review/summary: GREAT TASTE & TEXTURE!
review/text: I originally tried out this spaghetti with a manufacturer's coupon at my local supermarket -- and am hooked.  We now eat so much of this pasta that I plan to use Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" feature to save money on regular shipments.<br /><br />I am very picky about the taste and texture of my pasta.  The Barilla brand, and Barilla Spaghetti Plus Multigrain in particular, is a favorite -- it's delicious and always cooks up al dente.<br /><br />I admit that I am weak-willed when it comes to eating healthy if it requires sacrificing flavor and mouth-feel.  But I'm thrilled that I can enjoy this spaghetti without guilt. I even served it to dinner guests recently, when I normally would not consider using a "healthy" product. (I do care about the well-being of my friends -- but entertaining is often a special occasion that calls for pulling out the health-conscious stops.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />My only complaint is that Amazon.com's packaging has been inconsistent -- one shipment arrived in perfect condition, while another contained some squashed boxes due to inadequate cushioning.

review/summary: Box Weight??
review/text: Has anyone else noticed that the 14.5 ounce weight includes the box. You are really getting about an ounce less of pasta than the weight listed on the box. Well, it doesn't say net weight as most food products do but it still seems a sneaky way to raise the price! I am disappointed because I really like the product.

review/text: I love Boba, but when I recieved this product- one of the bags the seal was broken and the pearls were desintegrated. When I opened the other bag these also fell apart. The color and texture were not what I had recieved before when I mail ordered from another company. (Can't find them now.)Since I paid alot to mail them, I just took it as a loss. Not worth the time and trouble to mail back. I would not recommend this stuff.

review/summary: No real Instructions
review/text: I received this as a gift and it's a beautiful package. I'm attempting to make it now actually.<br />The problem that I'm having with it is that there are basically no instructions on how to make it. The spices are mixed in with the dried pasta, which makes it pretty, but very difficult to separate to cook.<br /><br />It says to "Mix spice packet with olive oil, vinegar, and soy sauce in a blender". There are no ingredient sizes. The blender is a pain.<br />It then says to "Add Vegetable" but the vegetables are dried.. so this wouldn't work out at all.<br /><br />Very difficult to understand how to make, and the spices being mixed with the pasta makes it very hard to separate and cook.

review/summary: Stale although a sealed can
review/text: True, it is always a question with pre-ground coffee whether it will stay fresh through the time it takes to use the whole can. But in this case, it was already stale when I peeled back the foil seal. I used it anyway but not happily. Too bad, because it may have been decent beans to start with. It doesn't make sense that a company producing a large amount of widely-marketed coffee, would be unable to do better quality control... so I cannot recommend that you buy this.

review/summary: Bad food... WAY overpriced
review/text: All you need to do is read the ingredients, and the review writes itself.  First ingredient: chicken meal (lower quality "rendered" chicken), next three ingredients: rice, corn, corn.  So in other words, this cat food is mainly made from mostly grain and some lower quality meat.  You don't find the ingredient "chicken" until the 7th ingredient.  C'mon people, you are smarter than to fall for that.  Compare that to any of the legit brands like Wellness, Buffalo Blue, Eukanuba etc., that have meat as the *first* ingredient and far less grain.

review/text: I just got the second cat in life (I waited well over a year since I had to put my last baby down at the age of 18  - the cat, not me).  Learning from past mistakes I'm making sure to feed my new baby good quality food.  Anything that includes the words "meat-by-product" in the ingredients is a NO NO!!  This food is perfect. It's healthy, has no random animal by-anything, and it's small so that little cat mouths can eat it without potential harm.  I highly recommend Royal Canin and their quality products.

review/summary: Not as great as I thought it would be...
review/text: I thought these would be a five-star item, but I have to rate it based on my cats' responses.<br />Of course, every cat is different, just like people, so take my review with that in mind.<br /><br />I thought the idea of a compressed ball of 'nip was great. I imagined the cats gnawing on it,<br />rolling it, etc etc.  Well, they are only partially interested. Part of the problem might be that<br />it blends in to our carpet really well. (Note that this hurts like a son-of-a-gun if you step on<br />it with bare feet!) But I think they have better vision than I do, so I think it is more ME that<br />has a hard time seeing it than they do!<br /><br />There is mild interest. Cat 1 will occasionally look at it, give it a lick or two, and move along.<br />Cat 2 will swat it once in a while, trying to get it to roll under my son's bed where she has one<br />of her stashes of toys, but that's all. She doesn't chew or lick it.<br /><br />Both are catnip addicts, so it isn't that they don't respond to the nip. Not sure what it is.<br />I don't regret the purchase, but it wasn't nearly as fun for them as I had thought it might be.

review/summary: Just as fun and more healthy than Pawbreaker original
review/text: I tried a larger catnip ball that had catnip on it and my cat licked it and the small amount of catnip came off and it was cardboard underneath.  After that he walked away. This doesn't happen with these balls. He loves the way they roll so quickly and when he catches it, he holds it in his paws and licks, bites, and even tries to kick it with his feet. He seems to feel like he really got "IT". Was surprised as he doesn't like balls normally. I have great pictures but should have taken video. Really great product. Ordering more now.<br />Addition: I received the new order very quickly but thought I had ordered 2 balls. The picture was somewhat misleading but the add is accurate. There is only one ball for the price. Worth it but just a warning.

review/summary: The Best Low-Carb Chocolate You Can Buy!
review/text: I now eat these bars as a regular staple of my low-carb lifestyle.  They not only taste great, but keep me full as well. The bars are also an excellent source of natural fiber.<br /><br />Mary Jo Kringas, the founder of ChocoPerfection, uses the sweeteners oligofructose, which is derived from ground-up chickory root, and erythritol, which comes from fermented natural foods.  These ingredients don't effect insulin levels (zero on the glycemic index) or have a laxative effect like malitol.<br /><br />What more could you ask from a low-carb chocolate bar?

review/text: I had read about these bars in various low carb blogs. Yesterday, I came across some at my local grocery store and decided to give it a try. I purchased the milk chocolate bar. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a bite of heaven. They are mildly sweet and have a creamy texture, as evidenced by the fat content. However, what pleases me the most is that they are sweetened without sugar or the use of malitol. I need to eat low carb due to medical reasons and I stray away from sugar alcohols due to gastric reasons!

review/summary: I was Disappointed
review/text: The description of these bars led me to believe they were made of premium chocolate with a Swiss-like texture and flavor. Not so at all. Don't get me wrong; they were not disgusting or gross. They tasted mostly like chocolate. But they in no way tasted premium. The texture was too firm and they didn't melt properly in the mouth. Erythritol is the best sweetener for chocolates in my opinion because it doesn't produce the gastrointestinal distress that most sugar alcohols produce. But it is not as sweet as sugar and any good chocolate recipe should compensate for this by adding sucralose for its synergy.<br /><br />I used to buy the Ross chocolate bars, which are sweetened with maltitol. I couldn't eat but one per day due to the side effects of the sweetener, but sometimes I ventured two because they are smooth, creamy, and sweet, the way great chocolate always is. By comparison, the Chocoperfection bars are like cheap knock-offs. Except that they're not cheap. If they cost a lot less I might buy them again because they do offer something like a chocolate bar taste with no evil side effects. But I won't be buying any more at the current price.

review/summary: OK if you can't have the real thing
review/text: After reading the rave reviews on the product website, I decided to spend the cash to try it out. The price tag is pretty steep, coming out to about $3.75 per bar. Pricey, but not insane for decent chocolate. Add to that the fact that you can't buy just one to try it and it makes for a significant investment in something you may or may not like.<br /><br />First of all, after I ordered I looked more closely at the ingredients list. Imagine my surprise when I found no difference in ingredients between the "milk" chocolate bars (which contained no milk) and the dark chocolate bars. I looked up the sweeteners they use and found that the claims of the ChocoPerfection bars' makers were true. They don't have most of the downsides of the sugar alcohols that most sugar free chocolate is made with. It also is high in fiber. In fact, one should really be careful with these bars as each one has 14g of fiber. If you eat two, you *will* feel it. The downside of this sweetener is that oligofructose is only about 60% as sweet as sugar. This really shows in the flavor of the chocolate.<br /><br />The candy tasted OK. Not fantastic, but edible, with a fair resemblance to actual chocolate. It didn't have the same sweetness as even normal dark chocolate does, but still tasted fairly right. It did have a slightly odd, though not entirely unpleasant under- and after-taste that might be off-putting to some. I found this to be not too bad. Another oddness is the texture. While at first the texture seems like normal chocolate, it doesn't melt or fragment quite the same way that regular chocolate does and has a somewhat unusual mouth feel. Again, I found this tolerable, but many might not.<br /><br />Would I buy them again? Overall, I'd buy them again if they were a bit cheaper or more easily available. I'd buy one occasionally in the store, if they were available that way. I wouldn't snub one if it was offered to me. All that said, I don't think I'd invest another $50 into a batch of these.

review/text: I bought a 5 pack for $21 including shipping. I do wish I knew which stores sell this directly, I would consider buying this more often that way. It is rather pricey. For $2 a bar, I would much prefer the taste and texture of SimplyLite Dark Chocolate bars sold at Trader Joes. Tasty, rich dark chocolate taste, and 3.5 ounces versus only 1.8 ounces for the ChocoPerfection bar. At $4.20 per bar the ChocoPerfection costs $2.33 per ounce, while the SimplyLite is $0.57 per ounce. ChocoPerfection is 3 times as expensive!<br /><br />But SimplyLite has Malitol. Decisions are difficult to make. Although one is much more expensive, there could be a good reason to pay more especially on a weight loss program.

review/summary: Not fabulous but gets the job done
review/text: Think its wonderful that there is such a product for diabetics. Unfortunately the flavor is definitely not equivalent to very good milk or dark chocolate (ie Godiva, Dove etc). It nice that there is something available for those who can't eat regular chocolate. I bought the 5 pack from Chocoperfection website ($21 for 5 bars, free shipping). It came quickly, well packaged, fresh, not melted, good communication via email. Unfortunately the milk chocolate flavor is reminiscent of cheap "chocolate" (think inexpensive chocolate flavored Easter bunnies or dollar store "chocolate"). Someone in another review had mentioned this, and I do agree. Cheap chocolate flavor is not necessarily a bad thing. My husband likes that flavor. Keep in mind my perspective is from someone who typically eats the real deal, your mileage may vary especially if you haven't had the real deal in a while. The raspberry dark chocolate flavor and mint dark (received a mini sample of that one) tastes better than the milk and plain dark in my opinion.<br />There is also a product called "DeMets sugar free turtles", available in Walgreens and Walmart, $2.00 a bag. They are also made with Erythritol (like Chocoperfection) instead of the usual suspects of malitol (that's in the Russelstover sugar free stuff) that cause GI issues. Can't tell there is no sugar in the Demets and no upset.

If you can't eat anything but SF candy and other sweeteners give you problems, I guess you could try it just to see if the mental satisfaction of eating chocolate outweighs the taste & texture.<br /><br />I thought the dark chocolate with almonds was MUCH better (if you can eat nuts) and don't buy a case of any flavor without trying one. I finally found them at a local health store, then if you love them you can buy in bulk on Amazon.

review/summary: Tastes good to my dry palate
review/text: I think "taste," is a matter of personal preference.  We are all different and we all have a different palate.  Mine is extremely dry, so tasting sweet things is difficult.  I have tried both the dark and the milk chocolate, and I prefer the milk b/c I love the sweetness it imparts.  The dark is also very good, and I use it in my baking.  I won't eat a whole bar b/c of the expense, but there are 5 indentations on each bar, and when I'm craving a little chocolate sweetness, cutting off 1/5 of the bar, and letting it melt in my mouth is so satisfying.  For those of us who choose to reduce or elminate our sugar intake, Chocoperfection is a very nice option.  Sucralose aggrevates my Asthma, I am glad it is not used in this chocolate.

review/text: I've looked all over the Thurston County, Washington area for Spam Spread, and haven't been able to find it the last few years.  I don't know why I even checked Amazon.com, but I did, and there it was.  Since the 24-pack case was eligible for Amazon's free shipping, I was even more thrilled.  Two dozen cans sounds like a lot for one person, but as soon as I received it, I made up a bunch of sandwiches to put in the freezer for my lunches, and will do so again soon.  I'd rather buy it locally, but since I can't, this is the next best thing.  Spam Spread, I've missed you!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIXYDC">Spam Spread, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: Wierd Favorite
review/text: This is another favorite from my childhood in the South.  Unlike "slab" spam, w/mayo, mustard and pickle relish this is like a ham salad. It also doesn't have the weird taste of "potted" or "deviled" meat.  My mom's standby party food was triple layer finger sandwiches of "ham" aka Spam salad paired with either, egg salad or colored cream cheese between 3 slices of white bread, slathered in butter and then frozen so the crusts could be carved off and cut neatly into long thin sandwiches with colorful layers.  Impossible to find on the west coast another taste of home, pricier than in the Southeast but free shipping when purchased by the case and it's on the door steps.

Ship this stuff overseas and it'll sit on shelves with the other chocolate laughing at it for being the poor chocolate child made from ratty scraps.  I've been to Hershey, PA and think that town is lucky they came around when we didn't have the ability to go out and buy a good chocolate bar elsewhere.  Awful, awful chocolate.

review/text: I tried these cookies at Mt. St. Michel (y'all must go). These cookies are fresh, buttery and delicious. It is true that many of the cookies are cracked or broken, which is a little puzzling since the tin can arrived intact; I don't think it's a seller issue. The cookies are thin, and they are meant to be crumbly. These galettes are thinner and sweeter than Walker's Scottish shortbread. A must try! Sprinkle the broken ones on your ice cream or oatmeal, yummy!

review/summary: THE Best Coffee Ever!
review/text: My husband and I, through the past 25+ years, have searched for the coffee we enjoy the most, and found it in Antigua  Guatemala coffee. We first started drinking this coffee through our local coffee roaster, but then they suddenly were unable to supply the coffee. We tried several other brands of this specific region, but most were not as flavorful as the fresh-roasted. We tried fresh-roasted from other Central American countries, but they did not have the flavor we so enjoyed.<br /><br />We were thrilled to find this brand of Antigua, Guate coffee and at such a great price! The coffee tastes yummy first thing in the morning and the price is perfect. The coffee arrived quickly [I usually order this kind of stuff on a Monday] and it came in a vacuum packed bag. We buy only whole bean coffee.<br /><br />Everyone has their own tastes in coffee, hence the plethora of varieties. But I do have this story to tell. After spending five days with a very picky relative who drank Choc'ful of Nuts [sic and yuck] coffee, I had to throw away what extra was made for me and bring out my little baggie of whole beans I brought with me. Because this relative left early in the morning, the way to solve the waste was for me to grind the beans at night and prepare the coffee maker with my Antigua coffee for both of us. The relative did not seem so pleased.<br /><br />The first morning we tried this one-coffee-for-two approach, I was awoken with my relative beaming a huge smile down upon me. "This is the BEST coffee ever!" my relative said, before marching out and leaving for work.<br /><br />I have promised to buy the relative and spouse a big ole supply of this coffee and don't mind one bit! It's share the love and help the coffee farmers in a country I love and admire. A win/win situation.<br /><br />I don't know all the various terms for coffee, except that this coffee tastes better to me than any other coffee I've ever had and I have had soooo many different kinds of coffee, even chicory roots :>)<br /><br />Try it ... you'll love it! But buy whole bean and grind it for yourself; we grind the night before and have it ready for us in the a.m., not purists, but a practical approach.

review/summary: Not bad - for K cups
review/text: We've had a K cups coffee brewer for two years and this is the best coffee we've come across so far.  In general the brewer produces weak coffee, even if one selects the 'small cup' size.  Tully's Italian and French Roasts partially overcome this with a bold roast or perhaps just more coffee per cup.  On a scale of 1 - 10 where 1 is a cup of Folger's crystals and 10 is cup of Starbucks coffee brewed on a Clover, this comes in around a 6 or 7.  Not fantastic but very drinkable.

review/summary: Makes a great cup of coffee at a great price
review/text: I couldn't believe the low price here on Amazon (less than 16 bucks!) so despite there being no other reviews to go by, I took the plunge, and I'm happy with the decision.<br /><br />While the Cafe Honduras isn't as strong as say, Coffee People's Black Tiger Extra bold, or Timothy's Parisian Nights (so strong I think I could stick a fork in it) it's not weak either. It makes a good cup of coffee at the larger cup setting, and on my machine (Keurig B60 Special Edition) that is 10 ounces. I have also found it works very well for iced coffee using the small setting as instructed over a full glass of ice- and since it's not super strong- it balances well with other flavors you might wish to add. For me, variety is the name of the game with the Keurig, and this is a nice addition to what I already have on hand to offer guests.

review/summary: Change of Pace for the Dark Brew Lover
review/text: Generally I love a really dark, bold brew (think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZDK">Coffee People Black Tiger K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM">Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHIZXE">Gloria Jean's Coffees, Black Gold Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>) However, change is good, and I appreciate an excellent medium roast once in a while and this Honduras was an unexpected find.<br /><br />It is a Bold variety ("bold" refers to the amount of coffee put into a k-cup, not whether it is a light, medium, or dark roast), and I like a somewhat stronger cup of coffee.  It has a very distinct aroma and flavor which I find rare in the k-cups and also tastes really fresh and somewhat sweet.  The lighter brews generally taste too "sour" for me, but I really enjoy drinking this coffee.  If you generally tend towards dark roasts but want to try something different, I can recommend this coffee highly.  Out of approximately twenty different light and medium roasts that I have tried, this is the only one I truly enjoy.

review/summary: Got a bad batch?
review/text: *****The 2 star review is not necessarily for the coffee inside the k-cup - but for the way the Van Houtte k-cups I ordered malfunctioned.*****<br /><br />I received 2 boxes of Van Houtte Honduras k-cups from Amazon in mid October.  The first few were fine - the coffee was good - nothing spectacular, but not bad either.  Then I noticed my machine was dripping very slowly, then hardly at all. I also saw that coffee grounds were dripping through along with the coffee.  When I opened the top of my Keurig machine, I saw that the k-cup was overflowing with water and coffee grounds. My Keurig machine was only a few weeks old and had been working wonderfully until that time.  I cleaned it out and tried another Van Houtte k-cup hoping that would take care of it.  The same thing happened.  I cleaned the machine again and ran hot water through it a few times to make sure the grounds were all out of it and tried a different brand of k-cup.  It was fine. I used the other brands for a few days and didn't have any problems.<br /><br />Then I tried the Van Houtte again and the same thing happened.  I repeated the cleaning - ran hot water through it and tried another one. Ditto.<br /><br />I think I may have gotten a defective box or two.  The foil on top isn't flat - but is puffed up as if there's too much air inside. The coffee doesn't seem to be very loose when it's shaken like the other brands of k-cups I have. Perhaps they were filled too much.<br /><br />Since I had used so many of the Van Houtte trying to fix my machine,  I figured I was stuck with the remainder.  I still called Amazon to let them know there might be a problem with the product. Not only did they refund my purchase  - they did not ask me to return the remainder of my order. I doubt I will use them - I'm afraid they'll clog up my Keurig machine.<br /><br />Thanks again Amazon - your customer service is terrific, as always.

When I run out, I always get asked, when are you getting more.  It's not as strong/bitter as starbucks and not as weak as D&D.  I would and do recommend this coffee to anyone that wants a good cup of unflavored coffee.

review/summary: My  "GO TO" K-CUP .. PERIOD!
review/text: That is my new favourite k-cup. I've tried about 20 flavours of k-cups thus far and this one is TOPS for me.  It's what I'm looking for in a coffee:  complete and full body, ABSOLUTE flavour (your taste buds don't have to dig in to find it, it's there). I think it's perfect for any time of the day - morning, after lunch, after dinner. This is the one.<br /><br /> My financial advisor came over recently and I asked him if he'd like a cup of the Van Houtte Honduras. He liked it a lot. Next time he came over, I asked him if he'd like something to drink and he asked for "that coffee you gave me last time". Yeah, it's that good.

review/summary: Good full bodied coffee!
review/text: I just got this yesterday and my husband and I both tried it this morning.  We both felt that it makes a very full cup of coffee, not terribly complex in structure, but still very good.  I was surprised with the fullness because of it being a medium roast.  Don't let that fool you though because it behaves like a dark roast.  I do think I like the black tiger better though because I can get the fullness and a little more complexity in the same cup.  I would get this again though because of the richness it offers without the slightest bitterness.

review/summary: Best K-Cup I've found, brews a strong flavorful cup of coffee
review/text: We recently made the switch from Senseo pods to K-Cups after our Senseo machine died after many good years. The main reason for the switch was for the greater variety (and availability) of coffee. However I've struggled to find a K-Cup that I would drink on a regular basis. I prefer a stronger brew of coffee (I always buy the Starbucks Bold selection for example) and the Keurig has plenty of strong cups, but I've found these to be strong (like espresso) with very little flavor.<br /><br />Then I ordered the Honduras, and finally found a cup of coffee that I will drink on a regular basis. It brews a nice strong cup of coffee that can take a small amount of cream & sugar without becoming too milky. And it's not overpoweringly strong & bitter like some of the espresso and Italian roast K-Cups that I've tried.

review/summary: EXTREMELY Dangerous!
review/text: This new pop up popcorn bag is EXTREMELY dangerous!!!  I did not use the popcorn button, rather I set the microwave to the indicated time (2.5 min) and the bag spewed hot oil all over the microwave, staining it.  This was the least of my problems because the microwave was SMOKING horribly from all sides when I came into the kitchen.  The smell lasted all day long and the microwave itself still smells very strong a day later, even after being cleaned.  This bag needs to be taken off of the market before it burns someone's house down.<br /><br />Again, I just cooked the popcorn for the specified time.  I cook regular popcorn at the specified package time and step away to go to the restroom and wash my hands all the time and never have a problem.  This product is scary!<br /><br />If you have this product, please return it rather than putting yourself, your home, and your family at risk.  I cannot believe that such a dangerous product made it to the shelves.  What a very sad shame.

review/summary: Bowl Bag is Terrible
review/text: The bowl bag does not pop in the same amount of time as a normal bag so it makes your microwave's popcorn button useless. Additionally, about half of the bags are faulty and open when popping resulting in very little popped popcorn. Last, I have found it almost impossible to get the bag to pop completely even when watching it pop (since I can't use the popcorn button!). Overall, this new bowl design is terrible and I would recommend switching to another brand until they go bag to the old bags that work.

review/summary: Sprayed orange grease all over the inside of the microwave
review/text: The pop-up bowl sounds like a great idea, but evidently they rushed it to market before all the bugs were out.<br /><br />The first bag I cooked was fine, except the instructions for opening the bag are far from clear, and even after you figure out how to do it it's a lot of trouble and makes a big mess.<br /><br />But the second bag evidently sprang a leak - it sprayed bright orange grease all over the inside of my microwave, even into the tiny vent holes inside the top and side. I always watch popcorn carefully while it pops, but I could not see the grease spray until after it was done and I opened the door. Cleaning it all out was a horrible ordeal, and I'm sure everything I cook in the microwave will come out smelling like popcorn grease for weeks.<br /><br />They released this product too soon. It needs serious redesign. I will not buy it again.

review/summary: Love the new Pop Up Bowls!
review/text: I was skeptical when I saw these at first, thinking the design would surely be flawed. The package design is great. Stands up by itself and doesn't collapse or leak if I add butter. The first two bags I made did burn because I was following the directions on the back of the box. The cook time listed is entirely too long. I started experimenting with shorter times with the second bag and got lucky with the third: 1 minute, 45 seconds seems to be the best cook time, at least for my microwave. I now get a full bag without any burned popcorn. In fact, usually the bag is overflowing when I get the plastic off. Taste is great and the entire bag is only 4 Weight Watcher points.

For years I have used a pair of scissors to cut out a large square from my regular OR Popcorn bags instead of opening the end, thus creating  a "bowl"  for myself.  So far, this plastic top and bottom seems like a TERRIBLE idea.

review/text: I loved the idea of having an actual bowl, but when I put it in the microwave, the popcorn just didn't pop. I first microwaved for the instructed 2 min 30s... less than half popped...i microwaved again in intervals, adding up to nearly 5 minutes....i finally got half of the bowl to pop... Due to this, the excess oil and flavoring intensified the popped popcorn, making it very oily and salty.. The flavor is great (besides its overly intensified nature), but I wish it was easier to pop it.

review/summary: My New Favorite!
review/text: Jumpstarter Bodyfuel energy bars are truly what they claim to be; outrageously delicious! Not only do these bars satisfy my sweet tooth, they provide me with more of a leap start rather than a jump start. These bars come in 6 different flavors; with Chocolate Raisin, AppleBerries, Cranberry, and Raisin being my favorites. The taste of these bars isn't the usual dry, crumbly, bark like flavor so often found in energy bars. Rather these bars have a fresh homemade taste where the cranberry bar has real cranberries and the chocolate raisin bar has real raisins, etc; which results in a truly fresh dense scone like flavor rather than that of hard wet sand. These bars definitely provide the needed energy needed to carry one through those hectic and/or strenuous days when missing meals just seems to happen. These also happen to be great for hikes, bike rides, road trips, etc. Downside; difficult to find in retail stores (hopefully this will change soon) and at $2.00 a pop, it can get pricy. However, when considering the bar can easily keep one satisfied until their next meal, it's definitely worth the price. Major pluses: no trans fats, no eggs, dairy free, and absolutely no preservatives. Makes me wonder what energy bar fairies they've got working for them that make these bars so delicious. Recommend: An AppleBerries bar with a morning cup of Joe or Chocolate bar with an evening cup of Joe equals yummy for my tummy. Thank you energy bar fairies.

Admittedly, sardines are an acquired taste but, trust me, you don't want to acquire a taste for them by eating these.

review/text: I grew up drinking Diet sodas.  No joke.  I'd never tasted a regular Coke until I was 13.  I thought I'd gag.<br /><br />In recent years I've scooted from one Diet brand to the next, avoiding all those empty calories and eventually avoiding caffeine.<br /><br />All these new 'Zero' products may not have sugar or caffeine but they are loaded with artificial sweeteners that I've generally heard nothing but bad things about.<br /><br />So, get fat with sugar or get cancer with artificial sweeteners.  Doesn't seem like much of a choice.  And, of course, I am prone to exaggeration on this matter.<br /><br />Having used Stevia before (an all natural herbal sweetener from South America) I was thrilled to find Zevia...sweetened by aforementioned sweetener.<br /><br />If you're used to the taste of Diet or Zero anything, then this won't be a far leap for your taste buds.  I love this stuff!<br /><br />The only down side for now is the price.  AT nearly $6 a 6-pack (or more) it's a pricey artificial sweetener alternative.<br /><br />But if you aren't a soda-holic (less than a can a day on average) then this really isn't so bad.

review/text: This isn't sprite but I really like it. I picked up a 6 pack from my local grocery to try it I'm really pleased. I just got a subscription to get the full case from Amazon. Great straight from the fridge, guilt free soda with no horrible aspartame after-taste.

review/summary: Its okay
review/text: I really would rather give this stuff three and a half stars, but I rounded up because my third grade math teacher said to round up for half or more. And I don't want her to think I didn't learn anything. She'll find me, just like she did all the others. The horror...<br /><br />Anyway, this stuff is pretty alright. What it lacks in the crispness of a 7-Up, it makes up for in flavor and not giving you diabetes if you chug the whole 24 pack in a week. Which, given the taste, is not impossible. The diet-y bluntness is still there from other flavors, and if you're used to 7-Up like I was, its pretty noticeable. But once you get used to it, its pretty good for lemon-lime, which I've never been a huge fan of in general. Drink it on the verge of freezing and finish before it gets warm, because when it does, it feels kind of like thin syrup.<br /><br />Should you buy some? If you want stevia-sweetened pop, sure. I do wish Amazon offered six or twelve packs instead of only twenty-four. I'd love to try out black cherry, but frankly, $25 is steep for me right now.

review/summary: Ok - Black Cherry the best flavor
review/text: I like Zevia for their "natural" claims. I say this because just as aspartame was produced and marketed to the masses, and people were not aware of the dangers of chemicals, I wonder about the synthesized version of stevia.<br />But, for now I'm trying to do the best with the information we do have - drink water most of the time, but when I just have to have a soda like with a pizza or something spicy, I reach for my Zevia.<br />I've tried all the flavors but my favorite is Black Cherry. The lemon is weird tasting and not very refreshing.<br />Black Cherry hits the spot.

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: I was a huge soda drinker, but I gave it up, due to the huge amount of calories in regular versions and the huge ugly headaches I get from artificial sweeteners used in the diet versions.  This stuff is delicious and happily free of both complaints above!  Zevia has given me back the ability to enjoy soda again!  Hooray Zevia!

review/summary: Zero Carbs+Zero Cals+Zero Artifical Sweenters= Zevia
review/text: If you are looking for something to quench your thirst without sugar, without artificial sweetener (Splenda, Aspartame) then you need Zevia Twist.  This is the most refreshing beverage out there. It has the all natural lemon and lime and tons of carbonation that you've been looking for.

review/summary: Really good!
review/text: Zevia Twist tastes so refreshing. The flavor from natural oils of lemons and limes really comes through. I'm a water drinker because soda just never quenched my thirst. But this stuff does. And it's healthy - none of the artificial sweeteners, colors and flavors - chemicals - in all the regular diet sodas. You have to try it to believe it.
