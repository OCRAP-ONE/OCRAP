review/summary: Tullys House Blend
review/text: I was looking for a different type of taste from a coffee, something a little stronger, but it had to go down smooth. This coffee surely filled the bill. I was drinking another brand and it was leaving a nasty taste in my mouth and just didn't seem to go down as smoothly as Tully's. I really recommend you try it if you are looking for a strong but smooth coffee!

review/summary: Taste great, but jam up coffee maker
review/text: As many others have stated, the taste of this coffee is fantastic.  Flavor wise, it is by far my favorite.<br /><br />My concern is that these K-cups keep jamming up my coffee maker.  Every time I make this brand of coffee, I have to use a paper clip the next morning to un-jam the Keurig.  I've noticed that these K-cups have a unique behavior about them.  After making a cup of coffee, I go to eject the empty cup.  The empty cup has a large amount of coffee grains on the top of it.  I have never seen this before in my 4 years of using a Keurig.  I am guessing this behavior is directly affecting the coffee maker by jamming it up.

review/text: Like some of you said, I only got 48 also.  Why do they advertise 50 and then send 48?  It seems minimal to us but 2 times the number of orders adds up for them really fast.  I don't like feeling cheated probably won't order again.  The coffee was strong.  I would compare it to Starbucks.  The order information says they have three different strengths and I didn't see where you can choose the strength so they shipped me Extra Bold.  I usually drink coffee black but with this, I make a 10 oz and 4 oz with one k-cup and then add some cream so I guess that knocks down the per cup price.  Still with feeling cheated, I will look for something better.

review/summary: Avoderm Is A Hit
review/text: We recently stocked a new kind of cat food formulated especially for healthy skin and coat. We brought one can home to try out on our three-cat focus group.<br /><br />First impression by the human is that it's really a disgusting looking food. Lumps of seafood and peeled whole shrimp, in a "fragrant" gravy.<br /><br />It is, however, highly palatable to kitty kind. The fragrance is an added bonus for older cats since they often start to lose their sense of smell after a certain age. So a strong smell makes the food extremely appealing.<br /><br />We split the can amongst our three cats, and the vote was unanimous. All three ate the entire treat bowl, not just the gravy, but the meat as well.<br /><br />So while it's not exactly appetizing to humans, cats really love it.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Sardine, Fish Broth, Shrimp, Crab Meat, Sunflower Oil, Salt, Guar Gum, Carrageenan, Tricalcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Methionine, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Iron Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Vitamin E Supplement, Manganese Sulfate, Vitamin B1 Supplement, Vitamin B2 Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Folic Acid.

review/summary: Vet recommended, Cat approved!
review/text: I adopted two very undernurished kittens from the Humane Society, whose on-staff vet said that AvoDerm dry and canned food is the best on the market for cats. When I took the kittens for their vet checkup 6 months later, my own vet also agreed that this is the best food available and was so pleased with the health of the kittens. My older cats have also seen a huge improvement in their coats -- much more silky and shiny, shedding is reduced and their weight is easily maintained on this food. I recommend trying this food if you have finicky cats or they have health problems.<br /><br />My cats absolutely LOVE all the Avoderm Select Cuts (chunky-style) flavors AND all the flavors of this pate-style food. The seafood flavors seem to be the most popular among the cats, but many vets recommend avoiding too much seafood for male cats due to the urine crystals it can cause. I started feeding the beef and chicken exclusively and they eat every last drop.<br /><br />Bottom line: It costs more than your average food, but it's worth every penny (buying it by the case can give you a pretty good discount from most vendors). If you consider that it keeps them healthier, which can save you from expensive vet bills in the long run, then it's worth it. Plus, think of the time you'll save not having to clean up after their shedding! Also, I've noticed that this brand does not result in the runny, smelly poo that some other, cheaper brands do. Try this food out on your cats -- you'll be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: highly recommended for picky cats!
review/text: This is my 1 year old cat's favorite food. In fact the only other wet food he'll eat is the other flavor of Select Cuts. I started him as a kitten on Wellness wet kitten food which he always seemed reluctant to eat. Ever since switching to this he will not eat any other brand, especially... gasp the pate style foods. He loves lapping up the gravy and then picking out the real shrimp and chunks of other meat. For a while I was wondering if they add something addictive to this food because he loved it so much.<br /><br />I love this food because it's no more expensive than other premium brands and is healthier than most. I recently also switched from Wellness dry kitten food, to the Avoderm brand and he likes that as well. I feed him both. His fur is shiny and he is active and healthy. That makes us both happy.

The bag was ripped in several places and the pasta fell all over like those annoying packaging peanuts!

review/summary: DE BOLES PASTA SHELLS
review/text: i Love pasta, but it is fattening.  This pasta is delicious and has no starch to turn to sugar and then fat.  It is made with artichoke flour.  Dr. Oz has said it is the pasta he eats all of the time.  Not only is it good for you, but it tastes exactly like the white flour pasta.  You can eat it with sauce and also butter and parmesian cheese and it is amazing. You can also add it to your soups, and it will be great tasting and less than half the calories of the white flour pasta per bowl.  I will order this again,and again.  I just wish they had it in a smaller box, but the pasta is wonderful.  It also comes in  angel hair pasta and fettachini.  I would recommend this to all the pasta lovers who don't want to get fat.  It arrived on time, was packaged securely.  I will use this vendor again.

review/summary: Horrible packaging; questionable glycemic response
review/text: We purchased this on Amazon because we have never found it locally.  Ideally I would have purchased far less than 10 pounds but it is the only size sold on Amazon.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted the packaging was horrific.  We inadvertently opened the bottom of the box.  Inside was a very thin plastic bag - similar to those one finds wrapped around clothing at the dry cleaners.  We tried to carefully pull the bag out of the box but couldn't find the top - was it sealed or tied ?  Of course, it was neither - it is just an open bag!  Half the shells poured into the cardboard box.  Finally got them back into the giant bag and the cardboard box didn't look so good - it had light stains as though it may have gotten wet somewhere in its journey from origin to home.  This is NOT a very appetizing way to receive food.  I wonder if this is a safe plastic.  Sadly, it looks like someone tossed a giant pile of pasta into a trash bag.<br /><br />The photo on Amazon's site is the appealing bright yellow box; it would certainly be far nicer to have these individually packaged.<br /><br />At least the pasta is very good tasting.  All of the De Boles we've tried are similar - very tasty but one needs to watch carefully when cooking.  Al dente is our preference and these cook more quickly than standard pasta.<br /><br />As far as Dr. Oz's endorsement I am skeptical.  This product is not purely Jerusalem artichoke - it also contains wheat flour;  his show stated that one doesn't get the sugar highs and lows but we feel like we do.<br /><br />The De Boles spaghetti that we find locally is very expensive compared to other products so it would be nice to determine exactly how much jerusalem artichoke flour is used and exactly what the glycemic impact is upon one's body.

review/summary: The best kringle EVER!!!
review/text: My family has been ordering kringle from O&H for over 30 years and it's consistently delicious and always arrives exactly when you request. My all time favorite is raspberry, but cherry and apricot are close seconds. You will NOT be disappointed if you order kringle from O&H...we have been given other kringles in the past and none of them compare!

review/text: I bought this as a gift to my mother on her birthday.  She loves sweets, and since I have learned that most of the previous gifts I sent her have been re-gifted (clothing, jewelry, and anything of the kind), I figure this is the best I could give to a very wonderful woman who's not wanting.  I have never seen the actual product as my mother lives quite far from me, but she just enjoyed it a lot she went out of her way to tell me (her compliments are precious).

I never measure it and sometimes I get more water in there, which means I have to go to a bigger mug and add another envelope! I've tried Swiss Miss and Land-o-Lakes but they just don't taste good to me. Celestial Seasonings makes a Tuscany flavored tea. The grocers where I live, don't carry it anymore. But those two together are MARVELOUS!! It tastes like a cinnamon hot cocoa toddy, without the alcohol AND without the metallic taste due to the packaging. CS doesn't use metallic paper, like Twining and Bigelow do.

review/text: THIS TEA PACKAGE, (Lipton Black Tea, 100% Natural, Tea Bags, 48-Count Boxes, (package of 12) equalling a total of 576 tea-bags, SEEMED like a tremendous bargain!  I'd always enjoyed Lipton Tea growing up....  And, though I noticed another type of Lipton Tea was also on sale: Lipton "Yellow Label" Tea...slightly more expensive, but boasting itself to be "better tasting tea", I know I have always enjoyed and been perfectly satisfied with Plain, Regular Lipton Tea.  So, I decided that was what I would buy....<br /><br />"SO FAR, SO GOOD" DEPARTMENT<br />=============================<br />When I opened the package, I was delighted to find that each box was individually wrapped, to keep in the fragile tea flavour.  I had always used the 100-bag box at home, so getting used to this smaller box would, I realized, take a while...<br /><br />I was surprised to find that there was only a smallish picture of Thomas J. Lipton, 19th-century founder of the Lipton Tea Company, on the bottom-right of the package.  Inside, the tea-bags were lined up, just as before, in individual paper wrappers, which UNwrapped to provide, not only a tag, but the entire wrapper, to provide balance, and easily allow the tag not to fall in.  I noticed that, sadly, a picture of Thomas J. Lipton, heretofore proudly placed on each tea-bag wrapper, was no longer on each paper wrapper...  But this was a small matter....I supposed.  I prepared my tea, (I like 2 bags in a 20-ounce glass), and when the colour had reached the correct darkness to my taste, I took out the tea bag, added some sugar, and -- after a few minutes to let the brew cool off -- drank it.<br /><br />"WHAT IS THIS????..! " DEPARTMENT<br />==================================<br /><br />But when I drank it, I scarecely believed I was drinking tea at all!<br />Not Lipton Tea, as I remember it, anyway.  The slight flavour that did come through was bitter.  I was glad it wasn't stronger.  Adding sugar made it only slightly more palatable.  (I don't like milk IN my tea...if I must drink milk WITH my tea, I use a separate cup, nearby).  I remembered the "Yellow Label" Tea, and have come to a startling conclusion.  Is it possible, I wondered, that, instead of "Yellow Label" Lipton Tea being a newly-developed, superiour tasting tea, that "Yellow Label" tea is actually the reglar Lipton Tea I had grown up with, and that this "bargain" tea I had bought, was actually a newer, cheaper variety?  I don't know...I can only suppose....  (As the theme-song goes on the great TV show, 'MONK': "I could be wrong here...but I don't think so.")<br /><br />Going to Amazon to write this review, I noticed yet ANOTHER orange-pekoe variety of Lipton Tea.  The gourmet "Brisk" Lipton Tea,  It boasts that each bag has four brewing sides....but my much cheaper Lipton Tea, here being reviewed, ALSO has four brewing sides to each bag.  It's enough to make a person become tea-ed, (or rather, "keyed"), up.  And confused.  Which tea is the Lipton I grew up with?  If, indeed, Lipton now makes it's least expensive tea from formerly unused, inferiour tea leafs, it should label THIS (new????)<br />as its "Bargain Blend".  And the old, familiar tea, (now called "Yellow Label Tea"?), as the "Original Blend."  Then again, the Lipton's Tea I grew up with, always called itself "the Brisk" tea....as is now in the gourmet blend.  I guess I'm confused here.  Maybe the "blend-switching" hasn't taken place at all -- and it's just mu ageing taste-buds that are at fault?  A little truth in advertising is strongly requested, here!<br /><br />At any rate, after drinking 3 cups of tea, with two tea bags for eah cup, (or 20-ounce glass), I now have 570 tea bags left.  I won't throw them out....but will (sigh!), have to make them into tea. The tea is not unpalatable -- just largely tasteless, with a hint of bitterness thrown in.  I guess I'll just be drinking a LOT of tea, in the near future, so I can use up these 570 bags of tea up, before I buy the Yellow Label or "Brisk" varieties.  Had the tea been more properly labeled, ("Bargain Blend"), I might have paid a little more for the Lipton Tea I (think), I grew up with.  As it is....well, maybe I can make my spaghetti and vegetables healthier, by boiling them in tea, rather than in plain water.<br /><br />Sigh......

review/summary: Substandard quality tea
review/text: The bitterness in this tea is way too strong, and the flavor weak. It leaves a strange, bad taste on the sides on my mouth when I drink it plain. It's only really drinkable with milk and sugar, or iced with sugar.<br /><br />Instead, I'd recommend trying a nice looseleaf black tea. Failing that, try Lipton's Black Pearl if you want a decent bagged tea that is easy to find. Twinings "Prince of Wales" is another good bagged tea.<br /><br />BTW, "Orange Pekoe" does not refer to the flavor of the tea. It refers to the size of the tea leaf pieces. Strangely, Orange Pekoe is used for large pieces, whereas this tea contains smaller pieces - yielding more bitterness. I'm not sure why they use this term.

review/summary: Excellent, Please Keep Away
review/text: My friends figured I was a heavyweight when it came to hot sauce. I douse most of what I eat in Tabasco sauce; I snack on jalape&ntilde;os sometimes. You get the idea. So for my birthday recently, I received The Source, innocuously perched on top of a small pile of gifts. I decided to try it the same day and to reassure everyone that my mouth was an impenetrable fortress. 7.1 million Scoville units seemed like quite a challenge, but is the sauce an unstoppable force against an immovable object?<br /><br />I tested it out on some chips and salsa (hot, of course) remaining after we devoured pretty much everything else. Just two or three drops mixed into this half jar of salsa should do the trick, right?<br /><br />I bit down onto the salsa-coated chip and immediately could not comprehend what was going on.<br /><br />My pupils must have doubled in area. My knees buckled. No one around me could understand the agony I went through past my teary blubbering and groans. The first bite had a profound effect on my senses as the world faded around me, but would only become more intense with time.<br /><br />I couldn't think straight. I gagged, I wailed, I pleaded for help. My bowels broke down as the salsa dripped little by little into my esophagus, making a sound like a dragon's gullet before projecting flame.<br /><br />My body had prepared itself for only the mildest of capsaicin encounters. Not even a steel maw could have stopped this. And as if the dragon noises were omens, I returned to my senses and vomited. All over the table, some of the guests, everywhere. It was a travesty. The Source's foul domain flew out in a projectile, but soon followed the cake and pizza. Then everything. I'm pretty sure blood made it in there.<br /><br />I only felt alleviated while breathing again after the ordeal. However, by no means did the unholy taste leave. It coated the inside of my digestive tract like some sort of visceral cinnamon challenge. I, no longer having anything to puke, writhed and rolled around for a moment and relieved my bowels before sensing the darkness take over me.<br /><br />When I came to, I was in a hospital bed and understandably confused. Only an hour later did the head doctor come around to checking me. Apparently I became comatose for several hours as my gut deteriorated. With successive stomach pumps, though, I survived.<br /><br />tl;dr: this stuff works. Please keep it away from me, and if possible, yourselves.

review/summary: Hot Enough to be "The Source" of the Big Bang!!!
review/text: I just started "officially" collecting hot sauces / extracts this year...2010. Although I just started collecting as a "hobby", I've been a fan of hot foods for decades. Plus, I've grown many different peppers including but not limited to jalape&ntilde;o, Cayenne, and Haba&ntilde;ero.<br /><br />I thought I knew "hot"...until I tried "The Source Collectors Extract". This extract is rated at a nuclear 7,100,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU)!! I've tried it both as a food additive and directly on my tongue (DO NOT TRY THE LATTER). This stuff is the hottest of ANY sauce / extract I've ever had...and I've had a lot. There has been a few close seconds but they just didn't quite have the same peak heat or staying power. "The Source" is hot instantly and you think, "WOW, this IS HOT", but then it creeps up on you even more until your reaching for some milk...ice cream...water...anything to make it stop!!!<br /><br />This is my personal favorite and I highly recommend "The Source" to anyone who is a true hot pepper enthusiast.<br /><br />Five Stars!!!

Actually, I don't think I could recommend this product unless you have "graduated" through the ranks of chili extracts.  If you've tried Da' Bomb, Dave's Insanity, or Blair's "a.m. series" and you're ready for the next step, then most definitely order The Source.  If not, start with one of those (or a lesser hot sauce even).  Your taste buds, or what's left of them, will thank you.

review/text: This is my second bottle of The Source now and I must say, if you have never experienced real hot sauce, you are in for a big surprise. This stuff is not to joke with friends about as you can seriously injure someone with it used inappropriately or against the manufacturers' guidance.<br /><br />If this is your first time tasting real hot sauce, one drop per pot of chili is more than enough. This is not the hottest stuff available but it is one of the best "hot to price" ratios you will find. It has a rating of 7.1 million scovial units where I think a habenero pepper is only about 500,000 units. The high end sauces range around 14-16 million I believe.<br /><br />Having a chili cook off soon? One or two drops of this in the entire pot of chili and you'll be a sure fire "hottest!" category winner I bet.<br /><br />Do not eat this stuff directly from the bottle ... do not give it to children and be sure to wash your hands 4-5 times if you get it on them. Keep away from your eyes at all costs!

This is by far the hottest sauce(extract) I have ever had; the pure heat packs alot of punch and is not for the weak of heart! When I first tried it on a toothpick the heat immediately numbed my mouth and began burning my throat; soon after my mouth began to burn as well and the heat as well as the burn was the most intense thing I have ever tried or tasted.

review/summary: Just ordered it, I am scared....
review/text: I wasn't always like this... I used to duck and cover when hot came around. Then about a dozen years ago, I tried some fresh cayenne, and got the bug.<br /><br />So, my most recent antics have been dried Ghost Peppers. Ate a whole one (not one of the dark colored, boiled/steamed sanitary weak ones) during Superbowl halftime, and finally felt real pain. But then I made wings with them, made chili with them, added them to my Sriracha chili sauce. No longer do I get the adrenaline rush like before....<br /><br />So... It is hot, very very hot. I like Tapatio for general "saucing", love it's flavor. Now my Tapatio has about 8 drops of Source in it, and it has the delicious flavor, AND the monster heat. After having The Source, Ghost Peppers are a silly kids toy, tabasco is something you hydrate with on race day, and your entire family will stop eating anything you own. It's kinda nice, actually, having an entire plate of hot wings that are both truly hot and delicious, and safe from even my idiot dogs! I have a feeling this bottle is going to last about a year, then I'll get another.<br /><br />Also, I have tried it a few times on a toothpick, and made some red beers and bloody marys with it, even got it in my eye when the cap broke... Soooooo hot. Whole new level compared to normal peppers and whatnot.

review/summary: Didn't hate 'em, but didn't love 'em!
review/text: These snacks are ok, as previously reviewed, but not great.  Alot of them taste, and look, burnt.  They just need to not cook them so long, as the light-colored ones are better. It is a good low carb snack as far as that goes, but I can't eat a whole bag of them at once, either, and the bags are small.  I didn't find them to be overly-dry, as I read before purchase, and they were not too salty.  I did buy the low salt for fear of that, and they were fine.  I won't buy this flavor again, but maybe a different one.  I din't hate these, but didn't love 'em either.  I hope the manufacturer reads these to perfect the recipe, cause they are on to something good.

The taste is not out of this world but is good for a lo-carb item.  Also, they are filling.  I can't eat a full bag at one sitting like I would have done with many other snacks.

review/summary: Great snack food for low carb diet, crunchy, lower salt
review/text: I can see from the other reviews that this product is either hit or miss.  Here is why I like them:  I love cheese.  I also am the one that grabs that piece of lasagna that has that crispy or even slightly burned piece of cheese in the corner of the lasagna pan.  So give me crispy cheese (and now in this lower salt version) and I am in low-carb heaven.  You can microwave for up to about 25 seconds to give them that just-popped taste and sensation (which I prefer to having them cold right out of the bag).  If you're already on a low-carb diet and eating a lot of cheese, I think you'll find this a pleasant change from cold and clammy cheese strings.  My only complaint is that I wish they were a bit cheaper, but I guess that's the price we pay for cheese nowadays.

review/summary: Incredibly salty
review/text: ...which is probably why I like them so much.  Popped cheese does taste vaguely cheesy, but mostly like salt.  And they're very crunchy, which makes them perfect to replace croutons in your salad.  You get six good-sized bags with your order - if you get to munching you might make it through half a bag before you turn into a pillar of salt.  But really, try them as croutons or float a few in your tomato soup.  As a garnish or eaten with something else, they're really quite good and satisfying.

These are the most terrible tasing things I have ever put into my mouth. The texture is gritty, there is no taste except excessive salt. How can cheese, which I LOVE, be made to taste this bad? The only thing good about them is the smell. They smell like butter but taste like %@&#. One handful and the rest were flushed. I will definitely check the reviews before buying any more food products on line.

review/text: I LOVE these...they have a good flavor, and most of all (being that there are not a lot of crunchy foods on a low carb diet) the texture satisfies my need for something crunchy.  I've tried the cheddar (my favorite so far) and grilled cheese flavors and like them both.  I am ordering the popcorn flavor because I'm a movie lover and I do miss the buttered popcorn when I'm surrounded by that wonderful aroma in the theater.  The only draw back is that they are fairly high in sodium, so if you are watching your salt intake, these might not be for you.

review/summary: I LOVE these!
review/text: I was pretty put off by the cost initially but my sister bought some and let me try them. They are definitely salty so you probably can't eat a whole bag in one sitting unless you're downing a gallon of water too but it's easy to eat 10 - 15 pieces if you're just snacking on them throughout the afternoon or watching TV.<br /><br />After doing the hCG diet, you are really trying to stay away from carbs in Phase III so anything that has a crunchy, snacky taste was something I was after.<br /><br />As for the taste, there seems to be a lot of disparity about if they're good or terrible. I guess it's just a matter of personal preference.  I really like the flavor. It's very buttery and also very cheesy - sort of like if you left some cheddar cheese in your hot pan and it melted and fried up, which I love.  Cheese is salty as a rule so yeah, it's going to be salty but they've added that extra buttery flavor and I think it's great.<br /><br />Would I eat it in place of popcorn if I could eat carbs at will?  I doubt it but I probably would keep them around and eat them here and there. They're a carb replacement! And I think they do a pretty good job of providing low carb eaters with a good crunchy, salty, butter snack; something that we don't get many other places.<br /><br />BTW, because it's less likely you'll eat an entire bag in one sitting, 6 bags of these cheese pops will last you a lot longer than you think which is why I ended up buying them. I've had a box of 6 bags and it's lasted me a month. I go through a bag a week probably.

review/summary: tasty but salty and dry
review/text: For anyone who wants a low carb snack these are a good solution if you are a cheese lover. These little cubes are literally blocks of cheese with the moisture removed. That means they're high in protein and high in fat and, even though these are the "lower sodium" version, also still very high in sodium. One package at only 1.7oz delivers a whopping 800mg of sodium. I really like these but they have a lot going against them. They're VERY expensive. 1.7 oz is almost nothing. They are very high in fat and the sodium is about twice what it should be. That being said, I would still recommend these as an occasional low carb snack if you're not hypertensive.

review/summary: Hey, I like them.
review/text: These seem to be hit or miss with a lot of people.<br /><br />Let me get one thing straight first:  I love cheese.  I LOVE IT!  So when I was doing Atkins I ate a lot of cheese, and meat products.  This fills your salty cravings, that chips or popcorn might normally if you weren't on a low carb diet.  I recommend these to anyone who likes cheese.  Some slight "burnt cheese" taste, but in a good way.  I like that taste.
