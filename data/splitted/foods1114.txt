review/summary: Dora and Diego cookies
review/text: Not the best cookies I've eaten. The icing is really sweet, the cookie itself is as hard as as a rock and tastes like sweet cardboard. But they sure are pretty. The kids seemed to be happy with them however.  The individual cookies are about 4 inches in diameter and come individually wrapped in the carton.

review/summary: Rich Colombian Nutty Flavor
review/text: Camano Island Coffee Roasters corrected the packaging problem, so my coffee arrived with a good aroma and oils on the bean. Colombian coffee is typically a bright slightly-nutty brew. Since Central and South American coffees are "washed," - these regions have plenty of water - taking the coffee fruit away creates a bright brew in the cup as it ferments on the cement patios. This coffee met with my expectations of a great Colombian coffee with a slightly-nutty clean taste.  The richness was outstanding, with a pleasing mouth feel and clean finish.

review/summary: Amazing with . . . everything!
review/text: I've ordered this sauce several times and fall in love each time. The vodka sauce makes plain pasta a restaurant-worthy dish. Spoon it over chicken, toss it with shrimp, add it to pork, the options are endless. The flavors are just right. My seven-year old loves it as much as my husband and I do.<br /><br />There used to be several customers reviews, which were so outstanding I bought it the first time just based on what I read. Sometimes the packaging is not the most secure, so check all of the jars when you get them. Some people have had jars crack and I had a couple that opened. They weren't opened enough to spill, but when I removed the plastic cap, I could see that the inner seal was opened. Amazon sent more immediately, so I have continued to order them again and again.<br /><br />I'm glad this comes in a four pack because any time I open a jar, it's gone within the hour.<br /><br />Update:<br />Amazon has improved their packaging since I posted my review, such an improvement that it is worth an update given the earlier concerns about open jars. The new-and-improved box is sturdy, with dividers for each jar, plus a styrofoam layer. Then the entire box is packed in an Amazon box. I do not think that anything can happen to the jars now, and I've never had any problems since the box improvement. Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: My husband and I liken this sauce to something we've had in an Italian restaurant on Mulberry Street in Manhattan.  I've never, ever tasted a sauce like this from a jar or bottle.  I've been able to purchase it in Shaw's in New Hampshire, but I believe they've removed it from the shelves because like another reviewer, I've noticed some of the inner seals not holding tight.  I hope the company addresses this matter, because they most certainly have a 100% winner with this product.

review/summary: Packaging is excellent!!!
review/text: When UPS dropped them off I was anxious to see how they fared as every product of this brand that has a review makes adverse comments on packaging. I think the manufacturer must have corrected it since they came in a nicely made, well fitting box lined with styrofoam on the top and bottom and dividers. In fact I saved the boxes to use for seasonal mug storage. The product containers are thick plastic with a screw on lid that could also be reused. I washed a couple in my DW and they held up perfectly. As for the flavor and quality-WOW! I would like to have tasted more capers and basil,as there is a lot of onion, but the tomato cream base is good right out of the jar by itself. I ended making a chicken pasts dish that was wonderful. I hoped for leftovers, but one jar is really only enough for 2 servings with pasta. Take advantage while it is on sale by trying the gift pack. This really is an incredible deal.

review/summary: 5 Star Base Sauce
review/text: I use it as a base sauce and just spice it up with things depending on what I serve but right out of jar with some grated cheese and black pepper is always great. Saute some shrimp in butter add some red pepper flakes and it makes a great pasta topper. I have done Sea Scallops by searing in ghee and adding to warm sauce with a dash more cream. I love it baked over Cod fish or poached in it. Just a really good thing to have on hand and there is nothing even close to it in a jar. For some picky kids this is great stuff to have on hand. I added it to Chicken nuggets, the supermarket kind they like and served it with pasta and grated cheese, they loved it! I made Italian "veal with peas" and used it, came out fantastic, brown veal in butter then simmered in water after browning till almost cooked soft. Then I added the sauce and simmered another 20 minutes with a can of peas, real easy and as good as my grandmothers version. Use only canned peas for this,  for some reason this recipe comes out better than with than fresh or frozen peas, Nana used canned too!<br /><br /> Great Container to reuse, it also freezes well. Great deal with Prime free 2 day shipping!

review/summary: Exquisite!
review/text: Oh, this is SO good!  Super easy (just heat in its own jar with loosened top in the microwave -- takes less time than to cook the pasta and doesn't even dirty a pan or dish!).  Love it with tortellini or any type of plain pasta.  Also great with sliced green olives added to it.  Don't believe the number of servings they say, though -- if you're anything like my husband, you'll barely get through one meal for the two of you per jar, with maybe enough left for him to take to work the next day.  We'd clearly need 2 jars if we have guests -- and it's definitely company-worthy, in addition to being a fast-after-work meal for ourselves.  My husband wasn't enthused about buying this but is definitely a convert.  We've gone through 3 of the 4 jars in 2 weeks.  You'll LOVE it!<br /><br />P.S.  The packaging problem reported earlier is DEFINITELY SOLVED -- you might even be able to run over the shipping box in a jeep without damaging the jars inside.  Well done, Scarpetta and Amazon!

review/text: We just recently discovered this product, thanks to Amazon.  I wanted to ship something practical and surprising and "homemade-y" to my hardworking out of state college son, in addition to usual boring birthday presents.  After reading reviews on Amazon, this vodka sauce seemed to fit the bill.  I ordered the pack of 4 to send to him directly....but within half hr of ordering I realised I forgot to change shipping address and this first order was coming to me!  When i went to correct,  the sauce was already being processed to be mailed out!  Within the hr!  My  sauce arrived the next day, within 24 hrs of ordering!!  (I live in Calif) I placed another order for my son, and his arrived in So. Carolina abt 3 days after ordering.  Packaging was great and speed remarkable.  If you like vodka sauce, this truly is worth trying...it's amazing, and hard to believe its not "homemade" but out of a jar.  My whole family loves it.

It's wonderful to order something, have it show up at your door, and find out that it's a great product.  All four containers arrived safe and sound, and I couldn't wait to try it.  While it's definitely not what I would call a low-calorie product, serving it over whole wheat or multi-grain pasta has to help offset the the negative, right?! Ha!  But it is so-o-o-o worth it, we all need to reward ourselves with a little treat now and then.  I would purchase this again; this sauce tastes much fresher and more flavorful than typical jars off the store shelf.

review/text: I love this sauce. It is my go-to for when I need to get a fast dinner on the table. I love it on a fresh ravioli that my grocery store carries that has spicy italian sausage inside, but it is also good on plain old spaghetti or any other noodle. I have read through all the reviews and plan to try some of the suggestions people have made. I would love to hear more. This seems like it would be a very versatile sauce.<br /><br />My latest trick was to add some homemade chicken stock and a little milk and serve it as tomato soup with a salad and some crusty bread. A slightly pricy version, but everyone loved it.

review/text: Wow!  Who knew you could get this kind of quality from a sauce in a jar??  This stuff works with just about anything:  I've used it with shrimp, chicken, homemade meatballs, artichokes and mushrooms -- the flavor just blends beautifully.  If you've never had "vodka sauce" before, it's sort of like a creamy marinara sauce with a splash of vodka (but you won't taste any alcohol -- it all burns off).  This has chunks of tomato in it for some texture, too.  I liked it so much I've set up a subscription, and will definitely be trying more of the Scarpetto line of sauces.<br /><br />Preparation couldn't be simpler: just eat in the microwave right in the jar (loosen the lid first, of course); or you can heat it in a small saucepan on the stove.  Piece of cake.  Serve over the cooked pasta of your choice, or use it in a casserole with layers of cooked pasta and some chicken or Italian sausage.  Top with cheese, and you've got a meal.

As the box broke and the case of water fell onto the floor, I noticed that the bottle said XXX Zero, at first I thought it was just a new bottle.  No, I actually received the XXX Zero, which tastes ok at first but always manages to leave a nasty after taste.  I feel like I just wasted my money on something that I could have bought at the supermarket when it goes on sale for $1 a bottle.  I can't return this and I don't want to drink it, this is what I get for being lazy, and luckily I only paid $25.41.

review/text: This product is really pretty remarkable. It was suggested to me by my doctor. I do an hour on either an exercycle or an elliptical machine almost everyday and perspire profusely. His recommendation was based upon this product providing a good blend of electolytes. It also has relatively low calories (50 calories for 8 ounces - about a third of a less healthy cola or other pop drink).<br />Surprisingly this drink has good flavor. Much, much better than any Gatorade product. I expected it to have an artificial taste, but in fact the fruity tastes seem natural. The blueberry-pomegranite and dragonfruit flavors are my favorites, but you might like others. The cost is high. I wish amazon.com would offer the 32-ounce bottles (especially in bulk), because they are considerably less expensive per ounce - at least that's what I find to be true at local stores.<br />The reviewer who complained about this site getting the calories wrong is correct. It's not ten calories, but fifty per (8-ounce) serving. Still - as already noted - that's not a lot.

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious but too expensive-itious
review/text: I am completely and totally hooked on glaceau vitamin water zero, especially this particular flavor, acai-blueberry-pomegranate XXX and recommend it highly. It is very tasty, and nutritionally has the following:<br /><br />100% of daily requirements for vitamin c<br />100% for vitamin B5, B6, B12<br />25% for vitamin A<br />100% for niacin<br />100% for pantothenic acid<br />manganese, vitamin B3, magnesium and antioxidant minerals<br />There are few if any preservatives.<br /><br />It's also ZERO calories and flavored with stevia, a natural sweetener, supposedly less questionable healthwise than sucralose/splenda or other artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I've tried about six flavors of glaceau vitamin water zero XXX (note that it looks  almost the same as glaceau vitamin water and glaceau vitamin water XXX so pay attention to the label) and acai-blueberry-pomegranate is by far my favorite, followed by dragonfruit and fruitpunch. I don't care too much for the lemonade one - it's too sweet. But then again I like to eat lemons whole and never put sugar in lemonade.<br /><br />The red-fruity vitamin water zeros are sweet but not overly sweet.<br /><br />In regard to the price, yes, it is over-priced here, especially when you add shipping costs. In my own local environment (near Boston), about five supermarkets and grocery stores near me carry it, at prices ranging from 99 cents per bottle to 3 bottles for $4 to (at pricey convenience stores) $1.99 a bottle. Given that I drink three bottles a day, the latter is too expensive. So basically I buy it in bulk at the lowest price, and dilute it to make it last longer. It's still tasty when you add a considerable amount of water to it.<br /><br />At the moment, Amazon does have a listing priced at 99 cents a bottle, and with free shipping for orders over $25, but it's only for the lemonade flavor.<br /><br />Since there are many electrolyte-type waters out there that are not very tasty, have limited nutritional value, a lot of preservatives and sometimes a hefty amount of calories - do yourself a favor at try glaceau vitamin water zero. However if buying at Amazon, do a search for all of them listed to find the best price and best shipping deal.

review/summary: Nectar of the God (singular)
review/text: This Vitamin Water literally saved my life. I was completely dehydrated after a day of yard work, full of who knows how many oxidants. Just as I pulled the last weed of the season (October), I felt the earth spin underneath me and I toppled over. Oh boy, did I topple a good one!<br /><br />My neighbor heard me cry out and rushed over. He asked what happened, but I was totally incapacitated. I was on the verge of a coma. He asked me if I had eaten enough... then my husband heard the commotion and shouted out from the TV room "No--she hasn't had anything all week. She's on a stupid juice cleanse." I had been on a juice cleanse all week and it had him mad because I'd stopped cooking. He was living off of Nachos and it made him GRUMPY.<br /><br />My neighbor, Jack (he's a little fruity, but we don't mind because he keeps his yard so nice!), said "well, that's the problem. You need some calories." At this point I felt like I was about to go into convulsions. My eyes were crossing up into my head and I was drooling. Jack ran to his garage and brought back a Vitamin Water. He opened it and kept saying "calm down, calm down." I got very calm. Then I took one sip of that Vitamin Water, and BAM--I was back in business. I jumped up so fast that Jack said "hey, take it easy!" I took another drink of the Vitamin Water, and let me tell you I was CURED. I started mowing the lawn immediately.<br /><br />Now I buy the Vitamin Water almost every time I'm at the store. My husband doesn't like the taste, so I took one star off (just to make him happy). But I think it's a pretty great product. I don't know if I would buy 24 my first time. Just buy one at the grocery store first to see if you like it. Then if you do, you can buy more!

review/text: I purchased this item from two leaves and a bud. I am just getting into the world of loose teas, and this was my first experience with loose leaf peppermint tea. Let me tell you there is no comparison.The tea bags were ok until I tried this tea. Just opening the bag emits a heavenly aroma, you could  probably use it as an air freshener if you wanted to. Now for brewing the tea... I doubled up because I like peppermint, I used 4 tsp for 16 oz, but then again I love peppermint. I steeped for 5 minuted since there are no recommendations on the package.... wrong! The tea came out bitter, but after tasting you have this cool tingling peppermint mouth feel, which permeates into your sinuses. I know that doesn't sound very appealing, but if you are a peppermint lover as I am, it was absolutely sensational. I have never tasted peppermint tea like this from tea bags at the grocery store. I went to the two leaves and a bud website, and they have the recommended steeping times available for all their teas, and for the peppermint it is 1-3 minutes. Next time I brew it i'm sure it will be better. This tea would probably blend well with others as well. If you love peppermint tea, you must try this, and you will be hooked as I am!

review/summary: Chocolates DO NOT contain real alcohol!
review/text: For a product that sells itself behind a liquor brand, I was pretty disappointed that the candies did not contain real liquor. A coworker of mine purchased some malibu chocolates as Christmas gifts for everyone. These candies were great and contained real alcohol but, rather than asking her where she purchased them from (because she more than likely wouldn't have divulged) I decided to look for them myself online.<br /><br />The image shown on Amazon is very vague and (at the time that I purchased) offered no product description. Far be it for me to sound like some kind of alcoholic but, mentioning the non-alcoholic nature of these candies should have been one of the least of things put in the description to help inform a buyer's decision.<br /><br />I understand that it might be tricky selling things of an alcoholic nature online when it may be difficult to verify age, but those chocolates my coworker gave were so tasty that I would've been willing to jump through (some) additional hoops in order to verify mine.

review/summary: Not bitter and easy on my stomach!
review/text: We are huge coffee drinkers and drink it every morning and most evenings after dinner.  Years ago I used to drink Starbucks French Roast.  Loved the taste but it just tore my stomach up and it was very acidic. I was hesitant to try another Starbucks but love vanilla flavor so I thought I would give it a try.  If you are used to drinking flavored coffees, you won't taste much vanilla...just a hint.  Very smooth and overall good taste.<br /><br />The ingredients on the side of the package says:  Ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root.  Also on the bag it says, "To preserve that fresh just roasted flavor, keep this bag sealed tight in a cabinet (not the refrigerator) and brew within a week of opening."<br /><br />Overall I liked it.  If you want a coffee with just a hint of flavor, I would recommend this.  However, if you are used to lattes loaded with milk, cream, sugar and other flavorings, you probably won't taste much of a difference between this and unflavored coffee.

The beans have the aroma of vanilla, but the vanilla flavor was very subtle.  I think this coffee would be okay for someone who doesn't like their coffee very strong.  But, if you like a good, strong cup of coffee, I would avoid this one.

But the addition of vanilla can make just about any coffee palatable, and since this had the Starbucks name on it, I figured it was worth a try.<br /><br />But I couldn't really taste the vanilla. Overall, this coffee just didn't impress me as either bad or good. It just sort of sat there. Maybe it has to do with my coffee-making skills, but I don't know why the vanilla flavor wouldn't come through.

review/text: I was in Baoshan City, Yunnan Province, China last August and had the opportunity to taste the local coffee that they called "Small Bean" coffee.  The flavor was uniquely pleasant and very gentle in taste.  I was wondering if Starbucks would be interested in that kind of coffee.<br /><br />When I received Natural Fusions, I was pleasantly surprised to be brought back to the highlands of Southwestern China that I just got back from.  I don't know where this coffee is from, but I am quite sure it is a similar kind of beans.<br /><br />I am glad that Starbucks doesn't infuse too much extra flavor, in this case vanilla, to overpower the natural taste of this coffee.  If you like the usual bold and strong Starbucks coffee, you might not like this one.<br /><br />But I think this coffee is quite safe for entertaining guests that you don't know what they would like for coffee because it won't turn anyone off by it's fine, gentle, and somewhat classy flavor.<br /><br />Just like drinking green tea, which is always mild, but the joy is in savoring its fine natural quality.

review/summary: Nice complement to my Keurig coffee maker
review/text: I recently acquired a Keurig coffee maker. It has been a good investment. And it includes a doodad that allows one to use something other than specially made "K-cups" (coffee containers explicitly designed for the coffee maker). I had earlier purchased this coffee, thinking to use it in my old Mr. Coffee machine (which never created the kind of taste that I wanted).<br /><br />However, in a Keurig machine, this works pretty well. I am still calibrating how much coffee should go in the container for brewing. One rather odd observation: There is not much vanilla fragrance when one opens the package; there is also not much of a fragrance when it is brewing. But when I drink a cup, the vanilla flavir is there.<br /><br />So, in the end, I find this a nice complement to my Keurig machine. I'm pretty satisfied, although the taste is still not as robust as I would like (but I am still experimenting on how much coffee to use, so this may resolve).

review/summary: Delicate with a hint of vanilla
review/text: To be wholly fair to the product, I feel compelled to disclose that I'm not usually a brewed coffee drinker these days, except for restaurant outings. Having tried about every coffee around at one time or another, I find that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M1KTUA">Nescafe Clasico Instant Coffee, 7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> suits my personal tastes more than any other. I drink one cup black in the morning and a second in the late afternoon with lots of Half-and-Half.<br /><br />As for this product, it's quite a pleasant coffee with no bitterness whatever. If found it to be especially delicate in ambiance, even though I intentionally brewed it just on the strong side. Had I used this extra amount of coffee with other gourmet brands that I've tried, it certainly would have been much darker and bolder (and in all liklihood, harsh) in taste.<br /><br />I was surprised in regard to the vanilla (a flavoring that I generally like) aspect of the coffee. The aroma of the grounds is pretty significant and I expected a similarly infused flavor in my cup; however, the vanilla came through as little more than a slight nudge. I actually would have preferred a more prevalent vanilla taste had I gone specifically for a vanilla-flavored coffee. But this facet of the blend might represent a positive point for certain other vanilla coffee lovers.<br /><br />Would I personally buy this product? If there were no such thing as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M1KTUA">Nescafe Clasico Instant Coffee, 7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> then I could say with some confidence that I would buy some intermittently. I'm limited for health reasons as to the amount of caffeinated coffee I can drink each day so I'm looking for a *plain old roadside diner coffee* experience most of the time -- for brewed coffee that would be either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1X45G">Yuban Original Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1BM16">Maxwell House Original Roast (Medium) Ground Coffee, 11.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, and not a gourmet-type brand. If I were choosing a specific *Starbucks* blend for myself, it would be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034L2VUY">Starbucks Christmas Blend 100% Arabica Whole Bean Coffee (1.56 lb. bag)</a> which I slightly prefer over the one under review here.<br /><br />However, I would not hesitate for a moment to serve the Starbucks Vanilla to either casual visitors or dinner guests, especially since the vanilla flavoring is so subtle. This is a quality product which I think many people will much enjoy.

review/text: I drink Starbucks coffee at home each morning.  I like a strong bold cup and therefore usually brew the darker roasts.  I am not a huge fan of flavored creamers but on occaision I will get a vanilla flavored coffee at a bagel shop.  I was excited to see Starbucks new line of flavored coffees because I assumed the quality would be just as good as their regular coffees and that the premium price would provide a genuine good hint of vanilla flavor.  I was deeply dissappointed in the strong artificial vanilla smell and taste when I brewed this coffee.  I couldn't even drink it with my 1/2 & 1/2 in it. It was worse than any gas station flavored coffee or instant vanilla coffee beverage I have tried.  The aftertaste was terrible and I had to throw away the remaining coffee.

review/summary: Starbucks french roast+tsp. vanilla extract= fusions
review/text: I gave this a try, as I enjoy flavored coffee from time to time, and I also enjoy the starbucks brand, especially their darker roasts.  In terms of it's roast, this did not disappoint, so for you milder coffee drinkers, this might be a bit bolder in flavor for you.  That said, the dark roast with the added vanilla flavor didn't seem to fuse so well for me.  Instead of both flavors working harmoniously, it was like dropping a dash of vanilla extract to my french roast in the morning.  One flavor, followed by the vanilla aftertaste.  My local store carries this at 11 oz, and a starbucks typical roast at 12 oz for pretty much the same price.  So we're talking an ounce difference price wise.  The fusions coffee comes only ground, so it doesn't work for the french press users, and I just wasn't impressed.  Not horrible, but not worth coming back for more.

review/text: Absolutely did not like this flavor at all.  It's sweet without tasting good, and that's really the only way I can describe it.  Add a little sugar to it and it only gets worse.  So far not impressed with the Starbucks flavors.  Have also tried the cinnamon and didn't enjoy it, either.

review/text: This coffee smells good when brewing but there is no vanilla scent at all. We thought that would be a bad sign but when we tasted it, the coffee was very good, even served black. The vanilla taste is very subtle. I served this coffee to family and friends and everyone liked it. My daughter said it was very smooth and she liked that the vanilla taste was subtle.

review/summary: Love It!
review/text: I hate flavored coffees for the most part. Not because I dont like a little flavor in my coffee but because most companies use flavored oils and inferior beans and are often very bitter. This caught my eye because the flavors are in their natural form ground with the coffee. I thought I would give it a shot and LOVE it. The coffee alone is a good quality coffee and the suttle vanilla flavor really comes out when you add a small amount of cream and sweetner. It's not my daily coffee but I always look forward to drinking it!

review/text: I am not necessarily a fan of Starbucks coffee, nor of flavored coffees, but I have to say that I found this particular coffee very smooth and the flavor was not the usual overpowering, cloying stuff that you usually get when you get a flavored coffee. I use about 7-8 scoops (note: varies with the size of your scoop, mine is about a tablespoon size when heaping, perhaps a touch more) for a 12 cup pot and get a very nice tasting/smelling pot of coffee. I can see having more of this coffee when the current bag is done. P-)

review/text: I'm not a big Starbucks fan...I think their beans taste burned and bitter.  That said, surprisingly, I really like this coffee.  It still has some of the strong, Starbucks coffee flavor that some really like, but it is nicely mellowed with the vanilla flavor.  The vanilla is not crazy strong, but if you don't like flavored coffee, you won't like this.  I found it to be a great morning coffee.  I drink it with half and half and like the smooth, creamy, vanilla taste.

So I thought this would be nice to try since it has a little bit of vanilla flavor in it to make it taste better. So I would have to say it taste pretty good for coffee, but if you're expecting it to take taste like vanilla Frapuccino, you will be disappointed :-) . It has a nice light flavor of vanilla in it to give your coffee a unique taste.

review/summary: The first flavored coffee we really like! Will buy again.
review/text: I ordered this coffee at at good price, not for the name. But both my husband and I were surprised that we really did enjoy the flavor and aroma without noticing a bitter after-taste. We are by no means coffee experts, we just drink our morning cup to get us going. We've tried different brands and don't usually give much care either way, except for flavored coffees which we usually avoid due to bitterness. They always smell so nice, but the taste, yuck. So maybe there is something to the Starbucks brand, it was good coffee, and I'll have to try some other flavors to see if they stand up to our taste testing as well.<br /><br />I should note that we make our coffee using an aero press which helps in taking much of the bitter taste out of coffee and we usually drink our coffee with just skim milk.

review/summary: Good coffee with a small flavor boost
review/text: The Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored is a very smooth tasting coffee.  There is a very small hint of vanilla flavor that did NOT have a chemical taste.  However, I would have preferred more of a vanilla flavoring as opposed to the minute amount in this coffee.  All in all, this is a good coffee that is not bitter.  I would recommend it to coffee drinkers but not to those who are looking for a burst of additional flavor.

review/summary: Great Smelling Vanilla Coffee
review/text: I like me some Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />When it is on sale or I have a chance to pick it up when out with a friend, it is always a treat.  I was excited when I saw a deal featuring their new Natural Fusions Ground Coffee on Amazon.<br /><br />I placed my order and (because of Prime) got it in two days. The first thing I noticed was the intense vanilla smell. I could smell it through the bag. After opening the coffee and making a bit, I was expecting an almost over-powering vanilla taste, not the case.<br /><br />I could only taste a hint of vanilla in the coffee.  That was OK, but I was hoping for a bit more.  Over-all, it is a good tasting coffee that has a decent boldness. While I prefer non-flavored coffee, I will admit, this coffee tastes pretty good and makes a strong consideration for future purchases. Especially if I can get it on sale.

review/text: It has a nice smell when you open the package, but not all that much like coffee. More like Vanilla extract,it really is very lightly flavored compared to regular Starbucks, it could be called Starbucks lite. It has a very pleasent taste but weak. I think if you use a bit more than the usual amount it has a more powerful kick but still not Starbucks par. You can taste a slight Vanilla flavor still not nearly as strong as other flavored coffee I have tried, still very pleasent and tasty though. Not sure I would buy this varity for myself. I like mine a little stronger. If you like a weaker flavored coffee, then you will like this.

review/text: First off, I think it's fair I mention that I'm not a big flavored-coffee fan. That said, I did enjoy this product more than I thought I would. I chose it as a change of pace over my usual dark roasted plain coffees. The vanilla flavoring is subtle, natural-tasting, and doesn't leave much of an after taste as many flavored coffees do. It's a lot more affordable on Amazon now, but when I received it, it was way over priced. Starbucks coffee is always over-priced (in my opinion) but this stuff was crazy expensive at first.<br /><br />Definitely recommended if you are a flavored coffee lover, and can get it at a fair price. I just ordered some of the cinnamon variety and can't wait to give it a taste, too.

review/summary: Great Starbucks Coffee at Home!
review/text: As coffee lovers know, it is sometimes hard to get the same flavor and consistency of brand names at home.  In the case of Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee this is NOT the case.  The coffee is just as good as what you'd get at their shop (though you do have to make it yourself) with a rich and fragrant vanilla taste. Following the recipe as listed, yields a great cup of coffee (which I have not always found to be the case when I purchase brand name coffee - I often have to "fiddle" with the guidelines to produce something close to what I get at their restaurant/shop).  The bag came very compressed and wrinkled and I was initially worried that this would impact its taste but we've made multiple cups since opening up the bag and each has been delicious and the bag itself does the usual job of keeping the product fresh (though I doubt we'll have it for long as good as it is).  If you like Starbucks and/or vanilla coffee, this is a product for you.

review/text: I've tried lots of flavored coffees, and most taste artificial and eventually wear out their welcome. This one is great. It has just enough vanilla to be flavored, but not too much to overpower. This does brew up quite strong, almost as strong as espresso with one tablespoon coffee to one cup of water. However, it's great for my purposes. I've developed an addiction to adding it to warm milk and brown sugar for a vanilla and brown sugar latte (I froth my milk by shaking it up in a jar and microwaving it).  I bet I can't get it that way at Starbucks, but that's okay because I can make it at home just fine ... and cheaper.

review/text: I was really excited to try out this coffee since I thought it was going to be bursting with flavor, but unfortunately, I couldn't taste that it was flavored or at all, much less with vanilla.  Now, don't get me wrong, this is a really good-tasting coffee, but it just doesn't live up to its name, in my opinion.  Also, although one of the ingredients is a sweetener, I really didn't find that the coffee tasted significantly sweetened either.  Overall, it's still a pretty good coffee, but don't buy it expecting much vanilla flavor or sweetness because you will probably be disappointed.

When we stop at a Starbucks' coffee shop, we know that we'll be paying a good deal more for the coffee -- but we're glad (?) to do so.  It's really fine coffee.  And so too with this 11-ounce package of ground coffee -- the price is more than a bit higher than the regular coffees.  And the taste, especially this one with the strong hint of vanilla, is better too.<br /><br />So treat yourself at home.  Buy the packaged ground Starbucks coffee and get that same great taste.

review/text: It's very difficult to review a product that is so strongly contingent upon personal taste. That being said, I rarely drink flavored coffees but do like them once in a while as a change of pace. When I drink these types of coffees, I prefer to flavoring to be light so that it does not overwhelm the natural coffee flavor. This product almost achieves that balance but the vanilla is just a bit too strong for my taste, hence only 4 stars. If you prefer the flavoring to be a little stronger than I do, then you will love this coffee. It's very robust and flavorful and it smells fantastic while brewing.

review/summary: Wonderful Flavor!
review/text: I served this coffee to my guests on Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it! It is not only a good flavor coffee but the accent notes of vanilla are just right. No bitterness to the coffee, light refreshing vanilla flavor all added up to a smooooth cup of coffee!<br />This coffee was good enough to serve to guests, yet feel like an indulgent treat for yourself!

review/summary: so good i ordered more - subtle vanilla ground coffee
review/text: Let me say that I'm a big fan of Starbucks fresh-brewed coffee, so it's a nice treat to have it at home too. From a pure coffee perspective, I really enjoyed the rich, medium-strength taste of this finely-ground coffee. It's not quite your local fresh-brewed, but still very good for my average drip coffee maker.<br /><br />Most flavored coffees just blow you over with aroma and flavor, so I find the subtlety  Starbucks Natural Fusions refreshing. But, if you're really looking for a vanilla-flavored coffee, you might want to look elsewhere - it's that subtle.<br /><br />Of course, the cost is more than your run-of-the-mill coffee in a plastic crate. But for me, the difference in taste and quality is worth it. I've ordered more!

review/summary: Very smooth.  Subtle is the key
review/text: The nice thing about vanilla is that it is subtle.  Unlike other flavors often used in coffees (cinnamon, fall spices, etc.) vanilla is not meant to be a strong flavor.  It is truly their to compliment the coffee.  The vanilla flavor is very natural and takes the edge off the coffee.  The smoothness of the coffee does not overpower the vanilla, and the flavors do not seem to be competing for space on your palette.  I would recommend this coffee as an enjoyable break from your everyday blend.

review/summary: Do you like coffee, or only flavored coffee?
review/text: I liked that this flavored coffee wasn't as synthetic tasting/smelling as what most flavored coffees would deliver. You could still taste the Starbucks coffee and I like that, but that's because I like regular coffee. If you're a flavored coffee drinker and you prefer the flavor over the coffee taste, this may not be the one for you.<br />Since I do not typically drink flavored coffee the ingredient list still left me a little uneasy..although "natural"(which really has such a loose, if any, definition when used in labeling food)the ingredients were just things I was not used to seeing listed on a coffee package.<br />They were, in order listed:<br /> Ground Coffee, Natural Flavor (with Corn Maltodextrin, Vegetable Glycerin), Ground Vanilla Beans, Indidan Sarsaparilla Root<br />So, more "natural flavor" than actual vanilla beans. Also, glad I checked before serving this coffee to a close friend of mine who has corn allergies.<br />A plus I discovered while examining the bag, it says if you bring the empty bag in to one of the US Starbucks stores they'll exchange it for a free 12oz coffee (within 30days of the "best Before" date). :)

review/summary: Smooth pleasant flavor- better than VIA vanilla
review/text: Generally I find that flavored coffees always seem to smell better than they taste.  It seems like the special flavor disappears once they are brewed.  And, I have to admit, I threw out the first pot I brewed of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla because it was too bland.  So when I made the next pot, I added an extra tablespoon of coffee and that made all the difference.  The vanilla scent is very natural and not perfume-y, and the vanilla flavor is nice, but not overpowering.  Add a little milk and sugar and it's a special treat.  I much prefer this to the VIA vanilla packets which, although more convenient, are too strong-flavored and too sweet for me.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like flavored coffee that is subtle, but well-balanced, this is a good one to purchase.  Just be prepared to add an extra tablespoon or so when you make it.

review/summary: Nice for a Starbucks item
review/text: This is a bit stronger than other vanilla coffees that I enjoy such as New England.  Depending upon your taste, you can enjoy a stronger brew or reduce the amount of coffee you use. I simply use a bit less coffee.  I was skeptical about this coffee as I find Starbucks coffee at the local stores has a burnt taste to it lately and I avoid their coffee in general.  This is a nice rich coffee and there is no hint of burnt coffee flavor.

review/summary: Nice Subtle Vanilla Flavor
review/text: Subtle vanilla flavor if you don't like your coffee too heavily flavored. My husband, who usually doesn't care for "regular" Starbucks (unlike me) did like this coffee. I actually switched his out (Duncan Donuts) and he noticed it was different but said he really enjoyed it. As for me, I really prefer this to the VIA style with the sugar added, this is much more robust and stands well in an expresso. Nice product, I may give it as a gift for my coffee buddies!

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: I hope I don't offend but I am not a regular visitor to Starbucks.  It is not because I don't like them but it is because I usually have my coffee at home.  Their product is actually pretty good from the few times I have been to one of their stores.  This product ranks high on my list of prepackaged coffees.  Light as I like it, but very flavorful, it is a nice way to start the day.  Don't shy away from it because it has a "chain restaurant" brand, it is actually pretty good.

review/summary: Vanilla? or Hazelnut? Good coffee, either way.
review/text: I admit, I'm not a huge Starbucks coffee fan (yes, there are those of out there who aren't), but I do enjoy flavored coffees, so looked forward to trying this Natural Fusions Vanilla-Flavored Ground Coffee from Starbucks. I thoroughly enjoyed the coffee, but I do question whether it is actually "vanilla" flavored or hazelnut. It tasted no different from the Hazelnut coffees I buy, and I didn't get a sense of vanilla from it at all. That aside, the coffee was robust and had a natural taste to it. Measurements for my coffee maker were the same as regular coffee, which is a positive since I often have flavored coffees that require extra coffee to get a deep coffee flavor. I did not rate this coffee 5 star because the flavoring was so deep that it actually flavored my thermal carafe, and that flavor stayed for 5 or 6 more pots of "regular" coffee, despite being washed out thoroughly after each use. Overall, I think hazelnut coffee lovers will love this coffee, though vanilla coffee lovers might be surprised at the hazelnut flavor! Good coffee and I will buy more for those nights when a special cup of coffee is just right.

review/summary: Very Strong!
review/text: Ok, so I think this is a great coffee for people who like strong coffee. Me, I'm more of a "McDonalds" type coffee drinker because I have found it to be a weak coffee, which is perfect for me. I wanted to try this Starbucks vanilla because I like the smell of vanilla. So I brewed it at home, and drank a bit. Personally, it was too strong for me, though the vanilla flavor was subtle and a nice touch. I added more milk than usual, and that seemed to help.<br /><br />Am I giving up my McDonalds coffee? No, but that's no fault of the Starbucks vanilla. I prefer my coffee less strong, that's just me!

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: I often will add a teaspoon of sugar-free vanilla syrup to my coffee so I was excited to try this vanilla flavored coffee from Starbucks.  Like most Starbucks coffees this one is very strong and robust, but the hint of vanilla actually helps to cut some of the bitterness.  The vanilla isn't overwhelming and does not leave that unpleasant toothpaste-like aftertaste that some flavored coffees do.  I found that I didn't need to add as much sugar or cream. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and found this more drinkable than Starbucks' traditional or non-flavored blends.

review/summary: Vanilla vanilla tastes like vanilla
review/text: This coffee opens up with a vanilla cookie odor and brews up the same. If you like your coffee to taste like coffee this is probably not for you. If you tend to use vanilla creamer that is what it tastes like but for me to drink it I have to add sugar because the vanilla has a bitter flavor, same as when you use vanilla in cooking.<br />So in the end for me I doubt I would get it again because I don't like adding sweeteners to my coffee, it really is going to be personal choice so maybe go to a Starbuck's and ask them to brew you a cup before buying. One nice touch is you can take the empty bag into a Starbuck's and get a free coffee.

review/summary: Delicious.
review/text: With a lot of flavored coffee I find that the smell is better than the taste and that after a few sips I'm very tired of the flavor.  Not so with this coffee.  The vanilla is perfect.  The coffee isn't like most Starbucks coffees (where it is strong and a bit burnt).  I would recommend this coffee for people who aren't really into flavored coffee but want to take a walk on the wild side of coffees.  Perfect for the holidays as well.

review/summary: Did Starbucks forget a Key Ingredient?
review/text: I was never a coffee drinker in the past. The bitter and often foul flavor of ordinary coffee was not to my liking and, other than the often-needed boost from the caffeine, I could see no reason to indulge in something with such a nasty flavor.<br /><br />My opinion changed with the invention of flavored and higher quality coffees and as a result of this change, coffee is part of my regular drinking routine. Starbucks is one of the pioneers in leading these changes and when I heard about this, Starbucks Natural Fushions ground coffee with vanilla flavor, I was anxious to sample. Starbucks makes this product using natural vanilla which, combined with quality coffee, sounded like a successful culinary marriage.<br /><br />So, how does this coffee measure up? Well, it certainly has a very pleasant aroma that whets the appetite and I doubt anyone would dislike this aspect of the product. The problem is, unfortunately, the taste itself. I was expecting something much more vanilla- like in flavor but the flavor is instead a little harsh, roasty, and contains only a touch of vanilla. How Starbucks managed to produce such an aromatic product that tastes so different, I am not sure.<br /><br />However, this isn't to say the product is bad. I find it decent as a general coffee for everyday consumption. I also like that Starbucks encourages recycling by offering a free cup of coffee if consumers bring the empty bag to a nearby Starbucks location. The coffee is responsibly grown and ethically traded, too, as indicated by the Starbucks Shared Planet symbol. However, the bottom- line is taste and based on the lack of real vanilla flavor, like I was expecting, I can give this product only an average rating overall.
