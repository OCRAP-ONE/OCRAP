review/summary: You gotta love heat, but these are great
review/text: I started off eating these from the supermarket down the street, but their stock of them seemed to dwindle as I purchased them, and then would disappear for a month, only to return for me to slowly consume again.  I then was fortunate enough to find this deal on amazon (way cheaper than the supermarket) and the quantity lasts weeks.<br /><br />I *LOVE* these things but, fair warning, they can get VERY INTENSE.  I personally don't mind but I get why some people don't like them.  If you can't deal with randomly intense mustard/heat don't bother.  If you can, however, you'd be hard pressed to find a snack that is healthier, tastier or more satisfying.  A serving of this stuff is enough to make you a little full for a while, but its all fiber and only about 130 calories.  The flavor ranges from mildly salty with some mustardy kick to "Wow kill me", has a nice crunch and is easy to eat while doing other tasks - your hands don't get oily or dusty or whatever.  Very keyboard friendly.<br /><br />Overall, 4 stars.  I wish the "peak" intensity was just a little less, as sometimes I get caught off guard and have to stomp my foot a bit to work through it, but otherwise they're spectacular.

review/summary: These are really pleasant and tast....HOLY HELL I'M ON FIRE!
review/text: It's like Russian roulette with my taste buds. When they are nicely coated, it's delicious, when you get one that is not, you'll definitely know it as your nose shoots out flames and you coworkers stare at you funny and accuse you of having tourretes as you curse like a sailor. Seriously, that "one in the bag" stuff is crap. It's more like 1 in 10 is super coated. Like some guy in the factory was like "watch this" and turned the wasabi powder machine to over drive for a second then shut it off while laughing like a comic book villain.<br /><br />The good news: You can spot them. Pour your bag out into a plate. You'll notice some of them have a fine white powder coating. These are the super coated ones.<br /><br />The bad news: When you finish all the good ones, you'll be left with the "bad ones," and you'll probably still eat them, destroying your tongue in the process.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoy these. A great healthy snack, low cal, high protein, and a great kick, but sometimes too much of a kick with no real way to "water it down."<br /><br />Great party trick: Leave it out in a bowl in the center of the table. Sit back, watch and enjoy as your friends discover the "bad ones."

review/summary: Tasty, healthy snack.
review/text: The Edamame soy nut has a taste & texture similar to a regular peanut.  The soy nut has less fat and more protein.<br /><br />The wasabi flavoring adds a hot kick.  It's not the same type of heat as a pepper.  A pepper's heat is oil based, and longer lasting.  The wasabi heat is volatile heat that travels up the sinuses.  It's an intense heat that clears the sinuses, but it is short duration and does not linger.<br /><br />I would have given this product 5 stars, but the wasabi flavoring isn't consistently applied over the soynuts.  This won't stop me from buying more.

review/summary: Pleasant flavor- uneven quality
review/text: I've noticed that with a lot of products on the market today- cereals and snack items like these soynuts, the quality of the food is increasingly subpar, i.e. there are almost always a few grains or other items/detritutus in the package that should not be there. A few of these beans, for example, look like they were dried w/ tiny black spots from dirt or perhaps insects? Some might attribute this to the fact that these beans are a product of China and while I do not think that its origins are the primary source of the problem, it might explain in part the low quality of the edamame. These green babies are tasty enough although the punch of the wasabi is low. Texture is reminiscent of freeze dried food but more solid. For me, the sodium level is just about right but I happen to believe that most products are too salty and that high sodium levels may have as much to do with American's expanding waist lines as HFCS. But back to the product at hand- would I order these again? Maybe, but I am more careful about each bean I pop into my mouth now. As a highly allergy sensitive individual, I can't afford to down bad beans no matter how tiny the black dots are.

review/summary: Uneven seasoning on an otherwise GREAT snack.
review/text: I absolutely LOVE these, when I get a bean that actually has wasabi seasoning on it. Unfortunately, the wasabi is rather hit or miss in the package. Like other Seapoint Farms products, there is a LOT of husk residue in the container. It appears that the wasabi is applied to the bean outer covering. In shipping, this outer part comes off and so does the wasabi.  Perhaps if Seapoint Farms did a better job of cleaning the beans AND THEN applied the seasoning? While tasty, wasabi-flavored onion skins are not as thrilling as the prospect of wasabi-flavored edamame.<br /><br />A good product worth buying and a good product worthy of improving to make it a great product.

review/summary: Perfect on the go snack!
review/text: I freaking love edamame. I've never had these before, but since I love wasabi peas I figured that I'd like this product. The flavor is similar to wasabi peas (minus the obvious wasabi flavoring) & I like how crunchy the beans are. The bag is resealable, which is nice because I can guarantee that I probably won't eat all of these in one sitting (although I'm tempted to).<br /><br />The only complaint I'd have about this product is that the bean casings flake off, which makes the product a little messy. I'm somewhat used to that with the wasabi peas, but this just seemed messier for some reason. (Maybe because the beans are a little bigger?) The flavoring isn't consistent over all the beans, but that's really not that much of a problem with me.<br /><br />Overall, I love this product & can guarantee that I'd buy it again.

review/text: For a snack, these are just okay.  They are, in my opinion, really hot.  Burn your nose kind of hot.  I like to put wasabi paste on my sushi and burn my nose a little, so I don't really have a complaint about the hotness, it's just not exactly the flavor I was expecting.  Wasabe peas (not this product) seem to have the right flavor, but these dry roasted edamame just don't have it.  And like the other reviewer said, it needs salt.  Maybe that would help a little.

review/summary: The Best Bar on the Market Hands Down
review/text: Going on Weight Watchers has its challenges. I have lost about 40 lbs to date and it has been good but I find that many of the products recommended by them have too much sugar. For example, everyone suggested Fiber One Bars as a snack because they are low in points. I noticed though that they spiked my blood sugar and stalled my weight loss. I switched to Extend Bars and boy, what a difference! I eat one of these every day, some times two. I really like them before bed or in the morning to help stabilize my blood sugar (I am hypoglycemic, pre-diabetic). I never have trouble eating breakfast now, these with a glass of skim milk or coffee and milk and a piece of fruit and I am good to go until lunch.<br /><br />What is the difference between Extend Bars and the rest on the market? First, they are only a 150 calories with only 3 grams of fat but 11 grams of protein per bar. They also have 5 grams of fiber, just enough to help digestion, without causing stomach discomfort. (Something I can not say about some of the others on the market!)<br /><br />I can not find another bar on the market to match those protein and fiber stats for the little calories and fat exchange. Also, the glycemic index is low because this bar contains a special slow digesting corn starch created from a corn grain that is different than the normal variety. It does not allow the blood sugar to spike, which can stall weight loss. This is the number one selling point for me, high protein and low glycemic...<br /><br />Finally because I really believe we eat WAY too many processed carbs in our diet, this satisfied me in another area, it has a low net carb ratio, and does it WITHOUT the use of high levels of sugar alcohol. There are only 4 grams of sugar alcohol per bar, that is completely different than any other low carb bar on the market.<br /><br />I really like the Chocolate and Peanut Butter, but not too wild about the berry and apple ones though. These taste exactly like the South Beach Cereal Bars, just less sweet. Give them a chance, they are not going to be as sweet as other things on the market...but they are great with coffee or milk...helps them not be too dry. Be sure to drink plenty of water as will any high fiber bar.

review/summary: Stabilizes overnight blood sugar
review/text: My 9-year-old daughter has Type 1 diabetes and we could not find a bedtime snack that stabilized her overnight blood sugar - until her diabetes educator recommended the Extend Bar. It REALLY does what it claims to do - stops blood sugar from going too low overnight. Now my daughter does not have to eat a glucose tablet in the middle of the night to keep from going too low. Her morning headaches and shakiness are gone! If her bedtime blood sugar is 120, her fasting blood sugar is usually around 100. The bars do not cause a sharp spike in blood sugar, just as advertized. Although they don't taste like real granola bars (not as sweet or moist), all the peanut and chocolate varieties are tasty enough to satisfy a picky 9-year-old. Thank you, Extend Bar!<br /><br />UPDATE 12/2/2010:<br /><br />We tried all varieties of Extend Bar except the Mixed Berry. The "Delight" varieties work the best at stabilizing the blood sugar of a Type 1 diabetic, since they contain only 20-21 carbs, no sugar, and 4-6 grams of sugar alcohol:<br /><br />Chocolate Delight<br />Chocolate Peanut Delight<br />Peanut Delight<br /><br />The "Crunch" varieties contain 30 carbs, 10 grams sugar (!), and 5 grams of sugar alcohol - and they caused my diabetic daughter's blood sugar to spike overnight. I don't understand why the manufacturer included so much sugar! These are not a good choice for a Type 1 diabetic, although they might work for a mild Type II diabetic who still manufactures insulin:<br /><br />Chocolate Crunch<br />Peanut Butter Crunch<br /><br />No one liked the taste of the Apple Cinnamon variety.

review/summary: Healthy and Hearty
review/text: I am always looking for healthy snack foods.  What I usually find are great tasting snacks that are too high in sugar, low in protein, and low in fiber.  They are good for camping or taking long hikes, but not for a daily healthy snack.<br /><br />ExtendBar Chocolate Delight meets my requirements.  This snack has 12 g of protein, 0 sugar (4 g of "sugar alcohol"), and 0 cholesterol.  "ExtendBar's" 20 g of carbohydrates is uncooked cornstarch, which is designed to be slowly processed in digestion.<br /><br />The taste is not the best I have ever eaten, but it is palatable.  It is not sweet, nor tart.  It reminds me of dark chocolate, but certainly not milk chocolate.  The bar's taste is more than acceptable.<br /><br />The Extendbar Chocolate Delight is valuable.  This is one of the best items for overall health that I have seen on the market. It is low in sodium and sugar (no high fructose corn syrup), and gluten free.  On the other hand, high in protein (12g), good fiber (6 g), and sustained energy level.  All this good nutrition and only 150 calories.  .<br /><br />The sustained energy level is real.  I have tried this for awhile without blood sugar spikes and without low blood sugar (amazing how they do it, but they do).  I highly recommend this product.

Decided to lose weight and cut carbs (no sugar, potato, pasta, rice or bread 95% of the time, sometimes I cheat :) ) in order to get in control. Been using extend bars since. I have one for breakfast with coffee. Then for lunch I have another one, sometimes I have a salad instead, or with. The key is that they really seem to work well to suppress my appetite, probably because they stabilize my blood sugar. Anyway after six months I'm down 25 Ibs without really starving and my blood sugar level have improved significantly, my doctor was very happy and told me I will not need any Meds if I keep this up.<br />I plan to lose another 25 with the help of the extend bars.<br />So I recommend these. Just note that some bars have more sugar. I only use the ones without.<br />Note that I also do a bunch of other stuff nutritionally to lose weight and control blood sugar so this is one piece of the puzzle, but a big one.<br />One thing I have NOT done is exercise. Not one bit. Not proud of it but happy that I can lose weight and improve blood sugar levels anyway. No doubt I would do even better with exercise.

review/summary: Chocolate "delight", whatever you say
review/text: I've used the peanut butter version of these to control blood sugar for a while and decided to try a different flavor. Somehow, they managed to make it taste even worse, with the added benefit of getting caught in your throat and causing a sawdusty coughing fit. It tastes nothing of chocolate and is quite the opposite of delightful.<br /><br />Fail.<br /><br />I'd recommend just the peanut butter version.

review/text: I buy this one, peanut butter delight and peanut delight and this one is in the middle.  The taste is a little over the top for my liking but is tolerable and you get used to it.  It seems like there is sooooo much of the "chocolate flavor".  I will continue to buy because I have been very happy with the was the bars work for me.

review/summary: Awesome at curbing hunger!
review/text: I was looking for something to help curb my hunger and binging in the afternoon.  These bars did it!  They really keep my blood sugar swings in check and I don't get tired in the middle of the day anymore.  I have energy all day and don't get the urge to binge.  Also the taste is GREAT!  I love that they're not too sweet.  I eat one a day around mid morning and that keeps me in check all day.  I am not diabetic but eat them to help me curb my hunger to lose weight.  My favorite is the chocolate delight. Am now a regular subscriber.  LOVE THEM!

review/summary: Better taste would help
review/text: As far as accomplishing the mission of keeping blood sugar steady, these bars seem to do a fine job. I had the chocolate flavor, and in taste it is mediocre at best. I have eaten numerous protein bars and health food bars, and to compare this one, I would put it somewhere in the middle for flavor.<br /><br />It starts out okay, but about halfway through, I didn't want to finish the bar. I would be willing to try another flavor, though. I believe that the company could do better with another flavor.

review/summary: Good
review/text: This bar tastes pretty good, but it's not delicious. The nice thing is that there is a lot of chewing involved, and it takes several minutes to eat, which makes it a more satisfying food experience. I eat mine before bed with 8 ounces of water. My blood sugar is now a little better in the morning. I am on insulin at bedtime, so this gives me peace of mind that my sugar will be more or less stable throughout the night. My blood sugar in the morning is about 5% or 10% better than with just eating a small bowl of unsweetened yogurt at bedtime. (If I don't eat anything at bedtime, my sugars are worse in the morning.) The bad thing about this bar is that I always get a funny aftertaste from Splenda. But it's before bedtime and I just brush my teeth and just go to sleep and it's manageable. I enjoyed the crunchy texture of the Chocolate Delight bar. I have ordered these through Amazon Subscribe & Save Program and got a discount, which is a good thing.

review/text: For flavor, alone, these Chocolate Delight bars are wonderful. However, they are excellent to control fluctuations of blood sugar -- much better than other bars of this type. This is a great tool that helped me avoid that shaky, weak feeling if I forget to eat while involved in work or other activities.<br /><br />ExtendBar is a great product, and I have also purchased them for a relative with blood sugar issues.

review/summary: "Dreambar" for Diabetics & WeightWatchers
review/text: At last!! A yummy sweet for diabetics, weight watchers and even ordinary guys. The name Extendbar truly doesn't do this "dreambar" justice.  Most sugar-free, diatetic foods taste like the boxes they come in and often don't live-up to the health requirements we need. Most are more pricey than their regular counterparts but not this "sweetie".<br /><br />My favorite is the Peanut Butter Chocolate Delight...a lusciously light flavor reminiscent of quality chocolate surrounding peanuts and crispies designed to stave off between meal munchies or replace a meal and makes the perfect delicious bedtime snack to maintain glucose levels for up to nine hours. These bars taste so good, I feel like I'm cheating on my food plan. I found that nibbling the bar encourages a more satisfied feeling and prolongs the pleasant experience of eating something yummy without the guilt or fear of high sugar levels. Other scrumptious flavors include Mixed Berry, Apple Cinnamon, Peanut and Chocolate Delights. I've shared ExtendBars with my doctors, friends and even strangers who ask me what I'm eating and want to know how to purchase them.<br /><br />A light treat just added is ExtendCrisp;available in Cinnamon, White Cheddar, Honey BBQ, Italian Herb and Zesty Ranch, all designed as sweet and savory snacks that aid you in controlling your glucose levels and calorie intake while chasing away those blues about dieting and maintaining good health.  Purchased by the box they are reasonably priced, don't wait...enjoy an Extend "Dreambar" today.

This makes the most delicious lobster bisque, ever...better than the seafood restaurant we go to. My husband makes his with Sherry, so the entire recipe, as made, does not last even a day. A great buy, a great price. When I run out, I will buy, again!

If you are making anything seafood based and need to use stock,this is a far better choice than chicken stock. Great flavor, keeps well, and the company uses lobster to make the flavor. It isn't riddled with salt and MSG.

review/summary: Make my kinder eat pasta
review/text: My daughter who is 5 and hardly likes eating anything but watermelon.  I use 1/2 tablespoon of the lobster base to make a quart of soup and simple add the alphabet pasta into it and boil for 5 minutes, she finished the whole bowl in a flash.  She didn't refuse to eat alphabet pasta because it's fun to her, but she "requested" to eat it everytime I made it with this lobster base.  And I like that it doesn't have MSG or high sodium content like other chicken powder in the market, it is made of real lobster meat, not artificially flavored.  The taste itself is out of the world great.  It's also a good lobster sauce combined with beaten egg white & corn starch for the shrimp.  Anything makes my kinder eat is GREAT!  Shipping is slow but packaging is excellent and careful as they are glass jars.

review/summary: Delicious, Spicy Nori Snack
review/text: Depending on your taste for spiciness, these rate somewhere around slight-eyewatering.  Though after a while, I think your tongue just gives up on the "Hey, this is spicy!" message.  The Teriyaki flavor is mild and doesn't overpower the nice seaweed taste.  These sheets are really crunchy right out of the bottle.  I've noticed after a few days, the crunchiness decreases, due to humidity I guess.  Though usually I just pull a few sheets out, and put the lid right back on.... Anyway, I like them best when at tiptop crunch-factor.  Sheets are approximately 1.5" by 3.5".

review/summary: So spicy it hurts... but delicious
review/text: I'm a spicy seaweed lover but I agree with the other reviewer... eventually your mouth just gives up!  The flavor is excellent though, and the typical consumer will find these last a while because even if you tend to eat fairly spicy food, you will only be able to eat a few of these at a time without the internal fire alarms going off.  I like to think of it as deliciously enforced moderation.

review/summary: BRILLIANT! If you like peperoncini or want to kick up sandwiches...
review/text: I saw this at my local Walmart and thought, hmmm. I got a jar and left it in the cabinet for a while. Then I finally tried it with a cheese plate and some french bread. Nom nom! It was sooo good! But wooh, I started sweating like a nanny goat in a pepper patch! It's hot! These aren't those timid peperoncini they use at Subway! So grab a crying towel from your golf bag and dig in!<br /><br />I have a very cool brother-in-law who loves to put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L112EC">Lays Flamin' Hot Potato Chips, 1.875oz Bags (Pack of 28)</a> on cold cut sandwiches. I think  he is going to love this spread. Personally I can't taste feta at all, and I have a pretty good taster. I'm on my second jar by the way. In an effort to write a complete review, I tried this on a few different foods and I can tell you, this is a must-have for me from now on when we have hotdogs. Take this to a picnic or family reunion!!! Put extra on MIL's sandwich! haha!<br /><br />There are going to be a lot of great uses for this spread. I found it in the section near pickles/relish at Walmart. I think it was 2.88. They have other flavors and I did try the olive one, but it wasn't what I had hoped it would be. This peperoncini is exactly what I had hoped! Five stars, no problem!

review/summary: Very artificial flavor
review/text: I was looking forward to this flavor. I don't tend to like a very strong brew, but a nice light coffee flavor with a touch a vanilla is something I enjoy. This coffee was awful. The coffee reminded me of cheap Folgers with some international delights creamer thrown in. Typically that grosses me out, it's so artificial tasting and that is what I got with this. Glad it was just one in a variety pack and I didn't have money wasted. I think I'll stick to a good regular brew and add my own vanilla.

I do add sweetener, which may not be everyone's taste, but to me it makes the coffee taste like I'm eating a real raspberry flavored chocolate truffle.  It is now my favorite afternoon treat/pick me up.

review/summary: Not my favorite-  syrup artificial flavor
review/text: I bought a 48 pack of this through Amazon when it was on special.  I normally drink medium blends and stay away from flavored but my wife likes the flavored coffees.  Her favorite is Pumpkin Spice from Green Mountain.<br /><br />What we found is the flavor of this was artificial.  I almost think it tastes a bit like maple syrup.  Too sweet...it would be better with less of the flavor.  I tried making it on the largest cup setting on the B70 but that just waters down the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the flavored liquid coffee creamers, this might be something you will like.

I have purchased many flavors and then don't want to finish the box, not so with this one.  It is definitely not my morning coffe, but rather the type you come home and brew after you've smelled and resisted a local Starbucks!  The main flavor is velvety rich coffee, with strong hints of raspberry and chocolate perfectly blended in.  I strongly recommend a "cozy-up" with a cup of this and a good book :)

review/text: The name sounded great - chocolate raspberry truffle - but would it taste as good as it sounds? Well, I was impressed. This has to be one of my favorite flavored coffees, along with some hazelnut ones, even though I typically prefer unflavored coffees.<br /><br />UPDATE 2011-01-03: I don't like this as much as I use too... it's not bad, but I'm just not "excited" about the flavor as much anymore. Plus I find it leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. I'm not "wanting" it in the morning, instead preferring to desire mostly unflavored coffees - like "Van Houtte Caf&eacute;, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast)", which is really good... so I'm reducing my rating to 4 out of 5 stars.

review/summary: Pretty good!
review/text: I actually got this flavor for my husband who really does like flavored coffee, usually I'm not a fan of them. After trying a French roast K-cup in my brand new coffee brewer and being very disappointed, I decided to give this one a go. Brewing a cup with 5 ounces of water makes a very nice medium strength, vanilla flavored coffee that tastes pretty good in the morning.<br />Usually when I have vanilla coffee, I grind an inch or two of a vanilla bean that's leftover from cooking into dark roasted beans and brew coffee in a regular drip brewer. Compared to that, this coffee is a lighter roast but with a nice flavor, and the vanilla flavor is mildly sweet. This is a coffee k-cup I would serve without hesitation to my dad and I think my husband will love it.<br />Definitely planning to try more of Van Houtte's flavors.

I hope the Hazelnut is just as good.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this, but I can't
review/text: I love raspberry and chocolate.  I could live on Sees Raspberry chocolate truffles.  But this coffee, ugh.  Brewing it smells pretty nice, a bit fruity, not much chocolate.  In the mug- awful chemical processed cleaner/air freshener flavor (not that I am in the habit of eating those) but hot it just tastes artificial. It does have some sweet taste to it, but even adding milk and sugar do not make it drinkable.<br /><br />If I let it sit around (and really, I bought the Keurig so I could have coffee NOW when I wanted it, not in 10 minutes) and it cools, it becomes passable.  But only barely.  The chemical flavor dissipates and it is drinkable, but only because after spending that much on coffee, I feel obligated to.<br /><br />Spare yourself the torture, skip this coffee, unless you like the taste of lysol, then it might be for you!
