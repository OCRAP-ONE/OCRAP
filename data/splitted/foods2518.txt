review/summary: My kids love these in their oatmeal
review/text: I love Mott's Healthy Harvest applesauce cups. It is only fruit-no added sugar. These are blueberry, but in stores you can also get country berry, strawberry, peach, and granny smith apple. Most days, my kids have oatmeal. Instead of brown sugar, I stir in one of these cups which sweetens the oatmeal naturally as well as adds color in most cases.

review/summary: Great idea, sour reality...
review/text: First of all, I am NOT a picky eater, especially when I am cooking for myself. I regularly eat low-carb, understand low-carb junk food will never taste like the real thing, and I enjoy it regardless. This is the first low-carb snack I've ever made that I could not finish (and believe me I tried).<br /><br />I love the idea of an easily prepared mac & cheese cup, and anything low-carb with a shelf life. But I'm just not sure this works.<br /><br />The noodles are not macaroni, they are thin like crushed up angel hair. But they do not taste like angel hair pasta, they're sour (maybe the recommended time left them undercooked?). If you're looking for pasta at home, and can eat wheat gluten, definitely buy Dreamfield's low carb pasta instead. But if you are avoiding wheat gluten, maybe this is an option for you.<br /><br />I bought a few of these so I'm not sure what to do with the rest, I'm thinking I will get creative with the recipe and if I come up with anything good I will definitely post my ideas here! I haven't quite given up yet.<br /><br />Other than that, I was really disappointed the noodles were not macaroni and wished someone would have written about it in a review, so that's what I'm doing. :)

review/summary: Not good ... it's a cup of goop!
review/text: If you are expecting a cup of low carb macaroni with cheese, this is not it!  The cup consist of a powder with super thin (looks like broken up sewing needles) pieces of pasta (I used the term pasta VERY loosely).  Once prepared, it turns into a cup of gooey, gloppy substance with virtually no presence of pasta.  It was like eating a cup of super thick, gooey soup.  The flavor was not bad, but other than that this product is quite horrid.  If I was able to give it a no star rating, I would.  I'm so glad I only order one cup to try.  I will definitely not order it again.  That being said, I have had many other good products from the Dixie Carb Counters product line, so this product is an exception.

review/summary: count your purchase
review/text: I've ordered Senseo Pods many times and never had this problem.  However, this time, each bag was short several coffee pods.  I started running out much quicker than usual, so I opened three bags and counted them, only to find 13 pods in each bag instead of 16.  I've contacted Amazon.com about this and am waiting a response.  Since I order two boxes at a time, this can really add up with a total of more than 30 missing out of the two containers.  Be careful!

review/text: When these are on sale on Amazon, it's the best price around.  I ordered a case of the hazelnut and a case of the vanilla pods.  I think everyone in the country did the same because it took 2-3 weeks for the coffee to arrive.<br /><br />Hazelnut flavor is somewhat sweet, coffee flavor is light.  If you want a strong coffee flavor, go with a medium or dark roast pod.

review/summary: Perfect for non-coffee snobs
review/text: I'm not a coffee snob, barely drinking a cup a week, but my significant other needs a strong mugful every morning.  The pods and the Senseo machine are perfect for this; barely takes 2-minutes to brew.  The 6-pack box comes out to about 30cents a cup even with the added latte packets (60cents when two are used for a strong mug serving).  Wonderful aroma and works well with the flavor packets.  I'm hoping the money saved by avoiding Starbucks every morning will go to my potato chip addiction....

review/text: My favorite senseo pod flavor is still vienna hazelnut waltz but I am disappointed w/my last shipment.  I opened a new bag this morning and there were 2 or 3 (I am sure of 2 but think another may have been open, too) pods that appeared to have little slashes in the paper and the coffee had spilled into the bag coating the other pods.  I threw the whole thing out wondering what would cause several pods in the same bag to be defective.

review/summary: Best of the Senseo Pods
review/text: I've tried many, many different varieties of pods and this flavor is the one that intersects taste and price at a level I can live with.  Yes, it will take 2 pods to make 1 cup of coffee but it doesn't taste too chemically like the Vanilla flavored.  If you are a Starbucks lover, probably best to look elsewhere - the Senseo system will never make a cup of coffee that strong or intense.  But if you like a milder tasting cup that still packs a nice kick in the AM, these are an overall good choice.  Best of the bunch IMO.

review/summary: Skinny and Boney
review/text: In the politically correct age in which we live, "skinless and boneless" sardines have invaded supermarket shelves promising an appropriate and civilized eating experience. If that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. These are the real thing, and I guess if they're not skinless and boneless then what else can they be but skinny and boney? While this may sound a bit rough around the edges, well, what the heck.<br /><br />Before going any further I have to disclose that I eat sardines every day for lunch. I've tried `em all, and these plump pilchards are right up there among the best.<br /><br />Generally I've operated from the premise that Portuguese sardines are superior, but these are increasingly expensive and sometimes hard to find. So when the local gourmet food store forgot to place my order I looked for an alternative and came across this Spanish substitute. At this juncture my knowledge of geography stood me in good stead as I realized that the Atlantic waters off of Portugal are contiguous with those of Spain, and clearly the fish know no boundaries in between. How different therefore could they be at less than one third the price?<br /><br />This seemed too good to be true and when I noted that they are packed in a combination of soy and olive oil rather than olive oil alone, my suspicions were aroused. Subsequent research into the matter uncovered the finding of the American College of Chest Physicians that soy oil contains omega 3 fatty acids. Sardines themselves are rich in these most beneficial substances so immersing them in more of the same could only seem to make a good thing better.<br /><br />And finally, to cut to the chase, these fish taste great, especially with a liberal squirt of fresh lemon.<br /><br />I do, however, perform a quick dissection prior to indulging.

review/text: These sardines are fair to good.  A little mushy for my taste, but nice flavor.  My shipment was NOT Spanish sardines.  The word "Spanish" is not on the box and in fact the sardines I received are a product of Morocco.  Must admit I was a bit disappointed.  I'll probably try these again and hope for the real thing.

review/summary: Not Spanish sardines anymore
review/text: *****NOTE: See update at bottom<br /><br />These sardines have a rich and delicate flavor, enhanced by the mixture of olive and soy oils in which they are bathed. It is truly one of the few instances I have found where something that I really like also happens to be good for my health, so needless to say I eat them quite a bit.<br /><br />Like one of the previous reviewers say, you could pay double and get some brand of Portuguese sardines, but you would be wasting half of your money. Instead, pay the same and get twice the little fish!<br /><br />On one occassion I ran out of these sardines so I got a different brand in Safeway. I was shocked at the difference. To start with, what is branded as "sardines" in the U.S. is rarely actually a type of sardine, but rather some other small fish. After getting used to this brand, however, the taste of those other "packed in the U.S.A." sardines was very bad. So bad, actually, that I couldn't finish the can and ran to the computer to order another batch of these.<br /><br />*****UPDATE (8-5-2012)<br />Vigo has decided to stop sourcing these sardines form Spain. These sardines are now from Morocco and the quality is far worse. The fish themselves are far smaller, they break apart easily, and have overall a gelatinous consistency and fishy smell. It is a pity. I suppose that it was a cost cutting measure. I will have to start looking for an alternate source of true Spanish sardines.<br /><br />The 1-star review is due to the fact that the product is now misrepresented (the picture still reads Spanish sardines.) If not for that, I would give it 2 stars.

review/summary: Bad Experience with Vigo Sardines
review/text: I'm very much in line with the other reviewer here on his preferences concerning sardines, but I can agree only until the last paragraph of his review. I had a different experience with Vigo Sardines that leads me to a different conclusion and it starts with the condition of the cans themselves.<br /><br />The boxes were shiny yellow, clean, and not dented, perhaps thanks to Amazon plastic wrap and packaging. When I removed a can from it's individual box for my second meal of them I found it was quite sticky. So I removed them all from their individual boxes and  found more stickiness and also dark spotting.<br /><br />Now I had already opened and eaten one can that happened to have the least problems, so it caused no real concern. I do wish I had opened another box first though. I'm able to comment on the taste, without being clouded by the -ick- factor of the dirty tins themselves:  The delicate and more complex flavors of Spanish and Portuguese Sardines were just not there...the flavors were dead really and there was a hint of a tinny aftertaste.  The fish themselves were not in the grandest condition either but they were plump and firm. It was a disappointment all around. I gave it two stars because it seems I'm the only one with a sticky and spotted can issue. It does make me wonder at the standards used during processing.  In any case [...] based on flavor and presentation and will not be trying Vigo sardines again.

I had never purchased food with lamb in it before but the one for life stages has it. i do not like the way veal or lamb are treated and have never eaten it myself either. However,having said that, I will be ordering this monthly for my dogs. Just wish there were more choices without lamb. It is impressive that their cattle are free range grazing cattle and fish are ocean not farm raised. I believe my dogs are eating better than us! Seriously, you will be impressed with the ingredients list on these foods.

review/summary: Warning this product may contain a doggy stimulant
review/text: First things first, unfortunately there is not an option for "Dog Loves It" on Amazon's reviews so I hope this is not misleading...I personally have never eaten the stuff so this should not be viewed as "I like this" and I haven't been able to teach my dog to verbally communicate yet so I'm going to have to go off of body language cues. That being said....15 month old, female German Shepherd with a sensitive stomach seems to love it. Had her on it for 5 months now. Half a can mixed with your dry food of choice 2X a day and you'll have a pretty darn wild dog at and post feeding time. Just bought a pack of the chicken grain free to see if it elicits equal enthusiasm. Inevitably, some of the cans always wind up at my doorstep dented, but I don't think that has any impact on the product.

review/summary: My dogs love it, and love the combination beef and fish!
review/text: I always wanted to try out Canidae for my dogs, and when I saw the price Amazon offered for these, I had to go for it. The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan "all the time", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it.

review/summary: All but 2 cans in the case were severely damaged
review/text: I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places. Even the inside cans were damaged. So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store. At least then I can be sure that the cans are not damaged.

review/text: I switched to the smaller cans because I have a Yorkie, and it took too long for her to finish the larger cans.  But to me, all Canidae products are great.  Let me tell you what happened.  Three years ago, my little dog had hot spots all over her.  She was miserable, itching, scratching, moping around.  I took her to the vet who gave me a cream which didn't help.  Then one time, I went to my groomer who told me the truth:  SHE'S ALLERGIC!  These hot spots are Alergies!!!  Huh?  Why didn't the vet tell me this?  (Was it because he was also selling the other dog food I was using?)  The groomer suggested I look for a product that had no corn.  I liked the Amazon reviews about Canidae products and tried it.  Not only did she take to the change right away, (although I gradually changed food) but her hot spots cleared up.  Needless to say, Canidae products are all I use now.  I don't care that they are a little more expensive!  They cleared up my poor dog's misery, and that's all that counts!

review/summary: Quality dog food, but he still can't have it...
review/text: For about three months we were feeding this formula and the Senior formula to our 18-year-old Gilligan, mainly because he has a very long list of health issues that we try to sidestep like landmines and I strongly believe the prescription foods sold at the vet office are nothing but crap.  I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues.

review/text: I think that someone should cross shrip with grapes. Then you could have shrimp on a vine... BUT.. every 5th "grape/shimp is filled with cocktail sauce. And then you culd pick a bunch of grape/shrimp and slam them on the plate and BOOM! you would have perfectly cocktail sauced shrimp any time you want!!! If this shrimp was like that i would give it 6 stars!

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: I bought this product from a local outlet several times and have always enjoyed it quite a bit. I usually brew 4-6 times in a row using my 16 ounce infuser and the same 2-4 teaspoons of tea. The price seems a little more worthwhile when considering this. The tea itself has a flavor that I would call smooth and green, a little strong but not bitter at all. I can only compare this to other Teavana loose leaf teas and various brands of bagged teas (Stash, Yogi, Lipton, and others), but gyokuru imperial is an all time favorite. I also like that despite giving a strong caffiene boost to my day it never has given me the jagged feeling or lift and drop that I have come to expect from coffie and strong black teas. It is a short steep tea made for 40 seconds to 1 minute per serving which I like as I am a little impatient with preparing tea. If you have a tea store nearby, do yourself a favor<br /> and ask to smell this, it will taste much the same when finished.

review/summary: A very nice mild green tea
review/text: I love Japanese green tea and had read that gyokuro is the finest variety, so I decided to splurge on this tea. The tea is very nice, but not worth the price (in my opinion) compared to other sencha teas at a quarter of the price. I prefer a tea that brews bright green with a distinct grassy taste. This tea (using 1.5 teaspoons with 8 oz. of 175�F water and brewing for for 3 minutes) brewed tea with a faint green hue and a delicate, mild flavor. The flavor was fresh and sweet but not as bold as I had hoped. As one would expect, a second infusion (brewed for 4 minutes) was even weaker and only beneficial if one is being frugal (or wants to avoid the caffeine that is mostly extracted in the first infusion).

review/text: I have tried a number of gyokuros and this one is way to overpriced for what you get. H&S has good gyokuro as do others here in Japan that sell directly from their farms.<br /><br />Did I mention how horrible Teavana's customer service is? They don't respond to emails,etc. You have to wait on the phone for hours. Simply unacceptable. Feel free to check their facebook wall to see customers voicing the same concern. The company simply does not seem to appreciate its customers and apparently many people feel the same way. I will no longer buy from them due to their poor service and overpriced products.

review/summary: The best!
review/text: I had never heard of this before. When my parents passed recently, I moved back into the house that I grew up in.<br />I came across an old bottle of this in the fridge. Obviously there for years. Knowing my parents, it could have been 10 plus years old. No dates anywhere on the bottle or faded & torn label. Eventually, curiosity got the best of me & the risk of getting sick from eating something I had no idea how old it was fell to the wayside. I tried it. Much to surprise, this was the best tasting marinade or sauce I had ever had. Unfortunately, I couldn't seem to find it any where in the Los Angeles area. Even my foodie friends have never heard of it, though my tastes run quite a bit more simple than theirs do. Well my friends, I have found it here and will be ordering it as soon as I finish writing this review. ENJOY!!!

review/text: Several years ago I used to buy Lea & Perrins White Wine Worcestershire Sauce all the time.  It was simply the best way to cook chicken--add some potatoes, onions and mushrooms (sometimes peas or green beans) and it cooked up the easiest but elegant dinner.  Then without warning, my store stopped carrying it.  It wasn't listed on the Lea & Perrins site.  It was just gone.  I was thinking about chicken recipes today and on an off-chance googled white wine Worcestershire and this page came up.  I am happy to see its made again!  Its even back on Lea & Perrins website.  Still can't buy it in the stores but ordering it here is the next best thing.  There truly is not anything better on the market (trust me I looked for a good substitute...)<br /><br />Glad its back...now to get it back on the grocery shelves.

review/text: When Lea & Perrins White Wine Worcestershire started showing up at my local market about ten years ago I tried it and wondered how I'd lived without it before.  It, along with basil, became my signature "secret ingredient" whenever I was teaching a young person to learn to cook a few dishes.  When I moved to New Zealand for 3 years I would take multiple bottles back over and share them with my new kiwi friends. They were also thrilled at what it could do to a soup, dressing or marinade. How disappointed I was to return to the States and find it missing from the shelves!  Now I buy it online a few at a time -- it's time to reorder!!!

review/text: The package states that the dumplings consisted of cottage cheese stuffed with potatoes and raisins. Hmmm, didn't quite get that experience with the first or any packet I opened. The "dumplings" were more like neglected corn meal mystery balls stuffed with poor resemblances of rehydrated potatoes and/or raisins. Physically hard and offensive to attempt eating, let alone digesting.<br /><br />I've have Malai Kofta at multiple Indian restaurants before, all of which, I've fallen in love with, so herein lies a true disconnect with this  manufacturer's rendition of Malai Kofta.<br /><br />The flavor of the sauce is commendable for a pre-cooked and mailed food product, but all else with this product falls short of pleasing.<br /><br />Hope this helps with your decision making.

review/text: The ginger is very subtle--I'm not convinced I taste it at all--and the peach is soft and delicious, the black tea exquisite. What also strikes me is the smoothness of the blend. It's perfect in the morning with breakfast; as a black tea it contains more caffeine than most teas, though not as much as coffee. And I like it with a bit of honey (to brighten the flavor and cut any hint of bitterness, particularly if you've over-steeped). Tastes best when it's cooled a bit to a gentle warmth, not steaming hot. For full review, see the posting on my blog ("Of Spice and Zen"): [...]

review/summary: Watered down taste, even for someone who's not a big coffee drinker!
review/text: I agree with a previous reviewer about the watered down taste of this particular brew. I recently purchased a CBTL Contata maker & brewed my first cup of coffee today. I am not at all a big coffee drinker. Coffees at Starbucks, etc. are too strong for me; I'm more of a Folger's breakfast blend type of gal. I love the vanilla and mocha lattes, though, which was the primary reason for my purchasing the Contata.<br /><br />Because of my rather "inexperienced" coffee palate, I decided to try the Decaf House Brew first because it is the lightest roast of all the brews CBTL makes. Even with this, I expected the coffee to be a little on the strong side for my tastes, but instead, was shocked to find that my first cup was really watery. I mean REALLY watery! I don't know if this is the House Brew itself and I should step up to a medium roast like the Viennese Brew, OR if reprogramming the Contata to produce a smaller quantity of beverage is the way to fix this problem. I'm confused as to what to do.<br /><br />A previous reviewer mentioned (and I am paraphrasing based on memory!) that there is less coffee/expresso in the CBTL capsules than there is in a K-cup and so the same amount of water used in the CBTL as is used in a K-cup maker is the reason for the watered down taste. Is this the real issue here, or is this an issue with the House Brew itself? I welcome comments on this from those who are experienced with the CBTL expresso makers and their brews. Trying to learn here!<br /><br />I'm disappointed that this is a problem. With my previous K-cup coffeemaker, I always brewed a 12 oz size of coffee and never did it taste watery. I'd go back to a K-cup maker, but really wanted a unit that brewed both coffee and expresso.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/22/12: I brewed a cup of Viennese Brew today. It was NOT watered down and tasted quite good, so maybe the House Brew itself is, indeed, the problem. I do have issues, however, with the Contata itself. When it was warming up this morning, it dribbled out about an ounce of hot water. Also, after it finishes brewing a cup, the spout continues to drip for a good 2 minutes. Am wondering if anyone else with a Contata is having this problem. Guess I will have to enter a review on the Contata page to see.

review/text: I know coffee purists often turn their noses up at decaf, but I'm starting to back off on "fully leaded" coffee.  I like the taste of coffee but don't really always need the caffeine.  Problem is, a lot of decaf out there just does not have good flavor.  I've tried decaf capsules for Tassimo and Keurig and have been disappointed.  But this capsule from CBTL decaf definitely has great taste!  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is.  But then again, I have yet to try a CBTL capsule flavor I didn't like.  If you need a good capsule machine and want to know that decaf is an option, go with CBTL.

review/summary: Suspicious ginger from China.
review/text: I had purchased this ginger once in the past, and it was very good quality. However, the latest order that I made gave me quite a shock! The ginger powder had a very peculiar, chemical odor. I tasted a small sample and had to rinse my mouth as it was disgusting. Then I looked more closely at the label, and discovered the problem. This ginger is from China, and although labeled as organic, I'm quite sure that it was laced with pesticide or other chemicals. I have read reports of "organic" ginger leaving China literally covered with insecticide powder, and I suspect that this is what may have happened to this batch. I would recommend that you avoid this product until these issues are resolved.

There could be more clams.....which is what I say about most of these chowders anyway.  I added a small can of minced clams and ummmmmmm, that really added to the flavor.  This is what I do with almost all clam chowders anyway.  And of course potatoes rained supreme but I still thoroughly enjoyed this can of clam chowder.  This was my first taste of the brand "Eating Right"  and I have to admit, I'll be buying it again when it's on sale.

review/text: Let me get this out of the way.  I prefer oysters in olive oil and larger in size.  Having said that, these oysters have a really fine taste.  At the end of the day, that is what matters.<br /><br />By the way, mine are in sunflower oil.

review/text: I like to eat smoked oysters straight out of the can or on a cracker. Unfortunately these petite, little darling are inconstant from can to can. Some cans have firm oysters in them while others cans are full of chewy and crunchy oysters. The aroma of the smokey oysters come on pretty strong and so does the taste.<br /><br />I probably won't be ordering any more unless the price comes downs.

review/text: These oysters have been a great buy for us.  At less than $1.00 a can, they are a fantastic deal and they are beautifully smoked.  So far ours have been very small, which we prefer, and our case was packed in sunflower oil instead of cottonseed oil, which is healthier if not heated.  They aren't oily, very smokey, and great with hot sauce, horseradish, and good bacon.  Try some!
