review/summary: Best tuna I ever ate
review/text: This tuna is fantastic. I stopped eating canned tuna because I want to avoid BPA although I am wondering if the liner of the cap on this jar might be made with BPA. I bought mine at my local market and it was about $4 less than this but worth it.

review/summary: Whoa...
review/text: I am too tired to do a video review. Maybe, I will do one later. This oil is a must have for ladies with natural hair. I am AAF with 3c/4b hair that has been thinning since the birth of my child. I have been natural for 4 years and mostly keep my hair in cornrows because of this dry, hot weather. I do "baby" my hair. Weekly conditioning, bi-weekly deep condition, satin scarves etc etc. I used this oil for my weekly conditioning. I put this on my dry hair, let it sit for a few hours (after dinner). I washed it out with apple cider vinegar and applied some shea butter and went to bed. When I wokeup I had a new head of curls!! Perfect little corkscrew curls and they were so moist. I have also been using it on my ends when I were my ponytails (between braiding). I have only been using this oil about two weeks but it really has made a difference in my curl definition and the moisture content of my hair. I highly recommend this proudcts to my natural girls!! It does have a smell to it but it disappears throughout the day. Be sure to rinse it out well.

review/summary: Cheap ingredients in an expensive bottle
review/text: This oil was something else a decade or so ago. It was also pricier. When I recently bought it at a local Indian grocer, I was surprised the price had dropped significantly. Hair oils in India are traditionally coconut oil mixed with other essential herbs, extracts etc - which is what I assumed Dabur's would be too. What a disappointment to find this only but an unhelpful formula of 1. Canola oil 2. Paraffinum Liquidum (a fancy name for Mineral oil) 3. Palm Glycerides (Solids as byproducts from hydrogenating Palm oil)...search the internet for contra-indications for these and it should steer you far away...Goes to show, bigger brands are not necessarily better (DABUR is huge in India)Unfortunately my purchase was not from Amazon and I ended up tossing it - so no refund.<br /><br />I would highly recommend pure coconut oil: you can use essential oils to add to its perfume, but sometimes I even use Azulene oil on my scalp. Works like a charm for oily, greasy scalp days...<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Easy-clean-easy-Azulene/dp/B00011JN56/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1291331352&sr=8-1

review/summary: This is a great product
review/text: As an African-American woman who has suffered from breakage and damaged hair, I have to give this props.  I've only been using the product for about two week now and I'm seeing big difference in my hair.  I use it as a part of deep conditioning regimen and let me say when I complete the overall process of conditioning, shampooing, and combing or brushing through my hair I have very little breakage.  If I don't use it as a part of my DC regimen than, I'll use some to a cheap conditioner as a prepoo to soften my hair for about 35 mins.  True the smell isn't the best but for the work it has done on my hair it gets my respect.  I will warn you the first ingredient used in this oil is mineral oil, so for my natural ladies who are scared of that, you may want to try the powder form.

review/summary: It is not Organic Hair oil ! It is mineral oil (Paraffinum Liquidum) !!!
review/text: I was using Dabur Amla Hair oil for many years and realized that it is mineral oil (Paraffinum Liquidum) and it is petroleum product and NOT a organic oil. It has Zero percent<br />(0 %) hair penetration. I have started using and trying different oils including coconut oil, and Til (Sesame) oil. I loved both - Coconut and Til oil from different company including any local Ayurvedic company in/from India which has herbs into it.<br /><br />Coconut and Til oil has more than 90% hair penetration after overnight use and I am telling this after I searched and reviewed some studies done on hair products, especially, oil. Dabur do have other hair oils product (e.g. Vatika) which has coconut oil and so if you pleased then can use that. But local Ayurvedic are far better than big brand for hair oil.<br /><br />Hope that help you a bit. Thanks.

review/summary: So Far its Working
review/text: I only used the product Amla Oil twice at the hair salon.  My hair stylist assistant washes my hair regularly and adds a cap full of the oil along with conditioner and massages it in for a few minutes and leaves it in for 10 minutes.  After she does a light shampoo to remove the oil which is very oily. YOU MUST DO A SHAMPOO OR MAYBE TWO AFTER USE.  The assistant only does one shampoo for me.  After she blows my hair out dry, my stylist styles my hair however I want and he does not put a heat protector.  My hair is left healthy, strong, and shiny (I have thick medium length hair, permed but not damaged. My hair is pretty healthy already).  The oil does not weigh my hair down, eventhough the smell is strong it is not bad.  The first use the smell lingered in my hair for two weeks and the second time of use the scent lasted 4 days.  I will continue to use this product.  I use KeraCare humidity block sheen<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GZ7RFS">Avlon KeraCare Oil Sheen with Humidity Block 11 oz (312 g)</a>regurlarly(BEST), and mizanni H2O intense night cream<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VUO8VG">MIZANI H2O INTENSE NIGHT-TIME TREATMENT 5 OZ</a>

review/summary: Fantastic Oil...Great for Natural Hair
review/text: I absolutely love this oil. I applied it directly to my scalp/roots, then massaged my scalp and put a bonnet over my hair and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning and washed my hair (with a homemade shampoo using castile soap) and conditioned and my hair was so incredibly soft.<br /><br />A lot of women I've heard have complained of the smell. It smells similar to the Blue Magic hair grease to me...the blue bergamont hair dressing that people use. It has a natural, almost earthy smell to it, and the smell does tend to linger. It took a day for me to stop smelling it in my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend. I am African-American, and I have natural, 3b/3c hair. I felt as if the oil has accentuated my curl pattern (not defined it anymore than usual). I have noticed that my hair is shedding a lot less, and the softness is to die for. Two thumbs up, definitely.

review/summary: didn't work for me
review/text: I have a lot of fine, wavy, dark hair, and this product didn't seem to do much for me. I was hoping this product would subtly darken my hair and also nourish it and make it softer. This product did seem to remove some of the red undertones in my hair, but didn't make it thicker or softer. This product is mainly mineral oil with dye and a bit of amla mixed in. For my hair, I prefer natural coconut oil or olive oil, so now if I wish to darken my hair I mix pure amla with either of those oils and get great results.

review/summary: Just a helpful review
review/text: I just wanted to let everyone know about hair oil products Bc I use them at times.. While this product does smell, it should not be worn outside, it should only be used as a leave in treatment and as such, should be used at night and shampood out in the morning. Never leave it in all day. I have not used this particular product but "amla" is a kind of a gooseberry and that's the primary ingredient in this (this oil is an ayurvedic product). Amla is very beneficial for dandruff and dry scalp so this will help with that.  But a great hair oil I use to get my hair to be healthy and grow faster is called "Vatika" and its from the same company(its on amazon). This oil does not smell bc its a coconut oil and it also has a nice fragrance added to it, so its great. I massage it in hair at night and shampoo it out in the morning. I sometimes do it twice or three times a week. I'm not a regular User. But it really helps w hair growth and also makes it stronger. I hope this helps. Sorry about the long message though.

I'm not even sure that it's all that authentic because the ingredients on the bottle don't list any that are compelling.<br />Since trying this item, I have switched to Extra Virgin Olive Oil from my kitchen cabinet, used the same protocol for treating my hair and have noticed a softer quality in my hair as a result.<br />Don't waste the time or money ordering this product.  Go to an Indian market and choose from more authentic products.

review/summary: Worked GREAT - White Woman w/ Blonde Hair
review/text: I just got the product yesterday. I used it last night. I have fine blonde hair with damage from regular abuse. It is also thinning a little, due to the abuse. I put it on starting at roots, massaged into scalp and then ran it through the ends. It stunk. It was not the worst smelling product, but it was not nice. I left it on all night. The smell did not keep me awake. In the morning I washed it twice with a Nexus shampoo and ran a daily conditioner through my hair really quickly. It worked GREAT! My hair feels healthier. My ends show a little less damage, but really the only cure for split ends is a trim. It also looks really shiny. I plan on using this for about an 30 minutes to an hour 3 times a week for about a month then backing off to twice a week - I really don't want my hair to darken, so I might drop down to once a week, depending on how my hair reacts. I will use this product again and would advise anyone that is dealing with brittle, damaged, fine hair to use it as well.

review/summary: What is in this?
review/text: I used this once. It works.  My hair is stronger, slightly darker and softer.  My concern is what is in this product?  What types of chemicals or pesticides were sprayed on the herbs?  How pure is the oil?  The product does not have an herbal scent but rather a chemical smell.  What is in this?  I worry because the scalp absorbs products readily and these things end up in your bloodstream....that includes any hair dye and shampoos you use.  The ingredients are especially important here because we are supposed to leave this on overnight  thus giving the scalp a lot of exposure to some unknown ingredients.  Keep in mind that the chemicals and pesticides that were banned in the US years ago are shipped to third world nations and frequently re-imported into this country via these types of products.  I don't know what is in this and it may be great but I am concerned about the smell...it is not a natural scent.

review/summary: Use before showering on dry/frizzy hair
review/text: I have been using this product for about 3 years now. I have thick, wavy black hair (which has been dyed brown in the past), and I thought this was an okay product to use. Even though it's not perfect, I would say my hair is better when I use this product than when I don't use this product.If your hair is naturally oily and rarely gets dry, you're fortunate enough not to need oils like these. But if your hair gets dry and perhaps frizzy once you're out of the shower, you should try this hair oil.<br /><br />I use this product 2 or 3 times a week. I massage it into my hair at least half an hour before I take a shower. It smells a little, and it's really up to you whether you find it a good or bad smell, but I personally don't like it. When I'm in the shower, I use small amounts of shampoo and conditioner (which is what you're supposed to do anyway) and wash out my hair with cold water. Then I let my hair air-dry or towel-dry and apply a leave-in conditioner of a different brand. And my hair feels good afterward! It's not dry nor oily, it doesn't look frizzy, and people have told me my hair is looking healthier over time.<br /><br />I basically don't like the smell of this product. And I'm sure there are much better, albeit more expensive, hair oil brands out there. But if you need to cure your hair of dryness, you should make your shower routine more like mine.

review/summary: Runny and Exciting Honey!
review/text: Unlike YS's Raw Honey, this honey isn't a solid mass crammed into a what is essentially a plastic peanut butter jar. That being said, don't be fooled by the picture, this is only about 12 oz more than your regular jar of YS honey and sells for $15. But I think it makes up for the price with it's taste; It isn't so cloyingly sweet as YS Eco-honey, and is actually a little bitter; but it's good tasting, and smells fantastically flowery~<br /><br />It may have / may have not been heat treated, because it's runny. Not supermarket, mass-produced and mixed with corn syrup, syrupy honey in a squeeze-y bear. It is more like naturally runny? Like flowing water, almost. In colder weather the honey firms up and has the same color as seen on the product page. (Here's something to keep in mind: If your honey has crystallized, *NEVER* nuke it to melt it. Your just wasting your money that way by killing all of the beneficial enzymes and good stuff in it. Melt your honey in a bowl, in a pan; low AND slow.)<br /><br />I read a review on the Vitacost website, and that customer said that this honey changes hue and flavor depending on the season. Since it's still Winter, going on Spring in the States, my jar of honey is most likely a Summer-Fall blend of honey; It is really dark compared to my jar of YS honey. I wonder what a Winter/Spring wildflower honey from New Zealand tastes like~

review/summary: Unsure of the flavor
review/text: I was sold on this product as it was Organic and Raw, it's pretty good, smells great.<br /><br />I have only used it in a few raw food recipes such as ice cream, but I can almost taste an aftertaste which I can't pin point exactly if it's the oil, but I have only noticed it when using this oil in my recipes....so I am a bit confused.<br /><br />I did a taste test and ate only the oil and it was great, but it seems when mixed with nuts and agave...there is an aftertaste and it seems like its coming from the oil...as the recipes I have made are tried and true, and it wasn't till I added this "brand" of oil that I can taste this odd flavor that seems like its related to coconut... I can't explain it, but would be interested to know if anyone else has experienced this, so I can see if it's just me, or the product.<br /><br />I paid $10 more than the on line price, so it was costly, and not sure if I will buy again.

review/summary: A New Staple In My Pantry!
review/text: These cookies were a seasonal offering at a local store.  I purchased one box.  After trying them at home, I returned to the store and purchased the remaining inventory! A simple scoop of vanilla ice cream is transformed by the inclusion of a butter crisp. I also love them with tea...or straight out of the box.  Don't be daunted by purchasing a pack of 12 boxes.  The cost is a little over half of what I paid in the store.  Lastly, unless you hide them in a dark corner of your pantry, you'll never have to worry about the shelf life, because they will be consumed quickly by family, friends, and yourself!

They put out 12 boxes-I buy 12 boxes-until they raised the price so much in 2 years that I sought out other methods of satisfying my addiction.<br />Amazon to the rescue!!! The subscription service is a wonderful thing-brings the price down to $2.11/box-when they are now $3.69 in my local supermarket-(if you can find them). And FREE SHIPPING!!  Finding this service was my refuge to keep these cookies in my life without going into "cookie bankruptcy"-with  my food budget.  LOVE THEM!!

They cost a lot more locally and are very fragile, so bringing them from France always leaves me with a box of very delicious crumbs. These came well-packed and (mostly) whole, so they are suitable for company. 12 boxes may seem like a lot, but they go very fast. Highly recommended.

Remind me a bit of a graham cracker.  You can also eat a bunch as one serving, which is always a plus.  I also wondered when I opened the box how I would ever eat that amount of cookies, but now I'm pretty sure it's not going to be enough.  They did arrive broken somewhat even though Amazon put in extra packaging air bags. Doesn't change the taste, so I don't care.

review/summary: So Simple, So Fantastic
review/text: Sugar, butter and eggs are three staples of almost every kitchen.  Who knew that these three ingredients could combine in such a way to produce Jules Destrooper's wonderful butter crisps?<br /><br />I actually learned about butter crisps from my wife's aunt who makes them each year at Christmas.  She always gives us a lot of them and I always eat way more than I should.  I love these treats and they have become a highlight of Christmas for me.<br /><br />The other day I was walking through a local store and happened upon these Jules Destrooper Butter Crisps and immediately grabbed a box.  While they aren't quite as good as the homemade ones of my wife's aunt, they come in at an extremely close second place.<br /><br />Homemade always beats the store bought brand in my opinion, but Jules Destrooper will now get me through the year until December rolls around.  If you enjoy a lightly sweetened, terribly addictive treat, I highly recommend Jules Destrooper's butter crisps.  They are a great snack any time of year and are the perfect compliment to ice cream, coffee or all by themselves.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

As you can see, the boxes are classy and in most gourmet stores, EACH box can sell for nearly $6! ... so you will also seem a genuine benefactor :-)<br /><br />The only thing wrong with these cookies is that Amazon makes it too easy to obtain :-)

review/summary: Elegant cookies of excellent quality
review/text: All of the Jules Destrooper cookies are made in Belgium with good quality ingredients and packaged well.  They are quite attractive and whenever I serve them to someone who has never had them before, they always comment on them.<br /><br />The thins are especially elegant, thin and crisp, wonderful with ice cream or a warm beverage.  My only complaint about Jules Destrooper cookies is that it is very difficult not to eat a whole box at once.  Whenever I see them at the dollar store, I stock up and try to hide a few boxes in the top cabinet.<br /><br />Ginger Thins - These have plenty of nice chewy little bits of translucent candied ginger (5%) that contrast with the almost brittle cookie and have a good balance of spice (ginger and a hint of cinnamon) to sweet.  These are wonderful with tea.<br /><br />Almond Thins - Crispy with lots of almond slivers and slices (10%) and a pronounced flavor of both brown sugar and butter.  I appreciate that they aren't loaded up with almond extract, making the taste more delicate in than the usual almond cookie.  Especially good with ice cream, cr&egrave;me br�l&eacute;e, or any custard-based dessert.<br /><br />Butter Crisps - These are also nice and crunchy but with a more neutral flavor, very buttery, similar to an ice cream cone.  They are excellent with a thin smear of jam and hot chocolate or with ice cream.<br /><br />Paris Butter Waffles - These are not quite as brittle or elegant as the others but because of the deep waffle pattern, they are the perfect vehicle for hazelnut chocolate spread (Nutella) or speculoos spread (Biscoff spread) and a cup of coffee.  This variety does have artificial vanilla, which is actually preferred by many for baking cookies.

review/summary: My new found favorite.
review/text: These cookies are delicious. I first tasted them when a box came in a Mother's Day gift basket.  When the last crumb had vanished, I searched for more on Amazon and, sure enough, my favorite shopping spot came through.  This crunchy, buttery waffle cookie is a terrific addition to a bowl of Blue Bell (yes, I'm a loyal Texan) ice cream or a good cup of tea or coffee. We even eat them with a cup of yogurt or kefir as a light evening meal.  You'll find your own favorite situations for this tasty treat.  The only thing I would change is the packaging.  Each thin box holds only 8 cookies, although each cookie is about 1 1/2 x 3 inches, so one cookie is plenty to eat in most cases.  Also on the positive side, the small packaging ensures that the crispiness lasts after the box is opened. I should add, the cookies are in two plastic nests of four cookies inside a foil package inside the cardboard box, so a good clamp keeps the opened cookies crisp and whole. Bon apetit!

Haven't tasted any others but if they are representative, the rest must be incredible!  Butter Crisp Cookies are absolutely outstanding!<br /><br />Difficult to find in local stores where I live so have to order on line now.  Received quickly from Amazon.com.  100% satisfied with service and especially the product! Try 'em, you'll LOVE 'em.

review/summary: Awesome and addicting
review/text: Wonderful flavor and crunch. I especially enjoy them with my tea. The ingredients are natural, and since I don't remember seeing the ingredient list with the product information I'll give it here: wheat flour, brown sugar, butter, almonds(10%), salt, leavening:sodium bicarbonate. I use to buy these at my grocery, but only if they were on sale. Amazon's price beats the sale price, so Amazon is a very good bargain. Knowing how thin the cookie is I was concerned about the shipping breaking the cookies, but frankly the product shipped from Amazon was in better condition than the grocery version. These truly are wonderful, but beware that once you've opened a box it's very hard to stop at a single serving (8 cookies). There are about 30 cookies per box, and I confess, I've eaten an entire box in a day. If you like the flavor combination of brown sugar, butter, and almonds then you will really like these cookies.

review/summary: The Swedish Chef Would Be Proud!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of all things swedish, from Lingonberries to salt cod to Lutefisk to those yummy red candy fish. When I saw that Jules Destrooper had invented yet another Swedish delectable, I could not wait for my package to arrive!<br /><br />After assaulting the UPS driver and absconding with my "butter waffles" (which are more like cookies), I went into my kitchen and sat down in my breakfast nook to eat them. A hearty glass of milk was all I needed to drench the entire box and consume it. In reality, I ended up saturating the cardboard box and must have eaten that as well, because when I was done there was nothing left save for some soggy nuggets stuck to my ceiling. I assume they are from my delicious waffles and not from my earlier experiment of stuffing a cornish game hen with popping corn to "make its own stuffing." I am still picking bits of hen from my bushy, inappropriately dark eyebrows.<br /><br />Also, some recipe ideas for these waffles include topping them with olives, tuna salad, anchovy and pretzel (an old Slavic favorite) and peanut butter. Sometimes I give these to the neighbor children when they behave themselves, and actually I have only given one out to one neighbor child. My neighbor's kids are usually misbehaving and absolutely do not deserve any of my tasty cookies! Anyway, it turns out the one kid I gave it to was actually a lawn jockey statue, which makes sense because my neighbors, the "Davenports," have very light skin. They are actually quite pasty and I am waiting for the day when one of them develops melanoma, because they are always out in the sun, in their pool, having a "heck of a time," under the sun's deadly rays, oblivious to the cellular damage they are inflicting on themselves. I prefer to stay inside during the daytime and nighttime hours, usually venturing from my house every fortnight to collect my mail. However, when I know a delivery of Jules Destrooper Butter waffles are arriving, I am on "high alert" and spring from my rascal mobility scooter whenever I hear a car door close.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE these waffles. Buy them, and If you don't love them too, send them off to me!!!

It has the same taste and texture of any full or multi-grain organic pasta, but with only 16g of carbs compared to DeBoles with 46g/serving. That was a no-brainer for me. I'm not a huge pasta fan, but at least if I am going to have spaghetti this makes much more sense than regular pasta. :)

review/summary: You can fit 63!
review/text: I use three of these across one of my storage shelves in my kitchen. I also have the large drawer that fits under the Keurig. Essentially these 54 pod drawers are for my overflow.<br />This particular brand - Nifty - is... well.... quiet nifty! It's reasonably priced. There are other brands that make this same exact drawer and charge a lot more.<br />Hypothetically speaking, since I use this for storage, I supposed I could use the actual boxes the K cups come in.... but the nice thing about these drawers is that you can easily see when you are running low... versus going in the pantry and sticking your hand in your favorite K cup box to find only a few left (or worse... empty, because some used the last one and didn't tell you!).<br /><br />I think my only con to this is that the drawers are not smooth sliding drawers. Sometimes you have to shimmy the drawer a bit. But that holds true for those 'other' pricer versions as well.<br /><br />Also... you can actualy fit more than 54 in this drawer. I can fit 63. If you alternate between storing each K cup top side up and bottom side up in each row... you can fit 1 extra cup in each row. However, I don't think all of the rows are exactly the same size. The middle row of each drawer is a bit snug. I end up only doing this extra-cup-concept in the outside rows.

review/summary: These hold K-cups just like they're supposed to
review/text: I really love this product. I had to take some time to figure out where to put it that would be accessible. I've put it on top of my microwave and it fits there great. It holds the exact amount of k-cups that it says it would and I was actually glad that I picked the 54 cup pod drawer over the 36 cup pod drawer as I have a lot of k-cups to store. I even placed some of my extra k-cups on the top of this shelf until I can put them into the drawers.<br /><br />I noticed that someone had said they could fit extra k-cups into their drawer by alternating one up and one down. I found this annoying as I couldn't see what all the flavors of coffee were being stored in the drawer. I could only fit one extra k-cup per line in the drawer anyway so I didn't find this needed or unnecessary.<br /><br />So if I enjoy it so much, why knock it down by one star?<br /><br />I noticed that the drawer is bent just slightly. It's a sturdy drawer, but it's not as sturdy as it could be it seems, the wire bent in slightly more one one side than the other. It would be nice if it had been made out of slightly stronger metal that didn't bend as easily. Also, some of the drawers slide very smoothly while others pull out a little harder because the wire that they slide on is a bit bent as well.

When pulling the drawers open, the tops of the kcups catch the drawer above it and tip over, or drag.  Just have to pull it out slowly to avoid problem.  Ive added a picture in the gallery also.

review/summary: "Sturdy" comes to mind as the best description!
review/text: If asked to sum up this coffee-pod drawer in one word, "sturdy" would be my enthusiastic answer. It is one hefty piece of metal sliding-drawer perfection - it weighed in at 4 lbs. 11 oz. on my postal scale!<br /><br />The drawers slide in and out with barely a hitch. Large rubber feet on the bottom means it stays put on your counter. The drawers have stops on the bottom so you won't accidentally pull  them out completely. And best of all, 36 K-cups fit in perfectly, nestling cozily in 3 individual rows per drawer thanks to 2 divider bars in each.<br /><br />Seriously, you can't go wrong with this product if you have only a couple of boxes of K-cups you need to store. So much more attractive than boxes! I do plan to eventually paint mine with metal spray-paint to complement my kitchen's color scheme.

review/text: We are very happy with this purchase.  It looks nice, holds more K-cups than other containers of the same price, and arrived in perfect shape.  The only thing I dislike about the product is that the bottom two drawers are sometimes difficult to pull out.  Instead of gliding out, you have to sort of wiggle and shimmy them.  It's really not that big of a deal though.  It's a minor annoyance but, overall, the product is everything we hoped for.  We just store are least favorite flavors on the bottom (the most difficult to pull out).

review/text: Before I got this drawer, boxes of pods were taking over my cabinet, like some sci-fi horror film. Now I can easily see what varieties I have and what I am running low on. I am a new Keurig user and this has greatly added to my enjoyment of the system. More organized than a basket, holds more than a carousel, and looks great too.
