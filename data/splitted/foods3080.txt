review/summary: Maragarita without the guilt
review/text: I could drink this all day and I have.  Tastes like a margarita without A. the calories and B. the alcohol.  It even has a salty undertaste.  Crystal Light has done a great job of capturing the essence of a margarita which has made me realize I drink margaritas for the flavor, not the alcohol. Time to make another pitcher!

review/summary: Fake tasting margarita
review/text: Just mixed up the margarita crystal light mix.  Of, course, followed the directions, because for<br />years I have been using the other flavors.  This one is of great disappointment.  It only tastes<br />like sweetened water, no identifying citrus or margarita flavor.  I like the lemonade the best.<br />One time there was a lime flavor that I really liked, too.  No, I will not use up the other 4<br />packets.  Waste of money.<br /><br />P. Calder<br />Green Bay, WI

review/summary: Good flavor for those hot summer days!
review/text: We drink a lot of Crystal Light as a break from soft drinks.  We thought we would try their new Mocktail flavors and give them a chance.  This Margarita flavor is not bad.  It actually tastes like a margarita with a couple of good exceptions, no sugar, low sodium and it has only 5 calories for 8 ounces.<br /><br />Each canister has 5 plastic pouches and each pouch makes 2 quarts.  Mix it up and serve it cold with ice or refrigerate for the best flavor.<br /><br />Crystal Light is a good low calorie drink and the broad flavor mix helps keep them tasting good.  We found this margarita taste to be better than the Appletini flavor.  I still like some of the original Crystal light flavors more but this is good for a change.  It tastes as good as some other more expensive margarita mixes.  I looked at a bottle of one of the famous brands that has 100 calories for 8 ounces and 25 sugars.  That is a huge difference!<br /><br />Try it you will like it!

review/summary: It's not my favorite but still pretty good
review/text: My husband and I drink a good amount of Crystal Light powdered beverages. I was initially leery of purchasing this particular flavor but after trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and finding it great, I thought I would give this one a try. In terms of flavor, I find this acceptable.  It tastes like a very mild margarita (without alcohol).  It even smells like a margarita.  While I think Crystal Light has done a good job imitating a margarita, it is not my favorite Crystal Light product.<br /><br />If you live near a Meijer, you can buy a five pack canister of the Margarita drink mix (as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LGIY">Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini, 1.69-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>) for about 2.79.<br /><br />If you recycle your plastics, be aware that Crystal Light sells its product in a #5 container. Unless you live in a relatively progressive place, #5 plastics are typically very difficult to recycle. Whole Foods engages in a recycling initiative to collect #5 plastics but if you don't live near one and you care about recycling, these can be a challenging item to deal with.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is a beverage that I would drink again but I don't know if I would purchase it if some of my other Crystal Light favorites were available like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E53TMQ">Crystal Light Sunrise Ruby Red Grapefruit, 3.4-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>.

review/text: I first experienced these when a co-worker brought some in to work.  Then, others picked up on it, and there was an unscripted effort to continually have a jar of them on someone's desk in the area.<br />The one thing that strikes me is having paid four or five dollars for this at the local Target store, Archer's distributor.  Oddly, Archer lists target.com on the jar, but once you're at Target.com, the site informs you that this item is not sold online - you must pick it up at the store.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I ordered these as soon as I saw that Amazon had discounted their normally-out-of-reach price a bit. Am I ever glad I did! They are delicious, with just the right amount of green chile taste. They're very, very spreadable. In fact, that is part of why I'm not giving them 5 stars. I'd like them to be a bit chunkier. But if you like yours to be spreadable, then you will love these.  They are not overly salty, look exactly like the beans you get in good Mexican restaurants here in San Antonio, and taste wonderful. I'd highly recommend putting them on nachos: spread these on some organic corn chips, top with your fave cheese (even not-cheese cheese), and bake the whole thing in an actual oven or toaster oven for a tiny while, just long enough for the cheese to melt, then pull the nachos out, top them with pico de gallo or sour cream or both, and enjoy!<br /><br />Buy these; you won't be sorry!

Personally I will not spend the extra for Organic food if there is chemicals in the can lining.  Good news is that they are phasing out the cans with the BPA lining and going BPA free.

review/summary: Another awesome Amy's product
review/text: This is THE BEST refried beans on the market today. Don't let the "with green chiles" part scare you. They are not hot or spicy, the chiles impart a subtle flavor. The beans are smooth and creamy, not pasty or gritty like the other grocery store brands. Even my 5 and 2 year olds love the quesadillas and burritos and nachos we make with Amy's refried beans.<br /><br />And along with delicious flavor, you get Amy's commitment to organic and vegan products. No GMO's and no MSG. You wont feel guilty about feeding your family anything from Amy's.<br /><br />I did find Amazon's price to still be cheaper than my local natural grocery store. Buy a can from your grocer to try it before you order a case.<br /><br />Side note: Amazon is not packaging these right, these come in a shrink-wrapped cardboard tray of 12 cans. Amazon simply throws this case into a larger  box only with 2 or 3 air pillows as padding! On my first shipment 8 cans were dented! Amazon quickly shipped me out another case, but this time only 4 were dented.<br /><br />Amazon figure out some better packaging for  your canned goods!!!

review/text: I like Amy's products in general and these taste fine. although I like a heartier texture. At $2.27 per can (and that's on sale) I think the product is too expensive. It's so easy to make refried beans at home by frying and mashing a can of pinto beans and a can of kidney beans in a cast iron frying pan (use a little vegetable oil to fry then mash with a potato masher, adding bottled salsa to thin the mix and a pinch of cumin and chili powder for flavor). I'm all for encouraging sales of products made with organic ingredients, but beans are too basic to spend so much money on, imho.

review/summary: My favorite canned soup
review/text: Goodness I can't believe some of these reviews.  How much crab does one expect to find in an inexpensive canned soup product usually found for under a buck and a half?  There are enough bits to make the soup taste like crab and you get to eat a couple of small chunks usually left on the bottom.  The spice is well done and there is a nice mix of vegetables.  There are only 160 calories in the can, and 44% of the daily value for potassium, and not so much sodium (they use reduced sodium sea salt and potassium chloride).  I eat at least a couple of cans a week and have never had heartburn from this soup.  There's nothing so unusual about this soup that would cause heartburn.  It's just a bit spicier than most bland canned soups.

review/text: Considering the price, this is a decent soup, but please don't put the name of my home state on the can. There is probably a gram or two of crab meat on average in a can of this soup, and it's usually all chopped up to the point where you can't even bite into it. We don't take that in MD. Real Maryland crab soup is probably 10% crab by weight and features chunks of crab you can bite into and taste the love. This is vegetable soup stirred in crab meat.<br /><br />4 stars when it's $1 a can, 3 stars for &lt; $2.

review/text: Boy oh boy, does the Internet hate Campbell's Maryland Style Crab Soup. I'll be the first to give this gem five stars.<br /><br />It's hard for me to get excited about soup. I only bought it on a whim because it was discounted, and I've been on a crab-kick here lately. (Crab pasta for lunch in fact!)<br /><br />The aroma of the soup is unlike I've smelled from.. well, any canned soup. I noted that there were a lot of whole pieces of corn, veggies, and white stubs I though were crab.<br />No such luck! Those were potatoes. Indeed, I was at a loss trying to find any crab at all!<br /><br />The broth has a slightly spicy flavor. Not the kind that leaves you huffing for air, but rather the kind you get a slightly snuffly nose after finishing the bowl. Personally it was the perfect "heat" for me- it might be too tame for others.<br /><br />I hopped on the Internet right after finishing it to see what else Campbell's had... because I sure was impressed! I'll definitely be trying out the "Harvest" line of soups they have next time I hit the grocery store.<br /><br />Just one gripe: it's not filling for a man who has a bottomless stomach. (Don't all men?)<br />I suppose if you want something filling, go for beef or pork based soups instead!

review/text: Let me start by saying I was THRILLED when I discovered this can of soup at the local grocery store.  Canned crab soup?!  Does it get any better??  Believe me it does.  You could find dog **** that tastes better than this stuff.  Since it is Campbell's "Select Harvest Light" I figured there would not be much crab in it (plus you can only expect so much from a three dollar can).  I swirled and scooped until coming across a lonely lump, and it was dark brown.  I suppose that upon looking back this should have been a warning sign on the dire things to come.  Alas, my childish excitement clouded my judgement and my taste buds must pay for it.  If you are still curious about tasting this soup, I would recommend buying one can and gathering twenty or so friends - that way they won't have to each buy one as well.  Good luck.

review/summary: Kind bars
review/text: I love that Amazon offers these at a notable discount.  I eat Kind bars frequently.  This particular flavor is not one of my favorites.  The blueberry pomegranite is better.  I have trouble with leg cramps, and the magnesium in these seem to help ward them off.  If I stop eating these, I get awful morning leg cramps.  They are generally healthy, and I do enjoy them.  Kind bars or leg cramps?  I know which one I prefer.

review/summary: Kind Apricot Fruit and Nut bar
review/text: Love this snack bar. Perfect for those who need a gluten-free snack/energy bar. Also low glycemic index product with all natural ingredients and low calorie,high fiber solution to mid-day snack. Fills you up and very satisfying. Great product for diabetics, and those seeking an alternative to cookies and chips. The bar contains almonds, apricots, and sliced bits of coconut giving it a chewy and crunchy texture. Part of my pantry staples now.

review/summary: Nice heat--and a fun snack
review/text: I just discovered this addictive taste treat a short while ago. The peanuts are roasted in the shell and are salted and a tasty spiciness is added, too.  There is a slow burn in the mouth with each peanut. If you don't like spicy peanuts, do not try this product out!  However, if you enjoy some spiciness, this is a nice snack food.<br /><br />I am often disappointed when some food is described as hot and spicy--only to eat something that has minimal heat to it. This delivers the goods nicely. It is not so hot that one burns (as, for instance, with the few times I've tried habanero peppers!), but it has enough pop to be an interesting taste treat.

review/text: I have been eating Hampton Farms Cajun Creole Hot Nuts for about 15 years. In my opinion they are the most delicious snack food on the market. Healthy and tasty, but if they were unhealthy I would still eat 'em. I must confess, I am completely addicted. After you eat a few your nose starts to run and your eyes begin to water. For an extra added kick you can lick the shell (which has the hot Cajun flavor) after you eat the nuts inside. In fact, I am eating some right now and my mouth is on fire. Trust me, this is the good stuff.

review/summary: A NATURAL CURE FOR INSOMNIA THAT WORKS!
review/text: I've had difficulty falling asleep since my college days.  Once I entered my mid-30's the insomnia became more frequent.  Melatonin and valerian pills did not work unless taken at levels that left me with a morning hangover effect. L-Tryptophan, 5-HTP, and GABA were ineffective. I have also tried numerous prescription (sleep is necessary to get through nursing school) and OTC medications that are used to treat insomnia.  Most left me with a headache or excessive daytime sleepiness (zombie mode).  I first tried Sleepytime Extra (Sleepytime and other chamomile teas do not work for me)about 6 weeks ago, and each time I drink it I become sleepy within 15 minutes.  Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra works like a charm!  The 25mg of Valerian root works synergistically with the chamomile and tilia estrella.  I'm stocking up before the FDA comes down on valerian like it did kava kava.  I also recommend 30-60 minutes of sunlight in a.m. hours, because many people are unaware that they have DSPS (Delayed Sleep Phase Insomnia).

review/summary: Sleepy Opium Bear Extra is the best bedtime drink ever.
review/text: for those of you not initiated, valerian tea is the single best herbal soporific out there. camomile? not even  close. some custom blend of liquorish root, peppermint, ginger and rosehips? don't make me laugh. this stuff puts you to sleep like the nyquil of the plant kingdom, but you wake up fresh and without that 'who did something in my mouth' feeling. the problem is that valerian root, by itself, smells and tastes horrible. i mean, actively foul. like it probably wards off mosqitoes and bears and camels and all, y'know? so unless you're a hardcore hemp-wearin' organic cotton 100%-recycled composting-toilet earthship hippy, you wants to get your hands on a blend, hear?<br /><br />the single best valarian blend out there is the 'Sleepytime Extra'. Sleepytime Tea, aka 'Sleepy Opium Bear' (check the picture on the label. it's like Ursus laudenum, you know what I mean?), is a Celestial Seasonings camomile blend tea. it's alright. but some friends introduced me to 'Sleepytime Extra.' with tagline "the valerian makes it extra". that is one mighty fine valerian blend tea. 25mg valerian, nicely formulated, tastes like a bit thicker, richer and slightly sweeter camomile. nice.<br /><br />we are going through Sleepy Opium Bear Extra in this house at a rate of knots. 20 bags in a box means a box every two weeks at best, since we both skip some nights because we're scared we getting addicted. (stay tuned.) but we were down to three bags, and frankly i don't trust my housemate jenn not to substitute in some regular ol' tension-tamin' no-extra camo-minty junk without telling me, because that's the kinda person she is.<br /><br />buy this stuff.  it will change your bedtime experience.

review/summary: Minty Chamomile for Sweet Dreams
review/text: Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Knocks me out
review/text: I never write reviews, that's how much I love this stuff.<br /><br />I don't sleep well. Usually, it takes me at least an hour to fall asleep and get up about 4-5 times in the middle of the night for no reason. And that's a good night. On bad nights I don't fall asleep at all, or it takes me hours to fall asleep and I still get up multiple times a night. Most of the time, however, I can tell when I'm going to have a bad night so, when I saw this in the store I thought it might be able to help (plus I like the normal version).<br /><br />I drink it and 30 min later I can barely keep my eyes open. I sleep the whole night through. Gives me crazy dreams though. Not bad, just weird and vivid.<br /><br />Oh and I took this with Tylenol once because I also had a headache and I woke up in the middle of the night really dizzy. I don't know if the mixture of this tea and the pain killer had anything to do with it, but I've never experienced that before and it only happened the one time I took it with medicine.<br /><br />Other than that, it tastes good, smells amazing, and knocks me out.<br /><br />p.s. Just bought the new vanilla flavor - not as potent but delicious!

I like to mix this with blueberry, or (when I'm under the weather) Echenacia tea (Celestials wellness tea).<br /><br />One word of warning. If you're on any medications for anxiety, depression, etc., you may want to stick with regular Sleepytime.

review/text: OMG, since entering my 40's I have had issues sleeping! I've been on every prescription pill out there and although they work, I didn't want to be tied to the expense associated with them even after the insurance paid its portion. I am a tea drinker and I experiment with different teas tastes all of the time. I'd heard Dr. Oz mention Valerian Root before and how it helps with Insomnia. I saw this tea at my local grocery store and decided to give it a try, NOT EXPECTING anything major. WOWWWWWW, I brewed one cup and about an hour later I was really relaxed and able to fall right asleep. I have told all of my friends about it. I also tried melatonin and it gave me an awful headache each time I tried it. I love this tea and hope they never stop making it! I even like the taste! I look forward to my soothing cup each night at bedtime!

review/text: I was really surprised with this product and how it helped me sleep at night. On an average I sleep about 4 hrs a night and considering that I have to get up for work at 6:15 in the morning I am quite exhausted. I tried sleepytime in hopes that it would help me and was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the tea and how I slept the entire night with no tossing and turning. The only con I have is that it didn't work immediately for me like it did for others and so now I take it about an hour and a half before I go to bed. It does give you a calming effect and I was able to feel rested without that groggy feeling in the morning. I have to say that it has improved my sleeping because I am not constantly waking up at night and having to force myself to sleep again. Very happy I bought extra.

review/summary: This Stuff Works!!!! (It's Got Valerian in it)
review/text: I read the reviews on here, and I thought this might work for me, because I have tremendous trouble getting to sleep, and I'm only 23. This has a nice chamomile/mint flavor to it. It wasn't too flat tasting, or too strong. It was just right. About 10-15 minutes after finishing a cup, I felt the valerian kicking in, and I was off to sleep. I actually slept 8-9 hours which is a huge improvement over the five to six I generally get each night. I think the valerian from the tea was in my system all night, because after sleeping about 5 hours the first time, I got up for an hour, but went back to sleep for another 4 hours without a problem. I don't know if it's supposed to stay in your system that long, but nonetheless, it worked, and Celestial Seasonings did an awesome job of creating this one of a kind tea. This is why I only drink Celestial Seasonings tea. No more Lipton!!!! Not only are the products 100% natural, and caffeine free, but they taste good and leave you wanting more.

Very pleasant taste and much more palatable than having to take sleeping pills.  Also, I don't have that sleeping pill drowsiness hangover the next morning.<br />Very highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Sleepytime Extra Dreams!
review/text: I've been using Sleepytime to relax at night.  No real problems sleeping but it did help me shut down.  I saw the "Extra" and thought I would give it a try.  Same good sleepy affect but I started having dreams, lots of very long lasting dreams about all kinds of stuff.  Nothing scary, some are replays of things in the past some are fantasy like assaulting a meidieval fortress over and over until I get it right.  I don't think I dream normally, at least I don't remember them if I do, but with the Sleeptime Extra I almost always have very vivid dreams and it really is an enjoyable way to spend the night.  No adverse affects as far as I can tell, well except for run on sentences I suppose!

review/summary: Best Sleep Aid and Tastes Good Too
review/text: I have tried many over the counter and natural sleep aids and this is my favorite. The "extra" in this tea is really important. Its not just Valerian, its also the Tilia Estella (Ternstroemia pringlei) that does the trick. Works like magic and with no morning grogginess. I often like to have a drink in the evening to quiet my mind and help me relax. When I'd rather not for whatever reason, I can substitute this tea for my ritual relaxation and ensure a quick bedtime and good night's sleep as well. I highly recommend it.

review/text: I was upset the first time I used this Sleepytime Extra tea as it didn't really work.  Then my friend told me she had used 2 bags instead.  I tried 2 bags and while it wasn't like my sleeping pills I did slowly felt my body relaxed and my eyes were ready to shut.  I hadnt had a good night sleep before Sleepytime...now any night that i felt restless I just popped 2 in my mug and some hot water!  Thank you Sleepytime.

review/summary: This turned me into a hot tea fan!
review/text: I am not usually a hot tea person but I love this stuff!<br />I am a nurse and I started drinking this tea when I would sleep during the day. I work third shift and I didn't want to get in the habbit of taking tylenol PM or benadryl everytime that I needed help sleeping. What I like about this tea is that when you wake up you don't feel drowsy. You sleep well and feel like it when you wake up.<br />I also continued to use it as I started a new job this year and I had trouble sleeping at night. I always have a huge to do list and this helps me sleep at night and not wake up in the middle of the night thinking about what I didn't get done that day or what I need to get done the next day.<br /><br />Also, for how much it helps you sleep, it is very inexpensive. THis is the way to go if you need help getting to sleep or staying asleep once you get there. I have never used prescriptions meds to help me sleep and I don't think that I ever will as long as I can keep using this.<br /><br />THis can be tricky to find in the store. I always get my tea at walmart(it is convenient). One time I found it with the vitamins and one time I found it with the groceries in the tea section. If you can't find it, make sure that you check both places. I hope that this helps!

review/summary: Bad reaction to valerian
review/text: I love regular Sleepytime tea, but I had a bad experience with Sleepytime Extra, I assume because of the valerian.  The tea did not help me sleep at all.  Then in the morning, I couldn't stand without fainting and had a horrible headache.  I had to sleep off the effects for several hours.  I tend to be prone to fainting and have bad reactions to drugs with psychological effects, so my reaction is probably unusual.  However, I would recommend reading up on valerian before trying this tea.<br /><br />On the plus side, it tasted fine, though different from regular Sleepytime.

review/text: I have trouble getting to sleep, and many nights wake up several times. This tea has valerian in it, which is a proven herbal relaxer. This tea not only tastes great, but makes me drowsy as well.  I've found it most effective when I let it brew for about 5 minutes, take it to bed with me and sip on it while I read something relaxing.  If I don't drink it before I go to bed, I definitely brew a cup when I wake in the middle of the night.  Then it helps me get back to sleep.<br />I keep several boxes on hand, because I never want to run out of it!

review/text: I drank this tea for the first time last night and it did put me straight to sleep.  Unfortunately, I slept terribly.  I had anxiety nightmares all night long to the point where I woke up at 2.15 am with fear and adrenaline rushing through my arms and legs so badly that they were actually hurting.  Went back to sleep and it happened again.  Finally got up at 4.30 just to make it stop.  Was shaky all morning.  I've never had this happen before and I'm not taking any medication other than stuff for my asthma.  Can't help but relate it the tea though I will try it again tonight to see if happens again.  If so, that will be the end of the tea for me.

review/summary: A Sleeper Hit
review/text: Celestial Seasonings' Sleepytime Extra is their usual Sleepytime formulation (chamomile) with the extra kick- so to speak- of valerian. Valerian is the herbal basis of Valium. Valerian is a natural relaxant, like kava kava (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016AU3K">Yogi Tea - Kava Stress Relief, 16 bag</a>. It's far more delicious as a tea than a pill. This tea has a calming, herbal flavor. It goes well with desserts. Two cups can literally put me to sleep, but so can boring things like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199232768">War and Peace (Oxford World's Classics)</a>. You can put this in a samovar and drink it. Sleepytime Extra is a refreshingly drug-free sleep aid. It's a lullaby in a cup.

review/summary: Just a nice tea, valerian does not make it extra
review/text: This tea has a nice flavor and is nice to drink in the evening (with most of the herbs being traditional evening  flavors).  But the tea itself is not a sleep aid or sleep supplement.  Its 25 mg of Valerian is several hundred times less Valerian than a standard Valerian extract pill.  They add an extremely small amount of Valerian so they can charge more for a 'medicinal' product - note the warning that you should not operate machinery.  My advice is spend a dollar less and get yourself regular Sleepytime.  It's a great tea.

I guess I gave it four stars because I like herring so darn much but now that I think about it maybe 3 1/2 stars would be more accurate. I also missed the natural smokey flavor that brands like Bar Harbor have. Certainly none of the cans of Roland I purchased will go undevoured but I will probably either return to a favorite or try another brand or type for my next purchase.

review/text: Good tasting honey. A little expensive considering the amount and price. If you are looking for a tasty alternative, you can't go wrong with this.

review/summary: Still better than the imitators.
review/text: My local stores have not been stocking Red Oval for a while and I ran across a review in the San Francisco Examiner that asserted that expert tasters rated several imitation 'stoned wheat thins" as better than the original.  This is a poor excuse for a blind tasting, but the expert foodies with cast iron palates decided that several imitations were better than the original.<br /><br />Since I have trouble finding Red Oval, I decided to give the ubiquitous Wheatsworth, ranked number two behind Whole Foods, a try. Gag me. They are truly awful. I wouldn't serve them with aerosol Velveeta, let alone a pricey Humboldt Fog. They are chock full of superfluous ingredients, thus failing the Occam's Razor test AND they contain too much salt, sugar, and honey. They had no cracked wheat texture whatever and a mouthfeel more like Graham Crackers. If these were intended to imitate the Red Oval product, they did a darn poor job of it.  I think they are snack crackers and should not be compared to adult food. I guess the tasters liked sweet and salty.<br /><br />So, I did what I had to do.  I threw out the Wheatsworth and ordered a 12-pack of my 35 year favorite, Red Oval Farms Stoned Wheat Thins.

review/summary: crackers
review/text: A grown up cracker. Not too sweet, not too salty. I particularly like them when they are a little overbaked and the edges are a little brown and they have a firmer texture. These crackers go great with strong cheeses and hummus.
