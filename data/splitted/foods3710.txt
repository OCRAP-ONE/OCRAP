review/summary: Great natural organic cocoa
review/text: This is an excellent organic cocoa at a reasonable price.  It takes a little time to get use to if you do not add sugar, but I use it all the time in my coffee.  It is a great way to get chocolate without the fat and sugar.

review/summary: Cocoa for health...
review/text: The Dutch process is a better process since apparently it is suppose to retain more antioxidants than the American process but Dutch is more expensive. I mix the isolate with un-hulled organic sesame seed, organic flax seed, Cocoa, organic soy milk...  The mix is great without any stories...I can not grind sesame seed in the grinder since it is so oily that ruins the grinder and flax seed is the best balancer for grinding. I grind for one week use and keep it in a sealed container in freezer. Regardless of that, I have to consume both seeds due to the high mineral content which is a necessity for my healthy diet. For years I have been doing blood test and my omega-3 has been much higher than the highest level required for my age, year after year. Although I consume fish, it is the flax seed that pushes my omega-3 higher. I consume the mix first thing in the morning before surfing, mountain biking or weight lifting in the evening. Thanks Now Foods.

review/text: I ordered these and I was very excited but when i received them they were all melted into a giant glob on one side of the container and the package was a couple days to a week late after the delivery date i would suggest ordering this product during the winter so they don't all melt like mine did. but they did return my money without a return so i bought a mold off of amazon and reformed them they worked but weren't as sturdy as they woulda been...

review/summary: excellent coffee
review/text: Melitta coffee is an excellent coffee for daily use.  It is a little stronger than most American brands, but your taste quickly adapts to it and you do not want to go back to regular coffee.  To me, Brazilian coffee tastes better than Colombian coffee and is smoother to drink with a good flavor.  I would recommend that anyone try a bag and see for yourself; just use a little less than usual to keep it from being too strong.

review/summary: Healthy, Convenient, Filling
review/text: These muffins are delicious, nutritious, and (best for me) very easy to make! The cinnamon smelled and tasted perfect.  Not overwhelming and not too sweet.<br /><br />They are choc-full of all those really healthy ingredients that should not taste good together, but they do. They may *seem* pricey, but I've tried creating muffin-like-thingees like this on my own and it wasn't cheap. And it wasn't easy. And they didn't taste this good.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit they don't taste like the muffins grandma made. But these won't contribute to heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, either.<br /><br />Be sure to let the wet dough "rest" for 10 minutes per the instructions. I suspect this may be the reason one of the other reviewers reported that his muffins were hard as rocks.

review/text: I think the product description didn't warn me sufficiently that these muffins are almost too healthy.  What really worried me was that they are so high fiber, you have to drink a glass of water with them, and if you eat more than one in a day, you'll probably have stomach problems.  They don't taste great, especially for $10 a batch.  It's too bad, because I had such high hopes for them!

It's a bit more expensive than your standard Ramen because it comes from Asia, but it is well worth the money.  You'll have a hard time going back to the cheap ramen after you've had this.

review/summary: Potent Habanero Hot Sauce
review/text: This Habanero sauce is potent! Only a few drops are needed to add a lot of heat to any dish. The Habanero pepper is very hot so it is hardly a surprise this sauce is quite potent (the habanero chile is likely the hottest pepper you'll ever find in any grocery store).<br /><br />This sauce is OK - It is similar to Tabasco in terms of its potency but I prefer it far more because it has no vinegar and tomatoes have been added to the mix.<br /><br />This sauce is potent, adds a great deal of heat to any dish with just a few drops. It has a very subtle sweet tomato flavor to it and has no vinegar notes. Considerable heat along with a vague hint of some tomato sweetness are its major flavor notes. The tomato taste and its sweetness however are quite subtle.<br /><br />I think this is a good hot sauce but certainly not a great one.  A true 2 or 3 star product. Primarily it delivers heat - and just that!!! Yet it has no real flaws either.<br /><br />Watch out for sellers who offer a low product price combined with high shipping charges.

review/text: This mustard is for people who hate mustard!  It is mild and sweet.  It has won me over to putting mustard on much more than I ever used to--like sandwiches, which I would never do before.  I can't stand the bright yellow mustard that you find in the store, or the taste of regular mustards.<br /><br />I used it to make deviled eggs to bring for a party at work today and was asked for the recipe!  It was just maybe two parts mayonnaise and one part Annie's honey mustard.  They said the eggs were delicious.  Just mayo, a sprinkle of paprika, and Annie's Honey Mustard!

review/text: Before I start, let me say that I am somewhat of a gourmand. Sure, I dont indulge in caviar and foie gras, but I love food. Although my eating habits and conquests are still in their nascent stages, I always jump at a chance to savour some classic specialties. These Walker shortbreads being one of them. I did my research, and found that these were some of the finest shortbreads to be had. After ordering and now having tried them, I can tell you that while they are surely rich and relatively tasty, they are not exactly what I expected. I was hoping for them to be better than any shortbread cookie I have ever tried, but in this respect they didnt live up to my expectations. It is, however, a relatively good accompaniment to some delicious Earl Grey tea.

review/summary: OK Coffee
review/text: I purchased the coffee maker based on being able to get Starbucks. I purchased boxes of Starbucks, Columbian and Breakfast Blend, but am now running low. I decided I would try some others. I hated Grevalia, the Maxwell House is OK coffee, but like drinking flavored water, when I saw the French Roast, which is supposed to be DARK and assumed stronger and fairly inexpensive, I thought I should at least try it. It is hard to replace Starbucks, but the French Roast is OK, not wonderful. I tried the Narob and several different others, but FOR ME this is going to have to be my Starbucks replacement.<br />I had heard that Tassimo was supposed to get a better choice by mid to end of summer and it appears they have fallen short. I had heard that Starbucks was to partner with Cruinart, but so far it's not showing up. I'm not sure these single cup guys are so great, when you are forced to a limited brand of coffees. We are back to Corporate America manipulating our morning cup of wake up.

review/text: The cost is considerably less, however the loss of the Starbuck brand and African Kitamu t-discs was a real downer. I have tried many single serve coffees and Starbucks was the best. I'm sure it has had a negative effect on Bosch single serve coffee maker sales. At this time I'm considering a Nesspresso machine because of the bold, dark coffee blends available.

It's also better than the regular Maxwell House blend, I think it's called House Blend.  I used to buy it directly from Tassimo, but they have gone up a dollar per package so this is the best deal going.  Hope Amazon continues to offer it forever!

review/summary: Great value and taste
review/text: I've been using rendered duck fat from another company that's 4 times as expensive but not any better.  I use it to make a chicken liver pate that convinces even the best palletes that it's duck liver pate.  This is enough duck fat for about 1-2 pounds of raw livers (depending upon your fat tollerance).<br /><br />My secret pate recipe:<br /><br />5 ounces rendered duck fat<br />1 lb chicken livers<br />1 large shallot, peeled and coarsely chopped (2 1/2 tablespoons)<br />1 tsp herbs de Provence (rosemary, marjoram, thyme work well)<br />2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed through a press<br />1 tsp sea salt<br />1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper<br />1 tbs cognac or dry sherry<br />One loaf of 2"x2" rye or pumpernickel bread (look for this at the deli counter)<br />Olive oil<br />Garlic salt<br />Pate: Fry the first six ingredients until the livers are cook thoroughly.  Allow mixture to cool slightly so you don't melt your food processor.  Add cooked mixture to food processer and blend away.  Adjust seasoning and add cognac.  Cool in refrigerator.<br />Bread: Heat oven to 400F.  Coat bread slices with olive oil and place in a single layer on a sheet pan.  Sprinkle with garlic salt.  These cook quickly so check them after 3 minutes.  You want a hard crouton-like doneness.

review/summary: The best cayenne pepper sauce on the market ... bar none!
review/text: I've tried a lot of cayenne pepper sauces over the years, and there are a lot of good ones. But, none of them are as good as this one ... it is the BEST! It's not so hot that it makes it difficult to taste the food that I've put it on (by "numbing" the taste buds as I call it). And it's not so heavy on the vinegar taste either, as some others are. It is PERFECT!!! I've become very disappointed over the last several months to find that our local grocery stores have stopped stocking many of my favorite food items, and unfortunately, this sauce is one of the items they have discontinued selling. I'm so glad to see that Amazon.com is carrying it, because I was afraid I might be enjoying my last bottle of it right now!

review/summary: Delicious and delightful tea for anise appreciators!
review/text: First of all, it should be noted that I REALLY REALLY like anise, fennel, and caraway flavors. For those who aren't familiar with these (and it seems many Americans are not) anise has a similar (but not identical) flavor to licorice, as does fennel (albeit more mildly). Caraway, meanwhile, is the same stuff that a lot of breadmakers add to rye bread to give it that unique zing. If you do not already like these tastes, you will probably find this tea vile, but for those of us who happen to enjoy them, seriously, this stuff is the bee's knees.<br /><br />I've only got one bag left due to the rate I've been drinking it! It really is a lovely after-dinner treat, and in addition to being delicious, the combination of anise, fennel, and caraway is quite soothing to the stomach.<br /><br />The only "negative" about this product, IMO, was the fact that the box was not sealed in plastic film (it was just cardboard, with the teabags in a smaller non-sealed bag inside), which seems like it could result in flavor loss if shipping ends up taking a while. I put the whole box into a Ziploc bag when I opened the package, though, and as far as I can tell, that helped keep the flavors fresh when the stuff was being stored in my cabinet. I didn't so much like paying $8 or whatever it was for shipping a $2 box of tea to the USA from Europe, so I'm going to look around for a domestic source, but I am very happy I ordered it because it has been a tremendously enjoyable beverage (and I never would have thought of mixing caraway with anise, but these tastes do actually play very nicely with one another).

review/summary: one of my favorites of all time
review/text: I drink a lot of tea, I have all kinds ranging from lapsang souchong, jasmine, Darjeeling, Rooibos, bagged tea, loose tea (uptontea.com or adagio teas, Twinings, etc). Overall, this is probably my favorite bagged tea, hands down. I love Earl Grey, but I was getting tired of it. I would usually buy 100 bags of Twinings earl grey tea just cause I drank 3-5 bags a day. I picked up lady grey on a gamble, along with several other Twinings teas. I never had it before, and was curious to see what it tasted like. Needless to say for years now it has been one of my favorites. It's very smooth, I love the added bergamot/citrus flavor. To me this tea is light, fruity, delicate, and just tastes great. I am not really good with tasting notes and all that jazz. I just love tea. Do yourself a favor, give this one a try. I have been drinking tea since I was in Kindergarten, my mother would give me red rose tea for breakfast with my toast and I have been a tea addict ever since.

This tea would be best described as a "mellow" tea, among black teas that I have tried.  I get just a hint of orange but not enough to say it is orange flavored.  I tried to find it in stores here but I live in a rural area and the grocery stores here are limited.  Couldn't wait for a trip to the city and found that Amazon had a great price on it.  I was a little daunted by having to order 6 boxes, but they way I am drinking it, I will have to reorder in no time.

review/summary: great tea
review/text: This tea is great because you don't have to add milk to it.  I read that adding milk negates the health benefits of tea.  It's not as strong as Earl Grey, it has just enough flavor but isn't like drinking perfume.  Earl Grey tastes like drinking cheap cologne, this doesn't.

review/summary: Pleasing citrus flavor
review/text: I first tasted Lady Grey tea in a Twinings sampler box and after 1 cup of this tea I went back to the store to buy a box of it.  It's got a lovely, pleasing taste.  It has more prominent citrus notes than Earl Grey, but is overall less intense in flavor and doesn't get bitter as quickly.  I like to have a variety of tea flavors around since I tend to drink two to four cups of tea per day at work and like to switch things up a bit, but this is the one tea that fits every mood and helps to melt some of my stress away.  When in doubt, I go with Lady Grey, and I am never disappointed.  I've shared Lady Grey with some of my fellow tea-drinkers at work and it has been a universal hit.

review/summary: Unique Taste!  Absolutely delicious!
review/text: I love this tea.  It has a hint of citrus that is not overpowering.  It is a nice refreshing alternative to regular English Breakfast or Earl Grey.  It is not too heavy and a find it very difficult to over steep.  It can be difficult to find on grocery store shelves so I have been purchasing it through a subscribe and save membership with Amazon.

review/summary: Lady Gray is a great tea for those short moments of personal comfort.
review/text: This tea always makes me feel as soothed and rewarded as a great piece of chocolate. The ever so slight citrus aroma and taste triggers pleasant fleeting thoughts of vacations, tropics, the beach-- I love it. My husband is now a fan as I started adding one of these plus his "cold brew" ice tea bag for his pitcher of ice tea and he raves about how great it tastes. Thanks Twinings & Amazon!

review/summary: So very comforting!
review/text: I've only recently discovered Twinings Lady Grey, and fell in love with it immediately. This is the tea I drink when I'm having a bad day and need some soothing and comfort, like a mother's cuddle; it always does the trick. I cannot stand earl greys in general, finding them too strong and the aroma/taste too obnoxious and perfumey (like I'm sipping a bottle of cologne). That's not the case here; the black tea base is mild, (just right, not weak), and the citrus & spices aroma is pure yumminess. (As it turns out, Twinings Earl Grey tastes almost as good, IF you let it steep for a few seconds only. The Lady Grey can steep forever and there is no problem.) I'm a bit of a loose tea snob, but not so much that I don't have some bagged teas in my collection as well. Now I'm dying to try the loose version in a tin!

This is my favorite tea-much lighter than earl grey-milder with a slight fruit or citrus undertone. It is my favorite and everyone who tries it LOVES LADY GREY! Perfect with teacakes or desserts!

review/summary: Totally Delicious
review/text: Teas such as this Lady Grey are the reason that Twinings is one my favorite tea brands. The flavor is lighter and more delicate than the often overpowering Earl Grey, with none of the tannins and acidity of Earl either.<br /><br />What is left is a smooth easy drinking tea with hints of citrus and a light floral flavor. Quite excellent on a hot summer afternoon with a bit of lemon, or sweetened with just sugar.

review/text: I discovered Lady Grey tea when I was on vacation in Paris. My cousin lives there, and served it every morning with fresh warm baggguette and fruit jelly.<br /> It has a very light and slightly citrus flavor that goes with everything. Now every time I smell it or taste it , I'm Back in Paris. It's wonderful. I live in a small town so the stores only stock the most popular and basic flavors of tea, so getting it on the internet in two days is great!

review/summary: What a pleasant surprise!
review/text: I was reluctant to try Twinings Lady Grey tea because though I don't dislike it, Earl Grey is not a particular favorite. I do however like citrus and was in the mood for a lighter tea so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />I really like Lady Grey! It is wonderful hot and quite refreshing when chilled, especially on hot summer days. If you find the bergamot in Earl Grey overwhelming you might want to try this one. It also has bergamot but it is much more subtle. Twinings considers Lady Grey to be a light tea, and I can drink it in the evenings without it interfering in any way with my ability to sleep. I prefer all teas black and unsweetened and this has a slightly sweet taste as is.<br /><br />I drink a *lot* of tea and I make sure this one is always on hand; it has a unique taste that I enjoy very much. Give it a try--you might like it too.

review/text: The Lady Grey Tea from Twinings is probably my favorite tea to drink anytime of the day. I know that the only thing that distinguishes it from Earl Grey Tea is that there is bergamot & citrus notes of oranges & lemons added to the mix. I can always find time to sit down and enjoy a cup of Lady Grey tea. I even like the tea so much that I can have it with some milk or drink it straight with some sugar. This is my favorite black tea to drink. In my opinion there is no other black tea like this one.

review/summary: Twinings "Lady Grey" 300th anniversary tea
review/text: Twinings developed this tea last year (2006) for their 300th anniversary - a counterpart to their famous "Earl Grey" product.  "Lady Grey" has the distinctive Earl Grey flavor but with just a hint of floral.  It has become my family's favorite tea.  We can no longer get it in our stores but is easily available on-line from Twinings.  A wonderful product!
