review/text: Actually, the dried shrimp needs to be softened first. You wouldn't need to worry about its shell. It needs to be soaked in water for 15-30 minutes. Its ready when its soft enough to be easily chopped up. Then it can be used in stir fry. The price here is ridiculously expensive. It should only be around $2-$3 at an asian market.

review/text: I purchased with the idea to use in my stir fries and fried rice for vibrant flavoring, but I didn't realize it had the shell on them yet so I had to hand clean those tiny little shrimp to use as intended.  They tasted OK, but more trouble than I anticipated for my needs.

review/summary: Good...but not the best
review/text: This is my third order of Turkish pistachios from three different vendors. As with the two previous orders, the nuts are good, but not the freshness or quality I experienced on my many trips to Turkey. At first I thought I was being too harsh in my assessment, heck Turkey is what 5500 miles away. But, on second thought , why shouldn't I expect a better quality nut? Yes, time is a factor in nut freshness, but how long should/does it take to get these nuts from Turkey? Or maybe they are keeping the best ones for themselves, I would. Anyway, out of 5 pounds we are about  half way through them as I write this review. The nuts are very lightly salted, which is perfect for me. The shell color is a perfect tan. Nut color has been the typical light/med green to an undesirable yellow/tan/brown, with the ratio being 50/50. The texture is, as expected, better with the green nut than the yellowish nut, which tends to be much drier, and powdery. One of the things you will find with Turkish pistachios are un-cracked shells. Trying to crack one is not easy, it fact they tend to shatter. So far, this batch has only yielded 4 or five un-cracked shells, pretty good. Would I buy again? YES, though they are not up to my expectations, they are still better than the California variety.

review/summary: A real surprise, beats the expensive Keurig K-cup brands
review/text: I bought a used Keurig K-70 single cup coffee maker from an Amazon seller and was pleased at the taste and quality of the brews but found the darker Keurig brews a bit strong and bitter. Also, the K-cup brews cost me about 60 cents per cup, a better price per cup than Starbucks, but not as well flavored.  I started washing out and re-using the K-cups with the little aftermarket clear plastic covers and they work great, allowing me to re-fill with other coffees.<br /><br />I worked my way through many coffee brands at around $6 to $10 per K-cup pack or 10-oz can, but none were exceptional. (stay away from the WalMart house brands or you'll be sorry.) I had bought a 10-oz can of Cafe Bustelo at the local Dollar Store for about $3.60 because it was so cheap, but put off getting into it until the others were used up. Frankly, I waited because I was expecting something really bad, considering the low price. ... WOW, was I wrong! ... It was by far the best of the lot and I'm hooked. ... Nearing the bottom of the first can I started looking for a replacement,  assuming finding another can would be simple but couldn't find one anywhere in town, including WalMart, so I'm ordering a slightly higher priced (plus shipping) four-pack of 10-oz cans from Amazon. ... Not because it's so cheap but because of the nutty, roasted, non-acid full-flavor. ... I refill a K-cup with Bustelo but don't pack it tightly before putting the little after market lid on. It probably costs me about 6-cents per cup now for excellent custom brew coffee.<br /><br />cheers!

review/text: This is espresso. In a can. Yes, a can. Is it as good as the place on a Seattle street corner that custom orders, roasts, and brews? No, absolutely not, there's no comparison. But it is better than anything you can buy in a grocery store and perhaps Amazon. Full flavored, loaded with caffeine. It has a rich warm nutty and and somewhat chocolaty flavor. Perfect for those of us who cannot get to or afford that hand-crafted espresso on a daily basis. It also happens to be perfectly ground for my espresso machine.<br /><br />I love this stuff.

review/summary: It's "Meh..."
review/text: I bought this locally for roughly the same price as here on amazon.<br /><br />I make "Espresso" using a stovetop pot or "moka" if you please, as well as my Aeropress.<br />For my Aeropress I use 185 degree water.<br /><br />I am an espresso person, at least the "espresso" that can be made with the above two devices. I really love a good cup of strong, flavorful coffee.<br /><br />I think an underlyign problem with coffees branded "espresso" is that they tend to be deep dark roasts, that put out a bitter aftertaste by nature. I've tried cooler water in the Aeropress, but it still comes out with that espresso...tangy bite at the end that makes you want to cringe after every sip.<br /><br />If you really want good coffee to be used in an espresso pot or maker, I would recommend just grinding down your already favorite coffee to the espresso powder, and brew with that.<br /><br />That being said, I rate this a 3 because it IS a good base for making flavored coffee drinks, because the flavor is so strong that it won't be masked by milk or flavors, giving you a pretty well rounded vanilla cappuccinol or just traditional cappuccino.<br /><br />So, overall, would not buy again, as I do not usually make espresso into specialty drinks, but rather I like it plain.  For this purpose...the flavor qualities of Cafe Bustelo are not up to par.

Bustelo produces nice crema, I enjoy the robust flavor and the price through Amazon is more than okay.  I can't get it locally, and I used to buy it direct through Rowland (javacabana.com), but some sloppy and indifferent internet sales forced me to give up on going through the Rowland online store.  It's much safer to go through Amazon, and getting issues addressed in a professional manner ... this is what Amazon does.  I enjoy Bustelo, and Amazon provides the service one would expect.

I was pleasantly surprised because at three ninety-nine a can I figured this would be a cheap-tasting brand.  It's not.<br /><br />Although it lacks the crema associated with Italian espressos, my cappuccino tasted quite good and robust, resembling a Starbuck's cup but at a much more affordable price. It was so robust I didn't need my usual second cup.<br /><br />Although this coffee doesn't have the flavor of a Lavazzo I would still recommend this brand for those who appreciate a strong cup of coffee in the morning.  Prepare it according to directions.  This coffee is made for "Latin tastes" and that means strong and bold.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this coffee is still cheaper at my local grocers than through Amazon, even with the ridiculously high 8.8% sales tax here in Arizona.

(i use honey). caf&eacute; bustelo, consider i, as one of the best. had i my druthers, i would have purchased the decaffeinated version. this, however, was not available at a reasonable price. incidentally, decaffeinated coffee isn't: it simply contains one half the usual amount of caffeine, while preserving the full bouquet of taste and aroma, if properly roasted. i had ordered, through amazon, the 4 ten-ounce bricks, not the cans, which, for some reason, are currently shown as unavailable. they arrived in a timely manner, with a 'best by' date one year and eleven months into the future. to my taste, another top brand is 'el aguilar'. i don't like 'pilon'. there are quite a few other brands of cuban or espresso coffee on the market which i am yet to sample. maybe you'll be the one to try them as well.<br />enjoy!

review/summary: Is this a can or an ashtray?
review/text: Cafe Bustelo releases a stale, pungent aroma when the can's seal is broken: you are forewarned by an odor reminiscent of Maxwell House or perhaps Folger's that has been ground together with cigarette butts.  Draw a demitasse of espresso and you can either 1) dissolve the enamel off your teeth by drinking it or 2) water it down to Americano strength where it will merely taunt you, daring you to drink it even when you know you shouldn't.  This is honestly the worst espresso I've ever tasted.  No body, excessive acidity and bitterness, unpleasant chemical aftertaste.  Yes, it's cheap - but the more important question is: are you?

review/summary: Used For Years and Love It!
review/text: I have been using this seasoning for years. The seasoning itself comes on one side of the packet and a bag for cooking the wings on the other. So this and the wings are all you have to have.<br /><br />The unique taste is delicious!  I prefer this mild mix and eat cheese with the hot wings.  And, although there aren't microwave instructions included, that is my personal favorite way of preparing them.  It can vary, per microwave of course, but it can take anywhere from 13-20 minutes to cook them depending on the wattage and the size of wings.  When serving to others I have found some preferred the oven method(instuctions are on the packet).<br /><br />I used to be able to find this in some of the dollar stores, but no more. My local grocery does have these, but the price listed here on Amazon, for the volume, saves about five dollars.

review/summary: The Best Oatmeal Flour
review/text: For those with Celiac disease or anyone for that matter, this flour is excellent. It is certified gluten free and does not raise your ttG. Only .07% of celiac's will react to avenin in oats. I am convinced that it is still cross contamination from non-dedicated facilities where people say they react to oats or there are other reasons for reactivity. You can use this flour in any recipe you would use a wheat or other flour. The approximate ratio is 1 1/3 of oatmeal flour to 1 cup of wheat. Experiment for the consistency you need. It will also absorb a bit more liquid than wheat flour. You MUST add 1 tsp. xantham gum per 3 cups of oat flour as a binder. Oat flour makes superior pancakes, waffles, shortcake, cookies, I could go on and on. Again, just  substitute as above with xantham gum and you won't be disappointed. Don't waste your time on those breads and cookies at the store that are expensive, fall apart and taste like sand.  Thank you Bob's Red MIll.

review/text: If you need a gluten free Oat Flour that works well for Gluten Free bread-- this is a good choice. It mixes up well with other gluten free flours, and produces a loaf of bread the tasters rave about. You will have to add a bit more liquid to the bread recipe-- as this flour absorbs more liquid compared to other gluten free flours.

review/summary: Excellent Low GI Carb Source For Shakes/Smoothies
review/text: If your focus is health and nutrition you can't go wrong with this product.<br /><br />One of the first rules of sports nutrition is oats for breakfast.  Many people, like myself, either don't like the texture or taste of traditionally prepared oats, or simply prefer the convenience of 'mass gainer' shakes.  After doing my research, I'm convinced the myth of 'powdered' vs 'whole' grains affecting GI is insignificant.  Oat flour still retains the soluble fiber of whole oats, preserving its valued low glycemic properties.<br /><br />This product allows you to make a great shake that has all the health benefits of steel cut or rolled oats as a hot cereal.<br /><br />I prefer the following simple shake:<br /><br />2-4 ice cubes<br />1/2 cup oat flour<br />1 scoop vanilla whey protein (25g protein)<br />1 cup liquid egg whites (pasteurized and safe for raw consumption, 25g protein)<br />1/2 cup mixed frozen fruit (strawberries, bananas, peaches)<br />add water to the blending cup fill line (I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000ZP3LQ">Tribest Personal Blender PB-100 Blender</a> with 16oz cups)<br /><br />This is a tasty, healthy, highly nutritious, protein rich, low GI carb breakfast.

review/summary: Organic tomatoes in a BPA lined can! Why?!
review/text: I used to buy two cans of this sauce every week because it was affordable, tastes good and organically grown. I was shocked when I learned that the cans are lined with Bisphenol A (BPA)! I called the company directly and they confirmed this. I can't understand why they would use organic tomatoes and then package them this way. I told them that until they change this I would no longer buy their products. In the meantime I switched to Newman's Own organic sauce in a jar. Granted it's not fat-free but I'd rather have some olive oil than BPA.<br /><br />Muir Glen please change your packaging!

review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

Amazon kindly sent me a replacement. It just arrived, and 5 of the 12 cans are severely dented.

I have tried many other brands of peanut butter, some more expensive, many that were less expensive, but Maranatha Organic Peanut Butter is my favorite by far. What separates this peanut butter from the rest of the pack is that it's creaminess & its incredible peanutty flavor- absolutely perfect! Peanut butter lovers, once you try this variety, you will stop eating anything else! Yum!<br />Note: I am not a fan of Maranatha no-stir peanut butter, nor their other no-stir nut butters; the no-stir varieties taste incredibly strange & unnatural.

The peppermint compliments the medication so well, these not only WORK better than any other flavor, but they actually TASTE decent too - like a really strong breath mint.<br /><br />Cough drops, by nature, are going to taste minty one way or another, so why fight it?<br /><br />Usage suggestion: Smash one so it'll dissolve quicker and stir the pieces into some hot chocolate. The result is a great mint-chocolate flavor and a cup of cocoa that will help ANY sore throat.

review/summary: I'm impressed
review/text: I admit it, I've been a bad momma and my 3 year old Yorkie's dental health could be better. After a recommendation from a friend, I went out and got a few of the individually packaged ones just to make sure because my pup is a bit of a snot about what she eats. Much to my surprise, she ran off with her Greenie and hid under the chair so the other dogs couldn't steal it from her! It wasn't until weeks later that I observed the ingredients list. Shock of all shocks, my little carnivore is totally into these and there isn't a HINT of any sort of meat in them. Other treats have been snubbed, biscuits go uneaten and the money we spent on treats is invariably NOT worth it. Greenies changed that completely!<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the steep price. I'm grateful to have such a little dog because I get more bang for my buck, but they're worth it. And it's probably much wiser to buy them here in bulk for a dog who's getting them daily. The vet also says these are pretty high in calories, but as our dog is 3 pounds and doesn't eat much anyway, I think these suit her well.

review/text: This is my first review ever.....i had to write one......why? because GREENIES are THE best!!<br /><br />I have a 4 year old Shih Tzu, and like any other dog, he loves dog treats.  The problem is a lot of treats are bad for dogs, and they make him have diahrrea or he throws up.  Well Greenies don't do that to him!  I've given him at least 10 in the past 2 weeks, i give him basically one every other day as a special treat for being a good boy.  He's a good boy a lot! haha<br /><br />Anyway, when i pull out the bag of Greenies, he hears it, he sees it, and goes BONKERS when i open the bag because his keen nose can pick up the scent of what is about to be a delicious treat!<br /><br />If you aren't sure about what treat to buy your dog, look no further, this is THE treat to buy!

review/text: Well, they have an ok flavor..  but it's the seeds that do them in...  Very hard.  Now I love crunchy food... but these are teeth breaking crunchy..  I was getting them for the whole family, but I seriously doubt my kids will be able to chew them...  Don't think I'll be buying them again...

review/summary: You either love 'em or hate 'em.
review/text: As you might be able to tell by other reviews, this is a snack that you either love or despise.<br /><br />I personally love these pretzel sticks; They have a fantastic crunch to them, and I like the texture of having larger seeds (flax, millet, quinoa, etc.) intact to crunch on their own.  There's just enough salt on them so that they are pleasantly tart but not overwhelming.  They are also extremely healthy and relatively filling.<br /><br />Some dislike the taste - a friend said they tasted like baking soda.  Many complain about how hard they are - and they are very, very crunchy and some are a bit tough.  But if neither of these bother you, you may end up addicted... like me.<br /><br />The bottom line: go buy them in your local Whole Foods or Wegmans before ordering a whole 12 bags.  That being said, if you do in fact like them, you will, in all likelihood, find yourself back here buying them in bulk.

review/summary: Best gluten free pretzel
review/text: These are quite crunchy- but i think a pretzel should be. I love these b/c they're not oily or greasy and have a lighter salty taste. The ingredients are great (nothing refined or yucky). They don't taste like the pasty refined flour pretzels but have the whole grain and seed taste.

review/text: Well, they ARE crunchy--except for the seeds that are so hard they don't crunch. And maybe they are healthy, but I do not find the taste attractive.  It's not bad, for sticks and twigs, but I prefer more flavor, in this case, more salt.  Maybe some garlic to bring out the grain flavors?  These really remind me of some of the organic snacks in the 70's--you eat them because they are good for you, but you'd really rather have something else.  I'll stick to Beanitos.

review/text: This is about as healthty as you can get when it comes to "snacks".  I like to dip them in almond butter for some added protein.  I would rate them a five but like all the Mary's products, they are fragile and you end up with too many small pieces in the bottom of the bag.

review/summary: VERY crunchy
review/text: I'm actually chomping on the curry flavored version of these as I write this, and disagree with the individual who thought bird-seed preferable (not that I have anything against birdseed as he/she apparently does!) I'm always looking for snacks that satisfy the need for crunching and are flavorful without being overly salty, not made with oils (i.e. peanut, soy, canola), and seem to have good stuff in them (these includes amaranth, flax seed, quinoa, brown rice, millet, and chia seed with the curry and sea salt). The name isn't appealing but I find them tasty and VERY crunchy. In fact, they're probably not for people with loose fillings in their teeth! My only issue with these is that, for my taste, they could be a tad lighter on the salt - but I still enjoy them.

review/text: We have a son that has issues with gluten and dairy. These are great. They are both gluten and dairy free and they are crunchy, tasty and convenient. We take these along with us all the time in my son's bag. He's a somewhat picky 2 year old and he loves them and so do we. The only problem is, I wish they were a bit cheaper. But, like most gluten free foods, they cost a lot. I also wish they offered a larger bag.

review/summary: Sticks and Twigs is an accurate description
review/text: A prior reviewer stated "you won't be able to eat just one". I think they meant "you'll barely be able to eat them"<br /><br />I'm a curry lover and purchased the curry flavor from a local store. It is really hard to describe these, but they truly are quite unpleasant. Nobody in the house will eat them. They are rock hard, and I can only imagine that a handful of bird seed with some curry powder would taste the same. Given the price difference between bird seed and these, I know which I would purchase if I wanted a similar experience in the future.

review/text: I found these shortly after I discovered my 3 kids have developed a sensitivity to wheat. Finding healthy gluten free snacks is tricky but finding gluten free snacks that the kids actually like is trickier. They love these plain right out of the bag or with dip or hummus. So do I! I can't find them anywhere near us so I am glad that Amazon has made them accessible. They are more flavorful than regular pretzels. With healthy seeds as ingredients, you won't be able to eat just one.

review/summary: Acquired taste, but oh so addictive.
review/text: I decided to try these after reading a blurb about them in our newspaper.  It's hard to compare them to pretzels, other than the shape.  I'm so-so about pretzels (I find them boring), but these are anything but boring.  The crunch is absolutely addictive.  Even my husband, who is less than forgiving about "healthy food that tastes too healthy", loves them.  We bought a second bag at the grocery store (4.49 per bag) before deciding that buying them by the case (at 3.46 per bag) was definitely the way to go.  My only hesitation in doing so was wondering how far out the expiration dates would go.  I'm hoping that the expiration date on the shipment of 12 is at least 2 to 3 months in the future.  Don't let me down, Amazon!

review/text: If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product.  We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most.  This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks.  It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes and muffins.  We even found a diabetic powder that you can mix with ice, fresh strawberries, some of this flavoring, and skim milk and then blend into a dietetic strawberry shake.  If you freeze your strawberries and add in a little Splenda� then the taste is really good.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found.  They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!
