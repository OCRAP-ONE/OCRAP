review/summary: Unexpected for a NY cheddar
review/text: The cheese has a very creamy texture, even for a NY cheddar that I would put more in line with Gouda. Typically aged cheddars seem sharp with a hint of cream but this had a very strong chocolate overtone which is the unexpected part and followed by the typical creaminess. It's pretty unique if you're new to aged or exotic cheeses. I would say this cheese pairs well with an aged Riesling or a milk stout if you prefer beer.<br /><br />I ate it straight but think this would go well on a saltier cracker or toast.

review/summary: Expired expiration date
review/text: Love this tea. First bought it when I was in England. The disappointing thing about my purchase is the expiration date on the tea box expired last year. When you pay that amount for "imported tea" I expect it to be fresh. It still taste ok but you never know, it was great when I first got it in England. Doesn't quite taste the same..Will not buy from this supplier again. Will have my daughter's friend ship it to me first!

review/summary: A long-time favorite
review/text: I've been drinking this tea for about a decade now, buying it first at a Russian specialty store in Washington Heights, NYC.  It's similar to Earl Grey in that it's a Bergamot tea, but it has a distinct flavor of its own.  I generally drink it unsweetened, but it also takes sugar and milk well.  The packaging is old school without the excess of packaging each individual bag, but I've found the flavor to stay constant through the last bag from the box.  My personal favorite above many teas I keep in the house, definitely recommended.

review/text: I've been quitting coffee for a while and moving over to tea,  I started with Ahmad teas when I got a gift box of 4 teas for my birthday (English breakfest, Earl Grey, English Tea #1, and darjeling)  This was my personal favorite out of the box and I love having a nice cup of it waiting at work for me every morning. (Its nice to not have to drink the nasty office coffee and my coworkers cant steal it like they do with my lunch)  Its smooth and not to bitter, just right for a good cup of tea without sweeteners like I take it.  Also no coffee breath!!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: There's a time when you simply don't want to drink a tea with any flavor in it at all. For the past few months I've been drinking all sorts of flavored tea: Earl Grey, Earl Grey with vanilla, tea with berry, tea with mango. Then I got tired of drinking flavored tea and decided to try this.<br /><br />This was actually a gift. I didn't want to open it at first because the packaging was kind of dowdy. But I wanted to try a tea without any extraneous flavors at all and decided to try it anyway.<br /><br />The result surprised me. This was a very full bodied tea with a very strong taste. It was very good and just what I needed after drinking all that flavored tea; finally a strong tea without any berries or anything.<br /><br />So, if a very strong tasting tea is what you want, I highly recommend this.

review/summary: Still loving it
review/text: The bad first:<br />The tea bags were not individually wrapped.  I've bought a box of 100 tea bags before and they were individually wrapped within the box, but these were not.  Also, while most of the tea bags are consistent in potency, there are some outliers. So far, i've probably consumed 25 tea bags, but i would say that at least 1 or 2 of them were flukes (meaning they were weirdly not as potent as usual) and i had to remake my tea.<br /><br />The good:<br />Despite the little issues mentioned above, i continue to love this tea.  I used to drink English breakfast tea but now i just drink this one, which is not as harsh and more fragrant.  I discovered them about 5 years ago and Ahmed's English Tea #1 is still my favorite, and i am an avid tea drinker.  True, loose leaf teas are generally more aromatic and strong, but when you don't have a lot of time in the morning, this is my go-to tea.  So glad i found them online b/c i no longer live near the store where i used to purchase them.

I always drink my tea in a large handled glass mug and this tea easily tastes good all the way through.  No bitter ends.  I gave up on all the ceramic mugs because they give the tea a different flavor.  I know that the glass mugs are pure and have never had coffee in them.  I will definitely order this item again.

review/summary: Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, 100TB ~ The Most Exquisite Earl Grey I've Ever Tasted
review/text: I first came across Ahmad Earl Grey Tea a number of years ago, while I was visiting a friend who lives out in Seaford, Long Island (NY). I was waiting for her to meet me in a mall, there, & I just happened into a Mideastern grocery-deli to browse and look at the great variety of exotic foods & spices they had for sale.<br /><br />By & by, I started getting thirsty & asked the shopkeeper whether he had cups of hot tea for sale. He showed me the varieties of tea they had & I chose Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, since Earl Grey has been my favorite ever since I was introduced to it back in the late '70s by an English friend of mine, who would prepare it with milk or cream & sugar or honey.<br /><br />Well, I had had excellent cups of Earl Grey tea in the past -- Twinings, Bigelow, Island-Rose & others -- but nothing I had previously tasted had fully prepared me for the sublimely fragrant, yet delicate & nuanced bouquet of aroma & flavor that literally "took me by surprise" upon my first sip of Ahmad Earl Grey Tea... aroma & flavor that was not just a simple one-dimensional taste but one that seemed to unfold as you drank it, revealing delightfully unexpected subtleties, layers & shades of enchantingly fragrant aromas & flavors.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the high quality of the tea leaves & the bergamot used to impart the flavor were clearly distinguishable to me in the tea's unmistakably delightful yet delicate aroma, not only when opening the box of 100 tea bags, or the individual envelopes containing the bags of tea... but quite detectable, in the tea bag itself, even after having made a cup of tea or two, making me wonder whether they might have discovered some very effective, secret manner of infusing the bergamot aroma into the tea leaves, or the tea bag, such that the aroma didn't dissipate after having made a cup of tea, or even while standing on the shelf of the grocery, as I've noticed sometimes happens with lesser grades of Earl Grey tea.<br /><br />In any event, after such an incomparable experience with Ahmad Earl Grey Tea, it is the only Earl Grey tea that I choose to drink, unless I happen to be out somewhere where it is, unfortunately, not available.<br /><br />It is at such times that I am so appreciative to have come across Ahmad Earl Grey Tea.<br /><br />Though I often purchase it at Mideastern food markets, for instance in Astoria, Queens, where it is readily available at rock-bottom prices & fresh from the importers, nevertheless, for those of you who are too far away to do so, the fact that it is available here on Amazon.com is already quite a boon, especially if you order a number of packages of it to lessen the impact of the shipping charges.<br /><br />If you do order Ahmad Earl Grey Tea & try it, I'm quite sure that you'll find that it soon becomes for you, as it has for me, "a most exquisite delight, definitely not to be missed!"

review/summary: Astringent aftertaste, no foil or paper packaging
review/text: I really enjoy Ahmad English tea #1, so I tried thier Earl Grey. It has an astringent aftertaste, is too strong, and this particular box has no individual packaging to seal the flavor in. I prefer not to use foil wrapped products for environmental reasons but these packets need to be in an airtight container so as not to loose thier flavor. I really cannot taste much bergamot which is what I enjoy about an Earl Grey. Also, it smells too perfumey for me. I'll stick to Twinings Earl Grey.

review/text: I am a regular purchaser of the Holistic Select dog snacks, but saw these biscuits when I ordered last and decided to give them a try.  All four of my japanese chin loved these treats, though they still seem to go more wild for the regular dog treats.  I can cut the dog treats into smaller pieces, while the biscuits tend to crumble more if I try to cut them to smaller portions.  However, these seem to have more teeth cleaning ability than the regular treats.  I am happy with this purchase and will definitely keep them on hand as an alternative snack!

review/summary: Daisy Loves These More Than Hot Dogs!
review/text: I like to feed my dog healthy stuff but one dog trainer wanted me to bring "high currency" treats so I bought some hot dogs and Daisy certainly enjoyed them.<br /><br />However, she actually goes nuts over the Holistix way more than she ever did for hot dogs and I'm happier feeding them to her. And they're not so stinky to carry around, and not perishable either.<br /><br />Daisy is about 14 pounds and I break the Holistix into 3 or 4 pieces. It's a little crumby but that way she gets several treats over the course of the day. I use these to help motivate her not to bark at dogs that we pass on our walk. When I mention "treat" she starts dancing on her hind legs walking backwards sometimes half a block in anticipation of one little morsel of Holistix!<br /><br />I have been buying the Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples, and Blueberries variety. I think we tried another variety once and it was OK but mostly I've just stuck with these. On amazon they are listed as "Menhaden Fish Meal." That is what is listed as the fourth ingredient right before "whitefish." I knew it was the right item by the blue label area and the picture of the bag. Previously I had bought them elsewhere.<br /><br />These are not cheap but if you break them up like I do and ration them out, as you should with all treats, a bag lasts quite a while.

review/text: I like a good chocolate chip cookie.  I LOVE shortbread cookies.  I did not care so much for these.  While I liked the salt added for a savory /sweet combo, I did not care for the chocolate bits.  Perhaps someone who loves dark chocolate will really enjoy this cookie.  However, the cookie chocolate left an unpleasant cocoa type aftertaste in my mouth and the nibs were a bit bitter for my taste enjoyment.  That may be, in part, due to fact I prefer milk or semisweet chocolate over dark chocolate and cocoa type.<br /><br />Not for me - I prefer a sweet treat that is sweet over one that is mildly sweet and mildly bitter.<br /><br />The Rustic products (in my experience) are quite excellent - and I feel many will enjoy this cookie if they have a palate for dark chocolates.<br /><br />Christine

I'm not a huge fan of this specific flavor.<br /><br />Like all of the other Annie Chun products I've consumed, this one is no exception in having a nicely sized portion, excellent noodles, and being the ONLY product I've ever consumed that had dehydrated vegetables that actually tasted/felt like they were fresh once re-hydrated.<br /><br />What is keeping this from being 4-5 stars is that the Teriyaki sauce is just terrible. I truly cannot imagine how people can say it's "delicious". It doesn't even taste like Teriyaki. I'm eating my last bowl of it right now, and I would say the flavor just tastes like terribly seasoned soy sauce.<br /><br />Overall, I would give the noodles/veges/portion size 5 stars, and the sauce 2 stars (generously).

review/summary: Disgusting Never Again
review/text: I bought a package of these noodles and one from simply Asia brand. I tried the simply Asia ones first and they were so gross I had to throw them out. I was still hungry and decided to go for the Auntie Chuns but that was it. The noodles are so nasty they smell like plastic and I don't know why they call it teriyaki flavor if all it tastes like is soy sauce with extra sodium. I would rather eat ramen noodles for a month than have to eat one of these again. I am definitely staying away from Asian microwaveable foods.

review/summary: Dreadful.  A salty bowl of dreadfulness.
review/text: Okay.  I have to admit that I usually don't eat processed/pre-packaged foods.  However, I was desperate for something for lunch and picked something that looked halfway decent.  After picking myself up off the floor after looking at the sodium content, I decided to just go for it.  I would just limit my sodium intake at dinner this evening.  I only used half of the teriyaki (?) sauce and my lips are still puckered.  There are so few veggies in the dish that I don't know why they even bothered to put them in there in the first place.<br /><br />Never, ever again.  I'll stick with Amy's instead of Annie's.

review/summary: Practically no veggies; just noodles and sauce
review/text: I agree with Audes, the picture on the front amounts to misrepresentation.  Even calling the tiny amount of dried veggies in the packet "topping" is stretching it.  And the procedure for draining the water from the bowl (in which I lost yet more of the topping) is downright dangerous.  The noodles and sauce taste fine, but there's nothing to the product but that, for all practical purposes.  Will not purchase again.

review/summary: The Best Instant Noodle Meals You Can Buy!
review/text: Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that "crunch" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)

review/text: For a fast alternative to junk food this was hearty, easy to prepare and fast. I would have liked to see more vegtables in it. It enclosed a tiny vegi season packet and terriyaki sauce(sweet). Flavor was good but if you pour this sauce on ramen noodles, they would taste good. Why 4 stars? I like the way the noodles are packaged. I bought this a grocery store and would not buy again or buy this on Amazon. I ended up throwing some chopped up noodles in mine.

review/summary: Not excited about this!
review/text: This soup has two specific directions for cooking, with microwave or without microwave.  Although the directions for preparing are rather simple, dealing with it was not easy.  I cooked it in the microwave, and the bowl, if very hot, is rather cumbersome to hold onto.  Draining it is a problem, and you may need protection.<br /><br />The bowl of soup nutrition facts claim 200 calories, total fat 2.5, and Ogm of saturated or trans fat.  Sodium is high, 440 it contains 38gm of carbohydrate.  I purchased it for the lack of fat.<br /><br />You can add chicken, tofu, stir fried vegetables, and fresh chopped vegetables.  Keep in mind that the meal comes with a small packet of dried tofu, carrots and spinach topping.  The vegetable packet consists of very small pieces, and dry and dehydrated!  Not very appetizing.<br /><br />There is an odd flavor and consistency with the noodles, and the sauce was not all that tasty or flavorful!  First impressions are critical, and I'm not sure I would try other Annie Chun's dishes, and I will not crave the Teriyaki Noodle Bowl.  ....Rizzo

review/text: This is terrible food. It tastes like chemicals... even the thick 'teriyaki' sauce they give you can't hide the noxious flavor. On top of that it is so grossly over packaged I actually felt bad trying to get to the food, yet on the back they say they're "saving the earth one bowl at a time". I looked for further information on this magical plastic bowl, but found none, and they invite you to donate 19 cents, but fail to mention their donations to this cause. Classic "green" company, all marketing, no substance and making more bad food for people to digest. I don't know about the other products, but the Teriyaki Bowl is awful. No debating that.

review/summary: Noodle sause has bad taste
review/text: Although the shipping was quick, the taste of the actual product did not appeal to me.  The sauce packets used in these noodles (and all of their other products, it very similar) was not very good.  It was too sour and had a distinct off-flavor. I ended up not even putting in any of the sauce packets just to finish the carton off. I prefer the noodle bowls and ramin sold in supermarkets to any of the Annie Chun noodles, and the store bought versions are much cheaper, but may not be as healthy.

review/text: My husband can't get enough of these very unusual snacks. They are whole wheat and are shaped to look like twigs...hence the name. The flavour is a quite strong and savoury one that it is difficult to describe, but we think they taste absolutely fantastic. They normally cost around $4 or more to buy in the US so anything less than that is a bargain. If you haven't tried them before this is an ideal way to try them before you buy a box! They would be a great novelty to serve at a party with other snacks and dips. These are hugely popular in the UK and very highly recommended.

review/summary: So... I'm Pretty Much Addicted To Twiglets...
review/text: Unlike a lot of other British staples, Twiglets are pretty hard to find in grocery stores in my area, so I'm very glad to see they're available on Amazon. They're the perfect salty, savory, flavor-filled snack and there's nothing quite like them. If you've never tried a Twiglet but happen to know what Marmite tastes like, well: Twiglets are basically crunchy little whole-wheat sticks that are coated in something that tastes very much like Marmite, although they're not actually Marmite-branded and aren't made by the same company. If you know anything about Marmite, you will know that opinions on the stuff are very polarized - you either love it or hate it, and the same goes for Twiglets. You will either think these are to die for, or your taste buds will recoil in horror at the flavor. If the idea of a tangy, salty, crunchy, savory snack (I suppose "umami" might be a useful descriptor here, come to think of it!) appeals to you, I would highly recommend giving these a try for something a bit different.

review/summary: Sorry - Bad Taste
review/text: I purchased these from a local grocery store. Honestly, I thought they were horrid. I've come to realize that they have Marmite as an ingredient. Although, it's not listed on the package from what I can see. Marmite seems to be an acquired taste loved in much of Britain, Australia and other parts of the world. Given that fact, I gave it two stars since the texture was not bad. If you love Marmite, you may love these "twigs".<br /><br />UPDATE: Wow - a lot of people didn't find this review helpful. Okay. The taste did grow on me a bit, but I never purchased them again. My husband spit them out. He lived in Australia and felt they tasted like Marmite. Clearly, he doesn't enjoy the taste, but I know many love Marmite (yeast extract). I bumped it up to 3 stars because they did begin to grow on me. I still think they are  an acquired taste and I still believe that if you enjoy Marmite, you will enjoy these.

review/summary: INEDIBLE!!!!!
review/text: The description on the bag sounded so good that I actually thought something must be wrong with my taste buds. Everyone at work tried them, and we all agreed that they were so bad, it was laughable! What a bitter, nasty aftertaste! The final crime: $5.99 for a a small bag. Had I seen the price, I never would have purchased them. I just ate a few more to reconfirm, and I think I'll go brush my teeth! UGH!

review/summary: Amazing Bagged Darjeeling for the Price!
review/text: Although the product description made this tea sound pretty wonderful, I was still skeptical, having been a serious tea drinker now for 15 years.  I'm even more skeptical of the quality of bagged teas, since many "pyramid" teabags still have tea leaf fannings or even dust in them, just like the old school "flat" tea bags.  This tea not only brews up into a hefty serving of BOP, but the taste is fresh and clean, yet complex enough to be considered a decent spring flush Darjeeling.  I was thrilled, because it can be difficult to find a good spring flush that is affordable and organic as well!  And, while I generally prefer loose tea to bagged, I can use this at work when I'm pressed for time and still enjoy what I'm drinking.  It would be great if the bags weren't stuffed into very small (albeit freshness-preserving) packages which, on my clumsier days, is hard to open without feeling like I'm smashing the leaves.  The teabag strings could be a bit longer as well.  But these are very small complaints, and they will not stop me from ordering again.  If the packaging helps to keep this tea as affordable as it is, it's a small inconvenience to put up with.<br /><br /> I am also going to try this brand's other Darjeelings--check them out!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OQ8">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Bags, Autumn Flush, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OPY">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Bags, Monsoon Flush,  20-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OQI">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Bags, Green, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OP4">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Sample Pack, 5-Count Teabags (Pack of 24)</a>

review/text: I bought this product hoping to make my cats coat shiny and healthy.  I take fish oil myself and thought it would be a good idea for the cats.  I just squirt about 1 pump into their food per day, and while I did notice that their coats were shiny and fuller, they absolutely hate this stuff.  They ate it at first but now they wrinkle their noses at it and wont eat their food. I admit it doesn't smell the greatest.  I won't be purchasing this product again.  I might try something else, but maybe my cats just don't like fish oil.

review/summary: Seems like a good product, but faulty pumps
review/text: I like that it doesn't have  a fishy odor, which is why I use it.  I'm hoping it is a good quality product.  It certainly appears to be.  I've used it for several years routinely to add to home pre-pared raw died for my cats and I have had no complaints from them and they all remain healthy.  SO, assuming it is a good product, which one never knows these days, I'm pleased with it.  However be sure to save the pump from the last bottle before trying out the pump on the new bottle.  Twice, now, I've gotten bottles with pumps that do not work.

There is also a soft version. I purposely ordered the hard nougat one. I grew up on this and it is amazing. Just like the chunk you can buy off the huge block in New York. I will definitely be ordering over and over again. They gained a repeat customer out of me! I am so glad I found this because I am 7 months pregnant and was craving this terribly, so glad I found it.

review/text: This product is every bit the rave of other reviewers. With the stand alone recipe the product is relatively dense and rich in flavor. I have found the following additions to the mix, make this cake EXCEPTIONAL.  1/4-1/3 cup ground almonds/walnuts/mixed; 3-4 tablespoons of good quality Coco Mix; 1-2 extra tablespoons of water; and turn down the oven temperature to 335 F. after 15 minutes and extend the bake time 10 minutes [40 total min.].  The basic mix has great potential for nut and berry combinations that are compatible with rich chocolate. Ice with Coco-whipped cream, refrigerate.

review/summary: Perfect for celiacs and cake lovers alike
review/text: I recently tried this mix for my stepson's birthday party. At first, I was also put off by the 'beany' smell to the batter. But that flavor and smell disappears once the cake is baked. Not only is it a delicious treat for someone with celiac, but all of my (non celiac) family members tested and devoured this cake. They couldn't tell the difference between it and any other pre-packaged mix from the store. Don't be intimidated by the bean flours! They make for a moist, soft, fantastic chocolate cake! (Not at all dry like some mixes made with rice flour.) And unless you plan on sitting back to chow down a big bowl of raw cake batter, you won't even know the beans are there. Bob's Red Mill has yet to let me down in the gluten free department, and this cake mix is no exception!

review/text: My mother made this cake for me, actually it was her birthday but she wanted a cake that I could also eat. I can't speak to the taste of this particular batter because I didn't make the cake, but from past expereince I can't say I have ever tried a gluten free batter that tastes good.<br /><br />But the cake itself is great. Six of us tried it and everyone thought it was wonderful and very moist. I am the only one who eats gluten free so that means this cake has the approval of five "normal" taste testers.  It was especially good with some coffee ice cream and homemade chocolate frosting.

review/summary: Tastes like metal??
review/text: I usually use Betty Crocker and have been pleased except for the fact you need 2 boxes to make a double-layer or 13x9 cake.  I saw all the high reviews for this cake mix and decided to try it while it was on sale.  I wish I had tried a single pack first.  I made the recipe as directed and it tasted awful!  Real strong metallic taste (like what an aluminum pan smells like when it gets the black tarnish on it), especially the after-taste.  I thought it may be because of the lemon juice, so I decided to try another one without lemon juice (since I bought the 4-pack).  It was slightly better (very slight).  Still very metallic tasting and smelling.  Although it was not edible, the texture was very good and the fact that a two-layer cake could be made with one mix was good.  Very disappointed - bought the vanilla cake 4-pack as well and will try that and post results soon.<br /><br />UPDATE...  King Arthur Gluten Free Chocolate Cake Mix is fabulous and you can make a 2-layer cake with one box.  It is a bit more expensive, but if you shop around you can usually get it at a decent price.  It tastes just like 'regular' cake, if not better.

review/summary: Great Cake
review/text: A cost-effective way to get your chocolate cake fix.  Some might taste a hint of bean in this when it has been baked (DO NOT LICK THE BEATERS!  JUST DON"T!) but there is so much lovely dark chocolate in this, you won't mind so much.  I'd advise to use at least 2 tsps. of vanilla, up to a tablespoon if you're not loving the hint of bean.<br /><br />I've had trouble with this not rising properly.  I find it really does need real eggs and cow's milk (otherwise I use coconut milk) and careful mixing with room-temperature ingredients.  If it "falls", you'll just have a denser cake.  Still tastes good, for my money, but maybe not for showing off to guests.<br /><br />Recipe book "Babycakes" has superb muffin/cupcake recipes using Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Flour, which is pretty beany, and all the recipes call for a tablespoon of vanilla.<br /><br />Update 2012:  I've found that two things help with the rising of this cake.  First, not skimping with the liquids.  The batter should be like a slightly thicker cake batter, but not much.  Second, I add an extra minute of beating on the first round, and make sure I do the entire minute on the second.  When I asked Bob's why my cakes were falling, they said it must be my oven temperature; but I have an infrared thermometer, and it says my oven is right on.

Unfortunately so much beaniness remains in the cooked item that the cake is not very palatable unless smothered with icing and icecream.  The texture is also slightly on the chewy side, although this could easily reflect my own poor baking skills.

I am going to make my own gluten-free cake with rice flour and whatever else I can find. This is okay if you plan to slather it with sweet toppings, like a big scoop of ice cream per slice, but as a plain piece of cake, not so good.

review/text: I made this cake as directed and it was absolutely disgusting. I bought this from Amazon.com so you can see that this is not someone who is just giving it a bad review with out honestly trying it. I have a household of five and not a single person could stomach this! That is including the teenagers my little brother "dared" to eat one of the cupcakes I made. After one bite everyone said similar things like gross..or what is wrong with this cupcake. Again I made it as directed and it was gross. I am really surprised since I liked the last gluten free cake mix I bought at the grocery store. If you really want to try this brand I suggest buying a single package instead of the 4 pack at amazon since you will likely have to throw out 3 bags. I usually don't take the time to write a review of something but that was how bad it was I felt I had to warn people.

I haven't compared this to my own from scratch chocolate cake, so I don't know how it compares, but it does make a great cake!  It is expensive, comes to something like $3.89 per 1 lb mix, but so is everything that is gluten-free.  If you are an occasional baker and you need for it to be gluten-free, try this one.  I'm pretty sure you'll like it.<br /><br />Even at this price, I doubt that you could beat it elsewhere.<br /><br />I recommend it.<br /><br />Hazel

The texture was nice and moist.  The taste, on the other hand, was bland and a bit odd.  Certainly not what I would call rich or "chocolatey."  I will try adding cocoa nibs or chocolate chips or cocoa the next time around.

review/text: So for any gluten-free person, I'm sure you've had your incidents with grainy, dry baked goods. It's no fun is it? Look no further than this cake mix if you want the best cupcakes/cake you can possibly have in a gluten-free diet. No grainy texture, not dry; but soft, light, chocolately goodness. Not only does this taste like a real cake, it's probably the best cake from a mix I've ever had. I didn't always used to be gluten-free, either.<br /><br />I was a bit leery of the garbanzo bean flour, but this must be the secret ingredient to deliciousness. No, it does not tastes like beans.<br /><br />Why are you still reading this review? Go make some cupcakes with this mix already!

review/summary: Tastes like chocolate cake!
review/text: I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk and eggs with my mix.  Results = chocolate cake!!  I know it sounds obvious but from someone who just recently stopped eating gluten and dairy to cure years of stomach ailments this is awesome cake mix.  The taste and texture is chocolate cake through and through.  To have things that resemble what I ate before going gluten-free and dairy-free is very comforting.  Other gluten-free mixes tend to be sandy and this mix is definitely not.<br /><br />I second the recommendation of not tasting the batter before baking!  You will be very disappointed if you do!

review/summary: Another Gluten free masterpiece from Bob's!
review/text: So chocolaty and moist, makes wonderful cupcakes. Everyone is happy with these, even the non gluten free people. I had to hide them from the kids so they didn't get eaten all in one day.

review/summary: Bob's does it again!
review/text: Following the recipe on the package to a "t", I still managed to overbake this cake by about 15 minutes. Surprise--still moist and dense!<br /><br />Of course no gluten free recipe will ever ever taste *exactly* like the wheat version, But I have to say this chocolate cake came remarkably close. I like that it has a nice dark chocolate flavor that's not overly sweet. To make it even richer chocolate-y, add in a tablespoon of chocolate extract along with the vanilla extract.

review/summary: The best cupcake I have ever had.
review/text: This mix makes incredible cupcakes. They are moist, chocolatey, light, everything I want in a cupcake. I made them dairy-free as well, with rice milk and margarine, and they were great! I do not understand why people are saying they taste like beans. They do not at all taste like beans. I think they are better than non-gluten-free cupcakes - just the best! I used Duncan Hines classic chocolate and vanilla frostings with them, which are horribly unhealthy, but taste so good.

review/summary: quick, easy, and tasty gluten free
review/text: while i prefer to bake from scratch, i don't always have the time. living with a gluten allergy often makes finding quick fixes or mixes difficult. i have found this chocolate cake mix to consistently deliver. its moist, chocolaty but not overly rich, and hard to ruin as long as you follow the instructions.<br />i've made this cake for guests and events, and no one can tell that its gluten free.<br />this cake will even keep frosted in the refrigerator for a few days without losing its flavor or nice dense texture.
