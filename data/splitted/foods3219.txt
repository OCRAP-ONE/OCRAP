review/text: My kids beg for pop tarts, but since I don't want them to have the  high fructose corn syrup, I say no.  I found thiese and my Kids actually like them better than pop tarts.  The texture is far superior to pop tarts.

review/text: So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the "It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!

review/summary: Fresh, pastry chef Bavarian Cream flavor
review/text: This is not a clone of French Vanilla by any means!  This definitely tastes like a freshly made pastry prepared the hard way, no shortcuts.  This has a light and lemony custard flavor and feels positively decadent and sinful even though I made my latte with skim milk and one teaspoon of sugar.  This is a very satisfying dessert!

review/summary: Amazingly creamy!
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I've read all the reviews for this matcha, and although it sounds delicious, I never thought Bavarian Cream would be a flavour I crave. I love donuts with fillings, don't get me wrong, but they aren't something I jones for in the middle of the night. (I haven't been pregnant yet, so that could change! Haha). I guess what I'm trying to say is - I already have the Cheesecake Matcha, how amazing could Bavarian Cream be?<br /><br />The answer? Extremely amazing. Absolutely amazing. Exclaim it to the heavens!<br /><br />There's something about this flavour that took me by surprise and wooed me. The smell is sweet and creamy, no mistaking it for "vanilla" or something generic, it's quite a specific scent. The aroma is true to the taste, hallelujah! There's almost a "thickness" to it, and certainly a richness, that is reminiscent of its namesake. Creamy creamy creamy! The smell and taste of biting into that perfect area of donut where all the cream is. I personally like to save that part for the last, if I'm lucky. ;)<br /><br />Thankfully with this matcha, I get the best part all to myself!<br /><br />My personal favourite way to enjoy this matcha is as a hot latte with a pinch of sugar, to make the flavour pop and enhance the cream (if it can get any creamier - my goodness!). That said, I also shook it up in a water bottle and took it to work as an iced tea and again it really surprised me! No sugar added + true Bavarian Cream flavour = a happy Ash-Lee servicing customers with a buzz! Thanks Red Leaf Tea!

review/summary: one of my favorite flavors!
review/text: This matcha is great hot or cold. I think it tastes more like vanilla custard as a hot latte, and more like the whipped filling of a pastry when cold. Definitely great with milk! It also makes a great flavor for mixing with others. Peaches and cream, anyone? But even by itself, it's fantastic and definitely a must re-purchase when I run out.

review/text: When I received my package in the mail it came in a white envelope clearly labeled Red Leaf Tea! I was surprised at how quickly my tea arrived! The matcha itself came in a shiny golden envelope with lovely labeling and the type of matcha I ordered printed on a smaller label stuck on it.<br /><br />When I opened the bag containing my tea the smell was intoxicating! Vanilla, Cream, Butter. Those were the aromas that struck me.<br /><br />It is a pleasing flavor if you like rich, and creamy with a full lingering after taste!<br /><br />It tastes exactly like what you get in the middle of a doughnut! Oh yes...its good! :)<br /><br />This is on the top of my list of favorites from Red Leaf Tea but I dare you to make a list of only 5 or even 10 as they are all so very good!<br /><br />They taste exactly like what they say they will!<br /><br />Impressed as always!

review/summary: Perfectly Creamy
review/text: I love Bavarian cream, it's such a nice luscious flavor. Though a big part of the reason I like it is the texture--and surely, a matcha couldn't really capture that, right? Well once again Red Leaf proves that they cam turn ANY flavor into a matcha and make it work! This is creamy, dreamy, vanilla custard with of course a lovely hint of grassy green matcha in the background. But the feel is smooth, creamy, and luscious. It really is like Bavarian Cream in a cup! It's got that same smooth custard-like texture as their Cheesecake Matcha, but I think Bavarian Cream edges it out a bit in terms of my favorites. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Sweet and Decadent!
review/text: I have wanted to order a vanilla-y Matcha for a while now, and I was debating back and forth between choosing the French Vanilla and the Madagascar Vanilla, when I finally settled on trying the Bavarian Cream.  And while this probably isn't as strongly VANILLA as the other two might be (but I don't know that for sure because I haven't yet tried either one of them, but they're on my list to eventually try too!) this one takes creaminess to a whole other level.<br /><br />I mean, you get the creaminess from the Matcha too, and combine that with the custard-y creamy taste of the Bavarian Cream, along with good amount of vanilla flavor and OMG you have heaven in a tea bowl.<br /><br />So very good.  Luscious, creamy, sweet and decadent.  Perfect!

review/summary: A yummy treat without the hassle
review/text: I admit that my knowledge of Bavarian Cream is limited. I originally thought it was just a variation of vanilla. But apparently, it's more like a custard and quite popular in pastries. I personally try to avoid pastries since they are delicious but can also be calorie-laden and full of sugar. So it's nice when you can have a matcha instead that has the flavor without all the calories. Also, Bavarian cream seems like a hassle to make, so all the more reason to enjoy it in matcha form.<br /><br />I actually made this matcha iced and found it absolutely delicious. Normally I have to toss some milk in there to make it a little more drinkable, but this didn't need anything at all. The taste was very creamy and I could just detect the tiny bit of citrus. It's worth noting that if you do decide to chill your matcha this way, a lot of the powder sinks to the bottom, so you may have to froth it up again to get it to absorb.

I was met with strong green tea flavor followed by a hint of citrus and a bunch of creamy smoothness. It felt like I was drinking a latte! While it wasn't the vanilla I was expecting, the creaminess made up for it completely! I am super happy I bought the large one!<br />I really enjoyed this cup of matcha!!

review/text: I only ever had straight matcha prior to purchasing this Red Leaf flavored one. I never even had a matcha latte! And I never ever had Bavarian cream. So trying this as a latte was 3 firsts at once! And I have to say, I'll do it again. And again. And again.<br /><br />I love that I get to drink such a healthy drink and have it taste like dessert. It's energizing and delicious. I definitely taste the vanilla and cream, and I guess that's what Bavarian cream is, right? It's a very custardy flavor. And then I get some matcha flavor in the background. It's divine. I am in cream puff heaven...

review/summary: So stale they actually bend
review/text: Purchased four types of nuts from Bergin simultaneously to make large batch of trail mix for several of my brothers who frequently hike/mountain bike  with a group. I do the easy work by making their trail mix; they do the hard work - the hiking and biking!<br /><br />First time purchase of these Bergin cashews, filberts (hazelnuts) and pecans; second attempt at their almonds. (First purchase of Bergin almonds was horrible; stale, sticky, gummy & chewy even though the 'flavor' seemed ok. They were just terrible. But that was months ago so I thought I'd give it another try).<br /><br />So far, the filberts, almonds (this time around) and the pecans are terrifically yummy. It is the cashews this time that are useless. Waste of money. All packages were sealed by folded over cellophane bags (like those cheap, holiday treat bags) and closed with an adhesive label listing nutritional values. Could not determine reason for stale cashews, but then again, I couldn't determine reason for stale almonds months ago either.<br /><br />So, some good; some not so good. Unsure if I'd purchase from this company again, even if on sale. Guess it is the luck of the draw.

review/summary: A Delicious Seasoning
review/text: The Golden and Brown George Washington broths are the "go-to" mixes for my family when a seasoning packet is required, or in place of a bouillon cube in a recipe. My family has found the Brown to be a great addition to baked dishes, while the Golden broth is best for soups. We always keep at least a box of both varieties in our spice cabinet. It isn't overly healthy, containing Sodium and MSG, but the foods it makes are delicious.<br /><br />Our favorite uses for the Golden George Washington broth mix are either in chip dips or as additions to soups. It also helps make a very savory bread mix, and it is delicious when combined with white rice. You may want to try using half a pack to start, when making rice, and adjust to taste. I'm glad we found this on Amazon since Publix is the only place we been able to find this locally, and only recently at that.<br /><br />Using GWB in our recipes is a family tradition well worth carrying on.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: Great Alternative To Regular Apple Juice
review/text: I normally drink a lot of apple juice. Actually, I buy everything Apple flavor. What I like about this product is that it taste like natural Apple, the flavor is excellent. On top of the taste, I know that this product more benefits than the regular apple juice you find at the local grocery store. You can't find this product at the super markets so I always end up purchasing them through Amazon. The twist on cap adds extra value as it allows you to save the drink for later (not like other drink packs).

review/summary: In a taste test you can't tell the difference between Essence of Lemon or a shot of White Vinegar.
review/text: My girlfriend and I picked up a few bottles of the Kombucha Wonder Drink at a local grocery store in Madison, WI. We really liked the idea of the naturally carbonated tea and thought it might be interesting. Well interesting it was, if by "interesting" you mean "makes your mouth pucker with disapproval". The more I tried to drink it the more I thought to myself that I had almost certainly encountered this flavor before. Then it hit me. I had come across this distinct flavor... during easter while decorating eggs. The flavor of the Essence of Lemon is nearly identical to the flavor of White Vinegar. To test it out I even went to the cupboard and poured a cap of white vinegar and swished it around in my mouth. Yep, thats it right there.<br /><br />It is possible we bought a bad batch. Perhaps self-carbonated teas turn to vinegar if left to long, I'm not sure. I can say that the bottle we drank from looked nothing like the deep yellow fluid on the internet. Our bottle had only the ever so slight hint of yellow, but was otherwise clear as water. If only it tasted more like water and less like that cup of vinegar with colored dye that you dip hardboiled eggs into with a little wire egg holder - maybe I would have given it two stars instead of just one.

review/summary: Whole pintos without the soaking and boiling
review/text: Don't get me wrong, these are not as good as a well-prepared pot of plain pinto beans. However, my experience is that to properly prepare whole pintos, you have to soak and soak, then rinse and rinse, then boil and boil and it takes time. Time that is worth it, but not always practical. With these I can have whole beans to serve with Mexican food in about 20 minutes and they taste good - not like the long-cooked version - but pretty darn good.<br /><br />I gave the product four stars because even with proper cooking, some of the beans come out a little hard - but that happens to me when I make regular pintos, too.

review/summary: Very easy to grow, my cat enjoys nibbling on it
review/text: I bought Kitty's Garden after I first discovered my cat trying to nibble on all the fake plants in my home.  I had to spray those with bitter apple just to get him to stop.  I was a bit skeptical about buying the pre-grown pots of grass from the pet store, because I bought those in the past for my gerbils and they wilted quickly after purchase.  I do not have a "green thumb" in any way, shape or form (hence all the fake plants in my place), but decided to buy this one because it boasted a nice variety of organic grasses for my spoiled cat and the wood container was adorable.<br /><br />I found this kit very easy to use.  So easy, in fact, that I started my garden in my office and left it on the window ledge there for the first week.  Of the four grains offered, I found that the barley one didn't thrive in my kit.  A bit of sparse grass grew from that compartment, but overall barley was a disappointment.  However, I still highly recommend this kit to any other pet owner that needs some grass for their four-legged "pet-kid".

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I've been buying little disposable cat grass kits for a few years now and this one is far superior to the others.  What I love most is that when the kitties eat the grass, they can't pull the container around or tip it over because of the wooden base.  It's nice and sturdy.  Kitties love the grasses.  I paid between $1.99 and $3.99 for the disposable grass kits and they only lasted a few weeks at best.  I bought this over a month ago and the grass is still growing strong, so it is a great value.  I also bought some refills to save on shipping, and I'm glad I did.  Out of 3 cats, only 1 doesn't eat the grass (at least not when I'm looking).<br /><br />Some people have mentioned that the seeds didn't sprout and it got moldy.  I had no problems at all.  You need to be sure to keep the seeds moist (a spray bottle works great) yet also be sure to empty any water left in the bottom so it doesn't sit in water.  If you're dilligent the first few days, I think you will increase your chances of success.  But I wonder if maybe the people who experienced mold might have started their kits during cooler weather...that could increase the chances of mold rather than germination.  Be sure to put in a sunny or very bright window (warmer temps) right after planting.<br /><br />No doubt that I will be buying the refills for this for years.  If you're worried that your kitty may not eat the grass, just buy a cheapie disposable one to test it out first...if he/she eats it, you will surely have a hit with the 4 grasses that come with this one!

review/text: This is a cute little planter for the cat's grass.  Like several others have mentioned, though, only three of the seed varieties included in the kit sprouted.  The fourth variety moldered without sprouting at all.  However, the planter is sturdy and attractive and the remaining seeds grew quite well.<br /><br />I'll definitely continue using the planter but I will be planting my own seeds instead of buying the company's refills, considering a quarter of their product was useless.  I found out that the standard 12 oz plastic container that tofu comes in fits in the planter quite perfectly, so I'll probably toss out four compartment liner and replant more grass using a tofu container as the liner.

review/summary: Quality Product-Cat Grass Planter
review/text: Excellent quality product.  The base is well made of good quality materials, it is sturdy and heavy enough so it doesn't move when your cat eats the grass.  It comes with 2 liners, one to catch the excess water (so your grass isn't waterlogged) and a second with 4 sections for each of the 4 types of grasses.  There is also a clear cover to use until the seeds germinate.  It comes with 4 packets of different types of grass seed and soil "plugs" which expand when water is added.  The directions were sort of hidden inside one of the liners.<br /><br />A couple tips, uncover the container once the seeds sprout to prevent mold growth.  My cats wanted to eat the grass before the roots were well established (which meant when they tried to eat it, the root came out with the blade of grass).  Until the roots were established to hold on their own, I cut pieces off with a scissors for them to eat).  To protect it from them, I sometimes loosely covered it with a white plastic grocery bag so light could still reach the plants.  Even with the bag, they were still trying to get to the grass.<br /><br />I let them have the grass planter every couple of days.  They are in cat heaven, this is definitely a treat for them.  At this time of year the grass outside is under 5 feet of snow, so it is nice for me to see something fresh and green too.

review/summary: Both Cats Love it!
review/text: I have two indoor cats.  I bought this after noticing they kept trying to eat my other indoor plants.  It arrived quickly, and was easy to plant.  You just wet the soil pods and wait for them to absorb the water and swell.  You then smush the dirt around till it is even in the container, remove a little bit of soil with a spoon, spread the seed evenly in to each place and then cover them and water it.  It needs plenty of sun and needs to stay moist.  However: YOU NEED TO KEEP THE CATS AWAY UNTIL IT HAS GROWN!!! Let the grass grow almost to maturity  (just a few days) before you introduce it to your cats.  The first time my cats had it they ripped into it so much that in just one day there was nothing left!  By letting the grass mature a bit, it is more sturdy and can take the munching better.<br /><br />They give you four types of seeds, but I could really not tell the difference between them after they grew.  Only one of them had a very slightly different colored grass stalk.  The cats did seem to prefer some of the grass over the other types, but I did not mark down which was which, so I do not know what grass it was.  When the grass is all gone, I take the insert and toss it out.<br /><br />I try to buy the seed refills and plant twice a year as a treat for them.  They are so excited everytime they get it.

review/summary: Kitty's Garden Edible Grass Planter
review/text: This is a great idea, well made box, and it's just perfect!<br /><br />I originally started out looking for some grass seeds for my kitties since they love to munch on EVERYTHING- not to mention I always have to move flowers so they can't reach them for their safety and the plants. When I saw this I thought it was the cutest box I had ever saw then I remembered it wasn't for me rather the cats! I felt the box alone was worth the price so I ordered it.<br /><br />When I opened the package I was highly surprised at how "real" the planter felt, not cheap like most things you buy. That had partially won me over already- the quality, but then I saw the handwriting printed on it and what do you know? It looks great! It has oats- wheat- rye- barley written across the top and kitty's garden below it.<br /><br />The planter itself consists of the wood box (of course), an open plastic container for catching water, and a plastic container with four sections to hold the seeds. The seeds drain and the wood stays nice, everyone's happy and wins.<br /><br />The soil had me confused at first because I had no idea they now wrapped soil in netting, but they do! You remove the netting and place each soil pod into a single container and fill with 3/4(?) ounces of warm water and wait ten minutes for the soil to absorb the water. You then remove a teaspoon of soil from each container (keep it seperated) and place the seeds into the spot where the soil was removed then cover them- don't forget to remove the open container and empty the drained water from when the soil was soaking.<br /><br />I planted the seeds two days ago and can already see sprouts so I expect them to be ready by next week or so. Basically, as I mentioned before the box is worth the buy. I can't really comment on the seeds since mine are growing and others had problems. However, you can always buy your own seeds and a small bag of soil that you know is trustworthy and just plant them in this awesome box!

review/summary: Neat little planter
review/text: I usually buy wheat grass at the local produce store, but thought that I'd try out the seed version.  It was easy to grow these grasses.  I also thought it would be fun to see what grass my kitties preferred.  They are indoor/outdoor cats, so they snack on it once in a while.  One compartment did grow some fuzzy, moldy stuff, but I just ditched that part in the trash.<br /><br />The planter itself is cute.  It's solid...a type of molded wood (made of wood particles I believe).  I'll be able to buy seeds and start a new crop once this one kicks it.  I grew it for about a week before I gave it to my cats, and it's been around for maybe 3 weeks, but is  now getting a little yellow.  I'm going to try putting it out in the sun for a day or 2.

I got it 3 days ago and planted the seeds immediately, and already all of the seeds are sprouting up (some more than others, but still I see sprouts for all of them).  Unfortunately I forgot which seeds went where, so I don't know which ones are which, but they are all growing, which is a good sign! I was worried when buying this that none of the seeds would grow.  I don't keep mine near a window, just on my desk, and not even in light most of the time, and they are doing fine.<br /><br />Will post an updated review once the grass is fully grown.  My cats have never seen grass before, so I have no idea if they will actually like this once it's ready for them, but I hope so!<br /><br />Also, the planter the seeds come in is very cute.  The instructions are easy to follow, and I like that the planter has two layers, the bottom one catching excess water, so you don't have to put this container on a plate or something else to catch water and doesn't get messy.

review/summary: Our kitty is addicted!
review/text: Out kitty got this planter for Christmas.  I had planted the seeds a week before so the grass would be ready for him to enjoy as a snack on the holiday.  He LOVED it!  Now he is constantly begging for more.  We didn't have a problem with our seeds...all four kinds sprouted evenly.  The planter is nice and sturdy, it will last a long time.<br /><br />The only drawback (aside from the constant begging from our kitty) is that the grass only lasts about a week, and then you have to get rid of it.  But that's ok because the refills are cheap!

review/summary: Fake plants are safe again
review/text: I bought this because our cats insisted on climbing on the counter to chew on our fake plants. It took less than a week from the time we got the kit until it was ready to give to the cats. The cats took to it immediately. We set it on the cat tree which gives it some indirect sunlight, and the kitties can climb up to munch on it. The planter is heavy enough that the cats aren't able to knock it around. It starting wilting after a couple weeks, but even then, the cats would eat it. We're getting another kit in addition to extra seeds. That way we can have one growing while they're eating the other. Then when the one starts to wilt, we can switch them out.

review/text: The grass grew FAST and my cats LOVED it, but the grass didn't last long (only about a week).  After that, the individual sections started coming out and mold started growing by week 3.  I might have just not let it grow longenough before giving it over to the cats, but for the price, I'd give it another try.

review/summary: Twisty, the Smart Cat loves the Grass
review/text: Hi!  I'm Twisty and I love the Grass that my Mom bought for me.  It didn't all grow and it didn't get real tall but I think that is because Mom loves me so much she just couldn't wait for it to grow big.  But she was smart; because she bought two.  Imagine that,two Kitty Garden's for one Smart Cat.  I eat my grass for a snack and also when my tummy is a little upset.  I eat it and when it get's short my Mom gives me the other one.  I have feline leukemia so I can't go out any more so as an indoor cat this grass is very important to me.  I think every Smart Cat should have a smart Mom like my Mom.

review/summary: Grew grass then mold
review/text: Well the big problem is that it grew mold.  I don't feel like I was overwatering it but mold still grew.  Before the mold grew my cat would throw up after eating it. That's more my cat's fault than an issue with the product I think.  She tends to over eat and I think she just ate too much grass too fast, if I let her eat for a few minutes and then put it away.  My other cat didn't have any interest in it.  I would maybe give it an extra half star if half stars were allowed.  The base is nice but the part that the seeds go in and the soil are not so great.

review/summary: This is How I Plant Them
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:25 Mins<br /><br /></span>They are oats, wheat, rye, and barley. In other words, they do seed if allowed to mature before getting killed by cats. Since I do have a backyard with space to plant, I plant seeds in soil. It takes about 4 months to complete their life cycle. During their growth, I only pick off tips of the leaves so they could still continue to grow. Only the last few days of seed maturing the leaves turn dry and yellow and are not edible. In return, I could get seeds "for free" to plant right away, as long as the weather allows it.<br />I don't use any pest control or use any fertilizer, so certainly not all of the seeds would survive. Aphids, with the help of ants, and snails do invade, and a slight strong gust could break their fragile stems. However, I could be sure that they are certainly organic through out the process. And the source of grass would not die down during the months they grow.<br />In the end, the wood container becomes cat treat bag holder. Anyhow, my Russian Blue is very rough at biting grass, so planting inside the box had been countless flip-overs and soil-spills.<br /><br />Notes: If planting outside, remember to wash before feeding to cats, and certainly don't pick off parts that had been bitten by aphids or crawled by snails.

review/summary: Nice design, grass grows quickly
review/text: My indoor cat loves cat grass. I've tried a few other products, but they either get knocked over by my cat due to the flimsy design, or the grass doesn't grow very quickly.  This grass planter kit is GREAT! It has a beautiful design and the solid base stays put in my kitchen bay window.  The grass began growing within 2-3 days and my cat happily noshes on it several times a day now.  He's a big cat, but, so far, he has not knocked the base over when he sniffs and chews on it.  Happy kitty - happy owner!

review/summary: Price Keeps Going Up!!!!- Not Worth it
review/text: The product is pretty good, grows fast but you can get mold/mildew on the soil very easily. The hot water they tell you to use to expand the soil plug adds to this growth. My cat loved 3 of the 4 grasses as noted by others and you can use 1/2 the seeds to extend the life span by planting it twice. In addtion the cat can get munching and pull this out of the caintier as the container is too light, I have to hold it down with rubber bands.<br /><br />I could take all that but now the proce keeps going up. This used to be $5 and is now up to $10!!! I will not pay this price anymore. Save your money and buy in bulk and skip the pretty container.

review/text: The grass starts growing with a couple days and is full grown in about a week. I watered it about a 1/4-1/3 of a cup a day. Just enough to wet the dirt. Too much or too little will kill it pretty quickly. My cat likes it. I think she prefers some kinds over others but she eats it all. Mine has been growing over a month and still looks good.

review/summary: Great planter as well as plastic insert
review/text: I bought this mainly just for the planter itself. I had planned on using the seeds that came with it and then just using my own wheat grass seeds after since it costs much less. I was so happy with the plastic insert that comes with the seeds though that I've taken to keeping and reusing that each time as well. I just put my own seeds and potting soil/peat moss (whatever I have on hand) in it and am able to drain any extra water out very easily to avoid mold growing. I have been using two of these for my three cats for two years now and couldn't be happier.

review/summary: Don't overwater!
review/text: Like most people who came here looking for cat grass, my cat destroyed the only 2 plants in my house and I wanted to get him something he could eat.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I followed the directions closely, including looking up what 3 oz. of water is so that I could measure correctly.  I made sure to drain out the excess water and put the whole thing on top of my refrigerator (the only place my cat hasn't figured out how to get to).  The first sprout that came up looked like it had mold growing, so I set the planter outside for a few hours in the sun.  Over the next day everything started to grow.  I did not water anything for the first few days - that initial watering soaks the dirt well enough, if you start spritzing too soon, you may overwater.  So once all 4 sections sprouted about an inch, I started spritzing every day.  We also had a few cloudy overcast and rainy days which kept me from setting the planter outside, so instead I put the overhead lights on in the kitchen.  I was amazed at how fast everything grew after that!  So don't overwater and give these babies some sunlight or lamplight and you will probably have the kind of success I had.  I'm waiting a couple of days for extra growth and for when I am home to monitor my cat's reaction.  I have been giving him sample cuttings and he seems to enjoy.  I may replant everything into a bigger bowl if my cat ends up pulling everything out of the planter.  I'm glad I bought a refill (as insurance if the first didn't grow) - I plan to get those started as well.

My kitty doesn't really go outside so this really is a great thing to have for him.

review/summary: mold and insects grew in my planter
review/text: I was so excited to purchase this planter. My cat is only allowed indoors and loves cat grass.  After following the instructions to a tee, I waited the 4 - 6 days as instructed to wait for the grass.  When I went back to check on growth, I saw one or two shoots coming out and a green fuzz all over the soil.  Also, in the window that I had placed the planter to grow, was an influx of flying insects that were not there prior to the introduction of the planter.  The only way those insects could have appeared exactly at the window where the planter was, is if they came from the planter itself.  Needless to say, I threw away the grass and will have to look for other sources.  Incredibly disappointed.

They all immediately buried their nosed into the grass and enjoyed themselves.<br />I used the seeds to make several gift pots for friends.<br />I mixed the seeds together and there were different varieties that did sprout so I was pleased.  Mine is still going after a month.  I keep coming home and find parts of it on the floor as my cat has munched and pulled a quarter of it out of the box.  She loves it.<br />The actual wooden planter box was fine, but the four interior suspended containers are a little limiting in use when using dehydrated peat planters.

In 2 days the first two kinds of grass were sprouting, and 3 days later were about 7 inches high! All four grasses sprouted fast and grew very tall in 5 days max. Sprinkle water on it occasionally. Totally easy! Cats LOVED it and chew it all the time, in fact it got so ragged from them breaking off grass I bought a second one, which also grew fast and worked great.

review/text: Kittys GardenVery easy to start. All four types of seeds started to grow within 4 days. By day 10 I had a beautiful grass garden for my cats. It was winter. Knew they would love it. I presented grass to my cats. They totally ignored it. Kept grass alive with frequent watering til I could finally plant it outside. My cats began to eat it after that. Kept the lovely plastic lined wooden box. The "Kitty's Garden" wooden, lined box now contains a very healthty wax plant. Great fun!

review/summary: My previous review : incorrect
review/text: I had been looking for catnip. When I saw " Kitty's garden" I thought it would contain that herb. I dis not read carefully that it contains : oats,<br />rye,and wheat grasses. I gave them a bad review but I apologize. This<br />"garden" is just fine even without the catnip. So I am giving them 5 stars<br />for excellent customer relations,speedy service and a good product.<br />Please change my previos review to "good" Nina Lockwood

review/summary: Always nice to be surprised!
review/text: Excellent product...the quality really blew me away! I wasn't expecting much from this product, lets face it...it's just grass. However, the container it comes in is really nice. Very surprised, and I will be getting more of theses for other cat lovers.

review/summary: Grows Easily
review/text: The 4 different types of seeds included in the packets have all grown well, although not all at the same rate of growth, and some seeds grew better than others. I got this product for my cat so that he doesn't have to go outside onto the apartment complex grounds to eat some grass when he is feeling nauseous, and although he has mouthed the Kitty's Garden grasses two or three times, he has not yet bitten any off.  He is 21 years old, and among other health problems, has problems with nausea. I give him some vet recommended medication for his nausea (it doesn't always seem to work), but sometimes he just wants to chomp on some grass.  Although he has not yet bitten off any of the Kitty's Garden grass, I consider this a good product. The grass outside is stiffer than this grass is, maybe that is why the outside grass is easier for him to bite off, but I worry about contaminants. At least I feel that this is a safe product for him.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After about a week, several of the blades of grass started to wilt (they didn't need water).  I took them out of the growing containers and transplanted them into regular flower pots with potting soil.  It took a few days, but I can report that there is new growth.  My cat still hasn't bitten any off, but he is probably close to the end of his life due to his kidney disease, so it is understandable.<br /><br />UPDATE ON JULY 2, 2008:  My old cat is stilling hanging in there, but he still didn't eat any of this kitty grass.  However, a young cat that unexpectedly showed up at my apartment door on Christmas Eve, 2007, and stayed with me for 11 weeks until his owners were found, loved this kitty grass.  I ended up giving the pots of grass to his owners when they took their cat back.
