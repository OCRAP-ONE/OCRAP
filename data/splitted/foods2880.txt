review/summary: Really low quality product
review/text: Tamarined Candy is amazing. No doubt about it. However,the quality of Tamarind candy sold by Ur Asian Store is deplorable. I ordered 1 3.5 oz box and 2 4 oz boxes of Tamarind candy and instead received 3 boxes of 4 oz Tamarind candy. No problem there.  Unfortunately, the candies themselves were old, stale, and worthy of my condemnation. There was no date label on any of the three boxes so I don't know how old they were, but I felt like I was consuming Candies that were years past their "best by" date. After tasting 2-3 from each box I had to throw all three boxes away. My only hope now is that I will not get sick from eating these expired Tamarind Candies.<br /><br />I strongly recommend anyone interested in buying Tamarind Candy to get it from any retailer other than Ur Asian Store here on Amazon.

review/summary: Senseo Foamy Goodness
review/text: We tried several non-Senseo pods in both our Senseo SL Supreme and older 7810 and this Cafe Classic Kona was our favorite.  There is more coffee in the Kona pod than in the Senseo pod so for a two-cupper place 1 Senseo Sumatra pod on the bottom and 1 Cafe Classic Kona pod on top. Press a bit to flatten so lid closes without forcing.  We can set our Senseo Supreme on 3 cups but either on 2 or 3 this comes out perfect!  In a pinch and for travel we use the Hamilton Beach Personal Cup one cup pod brewer where you can use two of these Kona pods and it still tastes great - just no foam!

review/summary: Five Stars for Tasty Lo-Carb Syrup with0 calories; Zero Stars for Price/Shipping
review/text: Okay, I just discovered Da Vinci syrups last month, and I like them a lot. I love this cherry one. For low-carbers, this can go in so much: yogurt, seltzer water for diet cherry soda, in Coke Zero to make it cherry coke zero on a whim,and my current fave way--over grated ice to make a sno-cone. I love cherry sno-cones, and here's a way to have it without sugar and calories.<br /><br />I use the Egg Nog flavor in almond milk or milk and it's a nice holiday-flavor. And the Toffee one in WonderSlim toffee pudding to enhance the flavor. The coconut one I use in hot cocoa to amake it German Chocolate cocoa, and it's also nice for sno-cones (though the cherry is better).<br /><br />I get mine at Netrition (where I've shopped low-carb items for years). It's a couple bucks cheaper in price and the shipping is much more reasonable (at less than five bucks per order).<br /><br />I'd recommend the product for dieters, especially low-carbers, but not this seller's pricing/shipping. No way.<br /><br />Enjoy...

I had gotten some cheap sugar free cherry syrup at Wal-Mart for snow cones and loved it but could no longer get it because it is a seasonal item.  This was expensive with the shipping but it had gotten great reviews.  I am very disappointed.  It has a very medicinal after taste.  I don't normally take the time to write a review but I don't want anyone else to spend nearly $20 with s/h for this. I'm pouring mine out. Try something else.

review/text: I used to buy this stuff in tiny expensive packages at the grocery store, so I was very happy to find I could get it in larger and vastly more economical quantities at Amazon. It makes a great peanut sauce; mix it up with some coconut milk and boom! Quick and easy. I have also used it on baked chicken, fish, and vegetables, particularly a mixture of cauliflower, carrots, and broccoli. You just take your cut up veggies, toss them in a little oil or butter, coat them with the spice mix, and bake them until you think they're done. It really adds life to vegetables.

review/text: I had high hopes for this product and will say that the packaging and cost are fine. However, the product inside the great reusable plastic containers is way too sweet. We used it on baked chicken, veggies, and as a sauce per the included recipe but the best  way to mask the excessive sweetness is using it to make a spicy Thai peanut noodle salad.  I add toasted sesame oil, hot chili oil, cilantro, ground peanuts and sometimes peanut butter and often bring it to potlucks.  It is usually the first empty bowl.<br /><br />I will not purchase again.

review/summary: Gummy bear pasta at best!!!!!!!!!
review/text: This was the poorest pasta I have ever eaten. If you follow instructions and boil pasta for 4-6 minutes you'll have a snowball of mush. I purchased 6 boxes and experimented with all six (just wanted to get rid of them). I cooked the pasta in separate batches for 3,4,5,6,7 and eight minutes. All were terrible. Dear Hodgson why are there 2 types of pasta in each box? One half linguine and one half curly long pasta. Please go back to the drawing board and try again. The worst whole wheat pasta is ten times better than this product. Never again.

review/summary: One of the better rice pastas
review/text: If you aren't familiar with rice pasta or gluten-free pasta, you may have some problems with this unless you follow the instructions correctly. Because this is RICE, you MUST rinse it after cooking to wash away all of the starch created from cooking. And you must not overcook it or you'll have a sticky mess.(That's what rice does!)  I've had my share of failed cooking experiences with GF pasta because I didn't rinse it well enough or I overcooked it.  So now I know.  This is great tasting pasta.  The linguine is best since it holds more sauce.  The angel hair version is a little too delicate for my cooking experiences.  No one can tell it's not the regular pasta when I cook it for guests.  I sure don't get that bloated feeling after eating this, which makes sense since it's not a combination of ingredients that makes up glue!!!

It keeps forever in the plastic container, too.<br /><br />One warning: this salt contains sugar. If this is an issue for you, discuss it with your doctor before using this brand of salt. On the bright side, this product contains no M.S.G. and there is a mailing address in case you wish to contact the manufacturer for any reason.<br /><br />Overall, Lawry's makes excellent seasoned salt. I recommend it highly.

review/text: I try my best to stay away from caffeine, and never really liked the taste of decaf black tea. About a year ago I tried drinking Rooibos (south african red tea) and I'm completely hooked. But this tea is the absolute best of all of the rooibos flavors I've tried from Teavana (I'd also recommend Adagio's Rooibos Jasmine and Green Rooibos Citron if you're looking for more flavors). It is incredibly floral due to all of the flower petals (including whole dried rosebuds) and fruity at the same time from all of the strawberry, with a slight sour kick. I drink this tea every day and it always cheers me up.

review/summary: Most dissapointing rooibos I've tried
review/text: At home right now I have the following rooibos teas:<br /><br />Salada Green Tea with Red Antioxidants (strawberry-orange)<br />Equal Exchange Wild Rooibos<br />Port Trading Cape Rooibos<br />Zhena's Gypsy Red Lavender<br /><br />These are all bagged teas.  In addition, I have some loose rooibos from a local tea specialty store called Virtuous Teas.<br /><br />Of all of these rooibos (or rooibos-containing) teas, the Teavana Tropica is the worst by far.<br /><br />Firstly, it is difficult to even tell if it contains any actual rooibos; any such flavoring is completely overwhelmed by citris.  Given that the tea is actually *called* a rooibos tea, I find this completely unnacceptable.<br /><br />It would be another matter if rooibos was simply listed as one of the ingredients.  For example, the Salada green tea I mentioned doesn't pretend to be a rooibos tea.  "Rooibos" is listed as a constituent (along with lycopene, anthocyanins and vitamin C), but the tea is called "Green Tea Fortified with Red Antioxidants."  Although the Salada tea is not called a rooibos tea, it is much richer in rooibos flavor than Teavana's so-called "Rooibos Tropica."  Teavana's tea should simply be called "Tropica" with rooibos listed as an ingredient (if there is any actual rooibos present ... I'm not convinced).<br /><br />Secondly, the tea's "tropical" constituents manage to produce a cloying experience in a tea that is otherwise too weak.  I have not been able to brew a pot that had any satisfying tea impact whatsoever -- it has always felt too weak regardless of how much tea I've used -- yet making it stronger simply imparts more of the bad tropical mix.  And the tropical mix *is* bad, as if I steeped some orange peels and random flower petals in hot water.<br /><br />This tea dissapoints on multiple levels.  Also, the fact that it is marketed as a rooibos tea will make me wary of any other Teavana offerings.

review/text: My favorite milk beverage. The local supermarkets don't stock this any more. Not sure why -- maybe it's old fashioned or something. Thanks to Amazon, I now have my malted milk again. The large container is about 3 times the size of the typical jar at the grocery store.<br /><br />This product is slightly different than the product sold in the plastic jar at the grocery store. The grocery store product dissolves instantly in cold milk, while this product does not. The ingredients seem to be the same. The trick I use is to put the powder in the empty glass and add a *very* small amount of milk. Mix until it's a thick liquid, and then fill the glass with milk while stirring.

review/summary: Mmm! I love malted milk!
review/text: This was my first time purchasing malted milk powder, so I can't really say how this measures up to other brands. But what I wanted was straight-up malted milk, not chocolate malt, not a milk shake, just malted milk and this got me there! I just add a couple tablespoons of the powder and a little bit of milk to a mug, microwave it for 20 seconds, stir, then add the rest of my ice cold milk and stir again. Boom! Awesome cold malted milk. Delicious. I fill kind of silly for buying this 2.5lb container (especially since I finally found a reasonable size at a local store). But hey, I'm sure I'll use it :)

review/text: This is one of the very few products that has maintained its quality and appeal over many, many years.  As a youngster I drank a mix of this malted milk with warm milk, but mostly I SNACKED on it in its powder form.  I still do!  Try it, it is absolutely delicious.  Specially great if you cannot have chocolate for allergy or some other reason.

review/summary: Doesn't taste the same as the 13 oz. size, but still good
review/text: As noted by other reviewers, this product does not taste the same as the 13 oz. size.  I use a blender to make my shakes, and I found this 40 oz. product yields a thicker shake with a less malty flavor than would have been present with same amount of the 13 oz. jar product.  This may be good, bad, or otherwise, depending on how you feel about the difference.  As I would need more of this product to get the same malt flavor intensity as the 13 oz. size product, the benefit of the lower cost of the 40 oz. size is reduced if not completely eliminated.  Shame on Carnation for giving two products the same name ("Malted Milk Original") with different recipes.  This product is satisfactory.

review/summary: Deelish
review/text: I love the taste of this.  I started drinking a glass of milk before bed which helps with my insomnia, and the malt powder makes it taste so much better.  It is true that it doesn't dissolve well, but using a spoon for the lumps at the bottom of the glass....it is like dessert.  Like malt balls without the chocolate.  If you put the powder in the glass first with just a tiny bit of milk and make a paste before you add the rest of the milk, it works better, but like I said, I don't mind the lumps.  I suppose a blender would be the ticket if you want a smooth drink.  I don't know why more stores don't carry it.

review/summary: MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD PAST
review/text: As a kid in the 40's and 50's it was such a wonderful treat to go to a neighborhood drugstore soda fountain with my mother and sister and order a chocolate malted milk served with two Salerno cookies wraped in celophane. The malted milk was mixed in a metal container that held probably 12 or more ounces milk, a scoop or two of icecream, chocolaet syrup and malt powder and could refill my glass after finishing the first. I found it in Amazon's grocery and gourmet food selections and have signed up for subscribe and save to make sure I always have it on hand. Now I heat soy milk and pour it into a cup with the malt powder and have a delicious, sentimental, warm, cozy and comforting bedtime treat.I'd better stop before I start to weep.

review/text: I always loved malted milk shakes, and this is the key ingredient! However, since I do not have a blender, I have been taking several scoops of ice cream in a bowl, melting it part way in my microwave, then adding a few tablespoons of this malt to the top. I then add a little milk and mix it in with the melted ice cream. The malt doesn't mix well, but it's still quite delicious! Some of the milk even freezes by the solid ice cream, which adds a little extra texture to the mix. Try it!

review/text: Saw a commercial about a new Flatbread product, thought I had to have it. I was so disappointed. First of all I'm not a wheat thins person, so maybe if you love wheat thins you'll like this. I'm Italian so I was thinking more along the lines of flatbread from Italy. Pretty gullible, right? Just because the product is called Tuscan flatbread, doesn't mean there is anything even remotely similar. My biggest gripe is the amount of sugar that is used. They are CRACKERS, not COOKIES! I couldn't get past the SWEET flavor. I spit it out. Why does everything have to have so much sugar?! We do have other taste buds in our mouth. Order them if you're just expecting elongated wheat thins and NOT if you really want flatbread.

review/text: I have to admit to liking Alfredo Pasta Sauce. I don't have it often but have a jar in the fridge for emergencies when I have no time to cook. Jarred sauce is not as good as home made, but I find Classico taste acceptable and it is a time saver.<br /><br />I have had the traditional Classico Creamy Alfredo (with the red label) in the past, and when I saw a "lite" version of Classico Creamy Alfredo in a local supermarket I decided to give it a try.  I found that the lite version tasted the same to me as the regular Creamy Alfredo sauce when mixed with pasta. Regular Classico Creamy Alfredo has 100 calories and 9 grams of fat per serving (a serving is a quarter of a cup).  Classico Lite Creamy Alfredo has has 40 calories and 4 grams of fat for the same quarter cup serving.  Tastes the same with less calories - I will use it again!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: One of the best things that Dave's makes
review/text: I am a big fan of this mustard.  It has a balance not often seen in hot sauces and condiments.  It is a little sweet for my taste but that can be remedied.<br /><br />First let me say that, unlike some of Dave's other products, this one does not include "hot pepper extract".  Instead we get our heat from "Red Chili Peppers, Mustard Seed, Habanero Peppers and Paprika".  In my opinion this adds flavor instead of just raw fire.<br /><br />I have used this product (sometimes as an addition to other sauces) on swordfish, inside of hamburger meat, on assorted grilled sausages, on deep fried chicken drummies, on top of corned beef (with horseradish of course) and several other meats.  I sometimes "kick-it-up-a-notch" by adding one of Dave's hot sauces, that and a little vinegar will tame the sweetness.  All in all a very good mustard.  Four stars from me!

review/text: This sauce is mild on the scale of hotness when it comes to condiments, but it is extremely flavorful.  I like it best on fried chicken.  The first time I ever tried this sauce was actually at Ike's Crab Cakes on the Ocean City boardwalk in Ocean City, NJ--and I think I'd been craving it, since.  It adds so much to a meal that I would have no qualms about shoving it into my coat pocket and taking it with me to restaurants.<br /><br />It's sweet like honey mustard, but not so much that it overpowers the peppers.  It sounds almost exotic to people who've never tried it when you describe it to them, but the ones I've met have unanimously agreed that they find this sauce agreeable.  :)<br /><br />Seriously, try it--if only to satisfy your curiousity.  This makes a great gift for anyone who is a fan of Dave's.

review/summary: Delicious Healthy Tortilla Chips
review/text: I stumbled across these new tortilla style chips by popchips and decided I have to try them.  I really like most of the traditional popchips flavors (potato version).  I would honestly say that all four flavors of these new tortilla style are exactly what I expected from popchips.  They are all excellent and go well with the style of chip too.  The texture of these will take some getting used to for me, but I would say it's pretty good (that's why I've given it 4 stars).  It's definitely worth a try and perfect for someone looking for a healthy alternative to regular tortilla chips (and if you get the 24 pack, preportioned into 1 oz 120 calorie bags).  I'll certainly be getting more, and it's nice to have a little variation of healthy chips!

review/text: I'd been eating the BBQ Pop Chips for a couple years now and love them, so I decided to try these.  Not my favorite, but my husband thinks they are great, so all is not lost.  I'm giving them 4 stars because I don't think they really taste like tortilla chips, but they are lower in fat and calories and have lots of flavor.

review/summary: More flavor & better texture than Potato PopChips
review/text: I bought some of the Potato PopChips & some of the Tortilla chips in the flavor variety pack.  I felt the potato were good, but the texture was odd, the taste was onlt from the powder, and it absorbed the water from my mouth & stuck to my tongue.  Only the BBQ Popchip was really really good.<br /><br />I would buy both kinds again, but only one is better than chips available in the store.<br /><br />I really liked the TORTILLA POPCHIPS!  They have a corn flavor, it has the texture of a puffed up corn chip, and it's not sticky in the mouth.  I'm not a big fan of powdered flavors, but I didn't mind these so much.  I enjoyed the nacho, ranch, salsa, and chili lemon tortilla PopChips.

review/summary: Great new low fat, healthy snack option
review/text: I have been taken with the Popchips that are a potato base since discovering them 1 year ago but then saw an ad for Tortilla chips made by Popchips in 4 flavors.  I immediately ordered them because I love chips and salsa and always feel so guilty eating "real" chips with it. These arrived and I have tried all flavors and love them all. They are 3 Weight Watchers Points Plus so fit well into a weight control plan. Highly recommend them.

review/summary: Different, but good.
review/text: I've been enjoying the regular Popchip varieties for some time now.  When these became available, I had to try them.  Even though there are only four flavors, they are varied enough to be satisfying.  I like the light and airy texture.  I think the taste is better than the baked tortilla chips that are available.  However, without flavoring, I don't think they could stand on their own as a plain tortilla chip.

review/text: I love the regular PopChips, especially the Salt and Vinegar.  Was happy when these became avilable on Amazon.  I decided to try the variety box so I could taste all the flavors.  What a mistake, these are the worst things ever.  They have a terrible after taste.  I took them to work for our break area, and I only received bad comments from people.  I believe PopChips messed up with these.  Will definitely not purchase again, nor will my friends.

review/text: I like the original pop chips, and I love tortilla chips, so when I saw this product I thought it would be a slam dunk.  But no.  These chips taste very....off.  They taste like no other tortilla chip I've ever tasted.  Nor do they taste like the original pop chips.  They have an odd cardboard texture with a weird aftertaste.  I would avoid this stuff.

review/summary: A great idea for a chip but no flavor
review/text: I have eaten the other pop chips and thought that these tortilla chips would be an exact match to the doritos and other junk food that my kids eat. But to my surprise these tortilla chips have no flavor. In the first bag it was all in the bottom of the bag. So the second back I shook the bag well to coat the chips and to no avail there still was no flavor. So if flavor is what you are looking for you do not want these but if you just want a low cal chip for a snack or with a sandwich then these are it.

review/summary: YES! Tortilla Popchips
review/text: I eat Popchips every day! So yeah I was a little excited when I saw they came out with Tortilla Popchips... IMO they nailed it! It is crunchy but indeed slightly puffy compared to a normal tortilla chip. I don't find the puffyness to make any difference in comparison to a regular tortilla chip though. I just read another reviewer saying these don't taste like corn tortilla chips and I couldn't disagree more. These have a great fresh corn tortilla chip taste. Basically these taste like a great tortilla chip but without any greasy feeling or taste. As far as the flavors go that's going to be subjective. Nacho cheese Doritos had always been a favorite of mine before Popchips and I think the nacho cheese Popchips are a great alternative. Sorry Doritos, too much fat. Ranch is good also and I'd rank it 2nd out of the 4. As far as the limon and salsa they don't stand out as favorites but I have no complaints and they're nice to have for variety.

review/text: I am a bit torn on these Popchips Tortilla style. I really liked the original Popchips with the different flavors and textures but the tortilla do not seem a good replacement for real tortilla chips and the flavors seem a little too light and washed out. After all real tortilla chips with real salsa is great and better for you too... bean dip not as good and cheese might be the worst (health wise not taste).

review/summary: unfortunatly not nearly as good as Pop Chips Potato based chips
review/text: I really like Pop Chips potato based chips so I thought I'd take a chance on the corn "masa" based chips. I ordered this 4 flavor combo pack. Now I admit I don't like all flavors of potato based pop chips; FWIW cheddar and salt & pepper are my favorite. These corn based chips are not very good which is unfortunate as I bought a case of 12. I knew it was a gamble, but hey, I live in Las Vegas...<br /><br />It is hard to pinpoint exactly where these chips fall short. Too me they seem very salty, although each serving is only 6% to 8% of sodium RDA. The nacho cheese flavor is the most tolerable of the four flavors, although it does not taste much like cheese. The ranch flavor tastes very artificial (although these are naturally flavored). The chili limon and salsa flavors are just okay. The chili limon flavor is rather bland and does not have much chili or lemon-lime flavor but it also does not seem as artificial or overly salty. In sum, I could eat a few of the nacho cheese, chili lime, and salsa but could not stand the ranch. Perhaps a plain, corn flavor would have been better that these heavily flavored, salty tasting chips.<br /><br />Of course personal tastes vary so much, but to me these are not very satisfying snacks especially compared to potato pop chips. I would not buy them again but I thought I should post a review since I already played the roll of guinea pig.

review/summary: Taste Like Flavored Cardboard
review/text: I purchased this item when all of Popchip's products were on sale. I chose this item specifically because I wanted to try the "Chili Limon" flavor. When I tried this flavor, I was extremely disappointed. This flavor, along with the other three flavors, has the texture of cardboard. The flavoring itself, is very light, hence "tastes like flavored cardboard."<br /><br />I understand that these are not tortilla chips; however, I LOVED all of the flavors in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007M832Y4">Popchips 11-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> that I bought at the same time. BEWARE! The potato chips and tortilla chips have totally different texture and flavor. I will not buy these again.<br /><br />The only reason this got 2 stars instead of 1 is that the ranch flavor was "okay."

review/text: It hardly matters what Grandma thinks, my granddaughter LOVES this product.  When I give it to her, she thinks it is tantamount to chocolate. She does not have to know it is good for her. In addition, I find dried fruit becomes soggy very shortly after opening here in damp Florida (even if resealable), so the small size is portable in my purse and she can eat the tiny bag in one sitting. This is a GREAT product.

review/text: I read some of the bad reviews for this product and was concerned, however, I ordered it anyway.....I am so glad I did.  This snack is delicious.  I'll agree with some viewers that it gets sticky in your mouth and gums up your teeth.....but it's temporary and your mouth clears out quickly so it's no big deal...at least not for me.  I bought this also because my grandson is highly allergic to most foods on the market unless they are fresh fruits and vegetables so this gives him a little variety.  They are easily packed away in his diaper bag for snacks during the day.  I do wish it wasn't as expensive as it is.....but....seems everything that is exceptional in life cost too much.

review/text: These are crunchy as they claim, but it's more of any "airy" texture. It's hard to explain. But I was expecting them to be like dried fruit but instead of chewy, they would be crunchy. They're not. The peices aren't even solid looking. They look like pork rinds. It's really strange to be eating fruit that looks fried instead.  The taste however is fine. It does taste like banana and cinnamon. And while I will finish the box I bought, I will definitely not be buying these again.

So I only drink Hansen's now with an occasional Coke or Pepsi when I'm out.  Hansen's is just better.

Precisely. Although I did manage to finish all twenty-four cans, there will never be a twenty-fifth. There are just too many other things I can drink--like water--to ever return to this. Sorry, but while it's not "spitting out" bad, as is another diet drink I know of, it's just not something worth any further consideration.  There's just no point in comparing it to Coke. Coke has character, this stuff is just a waste of time.

review/text: So, I got Hansen's soda on a price error. I'm glad I tried it because I really enjoyed it. Make sure it's extremely ice cold when you drink it because if you don't, the flavors won't taste right. I'll admit that drinking a can that wasn't completely cold was a bit unpleasant. However, I'm glad I tried it and thought it was good. I think the HEB sells a 6 pack for 4-5 dollars so this may be a cheaper alternative for some.

review/summary: Acceptable Altnerative to Other Diet Colas
review/text: I enjoy a wide range of Hansen's diet sodas, and am usually quite pleased with the product quality and taste.  The cola is probably my least favorite of their diet sodas, possessing a sharp after taste similar to any other diet cola I have tried.  If taste is your primary concern, I would recommend the more common brands as they are typically cheaper, and store brands taste as good as this one.  If you are concerned about the choice of sweetner, which is what lead me to Hansen's products as they use sucralose, than you may wish to pay the extra price and live with the taste.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad product, but may not be worth the extra money if taste is your most important factor, and this is clearly not their best diet soda product.
