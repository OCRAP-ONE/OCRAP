review/summary: Superb!
review/text: That's what my cat would say. This is the best food that I've found for my cat, and the extra cost shows it, but my cat's worth it! I was suprised to see the big chunks of real fish. I agree with other comments about the packaging, so it didn't take me long to figure out that if you use scissors to cut the top off instead of tearing it, you avoid all the mess. Just squeeze the contents away from the top first before you cut it. I actually prefer this package over a can, because since I give her half in the morning and half in the evening, I can just fold over the top and put the rest in the fridge. I have always bought the cheaper Whiska's pouches because, well, I'm a cheapskate. But at this point in both of our lives, I figure it's time to enjoy ourselves, and treat us both to the good stuff! Steak for me, Purffectly Fish/Chicken for her!

review/text: The Purrfectly Chicken is the only pouch variety all the cats love. That's 5 inside spoiled rotten princes and princesses aged 6 to 13 and anywhere from 2 to 5 outside feral cats.I can deal with the inconvenience of pouches spilling chicken juice but wish I were sure they were eating a quality product. The fact that they're from Thailand bothers me. The dark pieces are always left in the bottom of the bowls.

review/summary: My fancy feast only cat loves it at first but now he only likes the juice in it!
review/text: My 5yr old cat eats only Fancy Feast Grilled products. He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled. It seems like he enjoys juicy textured food in his mouth. He is primarily on wet food because of his stomititis. I am on subscribe & save for the FFG, but have been looking for a good wet cat food to provide some variety. The real meat in a pouch idea appeals to me. Got the 10-pack box today at local Petsmart for $5.99. My cat usually favors the chicken flavor so I opened the chicken packet first. Lots of juice and soft meat and smells more like human food(to human nose). My cat finished it in record time. Success!! We are going to try out other flavors like Seafood next. It did draw my attention that this product was made in Thailand. I am not sure if that should be a concern (?). And if your cat is like mine, who sometimes cannot finish the 3oz portion in a meal, just store it upright in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge for the next meal.<br />-----<br />Follow up: After two boxes, my cat is not so enthusiastic about it anymore. He would lick all the juice up and leave the content (especially the red color meat) in his dish...:-( He also doesn't like the chicken & duck flavor. If they sell only the chicken soup for cats, my cat would love it. The seafood (especially) tuna was a success for the first and second time and then he just doesn't like it any more. But he still likes his fancy feast grilled. So I guess I have to keep searching for alternatives...

review/summary: Whiskas Purrfectly Chicken & Beef Pouches
review/text: My cats love this.  The meat does not look like chicken or beef to me. However the Whiskas "Cat Chefs" know what the kitty cats like.  My picky bunch love to pig down on it. I was even able to sneak in their monthly flea meds with it with no problem.  A first ! The only down side is the juice runs out on the top of the package when you open it. So I just snip the top a tiny bit first then, hold a second and pull open. No mess to clean up then.<br />Will purchase again.

review/summary: Whiskas Tuna Entree for Cats
review/text: After Wal-mart discontinued the tuna packets product from Whiskas I turned to Amazon and found that I could purchase this product by the case (24).  This has been the best wet food our cat has ever had, and this is how we deliver his medicine, pulverized into the tuna!  He is a picky eater and has rejected every other wet product we have found.  So, I am very happy with this product and by subscribing for an automatic monthly delivery, using Amazon Prime, I am saving money and paying less than I did at Wal-mart.  Amazon Prime takes care of the postage and the automatic subscription saved me even more.  I know I sound like a shill, but I am a happy cat owner.

review/summary: my cat prefers this over the other Whiskas brands
review/text: My cat is a fussy eater.  I have to cycle between two or three different varieties of cat food in order to keep her happy - and eating!  She'd much rather yowl all day long, than eat the same meal twice in a row.<br /><br />So, when I discovered that she actually likes all three flavors of this Whiskas Purrfectly Fish variety pack, I was very pleased.  (Incidentally, she doesn't like two of the flavors in the other Purrfectly fish variety pack, but oh well...)  Also, this is a pretty good price for 4 packs of 10 pouches.<br /><br />I would have been happy to give this food five stars, except for a few minor issues.  For starters, pouches are always difficult to open and the food inside tends to often be messy to serve.  I've often gotten my hands splattered in juice, whilst I'm trying to feed a hungry cat.<br /><br />The major issue I have with the food is that it comes in one big piece.  When you open the pouch, it kinda slithers out - which is a bit less messy than feeding chunks (and at least all of the meat does come out of the pouch) but my cat won't eat this stuff until I chop it up for her.  Usually, that's not easy when she likes to shove her head in the bowl and start licking up the juice.<br /><br />She'll probably tire of this brand given a few more months, but for now, she definitely really likes it and I appreciate that I have three varieties of flavor to offer her.

When I mixed the Whiskas Chicken and Duck with his Whiskas dry about 10 minutes later he licked his plate clean.

She did a lot of throwing up and had the runs so I immediately switched to a natural canned cat food, all back to normal - no more sickness.<br /><br />My even greater concern with these flavors is the tuna/salmon - not only are you feeding them things they can't really process{wheat/corn} but your also feeding them a daily dose of mercury. Worth it?? You tell me when you get the vet bills that could have rather been spent on good food.

They did not do this when I served competing National Brands. My Cats also love Wiskas dry Cat Food which I make available to them 24 hours a day in a special serving bowl for that.

However,  when I brought this flavor of Whiskas out all 8 of them gathered around the food dish and gobbled it up as if they were starving.

review/text: Okay, so I admit I spoil my cat.  These Whiskas Purrfectly Tuna pouches are hit with my furry kiddos. The pouches are easily to open, just simply grasp at the notch and twist.  The food is relatively easy to get out of the package.  I found it easier to massage the bags first before opening to mix the filling up, otherwise you'll end up with one blob of congealed cat food.  Sometimes I'll still need to use a fork to separate and clean out the pouch.<br /><br />These pouches per ounce maybe more expensive than some of the other canned food, but the convenience of not using a can opener and easy at putting the food in the bowl are worth the extra nickel or two you might save.<br /><br />Truth wise, my cats love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283K02K">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Chicken & Beef, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 12)</a> and if given a taste test would probably prefer, but at about $1.46 per tub, they don't get to eat it very often.

I know that averages out to 3 stars, but there is no other food that my cats will eat day after day, so one more star for that.

review/summary: My cats favorite food
review/text: I use to get this product at my local Petsmart until they no longer carried it other than in a variety pack.  The Mackeral is their favoite and my cats were soooo upset when I couldn't get it. So I turned to Amazon to find it and now order it online in large quantities just to have it.  They're happy once again.

review/summary: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken Improved My Cats' Health
review/text: I used to never feed my cats wet food because they preferred dry and I thought it was fine as long as they drank plenty of water.  After losing one cat to death mysteriously and another one to kidney disease I decided to follow the advice of many on the web and switch to wet food.  I tried many brands including the most expensive, but my three cats prefer Whiskas Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken to all others.  I mix them together in the bowl.  All three of my cats run to the bowls to gobble up the food and they don't leave a morsel.  Also, my cats do not throw up this food like they do dry food.  I can't believe the change in their health.  In just a short time my two older boys went from being round fatties to having shape and nice healthy curves.  And their coats are absolutely gorgeous.  The oils in the food obviously create a nice sheen.  Also, the shedding is way down.  Thanks Whiskas and keep it comin'.

review/text: This is the only wet cat food that one of our cats will eat and we have been having problems always finding it in our local Wal-Mart.  So I was really pleased when I found that I could order it online and was also able to set up a schedule for monthly delivery.  I was even more pleased when I found that I could adjust the schedule when I needed to order it sooner than expected.  This is a great service for us and we have since set up another schedule for two of their other chicken products.

If your kitty likes tuna which looks like it came from a can - bon appetit!

review/text: These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original "Chips Ahoy!" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes.

review/text: Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie.

review/summary: Are We Reviewing Our Mistakes Or These Cookies?
review/text: Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of "calms" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not "crispy" cookies, or the blurb would say "crispy," rather than "chewy."  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.

He immediately liked it and would ask for one from time to time. Okay, they're only a tiny piece of candy and they're sugar free. What harm could it do? Well, then I started using them as little rewards and small incentives to do things. It worked. Finally, one day when I ran out and wanted to pick up some more, I found the Ice Breakers Sours (Mixed Berry) and I started using them. At first, he seemed startled at the drastic change in flavor. Now he loves them, more than the mint. Well, I like them too. I still prefer the mint as a breath freshener, but these little Sours are my boy's favorites.<br /><br />Gary Peterson.

review/summary: They never made it to Thanksgiving Day...
review/text: When I purchased these, I was hesitant about buying such a large quantity.  After all, I really only use them for making a green bean casserole.  Well, on the night I received the shipment, I stashed them away thinking I'd be holding on to 2.5 huge bags for half a year.<br /><br />I was horribly mistaken.<br /><br />My friends and family went through three bags in two weeks.  Thanksgiving is right around the corner and I had to order ANOTHER three bags.<br /><br />I don't know if French's improved their recipe, but from what I remember as a kid, the onions were good for chef's treat while cooking in the kitchen.  Though crunchy, they weren't crispy and they still had a moist coating to them right out of the can, a coating that actually coated the tongue after a few bites.  Once that happened, I was done until they were baked in the oven atop the casserole.<br /><br />It could be the bag they're packaged in that makes the difference, but they are MUCH crispier than the ones you get in the can.  I'm not sure if it's an accurate description, but the ones in the can almost taste underdone or maybe the can itself retains more moisture.  That's not the case with the bag and my family tore through them like fiends after potato chips.  I have to admit, I'm addicted too, but I've hidden away one bag for Thanksgiving Day.  There's no way I'm buying a third shipment...well, at least not until December, anyhow.<br /><br />All in all, I never thought this product could get any better.  It has and we're loving it.

review/summary: 3 LARGE Bags
review/text: I love these large bags! I use these onion rings for coating baked chicken and pork chops and the large size is very convenient and a much better value than the smaller sizes found in the grocery stores. I am able to find this large size at Sam's, but only around the Thanksgiving season. I suppose they feel we use these large sizes during holidays.

review/summary: Rip Off Price for Crystal Lite
review/text: I was deceived. I was looking thru crystal lite  selections and found most of the offers were for 4 packages of 4 packs which gives you 16 containers. For about $39, which would cost about the same in supermarket.<br /><br />So without reading one ad  real close I order a four pack and that is what I got 4 containers not a 4 pack of 4 for 16--- for $39 cost in supermarket $10.<br /><br />For $39 I thought I was buying a four pack of 4 packs a total of 16 cans. Which sell for about $2.50 each in supermarket. instead I got only 1 four pack which at the rate they are charging is almost $10 each--4 times the supermarket price.

review/summary: Delicious, Inexpensive Hydration with Minimal Calories
review/text: Crystal Light is a great way to cut calories from your diet, while saving a remarkable amount of money.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  CUT CALORIES:<br />  - Overall, males consume an average of 178 kcal from sugar drinks on any given day, while females  consume 103 kcal, as reported by the CDC study(Center for Disease Control). You can drink your fill of Crystal Light every day and consume less than one tenth of the calories you would drinking either juice or soda, making it probably the most effective way ever to cut calories. If you drank about 2 liters of Crystal Light every day, according to the nutrition information, you would consume 5 calories for every serving of 8 fl. oz. Since there are about 33.814 fl oz./liter, 2 liters would net you 42 calories (the way I mix it with extra flavor would probably be about 55 or 60 calories a day), which is still great when you consider that the average man just cut more than 100 calories a day from his diet. Sugar drinks represent at least 6% of the average Americans caloric intake. To put it in perspective, the average 2 liter bottle of soda is between 800 and 1000 calories (kcal). Cutting that alone will result in noticeable weight loss over the long-term.<br /><br />  SAVE MONEY:<br />  - Volume wise, you will save an exorbitant amount of money switching to Crystal Light from either soda  or juice. Just replacing soda at anywhere between $.49 and $1.00/liter (if you're buying in bulk, not including purchases from vending machines, restaurants, etc...) with Crystal Light at a max of $.30/liter (depends how you mix the beverage; i like a lot of flavor) will save the average person in the U.S. (consumed 219 liters of soft drinks/yr (2002)) from $41.61 and $218.70. That isn't even including the money that would be saved by also removing other sugar-based beverages from the diet, like juice or other fruit drinks. Don't even get me started on beer, wine, wine coolers, etc... and the cost difference.<br /><br />  TASTES DELICIOUS:<br />  - Ok, I'm not going to lie. Some of the flavors are delicious, some are NOT:<br />  - Fruit Punch [*delicious] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9ZQ">Crystal Light Fruit Punch Drink Mix (12-Quart), 2.04-  Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br />  - Cranberry Apple [*delicious] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9YM">Crystal Light Natural Cranberry Apple Drink Mix (12-Quart) 2.3-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a><br />  - Strawberry Kiwi [*extra delicious] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9W4">Crystal Light  Strawberry Kiwi Drink Mix (12-Quart), 2.3-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a><br />  - Pink Lemonade [*alright but kinda watery] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OCBSS6">Crystal Light On The Go Pink Lemonade,  10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br />  - Orange Sunrise [*downright, horrifyingly disgusting] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9SI">Crystal Light Sunrise Classic  Orange Drink Mix (10-Quart), 2.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />  - !!!Try Mixing the flavors together; I have had great success with my experiments!!! ;)<br /><br />  NEW PACKAGING:<br />  - The new method of delivery is as easy as it is awesome. It is great to be able to slowly pour the plastic tubes of powder, rather than the tubs, which exploded in a cloud of pink powder all over my face every time I tried to add them. They also easier to open, especially for those of use who don't have fingernails to peal those pesky, foil wrappings off.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS:<br />  - You definitely take a risk consuming non-sugar beverages that still taste sweet and delicious. No one really knows how these type of drinks will affect human physiology in the long term. Obviously the healthiest alternative to drinking sugar-engorged beverages like cola and strawberry daiquiris would be to just drink water, but we all know that NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO DO THAT. DUH!<br /><br />  STAINS:<br />  - The red, colored drinks stain everything. They will stain the hell out of your hands bright red, and every passerby will ask you why it looks like you just fought the battle of Persepolis. Don't get it on your clothes. It is even hard to get the stain off counter-tops and tables. Don't be a KLUTZ!

review/text: Amazon says that I have purchased this before. I sure did and I liked it at the price I paid at the time. The flavor is good and I can distinguish both the apple and the cranberry flavors.  However, at three times what I previously paid it is not worth it. Other flavors that I like equally are much less expensive.

review/summary: Hard to find flavor - cranberry apple.
review/text: Excellent product.  Wal-Mart appears to have discontinued it's Great Value Cranberry Apple Drink Mix which I prefer, but only becasuse it comes in single packets.  The Crystal Light product tastes just as good, but it comes in packets that are usually used for mixing in quart containers instead of individual bottles.  A little inconvenient but I've solved that by mixing 2 bottles at once.  I am fairly good at splitting the powder equally between the two bottles.  Not quite as easy for taking with in the car, but ok.<br /><br />All in all, if you have to substitute, this is a great tasting product.  Individual packets would be nice.  The only other inconvience I've found so far is that I cannot find this product in stores either, but had to search on-line to buy it.  Every other flavored cran-xxxx (strawberry, raspberry, kiwi, etc.) can be found in stores.  Who knew cranberry apple would be so hard to find.

I bought all I could and assumed the worst.<br /><br />Googling to find out if the product had been officially discontinued, I discovered this product listing. Hooray!<br /><br />This flavor is great because it isn't kiddy-drink sweet and thick. It is light, a little tart, and good for drinking all day.<br /><br />I have no idea why the grocery stores won't give it any love, but I'm sure glad it is available here!

review/text: I'm sorry to say I didn't try crystal lite for a long time even tho my mom offered it to me several times.  Now that I have diabetes I decided to try it. There are some flavors that I like, but when I tried cranberry apple I absolutly loved it.  It isn't too sweet like some of the flavors and dosen't leave an after taste like some of the other flavors.  I am really sorry the stores have stopped carrying it which means the company must have stopped supplying it, but as long as I can continue to purchase it online all is good in my world.  Thanks

review/summary: Has its moments!
review/text: Something about Crystal Light that I have been unable to shake off. The chemical side of this product sometimes overpowers the desire to believe one is drinking an all natural combination of Cranberry Apple. Happens with most flavors, actually. Then there will be particular moments when a glass of this one mix will taste just great as a refreshment. Of course I know it is made of many things that haves little to do with the real deal, like their lemonade, per say. You know it is not lemonade but on a hot day and with a thirsty body it really tastes very good, quite enjoyable. I notice they do get used sooner or later, but not very often bought. In our household I seem to be the one that drinks it the most. Could it be that I feel responsible since I am the one ordering it? I like their orange juice type and sometimes I been known to add some real fruit juice, directly from an orange or lemon, to add more convincing power to the drink. I guess what I am trying to say it that one can not beat the real deal but for all those times when it is inconvenient, not practical to shop and juice, Crystal Light fills a certain need and it does it in a respectable manner. Always that need for the sweet versus a pure glass of water, I guess. For the money is a good value specially when they are at a nice discount and who can beat the convenience of using amazon prime to deliver it right to your door. 3.5 Stars.

review/summary: Best of any powdered drink mixes
review/text: Hooked on this flavor combo several years ago.  Not the cloyingly syrupy-sweet flavors found in punch and berry mixes.  Tart / sweet combo just right for summer or winter or anytime of the year.  Have mixed with filtered well and tap water (chlorinated) without degradation of taste.  As others have mentioned, seems that many stores have discontinued this flavor in favor of the orange / tea /lemon 'standards.'  Highly recommend for more refined tastes.  Year + shelf-life as per dates on canister.

review/text: Remember that old joke where one person says "What flavor Kool-Aide is that?" and the other person responds "Red."? Well that's kind of the situation here. This drink doesn't remotely taste of cranberry or apple, but it's not horrible tasting either. I most likely won't be reordering this, because I only tried it as an alternative to the more expensive Ocean Spray cranberry drink mixes and it appears you get what you pay for. I'll stick to Crystal Light for Iced Tea and Lemonade, which have always been excellent.

The color is rich and red, there is space in the bags for the tea leaves to expand properly, and there is no dust whatsoever. The flavor is rich and smooth and bright, even after a full 4-minute steep. The little individual wrappings are very convenient for travel, sturdy enough to stuff into a pocket or the bottom of a cluttered purse.  These packets will not open until you open them, and keep the teabag in excellent condition.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the Two Leaves and a Bud loose Assam.

review/text: I think I need to look for an Irish Breakfast tea because this is not dark/strong enough for me.  By the time I add sweetener and cream I dont get the same taste I am looking for.  What I would like to see "Two Leaves and a Bud" come out with is a:<br /><br />Decaf Irish Breakfast Tea<br /><br />But on its own with no cream just a little sweetener it is ok, but nothing to write home about.

review/summary: Decent tea, but lots of packaging
review/text: The tea itself is pretty good -- very smooth, sturdy flavor.  Not too much to say about that part.<br /><br />However, I hadn't entirely appreciated how much packaging was involved -- this is a big box of organdy (that is, cotton) teabags, each of which is sealed in a hefty plastic bag.  I was expecting something more modest and more readily recyclable.

review/summary: Extravagant? Yes!  Good tea? Yes!
review/text: The tea is excellent. Assam tea is a smooth but hearty black tea.  I am a bit disappointed in the excessive packaging. I bought this as a gift for my daughter and was delighted to find it once again with free shipping on Amazon.  This is a special tea and makes a wonderful treat or a gift.

review/summary: OK tea, not very ecological packaging
review/text: The quality of tea is mediocre, but it is OK for the price. I suppose I shouldn't even compare it with Assam tea from the brand like Mariage Fr&egrave;res. I bought it because it is organic, hoping to support more green products. However, it comes with excessive plastic wraps. All tea bags are individually wrapped with over-sized plastic wraps. I'd much prefer those products which have coherent philosophy about their organic products to something like this. Next time I'll buy old-fashioned loose tea in a paper bag or tin container.

review/summary: Great Item
review/text: I purchased this when I was planning to make and freeze baby food for my daughter. What I like about them is that they are easy to pop after food is frozen, unlike regular ice trays. After they freeze, I just put the baby food in freezer bags and it's working great. Gave it 4 stars because they are a little pricey.

review/summary: Monkey Platter!
review/text: This tray makes a perfect monkey platter for a toddler! Before purchasing this I was putting items directly onto my son's booster tray or using several small dishes, but this is a way better solution. There are seven deep wells, perfectly toddler-sized. I can put a few heaping spoonfuls of yogurt in one, some brown rice in another, diced squash, some chopped apple, steamed spinach.. a bit of this and a bit of that. The monkey platter approach is a great way to encourage small children to try a wide variety of foods without overwhelming them and this tray is PERFECT. It's also cute and easy to clean.

review/summary: Works, but expensive
review/text: Basically my title sums it up.  This works, so I like it, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.  Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now.
