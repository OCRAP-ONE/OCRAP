review/text: Baby white popcorn from Wabash Farms pops nicely, has no meanacing hulls to get into your teeth, and is very tasty. What more could you ask from a popcorn? I highly recommend this product. At least a four star.

review/summary: Very good popocorn
review/text: My doctor told me I must eat "hulless" popcorn if I have popcorn at all.  Because I can't give up my favorite snack, I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn.  The kernels are tiny, but they pop well, although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store.  It tastes great, however, and has fewer and smaller hulls.  I don't think there is such a thing as completely hulless,but Ido notice thst I don't get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore.

My nine year old daughter didn't like popcorn until she reluctantly tried this. After a few bites, she consumed half the bowl!<br /><br />I bought mine at a specialty popcorn shop in Long Grove IL, so I didn't have to pay shipping costs, but when it's gone, I might have to bite the bullet and order it from here.

review/text: Wish I would have read the reviews that discuss the product's performance in hot air poppers.  The PC is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth...4 stars.<br /><br />Problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop.  Tilting the machine helps keep them inside, but it would be simpler just to find another larger kernel corn.

review/summary: Amish Country Baby White Popcorn
review/text: We've enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the Movie Theater Popcorn.  It's light and fluffy - tender - and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no "palm" oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more.

review/summary: Great little mini popcorn!
review/text: I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago, which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company). I thought...what the heck; I've always wondered how "gourmet" popcorn differed from Orville or other everyday popcorn brands.<br /><br />Let me tell you...IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY! I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, "normal" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.<br /><br />My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil, sea salt, black pepper, and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray. YUMMY!!!!<br /><br />I've tried the other Amish Country popcorn, and they're all good. This is my favorite, though!

review/summary: Okay but there's much better
review/text: This is my first time trying Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Baby White.<br /><br />Pros: It's okay with a nice mild nutty flavor. The hulls are more pronounced than with some other Amish "Baby White."<br /><br />Cons: It tends not to briskly pop up. In fact, we've burned several pans because popping it is tricky. We found that the microwave often works better than pan popping. And as mentioned above, the hulls are much more noticeable than with other Amish "Baby White" brands.<br /><br />We purchased these 6 bags and we'll use them up but won't be ordering any more. Next time we'll drive the long distance to our nearest Amish store.

review/summary: This is not hull-less popcorn! Or even close.
review/text: Bought 6lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this Baby White than on regular popcorn.  Not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn, the corn pops up so tiny that it's about 1/3 hull, 2/3 popped corn per kernel! I was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls.<br />I popped this using every tip I could find on the internet; all experiments still resulted in a tough hull.

review/summary: A great popcorn for small children!
review/text: This popcorn is much smaller than your average popcorn, and it is virtually hulless.  That is exactly what I was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old LOVES popcorn.  With 3 year old children, you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums.  My son has no trouble eating this popcorn.  It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.<br /><br />This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time!

review/text: I bought this with the whirly pop popcorn popper, and I made some as soon as I got them. It is the best popcorn I've had. I thought I would mind the smaller kernel size, but I didn't. There is substantially less hull than regular popcorn. The flavor is great. I suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn. It gives popcorn a great nutty taste - really delicious. You can buy peanut oil at any oriental (Asian) store. It's better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect. You won't need butter flavor or anything like that again (artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals). Now, we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of junkfood. Try it and you'll be popping like us.

review/text: The Popcorn was delivered as promised in an attractive wrapper. I used the Whirley Pop popcorn maker and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper. While the majority of the kernels popped, there was also a large amount of 'seeds' or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat distracting while you're eating. I actually got better results using Orville Redenbacher White Popcorn Kernels in the Whirley Popper (and it was actually cheaper at the local market). Overall I give Amish Country 3 out of 5 stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results.

Amazon suggested I search out the item again, and in doing so I see that this same vendor states the item is available. Not so.<br /><br />Technically this review does not relate to the quality of the product, just the ability to be able to ship it. Good luck!

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: I was so disappointed with this tea. i bought a box during lunchtime looking forward to a nice cup of tea in the afternoon. I made the cup and took a sip - YUCK. It tasted fishy to me but couldn't figure out why tea would taste fishy so I read the ingredients. I wish I had read them before - the second listed ingredient is an oil blend of tuna oil, soy oil, and soy lecithin. Just the thought of tuna oil in my tea is enough to make me gag - the actual taste is just as bad.

review/text: I am always looking for ways to get in Omega-3's and find a lot of pills to incur those "fishy" burps hours after taking them plus the routine of remembering to take the pills daily.  I love tea both hot and iced so I was quite excited to try this one...tea + Omega 3's...perfect.  I smelled the fishy smell before I even tasted the tea.  I did force myself to tast it and took about two sips then had to pour out the whole pitcher I had brewed.  It is quite fishy tasting.  Ridiculously so.  Glad I bought the box on sale so I don't feel bad about tossing it but it is so bad I can't even fathom making someone else go through the smell and tasting I just did.

review/summary: Fish Berry Tea
review/text: I picked this up at my local store and after brewing poured it out right away. The first thing you taste is bad fish, then a berry taste. It was so gross. I read the label and tuna oil is how they get the Omega 3. I should have picked up a pomegranate flavor with out the omega 3. I wrote an email to Bigelow since my satisfaction was not met. I will see if I get a response. Disgusting, I had to brew something else to get the taste out. Learned my lesson- fish oil does not go in tea!

Honestly, I never even noticed the Omega 3 on the package and I especially didn't taste anything fishy in the tea (I don't like fish either).  Anyway, I loved this tea. I even made it into a cold drink for guests and they liked it too.

review/text: The variety, not the brand, was recommended by a friend. Five stars is given with the caveat that other brands were not tried for comparison. The Choice Organic Russian Caravan blend seems to be the only such blend easily available in tea bags.  The unit cost of the product is an excellent value here on amazon, compared to other sellers' offers.<br /><br />The tea is a bit more delicate than one might expect, based on description. Steeping five minutes is recommended, for a full-flavored experience.  The flavor is delightful -- a good black tea, but with a distinctive smoky quality.

review/summary: Fresh from the Samovar
review/text: Choice "Russian Caravan" tea is excellent! It's got an unusually smoky flavor, and it is stronger than most black teas. Black teas are for the most part caffeinated, but they don't usually have a distinctive roasted flavor. Tea is an essential part of Russian fare;traditional Russian hospitality meant bringing out the samovar with sugar cubes (along with bread and salt) This tea would taste great while looking out onto the Pacific Ocean from Fort Ross, the southernmost Russian outpost in Sonoma County, California, settled in 1812. It's good for a rainy day, while curled up reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400079985">War and Peace (Vintage Classics)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199536066">Anna Karenina (Oxford World's Classics)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1434677702">Plays by Anton Chekhov- Second Series</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OEJE6Y">Complete Works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky (Illustrated)</a>, or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057DC3GO">Russia Against Napoleon: The True Story of the Campaigns of War and Peace</a>. Leo Tolstoy was from Tula, famous for its samovars, and its saying was "taking a samovar to Tula" an equivalent to "carrying coals to Newcastle."<br /><br />Russian Caravan has a delicious, spicy, roasted, exotic flavor.

review/text: I bought several boxes of these cookies for Christmas gifts and had one box left over.  I decided to try them with my coffee one morning and got the surprise of my life.  THESE ARE THE BEST COOKIES, THIS SIDE OF HEAVEN!  I've never tasted anything quite as good.  They're simple little bite size cookies, but surprisingly they do take you back...back to a time when things were simpler, and happier. As cookies go, these are quite a healthy choice.  I tend to look for products using wheat flour.  They made me remember my grandmother's kitchen, as she baked special treats for the family.  All I can say is they are simply amazing, and you'll do yourself a great disservice if you don't try them.  It'll take care of that need for "something sweet", without all the calories. I promise, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Great Tea, but Don't Buy it Here (Price Gouging!)
review/text: When my local Asian grocer stopped carrying the small tin of Japanese matcha green tea powder I'd been purchasing, I searched for a comparable (price/quality) alternative.  Amazon, as always, was my first stop, but to no avail.  Instead, I found this identical green tea powder from The Republic of Tea at Whole Foods Market, for $17.99.  Wondering to myself, "How did I miss this on Amazon?" I came back here to look it up, planning to make all subsequent purchases here.  Imagine my shock to find it listed for twice the price (almost $40) as what is arguably the planet's highest end grocery chain.<br /><br />This is a great, high quality green tea powder, especially for smoothies.  That said, don't fall for this price gouging.  Please visit your local Whole Foods or other health food store first, where you'll find it at half the price.  If they don't stock it on the shelves, go to customer service and I'm sure they'll order it for you, at no extra cost.  Shame on You, [It's A Treasure]!!! (seller)  When they cease their price gouging and bring the price back in line to a reasonable retail price point, I'll change my rating to reflect the actual product, but as it stands there's no way I'm going to award 5 stars and assist this seller in continuing to gouge the public.

review/summary: Not what I was expecting.
review/text: The only other matcha I have tried is the Teavana Matcha which was great. It went down creamy and smooth and had a nice light flavor without too much bitterness. There is also a savory after taste that lingers on the palate which I liked very much. I've read up from a couple reviews that the Teavana version isn't quite the real deal which was a bit off-putting and got me to thinking- man, how much better does the real matcha taste!? I only ran out of my Teavana Matcha and already I was craving so out of impulsiveness, drove down to my local Whole Foods and bought the Republic of Tea Matcha. Great packaging, had me sold! As for the tea itself? I opened the canister and the product was sealed inside a foiled envelope with a snap seal. I inspected the powder and found it chalky in feel and a darker green color, a sage tint which doesn't seem like authentic matcha. I found that in mixing this powder it dissolves well (I am not using a bamboo whisk to make my matcha [yet!]). The flavor is different, has more bitterness to it, a vegetal taste, with a thin texture- ding, ding ding! NOT MATCHA. I don't have enough experience with other brands but from what I've read of others and from my experience with the Teavana brand, this left me a bit disappointed. I will say that the flavor is not bad at all but has more of a regular green tea taste except much stronger. I will continue to use the product because it does give me that calm yet alert feel that I got from my previous brand so not complaining there. Not bad, not great, it's decent at best. If you are looking for matcha, steer clear of this brand. This is just a powdered green tea in my opinion, not matcha!!

review/summary: Terrible quality
review/text: I am a regular matcha drinker, and have been buying matcha from Mitsuwa or Sunrise Mart NYC for years, but bought this Republic of Tea matcha at the local Whole Foods. The colour of the tea is nothing like in the image on the package, it is a dull green (which means more oxidation and stems). There are usually three qualities of matcha: ceremonial, universal, and culinary. I am giving this tea 1 star because it is culinary quality at best. Don't waste your money.<br /><br />If you want good matcha, is best to try the universal quality Maeda-En (gold package). Or if you want to splurge, try the ceremonial (black package) quality, both for sale here on amazon or straight from the Maeda-en Website.

review/summary: Famous British Cereal, Introduced in 1932, Tastes Great
review/text: When I saw Weetabix in my local grocery a few months ago, I just had to try it!  How many breakfast foods do you know of, that get mentioned frequently in British novels and on BBC television programs?<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the whole grain "biscuits" are delicious.  They're nutritious, too:  two biscuits with skim milk (no sugar required) provide 170 calories (10 from fat), 130mg sodium, 150mg potassium, 29g carbohydrates (including 4g dietary fiber and 2g sugar), 4g protein, no cholesterol, and a few vitamins and minerals.  The biscuits themselves (12 to a package, or 6 servings) are light, crisp, and flaky.<br /><br />According to the package, "Weetabix is great on its own or with milk".  However the biscuits are very dry, so I can't imagine eating them plain.  When you add low-fat milk (1% or 2%), the biscuits soak the milk up quickly.  If you don't eat your Weetabix right away, the biscuits will break apart and your morning cereal will be a little soggy.<br /><br />But I like Weetabix, even when it's soggy, because of the delicate flavor and pleasant texture.  Weetabix has now replaced my previous favorite adult fiber cereal, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037N1ZEW">Post Shredded Wheat Original Cereal, Spoon Size</a>, and has become an almost daily habit.  The pack of 12 boxes seems like a lot of Weetabix--72 servings--but it's actually about a 2-1/2 month supply for one person.

review/text: If the can wasn't labeled "pomegranate," I wouldn't have known what flavor it was.  This drink is very fizzy and tastes tangy and vaguely citrusy like Sprite or the old Fresca, but I definitely didn't taste pomegranate.  The ingredients list a blend of six fruit juices, and it's pretty much a muddle, in my opinion.<br /><br />There is no added sugar and each 8 ounce can has 80 calories.  This drink might be a good substitute for an alcoholic drink served in a pretty glass, or as a base for punch, but I wouldn't choose it as a thirst-quencher or when I want a true juice flavor.

review/summary: Izze drinks related to Fibromyalgia type pain
review/text: I was drinking a bottle or two of these per day to help me lose weight (these got me off Pepsi).  I began to have very bad skin pain and muscle pain in my side and arms, wrists after about 2 weeks of drinking these.  I was going to the doctor for the pain and was about to be diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  I started an elimination diet as a last resort because I had not always had this pain (only recently).  After stopping the Izze drinks just by chance because I ran out and the store I was getting them at did not have the flavors I liked, the pain went away.  This pain was very bad.  I was becoming a person who could not have my children or spouse hug or touch me.  My clothes hurt where they touched my sides.  It hurt to sleep and lay on the mattress with my side.  I may be the only person to experience this and realize it may be some kind of allergy to some product in this drink.

review/summary: Stayin' true to the fruit
review/text: I must admit that, being the ripe old age of 31 and part-time middle-school teacher, I didn't quite understand the kids' fascination with Izze drinks.  They bright juice color and brighter, young-looking packaging caused me to theorize that these drinks were just the same-old stuff with a clever marketing angle.<br /><br />Then I tried one.<br /><br />The quality of the product is certainly outstanding.  Pomegranate is a trendy flavor these days, yet many of the pomegranate-flavored products on the market don't adequately reflect the fruit's unique flavor.  Izze, as it says on the can, "stays true to the fruit" and it is evident in the fact that their pomegranate drink actually tastes like pomegranate.  The flavor is full, yet not overpowering, and the flavor tends to stay in your mouth for some time.  Although the product is made with carbonated water, there is certainly no "coca-cola" quality to it.  There is not excessive carbonation, but rather the light carbonation of the water tends to enhance the flavor of the juice itself--yet another way in which Izze stays true to the fruit.<br /><br />It appears as if the middle-schoolers have a more refined taste than I gave them credit for.  Izze Pomegranate drink is excellent.  I highly recommend this product and will be sure to keep it around the house, myself.

review/text: Despite the fact that Izze Sparkling Pomegranate juice beverage has 19g of sugar, it is not too sweet. In fact, it has a very refreshing fruity taste, which is enhanced by the light carbonation.<br /><br />It's made from concentrates of juices, including apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate. The rest of the mix is comprised of sparkling water, fruit & vegetable coloring, and added vitamins like C & B6 (very small amounts).<br />Even though it contains lemon and cranberrry juice concentrates, it isn't too tart.<br /><br />All in all, it's a nice alternative to soda. And here's a little extra something I experimented with: mixed with a little wine (I used Sangria) it made a great wine cooler! ;)<br /><br />It's also low sodium and has just 80 calories per 8.4 fl. oz. All this and the fact that the Izze company does philanthropic/educational work for needy kids, and you've got a winning product.

This is more in the tradition of the European "lemonades"--fizzy water and fruit juice with little or no sugar.<br /><br />The can is the size of one of those energy drinks. (8oz.) If you like a fizzy drink now and then, I can't think of anything better. I don't drink soda, diet or regular (no point to either.) Izze, however, is quite nice. Try it.

review/summary: Refreshing, light, nice alternative to soda -- from a company with a conscience!
review/text: This review focuses on the pomegranate and grapefruit flavors of Izze.<br /><br />Izze's all natural sparkling juice is a nice alternative to soda.  There is no caffeine, no processed sugar, and no unnatural ingredients.  It is refreshing to read the ingredients and find that I recognize every ingredient!  And they are all safe!<br /><br />The pomegranate juice is mixed in with a bit of grape and apple juice, to mitigate a mild (but not unpleasant) bitter citrus aftertaste, somewhat like grapefruit juice.  The sparkle has a feel closer to sparkling water than to carbonated soda -- and I like that.  It is a distinctive flavor -- and I like that too.  I wasn't sure what to think after just one can, but after trying it a couple of times I have found that it is quite nice.<br /><br />I liked the ruby red grapefruit flavor all at once -- it has the perfect grapefruit flavor, the sweet tangy delicious zing, without the bitter aftertaste of grapefruit.  It is not too sweet, but just right for that grapefruit flavor fix that I like now and again.  This is the perfect size container, especially for my kids who also love the grapefruit flavor.  Good stuff.<br /><br />What I also like is that Izze appears to be a company with a conscience.  Started by a couple of friends in 2003 who liked the idea of an all natural and distinctive beverage as an alternative to soda, Izze uses their product as a platform from which to promote awareness of the Global Education Fund (and other good causes, both environmental and global) that they support.

review/text: Pomegranate: My first sip of Izze's Sparkling Pomegranate was not appreciated by my palate very much; I thought it tasted like someone had mixed a wine cooler with beer. I actually did a double take to look at the can and search for alcohol content. By the end of the can I liked it, and by the 3rd can I really liked it. It's tangy, fresh, with no sweet aftertaste and has a cool looking container design (aesthetics always matter!).<br /><br />With a total of 80 calories per cute little can, this isn't exactly what you'd call a "diet drink," but I find it to be surprisingly filling, so it makes a great in-between liquid snack, and can stave away the hunger pangs until your next meal without doing damage to your diet.<br /><br />Overall a nifty drink in a most attractive can. Don't let the first taste fool you. Izze's Pomegranate Fizzy is quite yummy...a very pleasurable acquired taste.<br />.......................................<br />Grapefruit: Izze's Sparkling grapefruit is absolutely the best drink in a can I have ever tasted. Nothing is even a close 2nd. Tangy and refreshing, its lemony grapefruit flavor is quite strong and tantalizing. It also contains white grape, apple and orange juice from concentrates, but what my taste buds remember most is the lemon and grapefruit. The Grapefruit flavor has 90 calories per can, for those counting calories, but like the Pomegranate, it's very filling, and does well as an "in-between" snack for dieters.<br /><br />This wonderful Izze fizzy is addictive. On a hot day cold Sparkling Grapefruit is a total delight, and since it does not have refined sugars it truly takes away your thirst, not like those soda pop drinks that actually seem to make one thirstier. Thank you Izze, your Sparkling Grapefruit gets the gold award for canned beverage in my house.<br />If you're into "hard likker," Izze's Grapefruit would make the perfect mixer, for vodka or tequila.

review/summary: It's NOT Pomegranate Juice and Tastes Bitter
review/text: I've enjoyed Izze drinks in the past and for the past year and a half have been drinking pomegranate juice whenever I get the chance.  When I learned about Izze's FORTIFIED ALL NATURAL SPARKLING POMEGRANATE JUICE, I was rather excited at the prospect of tasting some. I was rather disappointed.  To begin with, even though this product is labeled as pomegranate juice, it's a misnomer because this is not real pomegranate juice.  Instead it's a hybrid containing juices from concentrates of apples, white grapes, pineapples, lemons, cranberries, pomegranates, and a few other added vitamins.  The other vitamins don't bother me so much, but when a product is labeled and marketed as pomegranate juice, that's what a person should expect to get, not a mixture of a bunch of juices only one of which is pomegranate.  Besides the false labeling, the drink is quite bitter and hard to drink.  Drinking the beverage straight from the cans doesn't quite cut it (it tastes a bit metallic) and I've had to pour the stuff in a glass with ice.  Perhaps the absorption of the ice takes away part of the bitterness, but I've found the drink tastes much better this way.  But, overall, you'd best just avoid buying the stuff altogether.

review/summary: Okay
review/text: I've tried both the pomegranate and the blackberry. Of the two, I prefer the pomegranate.<br /><br />I don't mind that is only 70% juice, that seems fine and they seem sweet enough. But, unlike the 100% sparkling grape juice I have had in the past, these two Izze flavors leave my mouth feeling somewhat dry...in a way I have not experienced with other drinks. These 8.4 fl.oz. cans contain Izze Fortified which means fortified with 10% of the USRDA of Vitamin C, Vitamin 6 and Niacin. It appears from the Izze web site that Izze in 12 oz bottles is not fortified so I might one day want to try the non-fortified Izze and see what that is like.<br /><br />However, the 100% sparkling grape juice I can buy locally, although it comes in a much larger bottle so may not be as convenient, seems more economical so, if I wanted a sparking juice, I'd probably buy that instead. Or I might sometimes, but not often, want a sparkling water. But usually I am more than content with tap water. If I want fruit, I can alway eat fruit.

review/summary: Clean, crisp and an alternative to high fructose energy drinks
review/text: First impressions of IZZE Pomegranate (that's a funny word if you say it too many times):<br /><br />Attractive packaging and accurate descriptions on the labels with one exception. On the logo side of the can it says "Pure Fruit Juice", and I know this is childish, but then it says "& sparkling water fortified with vitamins." Well, that's hardly pure fruit juice. It has other stuff in it too. However, IZZE Beverages redeem themselves by actually not adding refined sugars or caffeine to the drink. This is something I can give to my children and not worry about Child Protective Services hunting me down. I was surprised to see that pomegranate (funny word!) is not the main ingredient. It's sixth on the list. Apple, white grape, clarified pineapple, lemon, cranberry and then pomegranate (teehee). I guess "Sparkling Pomegranate" sounded better to the marketing department than "Bubbly Clarified Pineapple Juice" (not funny sounding at all, which is also a definite negative in my personal selection of a thirst-quenching beverage).<br /><br />Taste. This is the good part. It's clean with a little sweet-tartness. Very nice balance and engages quite a few taste buds. It's fizzy and crisp. It kind of reminds me of the grape juice that I used to sneakily drink during church as a child, but with vitamin C, Niacin and B6. It has a nice, easy after taste that is not offensive like a few other drinks in this category.<br /><br />The profits. The company claims to be in partnership with the Global Education Fund "to help provide educational opportunities and resources to needy children around the world." And there's a kicker.<br /><br />The kicker: A lot of companies tout their philanthropic ventures. But with IZZE it appears that they actually do benefit humankind through a compassionate capitalism. The put their money to work! Employees, if the report is true, actually donate personal time for fund raisers and collect books in an IZZE vehicle. Those books are sent internationally to orphans and other needy children for their educational benefit. If you are involved with a school, you can partner with the Global Education Fund and do the same thing as IZZE. They are also involved in improving the "quality of life for children with chronic and life-threatening medical conditions" and programs promoting environmental responsibility and there's even more. Wow.<br /><br />And my two-year old loves it. She found a new treat. And now I have a new reward for positive behavior! bwahahahaha [pirate laugh]<br /><br />Great drink. Great company. I'm sold.

review/summary: To me it tasted great, refreshing, balanced, and it seemed very healthful
review/text: At the time of reviewing, I liked the idea of a healthful juice product that isn't "100% juice" (read: acidic or overly sweet). On the other hand, I didn't like overly diluted juices with added sugar - natural or artificial - either. IZZE seemed to be the juice product that I was looking for. It contains no refined sugars or artificial sweeteners. It's 70% juice, so it tasted sufficiently fruity to me. Because it's not 100% juice (with sparkling water added, which gives it a mild "kick"), to my palate it had just enough sweetness (from the juices themselves) and acidity. In addition, pomegranate juice seems to be renowned for its cancer-fighting properties. I considered this a healthful and tasteful juice product.

review/summary: Tasty, Refreshing Alternative Beverage
review/text: *****<br />This Izze Pomegranate Sparkling Juice isn't a soda and isn't a juice---it's a healthy alternative drink that's a bit of a combination of the two. It comes in a small can (8.4 oz) that I enjoy in a wine glass (it's about the amount of liquid in a very large glass of wine).<br /><br />Some pomegranate juices are sour, but this one is tasty and sweeter than most...actually it tastes like real pomegranate pieces (arils) do---perfect! It is a sparkling juice, and sweetened just with real fruit. Technically, pomegranates are considered a "superfood", so this is a healthy way of improving your diet via beverage choice. It's also fortified with vitamins C and B6 and niacin as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
