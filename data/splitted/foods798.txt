review/summary: Affordable Dog Puzzle!!!
review/text: I bought this puzzle to help entertain my smart and curious and food driven dogs. My "boys" love it! We play it every single day. Often to work on obedience (sit, get it, down, get it!) and just for fun administration of treats and even dinner. My golden retriever loves it, but is a chewer, so he must be supervised with it. He pulled the cups out and thought that in itself was the reward... LOL  but once I simply pointed to the treat hidden in the pawprint dish, he figured it out and was a happy camper. I also bought the spinner, which is actually my favorite of the two styles. I can get my golden's entire kibble allotment for one meal (we feed twice a day) inside it, so it slows down his feeding (so he doesn't gulp it down and get bloat). I know that my dogs love it by the perked ears and bouncing when they see me pick one of the toys up. They also sit and wait to be "released" to start their game. Great fun! The plastic is nice too since you can disinfect it easily or wash it in the sink without worrying about warping, splitting, or cracking wood like on the expensive models of similar toys. Plus, the price has been great and I found it at my local canine speciality store too!

review/summary: too easy, even for "not-so-smart" dogs
review/text: i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy, and *bonus* got a iive person on the phone (brownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so bright and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes---i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy.  See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further.<br /><br />However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys -- the Tail Teaser,  Egg Babies platypus and Hide-A-Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead.

review/summary: Affordable Fun for your Dog!
review/text: I have a golden retriever as well as a pembroke welsh corgi. They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the "name brand" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their "drive" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win!

review/summary: good even for dogs that might not be too bright
review/text: i have to admit - i was worried this was a big mistake when i first gave this toy to Bacon.  he was confused.  he first tried barking maniacally to get the treats to appear.  he then tried digging into the carpet next to the toy.  i wondered if i'd be able to send the toy back, as there was no way i would pull this toy out again if all it did is prove that my dog is not smart and barks too much.  luckily, within 15 minutes, he successfully unearthed a treat.  it's not an easy toy for him - but it's amazing to me that he has learned how to do it.  he's learned a bit of patience and problem solving.  two things i doubted he'd ever learn.<br /><br />the yellow plastic parts - we've lost one.  i'm really not sure what Bacon did with it.  i just use that open cubby as the 'easy hole' for him to find a treat in.  Bacon is a schnorkitzu (schnauzer yorkie shihtzu). i imagine larger dogs would chew the yellow parts up pretty quickly.<br /><br />i'm looking forward to getting another puzzle toy in the future.  i recommend this toy.

review/summary: Entertaining but too easy
review/text: My golden retriever was very excited to try out this new toy!  The first time we gave it to him it took several minutes to get all the tops off and get the food; however, by the third time it was introduced to him he had mastered it in 1-2 minutes.  We now use it as a way to feed him full meals so that he doesn't eat too fast.  Love that it is dishwasher safe but wish it kept him entertained a while longer.

review/text: This is the first time Lily ever saw this toy. She was able to move the parts and figure it out easily. She continued to play with it until see finished her dinner. It took a little time for her to figure out how to remove the pieces without them falling out but she stayed with it so it wasn't frustrating just stimulating. She finished her meal in 20 minutes and then grabbed a chew toy and jumped on the couch. I know Lily likes this toy and so do I. The price makes it extremely likable also. I will point out that Lily thought the yellow pieces were chew toys so I had to take them away when she was done with it. It's a fun quiet meal dispenser

review/summary: Good idea - implemention flawed. Maybe good for small dogs.
review/text: I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning "nosework" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I'll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don't see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective "nosing the flap" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2"x2" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could "find" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she "finds" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:34 Mins<br /><br /></span>My dog can get bored easily and when he's bored he's destructive and annoying.  So I try to find anything I can to keep his mind busy and hopefully wear him out.  He figured this toy out fast and gets his food in about 2 minutes, but he does really love it and he often settles down after playing with it.  My other dog (the chi x you see in the picture) has absolutely no interest in working for his food. So I guess it's not for all dogs, but if your dog is busy, this is a good way to occupy him for awhile.

review/summary: Good idea however....
review/text: This toy is not that great for my pug. He loves finding stuff in the little cups, however the yellow covers are impossible for him to get off. His mouth won't fit around them so he can't pick them up with his teeth, when he uses his nose to try to get at them the cups just fall back into place and if he uses his paws (that's when he's really frustrated) he winds up just flipping the whole thing over. I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped. It's not a bad toy as a starter puzzle but if your dog has done puzzles before, this one won't keep him interested. And if you have a dog with no snout, it's not really worth it.

review/text: I purchased the Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy.  Labs are exceptionally smart and I try to give mine, Autumn, a variety of challenging toys.  She loves her chew toys but she needs to be challanged.  First of all she found her toy under the tree wrapped and without a treat in it.  How did she do that?  With encouragement we allowed her to open her toy.  I took it away after she examined it.  While she wasn't looking I put a few treats in a few of the compartments.  It took her a few minutes to figure it out.  Next time, no challange at all.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.  It was too easy, but I think to some dogs it will be great, others fustrating.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043A71PU">Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy</a>

review/summary: Amazing Toy!!!
review/text: My dog loves this game.  As soon as he sees it, he runs over and waits for his command.  Even though there are 7 areas to hide treats, I usually only do 4 or 5.  When I give him the commad "Find the treats" he sniffs by each cover until he finds the one with the treat.  Then he gets his jaws around the cover and tries to pull it off, sometimes not on the first attempt.  He goes around until he has pulled off each cover that holds a treat.  The ones that are empty, he does not bother to remove the cover.  Really AMAZING Toy!!!!<br /><br />I would recommend keeping the toy hidden until it is time to play, especially if your dog is a chewer.  The covers are small and can be chewed up quickly.

You might try this on a individual basis. 2 of my dogs who normally don't fight over food at all got a bit possessive of the toy. Also, do not leave unattended so it doesn't get chewed up.

She had more issues with the cups located in the "palm" section of the paw. It was hard for her to get her mouth on them, and almost impossible to "slide up."<br /><br />The primary complaint I have with this toy are the yellow cups. They are flimsy and could be easily cracked into pieces with very minimal effort for a decent sized dog, or an aggressive chewer.<br /><br />DEFINITELY do not leave your dog alone with the toy. (This should go without saying..but...)<br /><br />Would I recommend the toy? Maybe. I think it would be ideal for medium sized dogs that aren't too smart for their own good. (If your dog can unscrew things, open doors, drawers, etc..then you may want to go for a more challenging toy. I wish I had of.)

It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.

review/summary: Think of this not as a puzzle or toy but more of an interactive feeder
review/text: I would definitely agree with others that this is not a very challenging puzzle toy.  So why do I give it 5 stars?  Well, challenging or not, this toy keeps my dog engaged and happy while eating!<br /><br />When my husband and I adopted our little dachshund/miniature schnauzer mix, he wasn't eating very much.  The vet told us that once he acclimated to his new owners and surroundings, his appetite would pick up.  Well, it didn't.  After two months, he still would not eat very much out of his bowl.  He would take 3-4 bites and would walk away from all his food.  My husband and I had to force our dog to eat or hand feed him - neither of which we liked.<br /><br />I read up on dachshunds and found out that they are hunting dogs.  I thought that maybe if we made getting his meal a bit more of a hunt or challenge that he would like it more - and sure enough, I was right!  Ever since we bought this star toy, he eats ALL his food with no problems!  It is such a relief not to have force or hand feed our dog and to not worry if our dog is getting enough food.  The fact that he enjoys it and likes it so much is just the icing on the cake and makes us so happy!  So, for our dog, it's more of an interactive feeder than a toy or brain game but we feel that it was well worth the money paid!<br /><br />We've had it about a month now and our dog eats out of it 1-2 times a day and it's holding up just fine.  He is a big chewer and he's tried to chew this a few times but so far, has not done any damage.  We have high hopes that this will last for a while!

review/summary: Challenging Dog Toy for my Smart Puppy! Great Dog Game!
review/text: My yellow lab loves staying busy and trying new things. After my dog, Homer played the Paw Hide-Dog Toy Puzzle it confirmed how smart he actually is. There were treats placed under each puzzle piece. He was able to figure out the game and get the prize...the treats! It keeps him entertained and I can really tell that he likes it. I have been bragging to all my friends that my dog has a puzzle game and that he actually understands it. Such a smart puppy! Awesome!<br /><br />This is a social writeup

Even my dog, who doesn't like to play much anymore was instantly interested in the bits of chicken. Although she got some help from my young son, when we leave her at home, this will be a great treat for her, so she won't be so sad when we leave.<br /><br />This toy is a great idea for any dog owner.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup.

review/summary: Great Toy to get dogs thinking!
review/text: I have two rat terriers, and they did not understand instantly what they had to do.  They actually had to think and use their powers of deductive reasoning to figure out how to get to the treats.  Their main drive in life is to eat, and then play, so this was perfect.  I loaded the treat compartments with their favorite chicken stick treats and then rotated the base and put the plastic puzzle pieces in.  It took them about 10-15 minutes of playing, barking and trying to get to the treats.  Eventually they figured out that the puzzle pieces ALL had to be removed before they could spin the base and reach their goal.  It was so much fun to watch.  Great toy Kyjen!<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup

review/text: My toy poodle was quite interested in this toy, but it proved difficult for him to play with.  He has a small mouth and it was hard for him to pick up the yellow pieces to get at the treats.  It was also hard for him to rotate it on its base to expose the other treats.  I think this is a fine toy for bigger dogs, but Liam is only 7.7 lbs.  My husband also didn't like all the noise.

He is sweet and friendly.<br /><br /> When he saw this product he first ignored it but I turned my back and then he stuck his little paw in the large shape to get the ball. Such a cute lil guy. Also since he is color blind like all dogs of course, the neon ball was very interesting to him. He rolled it around the house happily. The red part is great too because I can actually clean it unlike his other furry toys. I'm so happy a company actually took the time and effort to create such a great product with your dog in mind.<br /><br />Thanks CAGEY :)

review/summary: Cattledog approved!
review/text: Great toy for short periods of observed play.  My adult cattledog figured out how to removed the ball almost immediately, while the puppy took several minutes.  Even so, they have not tired of playing the game.  After removing the ball quickly a few times, they will complicate the puzzle by tossing the cube around, batting at it with their paws, pouncing on it...and only then remove the ball.  They wait for me to put the ball back in, and wait until I tell them to "Go find".<br /><br />This is not for the dog who runs off with a toy and plays keep away, as the thin rubber "bars" of the cube could be easily chewed and ingested (my puppy had to be told not to chew it).  Of course, all of the Kyjen puzzle toys are designed to be enjoyed by dogs playing in the company of their owners.  They are excellent training tools for "wait", "go find", "give" and the concept of taking turns (one dog waits while the other finds).  I work my dogs on them for about 15 minutes, then put the toys away.  They stay new and exciting that way.

So, the product is not challenging and not robust.  Maybe this would work for a declawed cat, but if your dog is halfway on the ball, get something else.

review/text: Our Lab puppy was able to figure out how to turn the red bar and left the dispenser lids, but the angle of the treat pod is such that she can't fit her snout, or manuvuer her tongue very well to get the food.  Even turning her snout sideways didn't help.  The idea has promise but unfortunately the design is lacking.  We'll keep trying but it doesnt really hold her interest since she can't get the reward.

And if I am not right there with him (on the floor next to him), he will throw the toy around to just get the treats out.<br /><br />I will continue to use this toy with him, mostly to work on patience with him, but as far as "challenging" this toy did not prove effective.

He hasn't quit figured out that he has to move the yellow cups before the wheel will turn.  On the other hand my younger dog thought that removing the yellow cups WAS the game.  Had to show him that there was something inside.  Does very well removing the cups now.  Timing him he is down to a little over 2 minutes.  You do have to show them how it works a few times if you don't have a super smart dog.

review/summary: Great Cognitive Toy
review/text: After purchasing the Kyjen 6 squeaker snake from PetsMart and realizing that it was a great toy I quickly looked up Kyjen online and found/purchased several other toys.  One of which was this treat wheel.  I have an American Bulldog/Chow mix who I think is pretty smart but I was still worried that she wouldn't be able to figure out the puzzle.  She figured out how to lift off the yellow cups fairly quickly but it took her a few tries to figure out how to spin the wheel.  She's got it down to an art now and loves playing with this puzzle.  I am also amazed at the fact that she has not destroyed/chewed any part of this puzzle as she has destroyed almost all of her other toys.  I would definitely recommend this product to others who want to challenge their dog.

review/text: My morkie loves interactive games. Make sure you take notice of the dimensions, it is larger than I expected. As one of the other reviews stated, my small breed cannot get his mouth around the yellow pieces, but is able to get them off with abundant effort via scratching and using his nose. As smart as my lil guy is, he gets the yellow piece off and thinks his reward is being able to play with it. But it was his first attempt and we're working with him, showing him the treats are underneath. He was continuously excited and determined to figure out the game. I expect over time he'll get better with it and the learning process in itself is fun.

review/text: The layers spin very easily and my 5 year old female weimaraner cleared each slot of hidden treats in less than a minute. If you nudge it gently it opens & aligns and as long as you don't bump it, it stays in place to eat each dish. I even tried to use it to feed her dinner to slow her down, but that didn't work at all--she aligned it once and ate out of it like a bowl. Bummer, I spent over $20 for a piece of plastic that will end up in a landfill. Stick with frozen kongs...

review/summary: Paw Flapper Fun, But Too Easy
review/text: I got my dog the Paw Flapper because he's a Basset Hound mix and loves to use his nose. He's also pretty smart, so keeping him occupied can be difficult. Unfortunately, this is a super simple puzzle. The first time he played with it, it took him about ten minutes to find all the treats. The next time, it took five minutes. There really isn't anything that challenging about it. Opening the flaps takes my dog a second, and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats. He had fun, but then it's a toy full of treats, so that's a given.<br /><br />The puzzle does seem to be well made though, so it's not a bad product. It just isn't challenging enough. I'll be returning it and trying one of the other puzzles.

review/summary: Reviews for the Treat triad, Paw Hide, and Star Spinner
review/text: Paw Hide- she sniffed a little and went straight to the covers and after she got one off trotted away like that was the prize! I showed her the treats and she proceeded to get them all. She figured it out pretty quick. I use it as a more challenging way of dispensing treats now.<br /><br />Star Spinner- she spun the thing and figured it out pretty quickly. Not much of a challenge there. Still, a fun way to dispense treats.<br /><br />Treat triad- this one was the most challenging, as it has 2 parts to it. She turned the red part around and then went to open the containers. Therein lies the rub. IMO, the container cover extends too far down so as to make it very difficult for her to grasp it with her mouth or her paw. She was unable to get a grip on it so she could not get to the treats. She didn't like this one.<br /><br />Overall, I don't find them to be that challenging, except for the Treat Triad but that one, I think, has a design flaw. Its not mentally challenging but physically so. I'm not sorry I got them but I expected more.

review/summary: Poorly constructed and designed
review/text: This is a review for the Treat Wheel by Kyjen. This is my second product with them and will most likely be my last as the other one had some design flaws as well. Overall, the concepts seem to be good, but there's always one glaring flaw and cheap materials/construction. This treat wheel is a good idea: pull out the "pegs" and find the treat then use your nose to push the wheel around until you find a secondary treat in another chamber. However, the execution is anything but good. First, the pegs are in too deep and with little (except a dangerously small hole to snag a nail) to grip except super slippery plastic. I tried myself to push and pull the item out of place, and it wouldn't budge (not surprising since 3/4 of it is "buried") and my dogs just grew frustrated and quit. I thought of using it without the pegs and just as a spinner but all the chambers are connected, and the top portion is so badly attached to the bottom that it wobbles about instead of spinning smoothly around. Plus, the chambers are so slick (all the toy being made of that same super slippery plastic) that the treat just slides around. And forget durability. I've seen Dollar Store toys constructed better. A medium to large dog could break this thing in one sitting.

While touted as one of their more durable toys, I found the plush toys to be more durable than this!<br /><br />I bought this as a replacement puzzle toy for one of my dogs, who adores plush toys and puzzle toys.  The second dog I have is more destructive and you really have to watch him with toys.  I was hopeful that the plastic would hold up better and the plush-lover would get more enjoyment out of his toy before it would get destroyed.<br /><br />The moon rover was much too difficult to get into (or out of) the moon; neither dog was able to retrieve it.  Within 30 minutes chunks of the moon were missing and the front part of the rover was chewed off as well.  Even though we're thorough, we were picking up chunks of blue plastic around the play area for a few days.  This purchase was a complete waste of $20.

review/summary: I love the fact that it comes with a ball.
review/text: The toy seems pretty durable which is a big winner for me because usually the toys that I buy for my dogs don't last quite long.  The toy itself has a tennis ball inside which I really like you don't have to buy two separate toys. I also love the fact that it has a ball inside and they can try to entertain themselves. So awesome.

review/summary: The Paw Hide is a great little toy.
review/text: Im out working in the daytime and feel real bad that my energetic pup is home bored to death! So finding this toy calmed my fear of doggy daytime boredom. It has seven (my favorite number) treat chambers that challenged my dog to lift each cup in order to reveal its prize!<br /><br />It is a must have when teaching the basics of eating obedience/command. It also taught him important problem-solving skills. I had to turn the pieces upside down at first because my dog smelled the treat through the space but cried because he was too inexperienced to figure out how to get it. I suggest this technique if this puzzle is too challenging for your dog; at least till they figure out how to successfully pull the piece off when turned the right way.<br /><br />The Non-skid pads on bottom is an amazing feature. I guess the makers knew mischievous dogs would push the entire toy around as an additional part of the game lol. Its base material is plastic which is perfect for washing. My dog chooses to use his teeth to pull up the pieces not his paw, so slob is usually all over this toy. I'm so glad it's plastic!<br /><br />Its a must have because it provides hours of fun, and I encourage anyone with a curious doggy to get one!!!

review/text: My american bulldog loves this puzzle. This was his first time using a puzzle toy like this, and he was able to figure it out pretty quick. Now everytime I get it out he knows exactly what to do :D I would recommend to anyone who wants to challenge their dog a little bit. It is definatly something you would not want to let your dog use unattended b/c of it being all plastic.

review/summary: Good Toy
review/text: I bought this as a birthday gift for my dog.  The plastic is pretty thin.  He loves tennis balls and playing fetch, so I thought it would be a great brain teaser.  He figured out how to lift the doors to get at the tennis ball, but when he goes to grab it, it ends up rolling back into the trunk and over to another hole.  Then he just gets irritated.  It slides easily on the hardwood floor, so he ends up pushing it around the room trying to get the ball out.  We put it on a rug to keep it from sliding around and then the doors don't open as easily.  I'm going to try to put some rubber slip grip stuff on the bottom to see if that helps keep it in place on the hardwood floor better.  He tries to dig the tennis ball out of the top opening since the doors don't work too well and then he ends up knocking the whole top portion off.

review/summary: Good fun for dogs
review/text: This adjustable puzzle toy is a good way to provide a challenging way for your dog to have treats.  It is fun for them if you just put one or two treats inside or many.  The rubber "feet" on the bottom do grip the floor somewhat which makes it more stable when the device is tightened up for extra challenge for your dog.  This is one of what could be many puzzle toys to entertain your dog.  My dog gets excited when I bring out a puzzle toy because he knows that with a little work, he gets a treat.

review/text: My puppy just preferred to eat the toy than the treats. My older dogs were curious but did not do any thing. However the red plastic is pretty stong. My dog has been chewing on it for a few days. So if anything it gives your dog something to chew on other than your shoes.

review/summary: My dog is a genius!!
review/text: No seriously, she is.  My dog's "grandfather" (my Dad) sent this as a first birthday gift. I videotaped it - 1st time, 23 seconds, including eating 4 treats.  She moved 1 piece with  her nose, ate treat, one with right paw, ate treat, one with left paw (she's ambidextrous), ate treat, and moved last piece with her nose, ate treat, ta dah!!  It was pretty entertaining. It won't slow down treat eating for her, but I can show her off. And it is very durable. I will try some of Kyjen's harder puzzles!

review/summary: Nice, basic addition to the collection...
review/text: I have a Fox/JRT/who-knows-what terrier mix who really enjoys puzzle toys, provided there is food in there to motivate him. I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.<br /><br />Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the "spin" and "flip" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a "cheater", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard-fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie/Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky-wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.<br /><br />My terrier has a short attention span, in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a "project in the works", and not one I would recommend for first-timers and beginners. Kyjen's Triad and Glider are not in this category. For the money, I'm happy to add them to his collection. I just fill 'em all up at once, and let the racket commence!

review/summary: Not Much of a Puzzle
review/text: After the first go-round, my little mutt knew exactly how to get at the hidden treats.  Treats are always welcome, but I think she gets more fun being put in a "sit" and watching me move around pretending to hide a bon-bon in various places. She's learned that it won't usually be in the last place I stop - but in which other one? Dogs are as different as the rest of us, but seems to me that only a rather slow dog or a lovable-but-dumb one would find this toy mentally challenging after the first time or two.  I give it three stars for their sakes.

review/text: I sat the toy on the floor and he immediately opened one flap and used it to rotate the toy and get the treats in every chamber. It wasn't much of a puzzle and he finished before I could log in to write this review. Less than 2 minutes. I'm not sure I would buy too many more of these products. In theory the product is a good idea. I gave this two stars instead of one because he did enjoy himself in those two minutes.

review/text: My toy poodle is 4 years old and he is pretty smart. He loves learning new tricks and seems to enjoy being challenged mentally. This product is great for him because he loves playing with tennis balls. Basically, this "toy" is really a puzzle for him to try to get the tennis ball out. It helps that my dog has small paws which can easily get inside the toy. Another benefit is the rubber is soft and is easily washable. It is particularly challenging for him to get the tennis ball

review/summary: Cattledogs love it!
review/text: This is one great toy!  My busy, mouthy Cattledogs like it so much they will ask to play with it, sitting and staring at it on the shelf where it's stored.  When they first got the toy, it took them just a minute or two to get their mouths around the squirrel, but it took a couple days of play periods for them to figure out how to pull it out of the hole (it's a tight fit).  I let them play with the squeaky squirrel for a few minutes, then put it back in and say, "Go find".  They love it, and will throw the "stump" around and thrash it back and forth, extending the game.<br /><br />While the toy is very durable, it is suitable only for observed play, as the chewy rubber of the exterior could be ingested.  All the  Kyjen toys are made for interactive play, but it's a point that must be stressed: these are not chew toys.  The other thing to keep in mind is the amount of dog slobber all that "Go find" spreads around.  You may want to confine the play to a room that is easily mopped.

review/text: While I have been pleased with some of the Kyjen toys, this puzzle was a disappointment.  My Mensa-smart Cattledogs figured out the game immediately, opening the flaps just fine.  But after a couple good retrievals the older dog looked at me as if to say, "Are you kidding me?", inserted a toenail into the top hole of this thing, and flipped it over to get the treat.  I'm going to try gluing it to a board so he can't cheat.  But overall, I'd say this is for very small dogs or slow ones.

review/summary: My dog seems to like this puzzle
review/text: I have a beagle and we have never bought a doggy puzzle for him before, so I was looking for something easy and also something that would make him use his great sense of smell. This puzzle is perfect! Although he figured it out in about 10 seconds, it is something that can be reused over and over again due to the 4 treat chambers. He never knows exactly where the treat went and sometimes I sneak one in while he's not looking, so later he will catch scent of it and retrieve it. It's very entertaining for both of us and I will definitely buy more dog puzzles in the future.

review/summary: Organic but BPA in the lid!
review/text: Our baby really loves to eat these and they come in glass, Great! But we discontinued using them after I found a web posting that the manufacturer uses lids that contain BPA! I emailed their customer service department (10/2010) and the company confirmed that BPA is used in the lids. This smacks of the worst kind of marketing, taking advantage of the organic label and the potential health benefits but selling it in inferior packaging, legal yes, but not really in the spirit of the organic movement. For Pete's sake the lid itself has the word "organic" written on it 6 times! We stopped using all the companies products including the dry oatmeal and rice because we personally found it such a dishonest practice (he loved those too unfortunately) so in summary good food, bad implementation.

review/summary: BPA in Lid & Food
review/text: Like other customers, I was sorely disappointed to find out that there is indeed BPA-containing plastic in the lid of Earth's Best food products.  I feel that this company is taking advantage of customers and deceiving mothers & fathers who are trying to do the best by buying organic food for their babies.  The company will not answer questions directly online or on their FaceBook accounts.  They give you the runaround to call their customer service number.  However, when they do finally admit to BPA being in the lid of the products, they try to pass it off as being an "industry standard" and that the food is "Safe."  Well, for those of us who are concerned enough to purchase organic foods--I think we want to see NO BPA in the packaging or product.  I am not content to be told what is safe or acceptable for my baby by a company's marketing department.  So, I have decided that, even though my baby has enjoyed Earth's Best products, I will find other products that do not have BPA in their packaging or food items.  I am truly disappointed that this huge manufacturer of "organic" products is allowing a product that has been banned in baby bottles in Europe to be in the lids of food jars in the United States. Shame on them.  I hope this helps other moms & dads out there to be aware of what is in this "organic" food product.

review/summary: Jar lids contain BPA ... So disappointing!
review/text: As my baby approaches the stage at which we can introduce solids to her diet, I started doing my research on organic, prepared baby foods.  I was all set to make Earth's Best my brand of choice, since we already use some of their other products (e.g., baby wipes).  But that was until I discovered that the covers of their glass jars contain bisphenol-A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor that can cause negative health effects, especially in vulnerable infants and young children.  Apparently, Earth's Best claims that its jarred baby food has been independently-tested, and found to have undetectable levels of BPA.  However, I'm still skeptical.  In a "perfect lab" setting with a pristine jar of baby food, the BPA may not have had the opportunity to leach from the cover into the baby food.  But in the real world, by the time that jar of baby food reaches the average consumer, it has been turned upside-down and shaken up in the process of packing, shipping, unpacking, shelving, etc.  Plus, many parents warm up their baby food in the jars; and I've heard that heating can increase/speed-up the BPA leaching process.  SCARY STUFF!!  I don't see why Earth's Best doesn't just play it safe and line their baby food jar covers with a resin that doesn't contain BPA.  It's honestly not that hard to do ... Just ask Eden Organics!  The linings of many of their canned vegetables are BPA-free.  Sure, it might increase the cost of the baby food by a bit, but I'm sure I speak for many parents when I say that I'd be willing to pay a little extra just for the peace of mind of knowing that there are no harmful chemicals in my baby's food.  After all, we're willing to spend a bit more for organic baby food to begin with.<br /><br />Earth's Best also makes baby food in BPA-free pouches.  But, to be honest, the company's refusal to acknowledge and correct the problem of BPA in its jar covers has left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended).  So I may just take my "baby-food-business" elsewhere.

review/text: I wanted to make sure my baby has a good start just like all the parents out there. That is why I am buying organic food and I do my best to prepare fresh food for her when I can. I am so disappointed to know for a company labeling organic containing ''bpa '' in their lids. what is the point??<br /><br />I spend considerable amount of money and effort to make sure my baby is not consuming toxins. I buy bpa free bottles, I even called similac feeding line to make sure formula containers did not have bpa- which they dont and I go buy a organic food with bpa lids. I am higly disapponted by earths best insensitivity to this matter. I personally feeled tricked. I trusted this company since I saw their food were in glass jars.<br /><br />I wanted to take this time to write this review. here is some facts about BPA---<br />The chemical is bisphenol A, or BPA, a component of the plastic epoxy resins used to line metal food cans. Dozens of laboratory studies show that BPA affects the developing brain and reproductive systems of animals exposed to low doses during pregnancy and early life. BPA has recently raised concerns from 2 separate expert panels of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with 1 group of scientists warning that human exposures to BPA are already at or above the levels that harm animals and another expressing concern about impacts of BPA on infants' brains and behavior.

My little one doesn't seem to mind them but he has only had a few of the flavors. I decided to go with Earths Best because I wanted an organic product. I know some are worried about the BPA used in the lids but unfortunately I think BPA is used on all jars and cans and I wasn't able to find an alternative product that didn't use it. I have found that my local Walmart and Target sell these for a little cheaper at only $0.54 a jar.

review/summary: Starter Kits great!
review/text: Here on Amazon the starter kits for the 1st stage are slightly cheaper than buying the flavors individually.  It's good to try to see which ones your baby likes.  Mine unfortunately will not eat peas so I got some jars of peas left (I have not given up hope yet, will try again in a few weeks).  My boy loves the sweet potato and carrot though, and I have my fingers crossed he'll like the squash as I bought 12 of those seperately.

review/summary: Great Baby Food and a Great First Veggie Variety
review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />1st Vegetable Starter Kit<br />If you're like me trying to decide what flavor to give your baby the first time can be difficult. I had an idea because of going through this with my son, but my daughter (as it turns out) has completely different likes and dislikes. This variety comes with sweet potatoes, carrots and peas. As it turns out my daughter can't stand peas and the nice thing is we only have 2 jars left over instead of quite a bit more potentially. It's pretty basic and on a whole I think most babies like all of these, but you just never know. That's why I like it in this kit. You can try them out without having to hand pick and sort through a bunch at the store. It takes the guessing out of it. Yes, the price is a little high, but if you just need something to get you started it's great!

review/summary: Baby Loved it! But do introduce new food a little at a time
review/text: I ordered this since my pediatrician recommended carrots and peas for my 7 month old who has been having rice cereal and bananas for a couple of months now. We tried the carrots and my baby loved it so much he finished about 3/4th of the 2 oz jar. However carrots are constipating and I had to give him 6 oz of apple juice mixed with water a day to relieve the constipation. Lesson learnt- when introducing new foods-especially rice cereal, not very ripe bananas and carrots, start with only about a tablespoon and then move up slowly.According to what it says on the jar, once opened it can be stored in the fridge for 3 days.<br />I like that Earth's best is supposed to be organic and not genetically modified food. They come in cute little glass jars which I'm reusing to store spices.

review/summary: Good first baby food
review/text: This is the baby food I started my baby out on and she enjoyed all the flavors. I like the texture of Earth's Best compared to a lot of the other foods. When I try to buy something else a lot of times it doesn't work out. I haven't found a stage one or stage two baby food from Earth's Best my baby wouldn't eat (she doesn't care for the stage three yet though). I like how I was able to get a variety of foods in one box and the price was great!

review/text: We started our little guy on solid food with Earth's Best veggie. He loves all except the carrot made him constipated. So we mixed a little bit of the "Plum Organics" prune in it and he was fine. I only hope they will change the lid to BPA free lining.

review/summary: Great, but $$$$
review/text: The product was great, my baby loves them and has no problem eating the fruits or vegetables. I tried all the flavors and they are all tasty. The only problem is that when I came back to Amazon to reorder, the price went up for the case. Now it is actually cheaper to buy them at fresh and easy. When the pricing per jar is in cents, a $3 price increase for the case makes a big difference.

review/summary: Perfect for starting baby on veggies
review/text: My 6 month old is just starting solids.  I looked at other jar baby foods in the stire and they just didn't look right. They were watery looking and just... wrong.<br /><br />Enter Earth's Best.  I took a chance on these and was VERY happy.  Unlike some baby foods that smell repulsive, these smell and taste like real food that even I would eat.<br /><br />The starter pack is ideal to get baby going on veggies.  We finished those and are now onto the EB fruits.<br /><br />I am so glad I got him started with these.  He seems to love them and that makes me happy!

review/summary: Great Dog Treat
review/text: I had a difficult time finding healthy snacks for my yorkie until some of the trainers at the Humane Society suggested trying baby food.  I found this online and couldn't be happier.  My dog loves this food more than he loves any of his "doggie" snacks, and it is exponentially healthier and cheaper.  I drop a teaspoon on top of his kong and he's in happy-land for the next few minutes.  It's such a wonderful alternative to the sugar and chemical filled junk they market towards dog owners.<br /><br />I only give this four stars because the jar tends to get messy.  The lid is difficult to get back on the jar which can lead to a sticky mess.  This is just one minor setback to an otherwise fantastic product.

review/summary: Subscribe and Save seemed a good idea
review/text: I thought the convienience and savings would make it worth it, but when I went back to reorder, the price had jumped by a couple bucks making it MORE EXPENSIVE than if I just bought them at my local grocery store... Amazon should notify of these changes, I would not have been happy if I got my next shipment having not caught this price-hike. I cancelled this subsription and looked around, from all the prices I see I could do better at grocery or Babies-R-Us!

review/summary: Best Organic Baby Food!!!
review/text: I'm a first time mom so I was apprehensive about my first shot at baby food with my son.  He actually LOVES his veggies!  I tasted it and I don't blame him.  Why pay for processed food when you could have organic at the same/lower price?  Besides, this is YOUR baby's health!
