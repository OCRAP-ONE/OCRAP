review/summary: My finicky cat will not eat this food
review/text: Having seen the TV adds for Blue Buffalo pet foods I was very optimistic to try this for my adult cat.  She is very finicky, preferring canned shredded meat to dry food though she will nibble on food like some major brand Cat Chow during the day.  So, I ordered a pouch of this and she just will not eat it.  If I offer it her in the morning and then fresh servings at lunch and dinner, she just will not eat it and sits by her bowl mewing and looking pathetic.  I was very disappointed.

review/summary: These bulk Energy Drink prices are outrageous
review/text: I thought I'd check online to see if buying energy drinks in bulk would be cheaper than buying the 4-8 packs in my local grocery store. Well they're not. At all. In fact the cost of this 8 pack, when you add shipping, is over twice what you'd pay if you bought 8 individually in a convenience store ( give or take some for tax)

review/summary: Great syrup but notice the name.
review/text: This is another great monin syrup that I used to make my own soda.<br /><br />The name is CANDIED orange. Do not expect a marmalade type taste<br />but a very sweet candy like taste. As a result I wound up using only<br />half a jigger of this per drink compared to a full measure.<br /><br />Very tasty but not what I expected. If you love orange crush, this is for you. If you love english marmalade like I do, try their blood orange instead.

review/text: I read this wrong, I guess. I thought I was going to get a box of 12 breadsticks so I put "2" in for quantity. Well, turns out I was really ordering 2 CASES of 12 boxes EACH. Funny. That explains why it cost me more than $50. I guess I just thought they were that special. They're good. And they are approved on my "diet" so I love them. Just, if you are going to order 2...make sure you want 2 cases. lol

review/summary: Great Taste, HORRIBLE Quality Control
review/text: I purchased these when I started the HGC diet.  They were a great choice as far as taste goes.  They satisfied my need for a crunch and they had a very pleasant taste to them.  They didn't just have that "stale bread" taste that a lot of breadsticks have. Also, while you do get a few burned breadsticks, you don't get to many.  For the most part they are pretty evenly cooked.<br /><br />On the down side, the quality is not that great.  Every package I opened have had broken breadsticks.  Now I know that breadsticks are fragile and I should expect a few broken ones, but for the most part, almost all of them in a package are broken, and some are broken so bad that they are just dust at the bottom.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the quality is this...so far, we've gone through 8 boxes of these breadsticks and I've come across 15 SEALED packages that contain NO breadsticks.  They are just empty wrappers, AND these empty wrappers aren't just in the box as that weird bonus wrapper you receive on occasion, they COUNT towards the number of packages of breadsticks you get in a box.<br /><br />These breadsticks are by no means cheap, and I honestly do not mind paying for something that is not only part of my diet, but something I enjoy.  I do take issue with the fact that I'm paying a premium price for a product with sub-par quality.

review/text: My local store stopped selling the Grissini and I came across these after doing a web search.  Why drive to the other side of town to pick some up when these can be delivered.  They are nice and crunchy.  Because they are smaller I can have 3 sometimes 4 as oppose to only 2 of the other ones I was buying.<br />Tricks the mind into thinking you are getting more.

I bought them because I am on the hCG diet and they are an allowed item, but there were SO many in the case that I decided to share.  My kids love them!  They have a nice crunch to them, but are not tough to bite or chew by any means.  The texture is perfect and the taste is absolutely delicious.  They kill off all of my carb cravings!  I will continue to buy these even after I complete the diet, they are just that good.

In addition to eating the bread sticks with meals, we also use them to make bread crumbs by putting them in a food processor along with a mixture of dry herbs to coat meat prior to baking it. The bread sticks arrived as promised and we have found very few broken so far.

review/text: Just wanted to say I give these 5 stars even for not being on a diet that calls for them. Less salty than crackers, and more tender than pretzels or packages of breadsticks I remember from many years ago.<br /><br />One box of these is 3.5 oz in weight total, 440 calories, and 6 grams of fat. And that's divided into 5 packets of about 7 sticks each. Pretty hard to overeat these very badly!

I'm pretty sure I'm going to have these for forever because of how many I have, but that's really ok with me.  If you're trying to watch your calories, these kind of fool your body into thinking you just ate a handful of crackers.  These arrived in good shape, nothing broken or missing.

I keep mine in the freezer, as the chocolate chips seem to melt quickly, and just take a few out as I want them.<br /><br />These are truly excellent cookies!

However, these gems are the kind of cookies that you are sitting in front of the tv in the old recliner and its really hard to stop eating them, just like the old (forbidden) Chips Ahoy. This company has a lifelong customer here. Most all of Kinnikinnick's products are the best gluten free that money can buy. Heck, I can't even make them from scratch that taste this good.

I know I should move away from expectations now that I am on a gluten free diet, but as a newbie I am still having a hard time 'cheating' as I miss the old gestures.  Finally, I can indulge on some naughty food wihtout compromising my health or taste.. Yeah!

review/summary: best GF cookie I have found.....
review/text: As you can see from the other reviews, these cookies are exceptional. I have Celiac and most GF cookies I have tried simply taste bad, or have no taste at all.  When you cannot eat gluten, most, if not all of your previous "deserts" cannot be eaten. So it was refreshing to find something that replaced all the previous gluten cookies and deserts. I never thought I would crave "sweets" until I could not eat them.....Kinnikinnick's Montana chocolate chip cookies help fill the void.<br /><br />I just ordered some of these from Amazon as my local store has been out for two weeks....got to have that cookie!

review/summary: Very close to Archway
review/text: These cookies are very close to the Archway molasses cookies.  They have a very sharp bite of ginger to them, followed by a mellow molasses taste. These are the first GF cookies I have found where I can not tell they are GF. This company makes a chocolate chip <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXC3Q">Kinnikinnick Foods Gluten-Free Cookies, Montana's Chocolate Chip, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> that taste like inexpensive store bought choc-chip cookies, not my preference, but not bad at all.  Theses run about $4 each in the store at best, making this a great deal, but the expiration date is not to far out so be aware.

review/text: These cookies are hard and crunchy and definitely resemble the store-bought cookies made in mass production bakeries. The taste was good, and the texture similar to somthing from Keebler or another large food processor and baker. I expected these cookies to be more like the gluten-free chocolate chip (or chunk) cookies from Pamela's. Pamela's I would rate with five stars. Overall the Kinnikinnick brand would be fine for kids who want a snack, but gourmet they are not.

I wasn't sure how he'd take to these cookies but I thought I'd risk it anyway.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to see that he was hooked after his first cookie.  Since that first cookie, I constantly hear "chocolate chip cookie, please?" at home.<br /><br />Good stuff.  Will be ordering more very soon.

review/text: they are VERY crumbly and fragile. They are more solid if you keep them in the freezer and eat them that way. Not your typical tough ginger snap texture at all, which could be a good thing.  At least half didn't survive amazon packaging and came smashed to bits.  Definitely worth trying, but maybe bought from a store, not from amazon.

review/text: My son loves these cookies, so I buy them in bulk and store in the freezer. They have a great taste, are low in fat....something he needs with his Crohn's disease...and very tasty. I am so glad to have a cookie that is gluten free and yummy. They are a bit fragile compared to regular ginger snaps (that could be used to open locked doors!!), but any crumbled ones are good in parfaits with yogurt or pudding, or as pie crust.

review/summary: PETOWNERS BEWARE
review/text: Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years.  As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers.  This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients.  Real meat and rice were substituted with "meat by-product" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be "unfit for human consumption".  They are taking ingredients that used to be considered "waste" and packaging it up as "healthy & nutritious" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not "sold-out" yet.  The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy.  We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of "aflatoxin poisoning" from the "healthy & nutritious" dog food we were buying and feeding him.  This was NOT cheap food folks.  This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as "Natural", that we were paying $60/bag for.  The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer.  They are still producing their "high priced waste" and heavily marketing it as "natural".<br /><br />My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often!  Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence.  Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet.

review/summary: excellent for my boston!
review/text: Before switching to Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon, my boston terrier seemed to have negative reactions to everything he ate. His stools were consistently soft and he frequently broke out in rashes and would scratch and itch until he bled. We kept trying new brands of dry food hoping to find something that agreed with him. We were amazed how quickly things turned around when we started him on Blue Buffalo. His stools are finally normal and his skin has never looked better. His coat is even shiny! I'm so glad we found this product!

review/text: Our Bernese Mountain dog had always been on another highly rated food (Nature's Variety Prairie), but his stools were really soft and he was prone to diarrhea.  Our vet suggested finding another food with less fat and more fiber.  Although this food has similar fat content, it has double the fiber.  He has done amazing on this food since we switched.  His stools are normal now and he has so much more energy!  We have been really happy with this food.  It's expensive, but worth every penny.

review/summary: Know the ingredients of your dog's food!
review/text: Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon might be a food some dogs do well on.  Mine did not.  It caused itching and loose stool, even after a very gradual switch.  I emailed BB customer service to see if they use wild/Pacific salmon or farmed/Atlantic (which is loaded with antibiotics and dyes--both of which could cause a reaction in animals with sensitivities) and they could not give me an answer.  I'm a fish snob from Alaska but aside from the wild vs. farmed prejudices, I was very concerned that they had no idea the source of their ingredients.<br /><br />This food gets a plus for the fact that it's grain-free.  I appreciate the direction this company is moving.  However, it is NOT a premium dog food in my mind.  Be cautious of any pet food company that doesn't know where their ingredients come from!

review/summary: AMAZING! FOOD! CAN'T HELP BUT SHARE WITH OTHER PET OWNERS!
review/text: Ever since our 2 mini poodles and 2 Maltipoo came in to our household they stole our hearts and became a part of our family. The hunt for the right food came when I heard countless horror stories from friends and family on how leading brand name foods affected and even caused the death of their pets. We all know how costly vet bills can me and because of this reason I believe that being proactive and taking preventive care will be a lot cheaper in the long run. Certain grains and corn are not a natural part of a dogs diet and as you know most or all advertised brands use that as one of their main ingredients. What i love this brand is that it doesnt skimp on any of the right ingredients and makes meat/poultry/etc. (depending on the flavor you buy) the main ingredient! this is awesome because there really isnt any other brand out there that is true to their pet owners and their pets! This manufacturer makes me feel like they actually care and thus they will get my money for their 1 of a kind and amazing food! My dogs love it, they have beautiful coats, they are energetic and healthy all around. Been using this for about 3 years now and will continue to do so. This is our households choice of food- the right food.

review/summary: Excellent Quality Dry Dog Food
review/text: I have a 2.5-year-old female boxer with terrible allergies. She scratches, rubs and bites herself raw. She is miserable and uncomfortable all the time and if you've had a dog with problems like this, you know how hard it is to watch her suffer like that. I've tried the vet's prescription formula dog food (at $60 for a 15 lb. bag, yikes!) and other limited ingredient diets, fatty acid supplements in her food, antihistamines, steroids (which have nasty side effects so she can't really take them anymore), plus medicated shampoos multiple times a week and antibiotics for the infections that develop in her scratching-induced wounds. Sure, there are moments of, "Hey, she's starting to look a little better," but none of it really seems to help. Other grain-free formulas showed some improvement in the first few weeks then fizzled and she was back to her mostly itchy self.<br /><br />The first time I have ever seen my dog without any scabs or big red gashes was three weeks after I started her on Blue Buffalo Wilderness (Salmon) with a small amount of a liquid Omega-3 supplement (Welactin) on top. The bald patches where she had scratched out her hair slowly began to grow back in and I found that I was not constantly telling her to stop scratching or biting herself. BIG IMPROVEMENTS! The environmental aspect of her allergies is now also successfully controlled with occasional prescription antihistamines.<br /><br />Some say this food is too expensive but in my opinion it is more than worth the cost. In fact, I am actually saving money compared to the cost of all the vet visits and medication that hardly even worked. My little girl will be on Blue Buffalo Wilderness from now on. I just bought a bag of the duck recipe so hopefully she likes the taste of that too.

review/text: I have nothing but great things to say about Blue Buffalo's products. I recently tried out the Wilderness brand (duck flavor). My black lab-mix loves it! As he's recently paralyzed, he sometimes has accidents in the house. Since his stool is solid and easy to pick up, clean up is a breeze. He even rolled over the pile in his wheelchair and none of it was ground into the carpet...just flattened a bit. Who knew stool could be so exciting?<br /><br />I definitely recommend Blue Buffalo's Wilderness brands.

review/summary: The best brand on the market
review/text: We were feeding our dog Puppy Chow when we first got her. Until one day I wondered what exactly was in that dog food..one look at the label really threw me off completely. In my search for high quality dog food I found Blue Buffalo. Every since  the switch she has had an extremely glossy coat and endless energy as she actually uses more of the food. This in turn lead to her needing to poop less because there is nowhere near the amount of filler/junk that's in these name brand foods. We got a Pit Bull recently and we feed him Blue Wilderness and boy has it helped him pick up weight, yet he is very healthy and they both get nothing but compliments from the vet!

review/summary: Simply Amazing! My Siberian Huskies seem to think so too.
review/text: I used to buy the brands you would find at Wal-Mart and the sort, but I thought to myself one day, "If I always spend a good amount of money on things for myself, why can't my dogs have the best food?" So I started researching the best dog food for Siberian Huskies, I read about how most of the super-market brands have grains instead of being natural. I came across a site that reviewed dog food, there I saw Blue Buffalo, my first time ordering this food was from Petco, online I paid $55 and then I bought it from the store and paid $65! Still not quite sure how that works, but I thought about how I always find everything for a better price on Amazon, and so I did.<br /><br />I must say when my dogs (Snowball & Shyko) were eating Beneful, Pedigree, and the sort, they would leave the food there and just not eat it. I was always wondering why they wouldn't eat it, but I realized after I bought this food that they love the natural stuff. Every time they see me simply reach for the bag, they get excited and start howling in excitement. They finish this food in record time, its kind of awkward to say the least, I wish Shyko would understand that your supposed to chew, haha. It makes me feel nice, knowing that my dogs love this food. The love for my dogs has no extent, and so they deserve the best dogs food there is, and this is it, for them atleast.

review/text: Our toy fox terrier was developing one raw spot after another. I began thinking it was allergies. I must have been right because within 2 weeks on this food they were gone. They have not returned. This food is pricey but it is cheaper than vet visits and meds. Besides the price the only downside is the dogs smell a bit fishy. We affectionately call our dog Nemo when he emerges from under a blanket. No con outweighs the benefits.

review/summary: He eats it right up
review/text: I have a smaller beagle who has very bad food allergies. We have to watch him everywhere we take him that he is not eating anything or he will break out in rashes and scratch for days till he bleeds. For the past year and a half we tried different brands to help him with his allergies, He started on Nutro as a puppy and we switched him over to Natural Balance Venice and potato and didnt see any improvement. We finally decided to take him to the dermatologist and she suggested Royal Canine Rabbit and potato. Not only is that food not helping him either, its $70 a bag and my poor beagle has trouble chewing it. I finally came accross the Wilderness Salmon food, just after a week of him eating this brand he has no longer had long episodes of scratching and Ive noticed his little bald spots of where he has been scratching are no longer red. His stool is firm , and even a little fuller then before since he eats it up like a little pig. Even with the transition from mixing his old food with the new, he would take mouth fulls and drop them on the floor and only eat the blue wilderness nuggets. The size of the food is perfect for his little mouth as well. Only downfall is that he gets smelly breath. But that doesnt bother him at all. Im so glad he is a happy healthy little guy now, and its all thanks to Blue Wilderness.

review/summary: No More Allergies or G.E.R.D.~
review/text: When I met my last rescue pet, Dixie, approximately 8.5 years ago, she was a real mess--both externally and internally. She exhibited a nervous condition (G.E.R.D.) that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions; that is to say, that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up! She was painfully emaciated, skeletal almost, and her blood-work was all over the place. So, after a round of IV fluids and 2 small bags of 'Science Diet' chow, Dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home. The first thing I did was to research which pet foods would address her particular condition; I knew that I didn't want to keep her on the 'Science Diet' regimen--it's too full of ingredients that I feel don't belong in a proper diet for dogs. Lo' and behold, I stumbled upon the "Blue Buffalo Wilderness" formula for dogs. It seemed like a good fit, due to all of the proper ratios (protein/fat) and totally "GRAIN-FREE". Viola! The rest, as they say, is history....8.5 years later, Dixie now weighs in at approximately 24 loving, happy pounds of my friendly and well-adjusted best friend.

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite!
review/text: I tried several different brands of dog food for my Alaskan Malamute mix, she would love one brand one day then refuse to eat it the next day. I finally decided to go down to my local healthy petstore and ask for help. The woman was very knowledgeable about huskies and malamutes and told me about Blue Buffalo and the Salmon flavor. What caught my attention the most is the wolf on the front and how it looked so similar to my dog. To this day this is the only food my dog will consistently eat, and I love the great ingredients inside.<br /><br />I also found that mixing a scoop or two of the Blue Buffalo Salmon flavored canned dog food with the dry food keeps my dog interested and looking forward to her meals.

review/summary: Great food for my dog's allergies
review/text: My dog would consistently get itchy at various times of the year, especially in spring and fall.  We attributed her symptoms to seasonal changes in weather.  However, after I started giving her Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon dry dog food, her allergies basically disappeared.  This is a slightly more expensive dog food, but my dog will get this for the rest of her life.  It saved me a lot of money on vet bills and allergy prescriptions.<br />Her dry fur grew long and silky.  Her energy level increased with this food.<br />The ingredient list is impressive as well.  It has real protein.<br />My dog would ordinarily turn away from dry dog food, but this particular bag has a lot of small flavor bits in it in between larger dry chunks.  It seems like the flavor bits are very appealing to my dog.<br />Please make sure to give your dog water with this dog food.

review/text: I own a miniature poodle and she is in love with this food. However it is high in protein so you dog will need to eat less of this then the normal store bought food. It's best if your dog is really active too because if you feed your dog this food and s/he just sleeps all day your dog will gain weight. Overall I highly recommend this product. You truly do get what you pay for.

review/summary: Dogs Love It
review/text: I recently added this food to the foods I rotate into my dogs' diet, and they absolutely love it.  Clean bowls all around.  High quality ingredients make me happy.  Protein level is higher than most foods, so if you need a lower level protein food, this may not be for you, or you will need to mix in another food.  If you are using a high-protein diet, then I highly recommend this food.<br /><br />The one drawback is price.  Per pound, it is the most expensive food I feed.  I rotate foods to add variety and keep interest in food, as my dogs seem to get bored with the same thing every day.  Despite the price, it is probably one of the most desired foods by my dogs, so at least the payoff is there.<br /><br />Shipping was surprisingly fast, free shipping was a great bonus.

review/summary: Good for my big guy but not his favorite flavor
review/text: Blue Buffalo continually produces high quality foods for dogs and for my 75 lb Pittie, it is very important as he has several stomach and skin issues.  He does very well with the Wilderness variety but I will note that he is not as enthusiastic about the Salmon recipe as he is with the Duck recipe.  Overall, this is another solid food in my opinion and it always ensures his coat is shiny, and that he is in the best health, which at 12 years old is critical. I find that the prices on Amazon are always cheaper and with Prime Shipping I don't even have to lug it around so that is another plus.

review/summary: The search is over for my French Bulldogs!!
review/text: I have two french bulldogs.  I have done absolutely everything to keep them healthy.  One is nearly 12 the other 3 years old.  My older dog was vomiting ALL the time and my younger one was chewing the pads of his feet apart and most recently, throwing up.  I've been buying them premium dog food their whole lives  or so i thought) and have added salmon oil and greens to their diet which did help with their coat and my older dog's hips/joints, but not their upset stomachs.  I know that Frenchies have a very sensitive system but this was getting ridiculous!<br /><br />My oldest daughter recently got french bulldog puppy and put her puppy on a completely raw diet of "Stella and Chewy's".  She swears by the frozen patties and wanted me to at least give it a try.  Well, given that I live far away from the nearest pet store that sells raw/frozen food, I decided to research different premium foods that would be similar to raw.  I came across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XGDG">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food, Salmon Recipe, 24-Pound Bag</a> here on Amazon, and after reading the reviews decided to give it a try.  I wasn't sure because with the wolf on the cover I thought that maybe it was for larger breeds, but that's not the case AT ALL.<br /><br />After the past couple of months of having my Frenchies on this dog food ALL throwing up has ceased.  There has been zero incidences.  The pads of my youngest dog are healed up and he no longer needs to wear a cone around his neck to keep him from chewing at them.  They have ENERGY, they are healthy and it is like a total miracle!  I can't say enough about the quality of this dog food, but it has literally changed the way my dogs act, feel and look.  I HIGHLY recommend this dog food to anyone who may have similar circumstances. I was literally resigned to believe that all Frenchies just threw up and I would have to deal with it.  NOT TRUE.  This has totally changed our lives and the lives of our dogs.<br /><br />A++++ Keep up the good work Blue Buffalo!

review/summary: My dog loves this food....
review/text: My wheaten terrier has been on Wellness Core for a couple of years now. I buy the BB to mix in with the Wellness about 50/50 to give him some variety. He is much more likely to eat when the food goes into his bowl when there's more BB in than WC. This last time I wasn't as diligent in mixing the two in the food container and there's more BB on top and he's been scarfing down his food immediately. I can't say I've noticed any other changes other than his enthuiasm for it, but that's enough for me...

review/summary: This is our new dog food, and I think she has more energy.
review/text: I have no problems with our last dog food (and it would still be my alternate choice in a pinch), but a perusal of comparisons and ratings showed that my old food was  3 or 4 stars (depending on which rater you looked at).  I decided to see what 5/6 star foods would be available locally and in the same price range.  This one fit the bill, so I gave it a try.  She likes it, and I do think that it's higher protein gives her a little more energy.<br /><br />If you are switching dog foods, do so gradually, and beware of loose stools if you transition to quickly.  Try [...] to compare foods.<br /><br />Grain free foods have been a huge benefit to my dog!  The improved nutrition has really reduced the number of ear infections that my Golden Retriever has gotten.

review/summary: Great for Dogs with digestive allergies.
review/text: When I first got my Golden Retriever I knew I wanted to feed him right. I started with Solid Gold puppy food which didn't work well. His feces were more like 'liquid gold' and his gas was constant and terrible. I also tried Nutro's Natural Choice and Blue Buffalo for large breed puppies. The stool and gas were better but still not solid. When he turned one year old I decided to give Wilderness a try, I came to the conclusion that he is allergic to rice and rice flower found in almost all dog foods. It has been nothing but good times since the switch. Sure it is a bit pricey but well worth it. You can also get a $5.00 coupon from the manufactures web site to use at B&M stores. I wish I could have started him on this food sooner but it is NOT for puppies. You should wait at least 1 year before the switch. He is also allergic to most kind of dog treats including rawhide. Blue Buffalo makes Wilderness treats as well, but I have yet to try them.

review/summary: Great ingredients but something is wrong
review/text: I did a lot of research on dog food after hearing Eukanuba and other dog food were found top have pentobarbital in them. I loved the ingredients of Blue Buffalo and they seemed to have an amazing reputation. We slowly, over ~ 10 days, weaned our dogs off Eukanuba and onto Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon. Bad things began happening soon after we started. All 3 dogs stopped having solid feces, and someone vomited everyday. We got through the bag and figured that lot, or set of ingredients, didn't agree with their digestive systems so we went over to the Duck. Things got worse.<br /><br />After 2 months of this we changed over to Nutro and they have been great since. I contacted Blue Buffalo to let them know our experiences and they replied with an email pretty much saying "Thanks for being a valuable customer"

review/text: I just got this today and changed from "U.D." ( urinary diet) that my hairless dogs have been tolerating ( barely) for 2+ years! My little guys WOLFED down a whole bowl each! I've never seen them like a food this much!! I could kiss the creators! First ,1 dog has has 2 surgeries for urine stones! In 2 years! On a " UD" $$$$ food! I shop amazon daily and researched all reviews and saw I was killing my own dogs with that garbage ! ( Grain is bad news but one review told me many dogs are allergic to chicken! ) my older " true hairless" is VERY allergic and despite 1000's spent on allergy testing, shots shampoos, etc he keeps an awful skin lesions that require shirts to cover!! It never completely goes away so I was FED up!! I ordered the salmon bc of the fish oil for skin ,( also got urine strips to test my little guys urine- less $$ to vet!!, got Urine crystal breakdown cranberry stuff (just do search on" urine crystals dogs" ) and followed other reviewers recommendations- my breed is prone to skin conditions ( including blackheads!!) and losing teeth,<br />They've only started this food today , but the " itch monster" is sleeping peacefully as well as my baby pup  - satiated and snoring !<br />Thank you Blue Buffalo!! I'm telling everyone abt this amazing food! ( & thanks to reviewers ) I also recommend you look up pat McKay - a holistic vet site with great vitamins and natural recipes! They'll direct you to a work up and 3 mos of "care" for only 250! ( I'm not affiliated at all ! )

review/summary: Great Ingredients - Good Quality Control?
review/text: I have been using Blue Buffalo Wilderness for a little over a year. I have 3 dogs, 2 labs and 1 golden. In my quest to find the "perfect" food for my golden's skin issues, I came across Blue Buffalo. After proper food transition, things seemed to be going smoothly. My golden still itches (which I think is yeast now, not food) and the one lab has a little gas, no biggie. About a month ago, I got a batch of food that made my 2 labs sick. The vet and I came to this determination when I put the dogs on plain rice, they were ok, then back on the food, sick again. I called Blue, they said perhaps the food was "too rich" for the labs. I'm not sure how, for they had been ok on the food for over a year. So, I tossed the food, bought a new batch, all is ok. The same thing happened this week, the labs are sick, and the golden ok. The labs eat rice for 2 days and they are good. Back on the food, now sick again. I called Blue. They could only say the food was too rich. To me, it doesn't make sense. Perhaps something along the process got into the food which sickens my labs, but not my golden. I like that the ingredients seemed to be sourced from whole foods, but I can't help but think the quality control of their processing is in check. Also, Blue did not rise up in the area of customer services. I was bummed about that.

review/summary: My lab/pit-bull mix loves it, has a beautiful coat, healthy body
review/text: Our young lab/pit-bull mix has been on the Blue Buffalo Wilderness dry foods for months now, and she loves it. She's about a year and a half old, with a ridiculously muscular body, a shiny coat, and less poops than when on a grain-based diet. She loves the taste of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness foods (you can obviously smell that it's fishy), and the Salmon has seemed to be her favorite, though we've bought the Duck and the Chicken as well. She never appears to overeat, so I don't worry about her having a lack of valuable nutrients. A young dog, she doesn't need the food to be softened with water.<br /><br />It's expensive, but surely it's worth it. My dog appears and acts very healthy. I've seen dogs fed on cheap, grain-based diets who are very overweight, despite exercising daily. Dogs are the descendants of wild beasts! And none of them ate corn. (Neither did our own ancestors.) A meat and vegetable diet is by far the healthiest. Sometimes I wonder if she's eating better than I am....

review/summary: Highly recommend!
review/text: I have 3 dogs. 2 boxers and one terrier. One of my boxers was having stool issues and vomiting often (sensitive stomach). We could not keep weight on her AT ALL! We fed her a large amount of different brand dog food and she still looked starved. We went to a pet store one day and asked for recommendations. They recommended this product (we get the salmon flavor to help her skin as well). We couldn't be happier! No more throwing up. No more bad poo's, and now it looks like we feed her! She (like many boxers) is still on the skinny side but not just ribs and hip bones sticking out. Since this product is expensive we feed our other 2 dogs purina pro plan (which works for them). Some reviews mention the dogs having stinky gas... BOTH my boxers stink us out of the house and the terrier doesn't fart at all (maybe a breed thing?). But, they are on 2 different dog foods (so not necessarily just the dog food causing the stink). Worth the money!!

review/summary: Smells good enough for Humans to eat!
review/text: I have 3 dogs and always concerned about their health as they are like children. About 2 weeks ago I went on a search for better food, after I read horrible reviews and details about the ingredients on previous food I was feeding them.<br /><br />Based on my dogs breed (Brussels Griffon, Yorkie & their baby) I was looking for a 5-star dog food brand that would fit all three best, including the convenience of being able to get the food by "location"!<br /><br />Luckily, PetSmart sells 2 5-star dog foods and this was one of them.<br /><br />I must say the food smells great! They all love it! I mix it with half a can of the same type in wet version.  The only problem I seem to be having is that the baby had a minor diarrhea due to the food change and one of them has really bad gas! Besides that they are all doing very well!

review/summary: GREAT food!
review/text: I have a chocolate lab that has various skin issues, all of which directly come from what food he eats.  I had him on purina pro plan and after he would eat his muzzle and gums were red and rash-y just from the stuff touching his skin.  The vet also said he was a little too heavy at 105 lbs.  I put him on this and he went back to the vet 2 weeks later for a follow up- he was down to 95lbs!!  His skin was also completely cleared up and his fur started to grow back where he had been chewing at himself.  He has much more energy now and doesn't have that doggie breath anymore.  I absolutley LOVE this food for him.  We feed twice a day, 2 cups in the morning and 2 cups at night and he never leaves a kibble, with the other food he would often leave half uneaten.  His poop is also much easier to deal with because there isn't as much waste in this food, so instead of going 5 times a day- he goes once.  I do wish it wasn't so expensive, but when you have a dog with allergies, its cheaper to buy this than go back and forth to the vet every month.  6 months later and he has a shiny glossy coat, sheds less and his eyes don't water anymore.  Salmon is his favorite flavor, but he likes the others as well.  Their catfood is awesome too!

If you're thinking about putting your dog on a better dog food, this is the one.  It's grain free, so most of my dog's allergies and itching got under control with this food. (Most)  I could tell it was good dog food when the running under her eyes stopped. And this is HIGH allergy season, so I was able to determine that the runny eyes were mostly being caused by the food.

review/summary: Vet recommended, Buddy loves it!
review/text: I've been feeding my dog Buddy (65 lb border collie/chow chow mix) Blue Wilderness for a few months, but it is expensive at my local petsmart. I figured out that it's cheaper per bag here at amazon, plus I don't have to pay sales tax, and it arrives at my door, no more lugging into a cart and then into the car then into my house. When I told my vet what I was feeding Buddy he was very pleased, because salmon is a great source of omega-3's. Plus, Buddy LOVES the salmon flavor. His coat is so much more shiny since I switched to the Wilderness line, must be because there's no grain in it. It also helped with his scratching, I think he's probably a little allergic to grains. Overall, a great shopping experience and a great product.

I've introduced more people to this seasoning; it is the "secret ingredient" to some of my most popular recipes.<br /><br />Lately, I've been making "simple salad" - torn bibb lettuce leaves, olive oil, Cavender's, a little grated parmesan, a little balsamic vinegar.  Nothing else.  I can't get enough.

When I opened the bottle I was immediately disappointed with the lack of a smokey scent -but upon tasting some of the light, flaky crystals I was pleasantly surprised with its 'sweet' taste.  If you're looking for smokey salt I would say look elsewhere.  This salt has been my favorite sea salt on Salads thus far.  I won't be afraid to buy the regular Arabian Fleur De Sel now.

review/summary: Nice Smoke Flavor
review/text: I guess you could call me a salt addict, I also guess it is a good thing that I have no blood pressure or heart issues as I am able to indulge myself with all different kinds of salts. This particular one is very nice and has a lovely mellow smoke flavor. The size of the crystals at first had me thinking I would have to use this salt in a grinder but I found that the large crystals are delicate and crush very easily in the fingers. I'll order more Spice Lab products based on how nice this salt is.

review/summary: The best fruit snacks
review/text: These snacks were the best I've ever found. We have a Granddaughter that is sensitive to dyes, these were 100% natural no dyes at all, just fruit juice. They tasted great and were good for them, I'm very disappointed they are no longer available.

review/summary: Check ingredients before purchasing
review/text: The labeling debate continues ... Natural... Doesn't mean it's natural to consume!  How can a product geared towards children that boasts 'made with real fruit and vegetable juice' also contain an ingredient that among other things, prohibits the normal absorption of vitamins and is used to clean industrial products? Please search 'mineral oil' before purchasing Motts products. There are healthy gummy alternatives out there or you can offer actual fruit and vegetables at snack time.  I am referring specifically to Mott's Medleys assorted fruit fruit flavored snacks. Let's keep our kids healthy!!!

review/summary: Product was good, shipping was rough, had a few leak
review/text: The product was fine.  Good price through Amazon - less than the grocery store on sale.  However, the shipping was rough and one box had several pouches that leaked.  2 of the 4 boxes were fine.  1 box was wet (pouches okay) but the leaking box beside it got it wet and ruined the box.  4th box had several pouches leak and ruined the cardboard box.  Amazon gave a partial discount for my trouble.  Would order again with reservations.

review/summary: Wonderful!!!
review/text: I bought this because I heard that sesame oil was great for making mayo.  I haven't tried other sesame oils, but this is FANTASTIC.<br /><br />Some recipes call for extra virgin olive oil, but that makes a very strong flavored (disgusting!) mayo--I used that the first time I made mayo, and I just threw it away.  This sesame oil makes all the difference, though.<br /><br />This is the recipe that I used:<br /><br />---<br />1 farm fresh egg<br />1 cup extra virgin cold pressed sesame oil<br />1 Tbsp lemon juice<br />salt and pepper to taste<br /><br />1. In a large bowl whisk the egg.<br />2. In a thin, very slow stream, add the oil with one hand while continuing to whisk with the other hand.  A food processor can be used as an easier alternative to doing it by hand.<br />3. Whisk in all remaining ingredients.<br />4. Store refrigerated.<br />---<br /><br />I used my food processor.  And, today I made a second batch with half sesame oil, half coconut oil; it was still good.  I think the sesame oil really adds the perfect smell and taste to mayo.<br /><br />We've been using the mayo on toasted sourdough sandwiches with grilled meat and cheese, lettuce, tomato, and green peppers.  SO tasty!  It would make a perfect substitute for any store mayo, though.  (And it's way healthier, since it doesn't have hydrogenated oils and chemicals, etc.)<br /><br />I do think this would make a great addition to salad dressings or stir fry.  It has a lighter flavor than toasted sesame oil.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  This oil is SO good!

review/summary: Great Flavor. Terrible Price.
review/text: Soda Stream is awesome. Love it, and this flavour is great. Very much like Coke Zero. Here's the deal though. The mix on Amazon is WAY over priced, and I can't figure out why? You can get these same flavours in the same size for betweeen $5.00-$7.00 at any Bed Bath and Beyond store. Amazon and vendors want between $9-$14. I don't get it. Just go to the store and pick them up, or order them online at bed bath and beyond. ITs a shame as I buy everything from Amazon and would love to bundle my reorders of this stuff, but not for that type of markup.

review/summary: Bought 5, received 1
review/text: I figured this price (11.99) was too good to be true for a set of five but I ordered it anyway. I opened the box and only found one. At the time this product (identical description and link) was sold by "Trend Marketing" with prime shipping. I emailed Amazon to get the remaining four and they said they couldn't because they don't know or control the inventory for Trend. They refunded the full amount and didn't need me to return the single bottle. So it was free. Not a good deal if you need five but a great deal for the one.<br /><br />I just went to reorder in the hopes I would actually get five now. Though the description is the same it no longer has prime shipping and is decidedly not worth $7 shipping if I only get one bottle.
