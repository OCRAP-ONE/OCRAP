review/summary: Great low calorie baking ingredient!
review/text: The Cherry Berry variety is great for baking low calorie muffins or scones - no sugar!  The corn variety is good for a office snack - portion controlled, only 70 calories, and more nutritious than chips!  I haven't tried the others but plan to - will try different varieties for scones and muffins - lower sugar than raisins or craisins or dried berries.  Good stuff!

review/summary: Crunchy healthy and portable snack!
review/text: I really like these freeze dried fruit snacks as they are very fresh compared to other companies that sell you a large quantity that is only in one large package and does not keep well.<br />Now for people complaining that these are mainly apple, I'm not surprized.<br />You can buy other brands that are just one kind of freeze dried fruit and pay 3 times more.<br />I have even seen at the store for kids a mix of only berries and banana and it was $5 for a 1 ounce/30 gram pouch!<br /><br />For the Amazon price and subscribe and save these are the best price and packaging around.<br />Now for people that say these taste awful, they taste just like regular fruits to me, the dried fruits you buy at other natural stores are full of sugar so some people are more likely used to those.

review/text: This freeze dry fruit tastes good and crunchy. Unfortunately, this is supposed to be mixed fruit, but in the bag, it is mainly apple, only has a few pieces of others - pineapple, mango and banana. Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars.

review/text: The first time I ordered the product, it was great and that is why I bought it again. This time, it seems to have been a BIG mistake. The fruit was humid, hard and nothing like before. Should not forget to mention the big clumps of fruit stuck together, that were so hard it made my teeth hurt. Too bad. I used to love this product, and talk to my friends about it. Not anymore. :(

review/text: Superb flavor.  Easy to use.  Place meat in zip lock type bag, shake up the Allegro bottle, pour in half bottle (or whole bottle depending on meat/ roast size), and let marinate in fridge for a couple of hours, occasionally flipping bag and gently massaging meat.  So far 8 people on different occasions have stated they have never had a better tasting steak.  I also have had to rush the marinade time to only 30 minutes by piercing meat with a fork during marinade. Not the best method, but the flavor still was incredible.  Shipping cost is a problem, as almost doubles the price for a case.  Allegro is only $4 per bottle at at my local Kroger's.

review/summary: terrific marinade
review/text: This is hands-down the easiest and tastiest marinade I've ever used.  My whole family and many families in our area buy it from local stores.  It is strong so a little goes a long way.  My husband had never had it before we married and now he wants it in every pot roast with vegetables and in hamburgers. When making pot roast, I water it down a little which makes it a little less strong but still tenderizes the meat and provides water for the vegetables. I love it on fish and chicken.  Our cabinet is never without it.  Thanks, Allegro!

review/summary: Agave to the rescue!
review/text: Love this product for my daughter who has a terrible sweet tooth and is borderline diabetic. Everyone who tries it likes it as well. Even my hubby is almost sold, and he is a die-hard white sugar lover!<br /><br />First heard about product from my raw sister who is a purist when it comes to her diet. She doesn't bother too much with processed foods, and I am striving to be like her. Bless you Seshatms!<br /><br />Product is a little sweet for me as I gave up sugar and honey long, long ago in my drinks. But it is excellent for cooking ... just don't use to much as it is very, very sweet.<br /><br />For those still holding on to sugar and honey, it is a great way to get rid of those cravings.

This product is NOT just for sweetening drinks.  Xagave is PERFECT for cooking and baking.  In fact, I "slip" it into the cookies or cakes I make for my friends and family.  No one can tell the difference!!<br /><br />Buy this product and you will be amazed!!

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: My wife and I always try to consume organic products.  We recently purchased a Blendtec from Costco and the host used this sweetener in quite a few recipes.  There are a ton of artificial sweeteners everywhere:  all man-made and extremely bad for you.  With all the high fructose corn syrup in almost everything that's eaten in this country, it's no wonder the majority of the American population is overweight!  After reading the ingredients in this product, it was a no brainer. Since this product is organic and there is a sugar conversion table listed also, it makes this product an A+++.  It only takes a little bit in each recipe to add just a little flavor if needed, without the guilt or harm of adding a processed sweetener.  Overall, I highly recommend!

review/summary: Our Favorite Natural Sweetner!
review/text: This is the best Agave brand we've used. We use Xagave as our everyday sweetener, as well as a replacement for sugar products in baking and other deserts. While we do still use organic Maple syrup in moderation, Xagave has a bit lower glycemic load. So, I sometimes set aside a 25 oz (18 fl oz) bottle and add a tablespoon or so of Mapleine extract (you can usually find it here on Amazon or at most Wal-Mart superstores). After allowing a day or so for the extract to blend well with the Xagave, it works very well as a Maple syrup stand-in!<br /><br />I'm particularly pleased the last 2-pack of Xagave bottles arrived with new flip-top lids. So far, the new style lid seems to have eliminated the irritating sticky drip down the side of the bottle the previous lid allowed.

review/summary: Best Agave Out There!
review/text: I had never tried agave before I tried Xagave, and since trying it have experimented with other agave nectars, but this is by far the best!  I've been recently trying to cut back on processed food and sweets (veryyy hard for me to do as I love sugar more than any other food group) and Xagave has made it easier for me to give up more of my unhealthy sweets for stuff I make with agave, and if the taste isnt the same, it's better! Also much less expensive than using stevia to replace sugar.  I will never use any agave or sweetener but Xagave!

review/summary: Hands down the best agave, it's like a whole different nectar!
review/text: I can't stress this enough, this agave is simply far superior to other agave nectars.  The taste is very neutral without the aftertastes other agaves seem to have, and the texture is creamy smooth.  Each bottle has a very informative sugar exchange table (detailed in that there are slight differences whether you're using it in a liquid versus baking with it) and the best part is that I have been able to take some of my mother's favorite recipes and convert them using Xagave instead of sugar and brown sugar without it effecting the end result.  In fact the cake I made seemed to be lighter and fluffier.  I again cannot stress enough how much this nectar changes everything for me.  As another reviewer mentioned finally something that meets the hype.

review/summary: Worst dispenser design I've ever experienced
review/text: I generally don't write bad product reviews, but in this case I'll make an exception. I switched from using sugar in my coffee to agave due to the low glycemic index, but also because it seemed simple to use, and the liquid is much easier to dissolve if I wanted to use it in a cooler liquid, such as iced tea. This was the first agave I ever purchased, and I am now a big fan. However, that is IN SPITE OF this Xagave product, NOT because of it. The bottle design for this agave nectar was beyond frustrating to me. The design of the bottles included a clear plastic top, which came off completely, and a little nub with a hole on it that you pulled up so that you could squirt agave out, and then pushed back in when you were done (kind of like an old-school water bottle), and then you put the clear plastic top back on again. There is NO way this design was actually tested by a conscious living human before it was putt into production. You could not use this product without leaving at least a tiny bit of agave around the spout thing every single time you used it. The next morning, you left a little more, and so on and so forth, until the top of the bottle (including the little plastic top thing) were so disgusting and sticky that I actually started to dread my normal cup of coffee every morning. I literally counted down the days until we were finished with this product (yes, I refused to waste it by throwing it out); not because I planned on quitting agave. No, only because I wanted to quit making a sticky disgusting mess every morning with my coffee. Honestly, I can't believe I'm the first one to complain about this. Am I the only one who received this type of dispenser top? Is this some sort of elaborate agave practical joke?<br /><br />Bottom line, I like agave. Strongly support it. I hate this bottle. In my nightmares, a giant version of this bottle leaves sticky puddles of disgustingness that I get stuck in until the end of time. Until the bottle design is changed, don't buy it. I've used other agave and it has all tasted just as good. Buy one that won't frustrate you with each use.<br /><br />Note: If the bottle has changed in any way, someone please comment on my review and say so, and I will change my review to reflect that. As of today (09-14-11), one of the pictures Amazon is using looks like it has a different dispenser/tap than mine, while another picture shows the same tap I had on my bottles. A flip-top would basically solve all of my complaints; I switched to a different brand (Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Blue Agave), and the flip-top design is perfect.

review/text: Agave supposedly has a lower glycemic load, but beware, that depends on how it's processed. Any sweetener should be used in moderation. That being said, this stuff tastes great - a lot like corn syrup.<br /><br />My favorite thing about agave is that it will dissolve in cold beverages. We mostly use it in sweet tea, but have also used it in ice cream and home made baked goods, all with excellent results.<br /><br />I see some complaints about the bottles, but the bottles I received were sturdy and dispensed the product without leaking.<br /><br />This brand is the tastiest we've tried yet and is hopefully organic. We'll be buying it again.

review/text: I remember reading an article regarding the alleged dangers of Agave Syrup from the quack "nutritionist" Dr. Mercola - yes, the same guy who claims that eating fruit gives you diabetes! Mercola claimed, with little to no scientific evidence whatsoever, that Agave syrup is as bad as high fructose corn syrup, and the gullible ran with the story.<br /><br />Anyway, I am a person who is extremely sensitive to sugar. I get a really bad headache and feel extremely dizzy immediately after ingesting food or drinks that is too sweet, so I decided to try out this brand of Agave, mainly because it contains fiber - my first time trying Agave.<br /><br />I use it mostly to sweeten tea and smoothies, and I don't feel sick as when I use table sugar. And the best part is, there is no aftertaste. I wish it would last longer, though, but that's OK.<br /><br />I will purchase it again and again, and Mercola can go suck on a boiled egg!

review/text: very easy to work with - i bought orange, white and green in large quantities and red for decorating.  all were easy to use.  red was softer, which makes sense since it was specifically designed for decoration.  i did not microwave the fondant as described for 'softening' i simply used a knife cut off a section and then kneeded it with my hands on teh table till it got softer.  it worked very well and looked super nice!  i would highly recommend this to anyone who is a first time cake maker!

review/summary: so so
review/text: Bought this for the color which was nice and vibrant. My issue that when covering a cake it was so soft it tore and sort of melted. And was bit sticky. I would rather use Wilton, or homemade to cover a cake. Probably would be ok if you were just making decorations or embellishments.

review/summary: Uneven Quality
review/text: My cats loved the first two bags, but the latest one repelled both of them. Even the one who wants to eat himself into obesity so badly that he eats filth off of the floor. I can't say that I blame them, because the smell was worse than usual. The bag doesn't expire for another 19 months, so I think the manufacturer has some serious quality control problems.

review/summary: Dont depend on it for dental help
review/text: This is a good treat for your cat, if he/she likes it. Some do not. I'd suggest a new customer w/ a cat who has never had the treat get a small bag  and not invest in the large one incase the cat refuses it.  My cat likes the hygene chews and I like to treat her regularly. However, they in no way take the place of any other dental cleaning from your vet or regular toothbrushing you can do yourself. This product can not remove any tartar or plaque on the cat's teeth, only a scaling will do that.  If you cat likes them fine, but dont depend on this for your cat's dental health.<br /><br />BTW this produict is available from various sources. Try searching for better prices if esp. you choose to go with the larger size.

review/text: Hi,<br /><br />This is a good product according to my cat.  He was very excited about this and even bit on the bag in an attempt to get one.  He loves it.  And I must say that I believe his teeth are better with it and breath.  I know many think this isn't the case.  That a tooth brush is necessary.  That may be true, but he had so much trouble holding the toothbrush.  He doesn't have opposable thumbs.<br /><br />As for the seller, I am not sure why people had problems.  I have not and ordered twice.  Both times, there was quick delivery.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

review/text: It took awhile but our cat is loving this treat and with its ability to also clean her teeth. We hope to get a good report on the health of her gums and teeth on her next visit to her veterinarian.<br /><br />In our case, we started with cutting up the treat into bite-size pieces and adding it on her food in small amounts. Gradually she is no able to consume the entire piece but we still cut it up leaving the film around it so she work on it a bit.

review/text: I have 4 cats and they are usually eat anything. I thought it would be a good idea to get them a treat and clean their teeth at the same time. I got the fish flavor and none of them would touch it. Then I tried to break it into small pieces and 2 cats out of 4 would eat it now. I called the C.E.T company and they said they have 100% satisfy guarantee. So that was nice.

review/summary: CET Chews are great, Amazon, not so great
review/text: The CET chews are fantastic in keeping my cat's teeth clean.  However Amazon has buckled under to a group called "Color of Change" with is a race-centered extreme leftist group that is extorting companies to drop affiliation with a business group called ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council).  Color of Change was founded by Van Jones, an avowed radical with a race-based agenda that has been exposed by his own words caught on tape.  Caving in to such race-based political groups that oppose the free market system is a losing proposition and is a sure way to lose customers such as myself.  My latest purchase of these CET chews tonight was not made at Amazon but at another company. Amazon needs to disassociate itself from race-based hate groups and re-join with ALEC to support the free market.

review/summary: My cat loves them and the seller was great
review/text: I was worried that my cat would not like these and was hesitant to buy this many.  I purchased a smaller bag and my cat LOVES them.<br /><br />So I purchased this much larger bag at Amazon's much better price via Amazon from Entirely Pets.  Again, I was worried about the seller based on other comments.  But they were ordered on Sunday, and I got them Tuesday morning - they ship from Fremont, CA.  The expiration date on the bag is 16 months from now, about what I would get in any retail store.  So I've just not experienced any problems with this seller or this product.<br /><br />The manufacturer admits that brushing your cat's teeth is much better, and I do that about every other day.  This product ensures that there is at least something done for his teeth every day.  And trust me, my cat does not let me forget to give him one of these every night.  He'll claw at my legs until I do and his claws are sharp!<br /><br />By the way, one tip for cat owners: many of an older cat's problems are due to the propensity of most cats not to drink enough water: kidney and teeth problems are common.  I feed my cat only a teaspoon of wet food a day, smothered in about 2 ounces of water.  He drinks the wet-food-flavored water and only then gets to eat the wet food.  My cat is 19 years old (the average cat lives to be about 12-14 years old) and has had no major health problems.  However, the teeth cleanings are getting to be too stressful for him, so I've taken to these treats and brushing his teeth to try to spread out the cleanings.

review/text: I have been purchasing these treats at the recommendation of the vet to help with my cat's tarter build ups.  When they are chewed they release enzymes into kitty's mouth to help fight against the tarter.<br /><br />What really surprised me is the price difference, I was paying about $12 at the vet for a 30 pack.  When I did the math on buying the 90 pack + S&H, it's about the same amount I would pay for two 30 packs -- so I got 30 more, another month's supply!<br /><br />Also, Entirely Pets shipped this very promptly.  I ordered on Labor Day Weekend and it arrived on the following Thursday.  Good Service!

However they love these chews and they would eat them all if given to them or they could open the container I have them in.<br /><br />After using them for 4 months, my cats went back to the vets for a checkup. The vets were taken back how effective these chews were. Strange given the vets recommended them to me. No more red gums and only a little build up of plaque.

He's at least 11 years old and has had multible teeth cleanings so i know how bad his breath can be. he recently had a checkup and the vet said he was in great shape for being so old. i gave them 4 stars because i was unable to track or check status on my package. it made me uneasy that my package may have been lost.

review/summary: They actually work!
review/text: In September 2009, my vet gave me a few of the fish-flavored chews when I picked my cat up from his teeth cleaning surgery. I wasn't sure about them, but my cat's 12, needs a special canned-food diet, & he needed anesthetized teeth cleaning every year. I figured anything to reduce the number of time he gets anesthetized was worth a try.<br /><br />She told me to break up the first chew so the cat would bite into the flavored part instead of the wierd-feeling wrapper. The cat was a bit dubious about it at first, but he was hooked within 2 treats & learned to bite through immediately. Now he begs for the things and pounces with great glee when I toss one across the floor each night.<br /><br />I feed him 1 treat soon after his canned food. He takes about 10 seconds to eat it & clean up the crumbs. He just had a 7-month check up & there's not a speck of tartar on his teeth. The vet said she'd never have guessed he was 11 or ate canned food! His breath has been great, too.<br /><br />My only reservation is that I think the company may have changed the formula with the last batch I bought. They are more yellow than tan, & smell icky to me. The original chews smelled fine. My cat was ... less than enthused about the change, but he still eats them willingly. I'm not sure if I could have gotten him hooked with the new formula, but he did eventually come to accept it.<br /><br />Overall score: effectiveness-10, taste/smell-4. Try a small bag to see if your cat can be convinced to like the chews, then buy in bulk for savings.

review/text: First off, my kittens loved these treats. They figured out right away what they're suppose to do with them and became their top most favorite treats.  Unfortunately after 6 weeks of vomiting and diarrhea for my little boy involving 3 vet visits at hundreds of dollars through trial and error I was able to determine that these treats were the culprit.<br /><br />They were well loved, appeared to work,  and caused no issues with my girl kitten so I still give them 4 stars.  But if your cat starts experiencing mystery GI issues with these just try discontinuing them for a few days and se if it helps.  I haven't asked my vet what about these might be the issue yet but I will next time I visit.

review/summary: Took some time but worth it
review/text: I purchased these chews for my cat as he had BAD cat breath. Initially, when I gave the treat he sniffed it and walked away. So I made a change and cut his cat food down from one cup a day (big cat) to 1/2 of a cup. By the second day he was willing to take the treat from a plate on the floor but wouldnt take it from my hand.<br />By day five, he took it from my hand. Once he took it from my hand I added back his 2 Whiskas Temptations treats that he received daily. After the first week I noticed the BAD breath became much beter. Now into our 3rd week he looks forward to me returning home and begs (he was a stray and already knew how to beg, lucky me) for his treats. The CET is the last treat he receives. His food was increased back to 3/4 of a cup as he needs to lose a bit. His breath again is much much much better and I am sold. I may try the chicken next time but for some reason the fish was $3 cheaper for the same amount. I did put half of the bag into one of his previous plastic treat jars as it was a pain to keep opening and resealing this big package. Now I just twist open the jar and Voila. Enjoy your experience.

review/text: My cat loves these.  Unfortunately, he ended up with a bacterial infection from an unknown source, and we had to stop all kinds of foods and put him on a veterinary prescription diet.  The infection could have been from the vet's office, some food he ate, or even the original breeder's house.  We have no other cats, so he wasn't infected at home via another cat).  These chews did an excellent job keeping his teeth clean, but were not as effective with his gums.  I am really looking forward to getting him back on these chews so that at least his teeth will be healthy.  We have to wait for his allergy tests to come back to find out what he is allergic to.  As soon as we get the green light from our vet, I am going to put him back onto the chews.  I would recommend them to any cat owner looking to improve his or her cat's teeth.

review/text: One of my 3 cats has always had funky breath so I've decided to finally do something about it to help her out.  She's a smaller 8 lbs cat and she loves these treats.  They're not too big for her like some of the others have had issues with and she gobbles it up as soon as I put it down.  My other larger cats like them as well and do not seem to have issues eating them either.<br /><br />I only give it 4 stars because I've only been using them a couple days now so I can't provide 100% feedback on their effectiveness yet.

review/text: My vet recommended these treats to keep the plaque off my cats' teeth.  When I opened them I thought, "there's no way they're going to eat these."  They feel like styrofoam but they're actually a soft middle wrapped in some sort of casing.  My cats go crazy for them.

review/text: My 2 cats go crazy for these treats. The little one, Figgy yells at me each night until he gets his treat. They really work. Their teeth are not gunked up with plaque anymore. Also, Figgy's gums are nice and pink. The big bonus is that the price is right. They cost a fraction of what my vet wanted. A++++++++++

review/summary: My cats won't eat them
review/text: I am desperate to find a good dental product for one of my cats, and I hoped this one would do the trick. The reviews sounded positive, but you never know until you try it with your cat. The treats are quite large for a cat's mouth, in my opinion - about the size of a wine cork. The idea is that the cat will have to chew it for awhile, and it will do its tartar-control thing. My cat expressed some interest by sniffing and licking it a little, but he didn't attempt to eat it. I then tried cutting the treat into smaller pieces, thinking that if I got him hooked, he would eventually take the full-sized treat and get the full benefit from the chewing. He ate one little piece one time and then never again. My other cat, who has healthy teeth and gums, did eat one full-sized treat once but didn't go for it the next time. So we'll try something else, which is fine. I do wish there had been a smaller bag of these treats available so I could test them out first.

review/summary: One cat eats them, one won't
review/text: My vet gave me a sample of these because both my cats had some tartar build up, and one needed a (expensive!) teeth cleaning. One of my cats loved them, she actually carried it around with her before eating it. It's kind of like a toy for her, which gives her something to do. The other cat turned her nose up and walked away. I haven't been feeding them long enough to my cats to comment on whether they reduce tartar and build up, but I do give my dog these same treats (the dog chews) and they help her breath and teeth SO much. Every time I take her to the vet, they comment on how clean her teeth are. So I'm hoping it will help my cats teeth out that much also.

review/summary: They appear to work and my cats love them
review/text: I've gone a couple of weeks without refilling my treat supply, and I'm really noticing the cats' breath getting worse.  Given their propensity for cleaning themselves inches away from my face at three in the morning, that is plenty of reason for me to buy this product.<br /><br />Also - while the cats all are thrilled by food of any sort, they are particularly nuts about these treats.  The sound of rustling cellophane brings them all running.  If I'm not careful they'll climb my legs to get them.  And I have to toss them to different parts of the house so that each cat gets to eat in peace, with no treat stealing or fights.

review/text: My cat is diabetic, so he is not allowed to have regular cat treats.  However, the diabetes complicates his oral health.  I bought the whole line of oral care products for cats -- all of which he hates except these fish chews.  He adores the fish chews and waits for them like regular treats.  They have helped his breath so much and they seem to help his tartar build up.  I will continue to buy them for him... they make him happy and help keep him out of the vet's office for dreadful teeth issues!

review/summary: Good product, predatory sales (Entirely Pets)
review/text: I've bought these from a number of places, but mainly Entirely Pets, via Amazon. A bit more than 2 months ago (11/8/10) these were $18.55 each.<br /><br />The first time I searched for them, this morning, it was almost $29/ea--don't quite recall. Now, this afternoon, it's $27/ea. The previous purchase, in Nov, the first price was around $25, but I looked and looked (including Entirely Pets' home site), then came back to Amazon and the price was lowed to $18.55! They're tracking us--Entirely Pets, not sure if Amazon is involved in this. I don't trust Entirely Pets.<br /><br />So, it's almost $9 more now, 2 months later. I bet if I wait another day, the price will go down more.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good product. My three cats like it, and with brushing teeth, oral rinse, and the chews, they have good teeth. Haven't had to have a cleaning for about 2 years. It is overpriced--$20 would be fair. They're gouging us.<br /><br />There's also Enzadent Chews, from Vet Solutions. They're cheaper right now, at Amazon. Still from Entirely Pets. I'm looking elsewhere.

review/summary: a treat, a toy and a toothbrush all in one
review/text: After a little experimentation with these treats, they have become a staple in our home.<br />Our little cat would not, and could not bite into these treats as they are in their full size.  I'm not sure if it was the size, shape or smell of them, but she was not interested.<br />They are unlike any other cat treat I've seen.  They are styrofoam in consistency and are big - - about the size of a wine bottle cork.<br />The first thing I did was use a utility knife to slice each treat into 3 pieces - - a bit time consuming because I didn't want them to crumble.<br />The second thing I did was roll one of them across the floor.  She took off after it, bit it, realized it tasted yummy, ate it and came back for more.<br />That's all it took and we now have a daily routine that combines playtime, snacktime and toothbrushing all into one.

I have three "finicky" cats, so was skeptical about their liking the chews, but decided to try the fish flavor ones anyway.  Well, the cats went crazy over these, in fact I had to hide the bag as they had ripped through it looking for more.  I have noticed improvement in my oldest cats breath.

review/summary: For cats who won't brush their fangs
review/text: We have 2 cats. One eats a varied diet that includes a healthy bowl of dry food which is good for her teeth. The other is so finicky, she drives us nuts. She only eats wet food and only certain flavors and certain brands.<br /><br />Even at the young age of 2, she was having gum problems and looking at a future of early tooth loss (devastating to the ego of a cat).<br /><br />This cat is not a pet-able cat. Don't think about picking her up let alone attempt to brush her teeth, if you value your eyes, your life, etc. This cat is a killer (but we love her anyways and are trying to keep her out of jail).<br /><br />A new younger vet arrived. He suggested these chews for cat number 2 to improve her gums and perhaps prevent her from losing teeth at a young age.<br /><br />She LOVES them. (The FISH flavor NOT the poultry.) She begs for them on her first bowl of wet (of course) food every morning. She lies to the 3 of us humans: after human 1 gives her a chew, she tells human 2 that she has not had a chew yet today, please give me one. Then she tells human 3 that humans 1 and 2 forgot to give her a chew and she gets chew number 3.<br /><br />Or maybe she is not lying because cat number 1 likes them too but the vet did not prescribe them for her. I know she sneaks over to cat number 2s bowl and snatches a chew now and then.<br /><br />Not cheap but well worth the price because cat number 2s gums and teeth have improved. Vet has given up (as have we) on trying to get her to eat dry food.

review/text: This seller by far is the only terrible seller I have dealt with from Amazon.<br />The Cat Chews arrived without any expiration date printed on the bags and most of them have changed to a very yellowy color. My two cats won't touch those with a off color. So, I have contacted the seller and someone over there told me to send them back for an exchange. I did that, and called the seller one month later since nobody contacted me and neither did I receive the exchanged product. After calling many times, I gave up and contacted Amazon.com. Since everytime, the person answered the phone told me that he can't do anything and the manager will call me back and he never did. After 5 of this phone calls, I decided I've wasted too much of my time and it's better to direct the issue to Amazon.com. And Amazon has made it so easy for me. They filed the claim and did the refund. I'll keeping shopping with Amazon, but not with this seller anymore. They are many other sellers carry the same Cat Chews.

review/summary: Cat Loves Them - Hope They Work
review/text: I have a domesticated formerly feral cat. The vet found two cavities and gingavitis on his last exam.  He is mostly very affectionate but I made ONE attempt to brush his teeth and am never going to try that again.  I got clawed up trying the oral rinse the vet sold me as an alternative.  Dental chews are a last resort.  The cat was indifferent to the treats sold by the vet.  I searched for alternatives through the internet and thought I would give these a try due to the mostly positive reviews.<br /><br />He loves them.  Like other reviewers I thought they were rather large, so the first time I unwrapped the cellophane-like covering and broke it into pieces.  Those were gone in about a second.  So I tried giving him a whole one.  Took about two seconds.  Now when I toss him one (once a day or so) he tries to snatch it out of the air.  I'm not sure whether it helps his teeth or not as he gobbles it in a second or two but he sure does love them.

review/summary: Great taste, too big
review/text: I ordered the 30 count pack of these chews for my three cats (Siblings that are 2 years old).  I had to go to the vet earlier this week because one of the cats (Daisy) looked like she had gingivitis, which she did, and found that the other two cats had some serious tartar.  I feed them a can of wet food once a day that they share and leave dry food out for nibbling.  The vet recommended these chews for all three cats, so I bought them.  I had read on earlier reviews that they were pretty big, and like the reviews saying that they were like wine corks, they're completely correct.  They're about the size of a wine cork with a softer texture and it smelled like fish food (I got the fish flavor).  All three of my cats are pretty small (ranging from 8-11 pounds), so I had trouble getting them to eat a full one.  I wound up cutting them into quarters to get Daisy to try them, and once she did, she went CRAZY for them.  She literally stands on the back or arm of my chair, swatting her paw out to get a piece when I'm cutting them!  She'll even throw little tantrums when I try to hold her back from stealing them from the other cats!  The other two cats didn't warm up to them as quickly or easily until I started cutting the quarter pieces into half.  I could definitely tell that they liked the taste, but it was just bigger than any other treats or food that they've eaten in the past, so they weren't used to it.<br /><br />I'm not sure if cutting the chews into little pieces will affect their effectiveness, but if I just gave them a whole piece, I'm sure the only cat who would try to eat it would be Daisy (which I suppose is good because she's the one with the gingivitis).  If this review was based on taste alone, I would have given it a 5/5 star rating; however, I wish they could make them more compact.<br /><br />Just a tip if you're cutting them, the chews have a papery coating on the outside.  My cats still ate the papery covering, but I'm not sure what it's made out of, exactly.  The chews stay intact for the most part, but do get a little crumbly when you start to cut them into smaller pieces.  I'm definitely going to try and "wean" them into eating larger and larger pieces.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I slowly started giving my cats larger pieces and now they happily eat the whole treat by themselves! Just make sure to watch your cats because my cats try to steal the treats from the others!

review/summary: Cat loves them, Unsure how effective.
review/text: My cat absolutely loves his "fish corks".  We have to keep them locked in a cabinet or he chews through the bag and eats all of them.  They are about the size of a wine cork.  Foam like texture with tough outer covering.  In theory, biting through the outer covering and squishing into the inner foam is supposed to help keep teeth clean.  Hard to tell if they are effective but I'm too lazy to brush his teeth and figure this is better than nothing.  He is fed Wellness wet food only.  I strongly believe kibble is bad for animal teeth since it doesn't clean their teeth while chewing and all the carbs simply make a nice paste on teeth providing an excellent environment for plaque forming bacteria.  Seriously, would you replace your tooth brush with hard cookies?  Consider the residue from Oreos?  I've seen kibble fed teeth and they aren't pretty.  We've been using this product for a few years.  Our cat is nine years old and finally needed his first professional teeth cleaning earlier this year.  The dental chews have a strong odor and oily residue that sticks to your fingers but easily washes off with simple water and friction.  He attacks and bats them around the floor for a second then devours them quickly.  I usually give him one each day.

review/summary: Great for oral hygiene
review/text: My cats love the taste of these chews and regard them as treats.  I have definitely noticed cleaner breath in my older cat and use this product as a prophylactic for the younger one.  A very good price and I will be buying them again.

review/summary: Little Fish Corks!
review/text: I was really hoping my cat would like these.  I buy the dog variety and my dogs love them.  My cat sniffed the chew and walked away.  I tied a string to it and attempted to get kitty to chase and chew the fishy smelling little item.  It was a no go.  Finally,  I sliced the chew into 4 pieces with a serrated knife.  I think he ate them unless my dogs found them before I did.<br />I don't know if the cut up pieces will work as well because he doesn't really have to chew them for very long.<br />Anyway, my rescue kitty is scheduled for a cleaning and hopefully the vet will have some ideas for keeping him free of plaque and periodontal disease.  Kitty is only 3 years old but the vet tells me he is needing a cleaning.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P3NU4O">C.E.T.

review/summary: All three cats love them.
review/text: Cats being who they are, there is of course no guarantee that your cats will find these treats appealing - but all three of mine devoured them.<br /><br />It took my tiny (6 lb) cat a little while to get the hang of eating them - they're pretty thick.  But once she got the hang of getting at them from the end she did just fine, and in a way it seems she has to take the most bites and gets the most benefit.<br /><br />Sadly, the cat with the worst teeth is allergic to them.  He's allergic to most dry foods as well, and my bet is that it's some sort of preservative triggering the reaction.<br /><br />As a result, I can't report on what they'll do for a cat with real dental issues - but they do polish away minor tartar build up and they eliminate stinky cat food breath when given as an after dinner treat.

review/text: I cannot attest to the results purported yet by this product but my cats love them. Our younger male cat, 3 years, especially loves them and will gnaw on a whole one of these 'treats'. He even got into the bag when we were gone and ate 5! The other cats did not seem interested because they are ridiculously large almost 2" x 0.5". The are wrapped in a wafer paper like material with a flaky, wafery, crumbly, stuff inside. To feed the other cats, I applied pressure to the wafer and rolled it back and forth between my fingers to break it out of the 'shell'. I do this and add it to their food or put it separately on their plate like an side dish in addition to their wet meal and they love it, go nuts for it. I associate it with/like brushing our teeth after we eat. They eat their main course, have dried bonito flakes on the side, and then have a side of these flaky chews (not really chews at all, like a crepe rolled up tight). I have only recently made this purchased and started using this product so cannot provide evidence for, or against, the claims of the product regarding pet hygiene and dental health but will post an update later in time. Is it weird I kinda like the smell of them...?

review/summary: One likes it one don't.
review/text: I got these and my female cat which weighs 8 pounds would eat the whole bag in one sitting, the male who weighs 10 likes one and walks away. Cats, go figure. I found that the male loves the Greenies though so I've got both covered. The only thing I can say is buy a pack and see if your cat will like them, no other way to know. I put in the cats weights as this crops up in other reviews. I got the exact same results with the Petrodex.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: My cat prevents us from properly brushing her teeth and dislikes most teeth cleaning toys, but she loves these chews. She plays with it for a few minutes, bats it across the room, and then chews on it to her heart's content. She considers it a treat, so it is an easy part of her day.

review/summary: Too big for a cat's mouth
review/text: As MANY reviewers have stated before me, this product seems like it should be a dog treat. They are slightly smaller than a wine cork (about the same length, but the diameter is skinnier). Considering cats chew "with their mouths open" as we would call it, putting something like this in it is just asking for a mess on your floor. I tried cutting it into FIFTHS (1/5) and it was still too big a piece for my cat. He would try, but it kept falling out of his mouth until it was just a soggy mess on the floor. When I did try to give him the whole one, he just batted it around. That's another thing... what genius made these round? As if a cat wouldn't have enough trouble eating it because of the size, now you're making him want to play with it AND when he goes to eat it, he'll end up rolling it down the floor (or rolling around the bowl) anyway.<br /><br />You can have the best ingredients ever, but if the delivery vessel is garbage, it's completely useless.

review/summary: The stench of old fish. Try the poultry one instead.
review/text: The fish C.E.T. chews smell terrible. I assumed they would but they are far worse than I expected. What's even worse is when the cats visit the litter box - O!M!G! I have to open all of the windows and doors, turn on the fan, and use air freshner. I thought one of them was sick.<br /><br />Try the poultry. Much better. Hardly smells at all.
