review/text: This was a great product and easy to use, I am now to fonadant decorating and it was tricky to learn how to get it on the cake, but after the second attempt I got it and it was amazing and it did have a nice sweet taste and was easy enough for a beginner to use. Everyone loved the cake that I made.

review/summary: Not so Fondarific
review/text: I bought this fondant because the previous buyers gave good reviews. I have worked with fondant before and I have never had trouble putting in on the cake. The fondant was not manageable. When i finally got it on top  of the cake it would start stretching from the sides. When I tried to make figurines out of it and it would just fall apart.

review/text: As stated in a previous review for this same product but in black this was my first time using fondant. This product was use for my oldest grandaughter and her friend who share a birthday. They turned 16 and planned a large party 125+ friends invited. I made two full sheet cakes using this product in black and white. I was pleased with the results, this product was easy to work with, and the price was great. Definately a worthwile purchase.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: Fondarific is by far the best tasting and easiest to work with fondant out there. Somewhat expensive unless you can find a deal on Amazon (occasionally I have gotten a pretty decent price that way). Well worth it though to not deal with the headache of dry cracking fondant that you have to be a lumberjack to roll out. The color is slightly off white but unless it is sitting next to something stark white nobody will be able to tell it isn't the wedding white, which is frequently out of stock on this site.

review/summary: Going Back to Satin Ice
review/text: I tried Fondarific because the reviews all seemed pretty good - i.e. SUPPPOSEDLY tastes good, easy to work with, doesn't dry out, etc.<br /><br />1. I use a Sweetwise mat to roll out my fondant in most cases. Fondarific stuck to the mat. We're talking disaster. Thankfully I was able to repair the bulk of the problems (and there were TONS of them)with shortening. Either way, the finish wasn't as clean as I would have liked...something that's NEVER been a problem with Satin Ice, Chocopan or my MMF.<br />2. I was expecting awesome taste, but this tasted like wax, Wilton, and Chocopan mixed together. Thankfully the slight Chocopan taste saved it taste wise, but this stuff doesn't hold a candle to Satin Ice in the taste department. My kids, who like MMF and Satin Ice, HATE - and I mean HATED - Fondarific.<br />3. I had some smaller accents to cover, so I rolled out the Fondarific in the traditional way...i.e. no mat. The stuff was sooooooo sticky and by the time I got enough powdered sugar down to keep this stuff from sticking- it was dried out to the point where it was almost useless. Sure, there was no elephant skin, but it felt more like gumpaste that had started to harden.<br />4. The texture after being rolled onto the cake was off. I always hear about people saying they don't like how fondant feels in their mouth, but my MMF and Satin Ice had changed my friends' and family members' opinions. Sadly- Fondarific even had me gagging and peeling the fondant off my slice.<br /><br />I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I will NEVER use this again. Thankfully I was able to save the cake and it still came out looking good, but it was a struggle every step of the way.

review/summary: AWESOME Flavor!
review/text: My favorite, of course, is CHOCOLATE!  All three flavors; i.e.. Chocolate, Strawberry, and Vanilla are delicious mixed either with COLD water or SKIM MILK (only 8 oz) ... I usually drink mine for breakfast which will tie you over until lunchtime! The reason it's called "CONTROL SHAKE" in the first place is because it does help to CONTROL your cravings for anything sweet and delicious; because in itself, it is sweet, delicious, and creamy!! YUM!! There are five packets in each box.  Control Shake also allows you to have a quick lunch if needed.  This product has 24 minerals and vitamins. You can also mix Control Shake in your blender with ice, which makes it really frothy ... try Control Shake, you will absolutely LOVE the taste!

review/text: This is a very good tea as far as teabags go...traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas, But this is the exception...being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas(White tea is the least processed of all teas)...teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of...these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas(the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance)... and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money...It took about six weeks to finally get delivered, but it was worth the weight...This one is a no brainer...!!!

review/summary: such a special gem, this one!
review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good tea, very gingery
review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

review/summary: The taste that stole my heart
review/text: I had never liked the taste of coffee. I thought the smell was nice, but the taste seemed far removed from that aroma. Then, I went to Italy and, being the (American) tourist that I was, I had to try every food and drink my teenaged hands could reach. In a tiny cafe in Assisi, I had my first shot of espresso. It was dark, strong, and bitter in a peculiarly pleasant way. Since then, I have been trying to recreate that taste and this is the closest I have come to it with a grad student-type budget and local equipment. Thank you!<br /><br />Now please, Zicaffe', if you would, offer this in larger quantities as you do your other espresso pods, I would greatly appreciate it.

I use garlic in 80% of my receipes.  This should last me about 2 years, I just hope the taste holds up.  I store it in airtight bag in the fridge, so it should be fine.

review/summary: Fantastic Chips
review/text: I went to the west coast and fell in love with these Limon chips!  They are the best chip I've ever tasted and addictive.  Of course  when I got back to the south, they were nowhere to be found.  Everyone needs to write Lays Co. and ask them to do another survey in the south for these chips.  It's been since 2000 and people's taste have changed since then.  I'll definitely buy a case if I can find them.

review/text: Had these chips in Yuma, AZ while on a run to Mexico.  They are wonderful.  The flavor is perfect and the best I've had of all flavored chips --  better than vinegar-flavored chips, etc.  Even the people I was with, who cringed when I bought them, ate so many I had to buy more.  Tried to find them in Phoenix grocery stores and they weren't readily available - it's a flavor tailored to the Hispanic palate, hopefully it will catch on soon.  Please Amazon, try to get these soon.

Made it into a nice fish dip for some company and it went over like a fat dude at a pie eaten contest. They loved it, so much so I only got a small taste. I fooled them though. I hid a whole package for myself. My moma raised a bunch of slow kids, I was not one of them (;. Oh my , I was so glad I did, great flavor, firm meat and did not last long even with just me and my lady friend. Its a nice and different taste treat. All I can really say is 'It taste like more ".

review/text: Maybe I was spoiled by spending so much time in Alaska, but this salmon was inedible.  It did not smell appealing when opened, and the taste was metallic and overly salted.  I wound up having to trash the whole thing.  It had not expired, and the packaging was not damaged so I have to believe it was just this particular brand.  It was a major disappointment.

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: This is a very good product for any price. People knock it a bit because of the corn but I've spoken to Eagle Pack and have found they are very open about their product. Carbohydrates are carbohydrates are carbohydrates. No cat needs them. Ever! Apparently the grains used in this product are local to Indiana and surrounding areas (Michigan, Illinois, Ohio)? That's never a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. I've also read the company is non-GMO but I haven't confirmed that information through e-mail. The point is that unless your pet is allergic to corn or rice you're wasting your time going grain free. Potatoes and peas are just as useless as corn or rice and cats would never eat any of these in the wild. So if you want a food that is locally sourced (for the most part) and don't want to pay twice as much for Orijen simply because they use peas and potatoes this is a great option.

The appearance of the product is extremely unappetizing - little black uneven lumps with sprinkling of salt on the dried mangos. In my opinion, the taste is salty, gummy and disgusting. I have eaten many dried/cured mangos before and this is the worst ever. This whole lot is going into the trash!

The lotions and bath salts, etcetera are disgustingly low quality, I would never even consider using them. The wire basket that it's all packed in is laughable unless of course you like chicken wire shaped as a sleigh, but I think it's suppose to be a tub. Absolutely the worst gift I have ever received. Funny though. Save your money.

review/text: This pasta is really delicious, as well as being considerably lower in calories than regular pasta, and having 18g fiber per serving. I agree that it is a bit blander tasting that regular pasta, but I actually like that: since it doesn't overwhelm the sauce you are using (the way whole wheat pastas tend to do), it allows the sauce to be the star of your dish. A 2-ounce portion is very satisfying. The sampler is a nice way to try it out. Mine came with 2 boxes each of penne, rotini, and linguine. Will definitely recommend it friends!

review/text: I don't eat a lot of pasta because the calories seem so "empty," but I was attracted to the huge amount of fiber in these products.  Whole wheat pasta sometimes has a slight bitter taste that this pasta does not have.  (I seldom eat white flour.) This is very tasty and passes muster just fine with picky eaters.  One caveat:  The directions for cooking time are way off.  You will have to experiment.  Doubling the time is not out of the question.

review/text: While I do like this pasta, there are a few caveats. First of all, it has to be cooked longer than regular pasta to get it to the proper stage of doneness. It will taste starchy if not cooked long enough. Also, the box of spaghetti looks like a regular 16-oz box of spaghetti, but I was disappointed to find it is only half full.  I don't like the high price, but I will continue to buy it because it is healthy and tastes great.

review/summary: Better than the original "nests" I got a few years ago, much better!
review/text: I don't know if they changed the recipe for the better of if the new shapes I tried (this one and the lasagna) simply work better, but man, these are great.<br /><br />In the earlier days of FiberGourmet, I had tried the fettucine nests (regular and two flavored types) and really, they were just okay. The fiber was nice, the firmer texture is nice (I'm an al dente fan and hate mushy pasta), but it had a sort of grittiness and blandness that was only tolerable under lots of sauce and cheese.<br /><br />But since I have been trying to increase my hubby's fiber intake (and I prefer high-fiber pasta for myself), I decided a couple months ago to try a few new things from FG: the cheese crackers, the rotini, the lasagna.<br /><br />I tried the lasagna first and it came out terrific. I needed a box and a half for my normal lasagna size, but the texture was beautiful and held up under microwaving as leftovers.<br /><br />The cheese crackers will be a staple for me. Amazing crunch and very like Cheez-Its (a bit more tangy or bitter, but with a better crunch and superb fiber count).<br /><br />The rotini is one I need to reorder, as I've gone through the 6 boxes already. It has paired beautifully with marinara and with lite alfredo sauce, and it was excellent in an improvised supper of the rotini with artichoke hearts, garlic, EVOO, spinach, and parmesan.<br /><br />The spaghetti stays very firm, which takes a tad bit of getting used to for me, but hubby liked the texture. Went just fine with marinara and meatballs and even better for me as leftover, as it didn't get mushy at all and had nice "tooth feel". I made it with oil and garlic and hot pepper flakes it was delish. I also had it with vegan sloppy joe (textured soy) , cheddar, and tomato bits and it was very good.<br /><br />I do find I get quite a bit of gas when I have a generous serving, so I only eat it when I know I don't have to be out and about. :)  But that's a minor issue for me, as the high fiber and excellent firm texture and improved (imo) flavor from the original pasta they had.<br /><br />The price is a bit mad. One package of the spaghetti, for instance, is very slight. Only half pound (for those used to full pound spaghetti boxes). So, I used both boxes so I'd have leftovers for a couple days for me and hubby. Somehow, I don't understand why the equivalent size to a standard spaghetti box has to be like five to six times as much (since I can get a box of spaghetti of decent to good quality locally for a buck to a bit more). These, at this amazon price of 18 bucks for six samplers, means each box averages 3 bucks. Two boxes of spaghetti to make one pound--6 or more bucks for that quantity. Nuts. It's PASTA! They're adding fiber, not truffle oil!<br /><br />A thumbs up. It may not suit a true pasta gourmet, but it makes me very happy...except for the price. But, well, even Dreamfields (my previous higher fiber pasta, which I'll still buy from time to time) isn't cheap compared to the regular pastas<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/text: These pastas are incredible! They don't taste yucky like so many of the wheat pastas. They are white not brown. My husband (who will not eat anything "diet") loves them.  I have used in many recipes. The high fiber brings the points way down and fills you up fast.

review/text: I love pasta, but it does not love me.  I just don't seem to be able to digest it.  But this pasta, not only tastes great, it is so easy to digest.  And, as an added bonus, it is healthy & low in calories.  I have now tried every version of this pasta & they are all amazing.  Some reviewers complained that the pasta is too firm, but that is not the case.  You simply need to cook it a bit longer than regular pasta & then it is light as a feather. Because of how wonderful it tastes & because it is so light, you would think that you were eating homemade pasta.  Almost hard to beleive that this stuff comes out of a box! :-)

review/text: I had tried the speghetti and it was AWESOME!!! I tried the pasta boxes and they taste normal, you can not tell them apart from the normal noodles you get in the store. I tried the mac/cheese box, the noodles were ok but I am not a fan of the cheese seasoning they give you. I understand they are trying to keep down the calories. I would prefer to buy the noodles and make my own cheese sauce for my mac/cheese in the future. Overall, the pasta is really great.

I won't be getting the variety pack with the mac and cheese again. It was so bad that I rinsed it off and just ate the elbows with pasta sauce. Other than that, everything was great! I will definitely be getting the rotini and penne again.

review/text: My daughter and I have been eating lighter for the last year and this product is perfect for us!!  We've both lost a lot of weight, but sometimes missed having a larger portion of pasta with our meals. Fiber Gourmet is so much like regular pasta we can't tell the difference and now we can have a decent serving.  We tried the mac and cheese and while it certainly isn't as cheesy as other products, it is good. My son-in-law actually didn't notice it wasn't Kraft when I added a package of laughing cow at the end since it strengthened the flavor very nicely. I've served this pasta in a baked ziti for company and they never knew it wasn't the real deal at less than half the calories!  I just wish they'd get the spaghetti style in!!

review/summary: Great Pasta Option
review/text: I am a huge pasta lover, but I've never been a fan of the nutritional stats of regular pastas. They have been getting better with more whole grain/wheat options, however this is by far the best pasta I have found. It did cook up firmer than regular pasta, which is actually something I like about it, and it held it's shape much better when used in soup than regular pasta has for me.<br /><br />The biggest difference I noticed with this pasta was that it was a little more bland tasting than normal pasta, but that really didn't bother me. I found the texture nice, not grainy or chewy at all.<br /><br />I did have to order this online, as it isn't sold anywhere near where I live. I ordered it straight from the Fiber Gourmet website. It shipped quickly, arrived on time and intact. It was more expensive than store bought pasta, I felt the price was fair for the benefits of this pasta.

review/summary: Super tasty, perfect size
review/text: This popcorn is just the right amount of sweet: not so overpowering that it tastes like candy, but you can definitely tell that it's kettle corn!<br /><br />The portion size is also perfect for one person. I consider myself a relatively big eater, but by the time I'm done with one bag I'm pretty satisfied (mostly because it takes so much time to get through one).<br /><br />I also like the nutrition breakdown of this popcorn: lots of fiber (4g), a solid amount of protein (3g), and no sugar. Sure, it has ~4g of fat, but overall it's almost a perfect ratio of fat to carbs to protein, with the added benefit of the fiber and lack of sugar. What a great snack! I can't think of any other food item that is only 100 calories, tastes this good, has even a marginally good nutrient breakdown, and tides you over for an hour or more.

review/text: I have tried the other 100 cal kettle corns and none of them are near as good. Unfortunately, I have only tried the other ones cause I suspect this one has been discontinued (It was getting hard to find in my local stores and my roommate bought me some off Amazon, and he bought a lot of them actually but once that supply runs out :( ). Jolly time came a far second and Orville.. blech.<br /><br />Anyways, it is a shame if it has been discontinued because honestly, it was the best. In fact, I've noticed in general Pop Secret does the best microwave popcorn (I also wish they still had the regular kettle corn in single packs... that stuff was really good but usually I'm watching my weight so I tend to stick to the 100 calorie stuff).

I like the flavor, although I don't think it tastes a lot like kettle corn. I prefer it over an artificial "butter" flavor. I like that it is dry and not greasy. Taste is a personal matter, of course. You'd have to try it to see if you like it. I listened to the popping a few times and now I know exactly what time to set on my microwave. I tried that same time at work, and, goodness, that was a burnt offering! But I know now what time works on that microwave. You know how packages always say "applicances vary, adjust the time accordingly"? Well, yeah, they are right! I am glad to have a source for this product now.

I have a very expensive Jenn Air microwave with a POPCORN sensor on it. The first bag I tried, after about 30 seconds the microwave started moaning and buzzing really loud. I went over to take a look, and it was like a light show going on inside. I quickly opened the door, and could feel the pressure from inside push the door open! I figured maybe it was just that particular bag, so I tried another. SAME THING HAPPENED. If my microwave breaks anytime in the near future I would bet that this popcorn incident is to blame. DO NOT BUY-SERIOUS SAFETY RISK. I am calling Diamond Foods to complain. It's a good thing my kids were not making this popcorn on their own!

review/text: I've tried these cans of Roland Tropical Mixed Fruits twice and both cases were not very good tasting.  I was hoping the first batch was an anomaly.  I found the convenience of them to be great but obviously the fruits were not truly ripe when they were canned.  I'd say it was 50/50.....1/2 ripe and 1/2 upripe fruits.  My family ate them but a truly ripe papaya, pineapple, or mango would have made this easy dessert way more desirable.  I won't be buying these again even though getting a variety of tropical fruits in one can is a great idea.
