review/summary: Catstronomical !
review/text: After feeding our 3 outdoor cats "whatever is cheapest or on-sale cat food" for a year, we noticed horrible skin problems on two of them.<br />There was also too much puffy orange cat vomit to clean up.<br />I began researching animal food in general and ended up with this product as an affordable, happy medium.<br />Within a month of this diet, their skin problems went away and their coats have a beautiful luster again.<br />Not one incidence of vomit has been seen with this food.<br />They eat less of this food because it is nutritionally dense with no by-products or corn meal.<br />My cats experienced a noticeable turn-around of health since beginning this diet.<br />I am glad to find it as a Subscribe & Save item.<br /><br />{{* *}}

review/summary: Cats LOVE this Dry Food. Best Commercial Product List I've Found in Reasonably Priced Commercial Pet Food.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
review/text: I have 4 indoor cats ranging from pre-teen to senior. We previously fed them Iams Multi-Cat dry food which we purchased in 20lb bags at our local warehouse store. About 4 months ago, the warehouse store discontinued stocking Iams cat food, so I went looking for another, better quality dry cat food that was reasonably priced (my preference was to make my own cat food, but the reality is that I don't have time to do so).<br /><br />I stumbled on Castor & Pollux on Amazon & decided to give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBTQ">Castor & PolluxUltramix Feline Fomula Dry, Adult, 15 Pound Bag</a> (blue bag) a try. We went through 27lbs of the blue bag and then switched to this indoor version (green bag).  Now that we've gone through about 20lbs of the green bag, we are quite pleased with the Castor & Pollux cat food and it is now our cat food of choice.<br /><br />The one thing not listed on the website is the ingredient list, and I wanted to know this information before I purchased, so here is a full list of ingredients straight from the back of the green bag (note the ingredients are slightly different than the blue bag):<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Ground Whole Grain Barley, Cellulose, Brewers Rice, Rice Protein Concentrate, Ground Flaxseed, Chicken Fat preserved with Mixed Tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), Natural Chicken Flavor, Cultured Whey, Dried Beet Pulp, Salmon Meal, Sodium Bisulfate, Dried Carrots, Dried Bananas, Dried Apples, Potassium Chloride, Salt, Dried Blueberries, Dried Papaya, Choline Chloride, Taurine, DL-Methionine, L-Carnitine, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Copper Sulfate, Niacin, Vitamin A Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganous Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Pyridoxine Hydroxcholoride (source of Vitamin B6), Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin K1 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Cobalt Caronate, Yeast Culture (Saccharomyes Cerevisiae), Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophuilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longbrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract and Fermentation Solubles.<br /><br />My senior cats had a hard transition from the Iams to the blue bag and we ended up cleaning up a lot of carrot-filled cat vomit for the first 2 weeks. The younger cats transitioned with no issues whatsoever. Now that we have gone to the green bag, we are not experiencing the daily upchucking (whether this is because they are already accustomed to the food or not, I don't know, but would assume that it plays a part).<br /><br />All of our cats love the food (both versions), and run to their food bowls when they hear us fill them up.  They seem to eat a little less of the Castor & Pollux, so maybe they are getting more quality with each bite. Iams uses by-product and Cator & Pollux uses meal, so I assume this may be the case.<br /><br />While I can't pronounce many of the ingredients on the cat food bag list, I did research on the protein ingredients (by-product vs meal) & found the following information from various websites:<br /><br />Protein, in the form of quality meat ingredients, is the most important component of a pet's diet. As animals with a carnivorous background, their digestive tract is designed to utilize primarily meat and fat. It is also the most expensive ingredient for a manufacturer to buy and the profit margin on a product is drastically affected by the amount and quality used. Ideally, the first ingredient of a food should be either a specified meat meal, or a specified fresh meat type followed by a meal.<br /><br />Meat sources in "meal" form (as long as they are from a specified type of animal, such as chicken meal, lamb meal, salmon meal etc.) are not inferior to whole, fresh meats. "Meal" consists of meat and skin, with or without the bones, but exclusive of feathers/hair, heads, feet, horns, entrails etc. and have the proper calcium/phosphorus ratio required for a balanced diet. They have had most of the moisture removed, but remember that meats in their original, "wet" form still contain up to 75% water.<br /><br />Byproducts of any type are less desirable and only acceptable if they do not make up the main source of animal protein and if the name of the species used is also defined in some manner (e.g. "chicken byproducts" or "beef byproducts" but not "meat byproducts" or "poultry byproducts"). Byproducts consist of anything but the quality cuts of meat.<br /><br />This is a reasonably priced dry food with a good list of ingredients as compared to other commercial foods. Castor & Pollux claims that they fully & unconditionally guarantee their food, so if you order & don't like it, you can call them.  Additionally, Castor & Pollux has a Pet & Soul Foundation that supports various pet organizations & charities, so our purchases go to help needy animals. Look on their website & do the daily free kibble game to donate free kibble to pet shelters.<br /><br />All in all, I think that I could probably come up with a better homemade cat food, but, given time constraints and solid know-how, I think that this Caster & Pollux dry food is a good choice. My cats, all indoors, love the food, their fur is shiny & their skin appears to be healthy. We do not have dander issues & all the cats seem to be feisty & healthy.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

review/text: One of my cats has food allergies and I was having to buy bags of food from the vet for exorbitant prices.

review/text: My cats just Love this Cat Food and I have 3 of them to test it out.  I've bought this several times now in this size and also the smaller size.  This 15# is just a tad more reasonable.  My cats have no problem eating this all up and I know it's good for them too.  Their coats are much more shinier and they seem to have less hair loss.  All around I think it's a Great Product and I will be back for more whenever I see that it's on Sale.

review/text: I decided to try this cat food when I ran out of my old stuff.  My cats, prior to eating this cat food, seemed to always be throwing up on the other stuff so a food change was a must.  Since they have been on this cat food, they no longer throw up like they used to.  I like the fact that its natural too so I know my kitties aren't eating things they shouldn't be.

review/summary: The ONLY dry cat food my cat will eat!!
review/text: When Petco and Petsmart quit carrying this product in their stores almost a year ago, I went to another brand that was recommended to me as a good replacement.  I tried it, and my cat usually eats pretty much any cat food I give him--and at first he did the new one.  About 3 months into the new diet, he stopped eating completely for a week. I was frantic, and was trying to figure out anything to make him eat!  After many approaches, I looked online through Amazon for his original Ultramix and found it!! I ordered his dry food and along with that ordered the wet food too.  As soon as it came, I threw out everything else, and he chowed down like he hadn't in a long, long time!  I now order his food online and give him about half dry and half wet, depending upon his mood.  But as long as I can find this online, he's good.  His mood, skin, hair, and appetite have greatly improved and have stayed that way.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!

review/summary: The Gang Loves It!
review/text: I have three large indoor Maine Coons--so I will leave it to you to imagine the issues I have with hairballs and cat yak in general.  This was recommended at my small local pet food store so I tried it even though it was very expensive, I'm embarrassed to say how expensive.  First I mixed it with Blue Buffalo Indoor Health (which they also like) but my cats will not eat the Blue Buffalo "life source bits" for any reason.  The hairball and cat yak problem did get substantially better, strangely they also seemed to have fewer issues with matting.  One day I was too lazy to do the mix and just fed the Castor and Pollux Ultramix till the bag was finished.  They really enjoyed it, and while they do tend to pick around the bits in this one too, they don't do it nearly as much.  They seemed slightly "happier" meaning slightly more energetic, interested, playful and silly. However, if I'm honest I think I might have seen an increase in hairballs and general yak, but this was still much improved. Now I am feeding just the Blue Buffalo Indoor health till that bag is finished, and we'll see if there is a difference.  I will update if there are any bombshells to report.<br /><br />All in all, my inclination is to stay with Ultramix--they love it, they seem "happier", and the hairball/cat yak problem is still much better than with any other food I've tried alone--and I have tried many many foods of every price point including those that advertise hairball control.  Don't get me wrong, Blue Buffalo is better than most I have tried too, but Ultramix claims the edge so far.<br /><br />As for price; while I always prefer to support local small businesses this is one of those cases where the price point is so different that I have to go with an online purveyor.  I am fine with a 10% even 15% difference to support the locals, but in this case it's well over 33%.  I suspect this is because Castor and Pollux is not a household name so stocking it is expensive--still...

The price is very reasonable for this high quality food.  I have turned friends onto the Amazon pet food ordering experience.<br /><br />Come to think of it, my only complaint about ordering this brand of food from Amazon is that there is a demand for it and many times Amazon will note that my order won't be shipped for an entire month and then it ships the next day. So I caution you to not take their shipping dates too seriously.  Once the food is shipped I typically receive it on my front porch the following day.

review/text: My large dude-cat Larry loves to eat. When he gained a bit of weight I put him on Natural Balance low cal food and his fur began to fall out. It was dry and patchy. Well, one 15 pound bag of this stuff later he has slimmed down nicely, and he has the best coat he has ever had. He looks and feels great. He also loves this food. It's a win-win all round, and well worth the price -- much cheaper than visits to the vet for any weight / skin related illnesses. We are very happy customers, and with Amazon prime, its delivered to your door with free shipping. (To the mailman's amusement.)

review/summary: Works for my cats!
review/text: Part of the reason I tried this is the availability via Amazon's Subscribe & Save program.<br />Being able to combine serious quality feline food with the convenience of having it show up on my doorstep is something of a no-brainer for me. The fact that having it delivered means I'm visiting those pet emporiums less and therefore getting all wanty over the cats up for adoption probably is a good thing for me.<br />As for the food itself, my crew has responded rather favorably to it. We had a little extra vomiting initially as they adjusted, but I've had that happen with almost anything drastically new I tried.<br />I think this food has helped my oldest two the most. One had been getting increasingly sedentary and I suspected she was having joint pain. Now she's back to jumping up on furniture and being much more interactive with us. Her coat looks good too. She's actually at her best ever.<br />My other old girl had been having the occasional seizure this past year. These have decreased in frequency. She already had a good coat but damned if it doesn't look even more luscious. You'd never believe she's a mature cat.<br />My other two don't have issues that this food addresses, but I want my healthy ones living long and healthy lives. I wish I could say my big boy cat was a little less big, but I know that's not the purpose of this food. And I know in his case, no matter what his diet is, he's gonna stench up that litter box.<br /><br />I'm glad I tried this food for them. Very worthwhile.

review/summary: Drastically reduces vomiting
review/text: My cats like this food, but they don't seem to love it they way they do the cheaper stuff that I occasionally have to buy from the grocery store when I run out. The older one clearly prefers the C&P Organix chicken flavor when she has a choice, but I'm sticking with this one as the younger cat prefers it and she's the one with the sensitive stomach. FWIW, the younger one is also a VERY finicky eater; she'll eat canned tuna, but she won't touch human food (not even milk!) or canned cat food, and she's very particular about which dry foods she'll eat. She adores Purina Cat Chow Indoor Formula, but she vomits 2 out of 3 times that she eats it.<br /><br />Neither one of them eats all the little bits of fruits & veggies; most of those get left at the bottom of the bowl. I used to feed them Pet Promise, but they seemed to get tired of it. Ditto for Nutro Natural Choice. I suppose when they get bored with this I'll just rotate back to one of the others. If anyone knows of any other good foods for cats with sensitive stomachs, please feel free to comment and let me know.

review/summary: My old gal can't eat it
review/text: I'm sure this is a good quality food, but the kibble is too large and dense for a 14-yr-old Tortie who has lost most of her teeth.  It's too dense and didn't soften well when I added water, so when she tried to eat it, she would have to swallow it whole, resulting in more episodes of vomiting.<br /><br />After only a few tries, I gave the whole bag to a friend, and she said it made her male cat vomit.  I think the kibble is too hard and too large for older cats.<br /><br />I've switched my kitty to "Life's Abundance" and she's thriving.

review/summary: not for my cat
review/text: I wish I could give the same review as previous reviewers, but my cat refuses to eat this food, which is strange because she eats just about anything. I was also disappointed by the way Amazon packed this products. When I received the box, the bag with the food was opened and about half of it was spilled inside the box where I also had books. Maybe that's why my cat won't eat it?

review/text: My cat won't touch it at all, which is a pity, since its ingredients look healthy. She usually loves new food.  So when she resisted the food so much, I thought she was ill and took her to the vet, had a x-ray taken to check if she'd swallowed some things that got stuck.  She turned out to be fine. I then tried Iams, which she loves right away.<br /><br />Castor & Pollux doesn't respond to my inquiry.  ZERO customer service!

review/text: I contacted the seller regarding the best type the raw or liquid type for baking and they recommended the raw type.  I was disappointed with the results. Since then, I tried this in iced tea and again, was disappointed.  I had to continually stir the contents of a large pitcher because the honey sunk to the bottom.  The taste of the honey never diminished, but it was a pain in the neck to do the stirring every time I wanted a glass of iced tea.  Next time I will buy the regular honey.

I was going to make pecans pies with these and am now stuck with a 30 pound box of pulverized pecans. In the heading it says mealy pecans and is followed by the word chopped. They are way past chopped. They also arrived in bulk which again the picture was deceiving as it shows the pecans neatly in bags. I am so disappointed in my purchase.

review/text: I purchased this product for 2 little girls... So I bought 2 boxes... When I should have bought only one, because it has multiple mug sheets in each one. Then I found out that the actual mug costs an additional $10 after I'd already paid $10 for the original box of papers and an order form, it seemed silly.  I know that these are cool mugs, but to cost over $20 for one is a little ridiculous.  The girls whom this was intended for still haven't come up with a design... I wish it had more examples of successful creations or ideas on what works best.  Who knows if there will ever be a final mug for each girl.

review/text: The low sodium doesn't bother my tastebuds at all, and I'm a semi-salt addict, but the broth of the soup has a 'beany' flavor that becomes more unnerving with each can.  On the plus side this Minestrone is heartier than other Minestrones I have tried:  I have just have to mix it with other soups to lessen the 'beany' taste.  3.75 Stars.

review/summary: One of my wife's favorite flavors!
review/text: If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />This flavor is good for baking low calorie muffins or cakes. We also blend 8 ounces of skim milk, a vanilla protein diet mix (About 160 calories), one tablespoon of egg nog mix (No more because of the sugar), two tablespoons of instant sugar free vanilla pudding, 6 ounces of crushed ice, a tablespoon of Da Vinci egg nog syrup for a great tasting egg nog shake. (Blend well)  Makes a nice low calorie lunch!<br /><br />It jazzes up the flavor without adding calories or a lot of salt. It only contains 5 mg of salt. I have attached a photo of the label for your review. You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />While this is a 5 star product I disagree with someone charging almost $10 to ship a product that costs $6.49.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!

review/text: I buy a lot of sugar free items, syrups included.  This one is "fine."  I do love real eggnog, but I don't find myself using this syrup too often.  I think it's hard to replicate some things, and a good creamy eggnog translated to a single syrup is probably hard to pull-off.  That being said, I am glad I bought this, as I'd much prefer this over a 300 calorie eggnog when the craving hits!

review/summary: Oil is comparable to others - seller is lacking
review/text: I have used Lavender Essential Oil for years and loved the idea that these were food grade.  I ordered 7 different oils about a month ago - at the time of this purchase - but have only received 5.<br /><br />First the oils: They are mostly comparable to other brands but seem a thinner and do not seem to last as long as others - I expect that is due to the food grade. The bottles do not come with droppers - this makes it difficult to use as everything with essential oils is based on drops.  Depending on how often I actually use in food - I may or may not purchase this brand of lavender again.  The price is good but if I have to buy my own dropper tops it outweighs the better price.<br /><br />The company - faerie's finest - I was okay with the delay I was informed of on two of the oils in this purchase; however, when I recently emailed them to find out when those two oils would arrive I was informed that they were supposedly mailed before the date I was told there would be a delay.  When the issue is resolved - I will update this review.  In the interim, I will not recommend the seller nor will I buy from them again.  Which is unfortunate as they have nice selection of essential oils.

review/text: Hi,<br /> Online it says 100% pure lavender oil.  I use lavender oil religously and this does not smell like other pure lavender oils I've recieved in the past. The smell is faint and it is a little more 'perfume' smelling. I did notice on the bottle it says a 100% natural oil not a 100% pure lavender oil.  Online it states that it is a 100% pure lavender oil.  I wrote them and they wrote, "Thanks. We are sorry to hear that. Your can return for refund. But this is 100% Pure lavender oil, no mixed, no chemical.".. Too return it you would have to pay shipping back plus you are out the shipping you paid to recieve it too.  All in all if you are looking for a strong lavender smell this is not it. There responce was fast so I will give them the benifit of dout, so giving 3 stars for an okay rating. Thanks

review/text: I ordered this oil from "Enchanted Wilderness...Catey13" and am not sorry that I did!  I absolutely love lavender and when I finally recieved this oil, it smelled just as I imagined or better!  The concentration is strong and just a few drops go a really long way.  I've already used it in bath salts, a body scrub, a face moisturizer, linen spray and glycerin water and the bottle is still almost completely full.  Seems like this amount could last me for years!  I use the linen spray on my bed and it really makes the whole room smell wonderful and the bed seems "fresher" for a longer time between weekly washings.  The price was very reasonable and I even received a surprise sample of some rose geranium oil and some recipes and suggested uses with my order.  Also, the bottle does not have a dropper top, but there was a pipette included which works just fine.  Looking forward to trying it in lavender shortbread cookies next.  Would definitely order this again!

review/summary: A wonderful liquorice
review/text: I bought this yesterday at Target for I believe $2.50 for one bag. I've never seen a mango flavored liquorice before. I like it. It is a little bit harder than another Australian liquorice I bought at Target before that may have been made by the same company. That's why I'm giving 4 stars. It is a lot of liquorice for the price and imported at well. The fact that it is imported was another reason I bought it. A bag could easily be shared among two people. Flavor is light but true like eating real mango. The flavor also sticks around for a little while after you've swallowed. The total fat is 1g. The sugar is 16g. Quite a delicious and cheap snack/candy!

review/text: I used to love Twizzler's licorice. Then I tried this soft liquorice from Australia. Wow, what a difference. The flavor is amazingly zestful. The liquorice is soft and chewy (unlike Twizzler's, which sometimes you have to pull apart to eat). Mango is also a great idea for a flavor - sweet, but different from the usual flavors. Looking back, I can hardly believe how I lived without these in my life. I know these things have sugar and might not be great for my health, but what the heck - it's worth the price!

review/summary: My Darrell Lea Favorite!
review/text: I have tried most of the Darrell Lea line and this one is my favorite.  I have never cared for black liquorice, so I was very excited when I found out that Darrell Lea came in a range of flavors.  It's a soft, chewy piece of solid liquorice.  I found that it wasn't overly sweet for me, but it might be for others. Has a true mango flavor!

review/text: I'm not diabetic or anything, I just saw this cake mix in the store and thought 'hey, I'd love a piece of cake with fewer calories' so I bought it and gave it a shot.  It has great flavor and a rich dense texture that almost reminds me of a custard or sort of german pancake.  It might be too dense for cupcakes but I bet adding another egg would help it rise more.  If you want to make a layer cake I would recommend getting two mixes.  I will definitely buy this product again!

review/text: The name sanbitter (san pellegrino bitter) tells all. This is a typical italian "aperitivo". A drink that should be drink in small size before having dinner(with snacks like penuts, small crackers, etc.). The bitterness (and believe me is bitter) is suppose to stimulate your appetite. My wife that is born in the US hate it, as it Italian I love it...so I guess it requires to have roots in Italy. Rated 5 as Italian, someone in US will be probably rate this 1.

review/summary: It's not bad if you know what to expect
review/text: This is a decent aperitif soda with a taste reminiscent of grapefruit and lemon (somewhat similar to a strong IPA), with a small addition of sour cherry.  It is an aperitif soda- drink it before a meal and it will help to 'wake-up' your tastes; I can also imagine it as a good digestif after a heavy meal.  This will not be everyone's favorite drink but, then again, it was never meant to be consumed quickly or in a large quantity. Drink it with a meal and enjoy it as a part of that meal, not as a beverage on its own (unless you enjoy it).<br /><br />This would also make a good mid-afternoon soda replacement for us folks who might really want a sweet carbonated beverage without artificial sweeteners.

review/summary: Fabulous non-alcoholic cocktail offering
review/text: I was thrilled to find this on Amazon, having purchased it from Cost Plus before (who no longer carry it). I would agree that drinking this straight is probably not to most people's liking. It tastes like campari-flavored soda. However, if you like negronis, this, combined with orange juice in a highball glass over ice, tastes like a negroni without the alcohol. It also looks beautiful if you serve it without stirring, allowing the orange to merge into the red, and garnish with a swizzle stick and an orange slice. The bottles are very small and have cool graphics, too. Save them to use as individual flower vases at an outdoor party.

I like it over ice, with an orange slice for garnish. People who find it too bitter might enjoy it mixed half and half with orange juice. San Pellegrino also makes a somewhat less bitter soda called Chinotto, which I occasionally try with meals.

review/text: Bitters isn't soda pop, so if you're looking for something super-sweet and familiar, just get some soda. : )<br /><br />As someone who doesn't drink alcohol (but used to), I miss certain more interesting flavors. So one ex-gf of mine turned me onto this as a substitute for Campari in "mocktail" mixed drinks.<br /><br />Now I'm using it as a bitters substitute in more complex tiki cocktail recipes, along with ginger beer (which is hot, spicy and also alcohol free).<br /><br />Oh and if anyone out there wants a non-alcoholic substitute for Guinness, try Malta Huey.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great sipping beverage, as someone mentioned. Different and complex. Enjoy.<br /><br />p.s. I'm an American. So no, you don't have to be Italian or European to enjoy this.<br /><br />p.p.s. If you like this, but would like something a little LESS (though still interesting and) bitter, try Chinotto.

review/summary: Quite Possibly The Worst Drink I'ver Ever Had
review/text: I'm still having shivers of revulsions from my two sips of Sanbitter. What a pretty little bottle. Looks can be deceiving! Let me clarify that I like bitter flavors- I love radicchio in my salad, drink goldenseal tea, and love Angostora bitters on a sugar cube for a pick-me-up. Therefore, when I spotted Sanbitter at an Italian grocer I had to try it. I think this is what I sputtered out after the first sip: "Dear God, that is the worst tasting thing I've ever had" and "I never thought I'd taste that cherry fluoride the dental students painted on my teeth again." Enough said. I foolishly tried another sip to clarify my perceptions. They were confirmed. For those who love this, all the more power to you. I will not be partaking again.

review/text: If we had a 'I'm A Fan' button to push, I would definitely be a fan of Tully's K-cups.<br /><br />Usually I drink lots of Tully's French and/or Kona, and Italian is a new favorite that I know I'll be drinking now that I've tried it.<br /><br />When I think of Tully's Coffee House Blend, I think of going into a restaurant and smelling that wonderful aroma of freshly-made coffee. It tastes delicious!<br /><br />At first I didn't think of it as one of my all-time favorites, because it's just an excellent cup of coffee. Good flavor and aroma, not too dark, not too strong, not too bitter, just delicious. I just came back to edit this review and say that it is becoming one of my all-time favorites, just another great option from Tully's.<br /><br />I used to say that I like to keep it around to drink after I've burned out my taste buds on stronger blends and want to calm my taste buds down a little. Now I've found that I enjoy it pretty much any time.<br /><br />One thing I would say about Coffee House Blend is that it will probably please more people in a household or guests visiting than my all-time favorites, which are way too strong for many people. This is a good choice to please more people. It should please just about everyone!<br /><br />EDITED once more. I came back later to say that with all of my other K-Cup options available to me, I keep reaching for the Tully's House Blend. I don't know if it's just a mood I'm in right now or what, but the others just seem like they are trying too hard. Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying House Blend.<br /><br />EDITED still once more to say now my favorites are House and Italian, both Tully's. It's the best!

review/summary: Ludicrous Price for Amazon
review/text: The price for these k-cups on Amazon is ludicrous.  They are actually cheaper in a department store paying sales tax.

review/summary: Tully's Coffee is my favorite!
review/text: I have tried many different k-cups and Tully's is my favorite. I like the taste because it is a little sweet and doesn't have much acid. It's perfect for that first cup of coffee, as well as at any time during the day or night. Really good coffee.

review/summary: Solid Gourmet Cup of Coffee
review/text: Its just dark enough for my tastes to be brewed on the 7.25oz setting. It has a dark chocolate and brandy aroma. The house blend has a boldness falling in between a medium brew (gloria jeans hazlenut) and a lighter bold brew (newmans organic). The taste is pleasant and has notes of cocoa and malt, and an aftertaste of walnuts. I would recommend this as a keep around the house brew, but not for something to impress guests.

review/summary: Less expensive alternative to the Kona Blend
review/text: I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!<br /><br />I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend. I had more than 4 cups of coffee before I noticed on the packaging that it said House Blend instead of Kona Blend. I would not have known that it was not the Kona Blend had I not seen the packaging. One caveat: I make "lattes" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.  Someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />My bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the Kona Blend, due to vendor and shipping costs, and it is more than good enough for me.  I've since ordered another box.

review/summary: Starbucks is great, but Tully's is THE BEST!
review/text: Here in Seattle you can't turn around without bumping into a great coffee kiosk, but there is nothing like being able to enjoy a terrific cup of coffee first thing in the morning while still shlepping around in my slippers at home.  As a new Keurig owner, I taste-tested a variety of brands (since it was so easy to do) but my local favorite, Tully's, came out on top.  If smooth, rich, full-bodied coffee can be called comfort food, Tully's has it nailed.  Happily, Amazon shipments arrive promptly.  Yes, K-cup packs are pricey, but life is short.  Drink good coffee!

review/summary: Tully's House Blend K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)
review/text: I received the Tully's house blend K-cups on time. I love the flavor of the coffee. I use the Keurig coffee machine when I only want one cup of coffee. I will reorder when I'm out of the coffee.

review/summary: wonderful rich taste
review/text: I like a strong rich coffee in the morning to wake me up. Tully's fits the bill. I have tried some of the others but they are either too dark or too weak. Ordering from Amazon is just TOO convenient--It comes right to your door. Try it you'll like it!!
