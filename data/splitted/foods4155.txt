review/summary: Nice Fresh Coconut Taste. Loaded With Potassium.
review/text: I just recently visited my nearby Fresh and Easy Market and saw that they had added Hansen's Natural Coconut Water (in 11.2-ounce containers) to the available beverages. Well, I like coconut water and just had  to try it. Good. Very good. It's 100% coconut water from concentrate. Nothing else. And it has a nice fresh coconut taste. Loaded with potassium too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Hey, it tastes like...
review/text: People, coconut water is no fad. I've tried many drinks to rehydrate, e.g. Gatorade,various sports drinks, Pedialyte, and nothing was helping me. I would have a few beers and I'd wake up so dehydrated. I could drink all the water in the world and it wouldn't help. Once I discovered coconut water, it helped me sleep through the night. If you're a drinker, drink a coconut water in conjunction with your poison. It will help you. Trust me.<br /><br />Out of all the coocnut waters, this one absolutely tastes the best. Why? Because it actually tastes like coconut. Zico is great, but it doesn't taste like coconut. Haven't really looked any deeper than the taste, but Hansen's definitely holds the title of best tasting coconut water.

I usually pick mine up at Kroger and I've never had a problem with the quality. Once I tried another brand because it a little bit cheaper, but I didn't like it at all. Dofino cheese's in my opinion are the best gourmet cheeses on the market.

review/text: I'm a repeat buyer of this couscous. Very easy to prepare. Just equal parts couscous and boiling water in a bowl, cover and in five minutes it's ready to fluff and serve without dirtying a pot. Great when you've forgotten to prepare a grain to go along with the meal. And if anyone's worried Whole Wheat is going to have too strong a flavor, don't worry. It has a very light taste that pairs well even with delicate flavors like fish.

review/summary: Not a serissa
review/text: All I wanted was a serissa starter bonsai, but instead I got a cutting of some kind of landscaping shrub.  I decided to keep it and try to grow it, since it was so cheap.  I figured trying to return it would be too much of a hassle, plus I didn't want to spend anymore money on this sorry order.  The poor little shrub is dying now, as I suspect it was expecting to get ready for the winter, and wasn't meant to be grown indoors like a tropical serissa bonsai.  I'm not sure why this vendor tried to pass this shrub on to me as a serissa, as I had written them about the order and explained that I'm an avid bonsai grower, and I've been growing serissa bonsai for over 10 years now.

It has a paste like consistency, does not have strong smell (maybe that is the problem).  I try very hard to feed them grain free, better quality foods.

review/summary: Unahppy with changes in Felidae canned food
review/text: Order Placed:<br />August 9, 2011 pakcof 12 cans, 5,5 ounces<br /><br /> I have purchased this cat food several times in the past and my cats loved it. However, the last shipment on August 9 disappointed me, and my cats. The  design of the can has changed but that does not bother me. I AM VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE FOOD ITSELF. It is now almost liquid and does not really fill up the can, while it used to be solid-firm all the way up to the lid, like a good pate' cat food should be. My cats do not even like it anymore.<br />I would like to know if other buyers have noticed the difference or if by chance I received a shipment that is under par. I certainly will not buy it any more and will no longer recommend it to anyone. I would like for Amazon to forward my comment to Felidae. Why did they change the formula and make it worse? Changes like this damage a firm's good name in general.<br />Best regards, Vera Mottino

review/summary: Great nutrition that kittens love!
review/text: Even after being a vegetarian for over a decade now, this food actually smelled and looked pretty good -- especially considering that it's canned cat food.  Unfortunately, I think my kittens may be eating better than I am now.<br /><br />I'm no scientician, but from what I've read (Franny Syufy of [...] offers some great cat info) this food is very well suited for cats of all ages, but especially for growing kittens.  With high quality protein (very important for development) almost wholly from salmon and not byproducts and without grain fillers I was only hoping my 3 young kittens would enjoy it.  I feed them their canned dinner at the same time every evening, and after making a smooth transition from Fancy Feast (handy in a pinch, at least) earlier this week, they let me know in chorus when it was time for their Felidae last night!  After discovering how much they like it, I will be ordering the larger cans and using a lid for storage to save some money from now on.

As in she ate my zucchini plant and she even refused to eat this food.<br /><br />I do not recommend this for cat food. Now I have a case and not sure what I will do with the rest of the cans. May be donate it to the humane society not sure.

review/text: I am pretty sure if my kittens had free reign over how much and when they ate, they would eat an entire can of this stuff in one sitting. My favorite thing about the Felidae Salmon is that it smells like salmon and you can see whole peas right in the food. I realize that sounds dumb, but when the first ingredient on most other mass-produced cat food labels is "meat by product" this makes me very happy (the first ingredient on the Felidae food is salmon).

I was frustrated that it took so long, but I didn't realize until they arrived that they were coming from Europe.  They were the genuine thing.  Needless to say, they were a big hit with my wife.  You may have to wait a little while to get them, but they're definitely worth the wait.

review/summary: Changed for the WORSE
review/text: These used to be my favorite allergy friendly snack that I did not have to make myself. The flavor was great and most importantly, it had TEXTURE (which as anyone with allergies to most textured foods like nuts and grains knows is extremely desirable and important.) But they have changed them for the worse! Oh they are so horrible that I am having trouble expressing it so here's a copy of the email that I sent to the folks at Enjoy Life Foods:<br /><br />  "You have ruined Chaco Loco snacks. They are now disgusting! They used to be the only allergy friendly snack that I'd found that had real flavor and most importantly TEXTURE. Now they taste bitter, slimy, gewy and are completely absent of texture. They stick to my teeth, are difficult to chew and swallow--gross! I tossed the bar into the trash after taking only one bite. Oh, and I noticed that you made them substantially smaller which in this case is a good thing because I can't imagine anyone choking their way through the entire bar anyway. I'm not sure who authorized this farce, I mean product change, and wonder if they actually tasted they product prior to forcing it out onto unwitting consumers like me. I thought that I'd finally found something delicious that I did not have to bake myself that would always be reliable and available for my family but I was wrong.  Choco Loco's now taste like most other allergy friendly snacks on the market today--Terrible. I am so unhappy that this product was changed and am returning them to the seller ASAP."<br /><br />Trust me on this one people, do not waste your money.

If you have allergies and can't have gluten (like me) you'd be better off eating a piece of chalk and a spoonful of cocoa than this.  Skip it.

review/summary: Reformulated bars are NOT an improvement
review/text: Enjoy Life has reformulated these bars and they are now virtually inedible. My sons brought one home today as they thought it had mold. It was likely just the dark chocolate having been exposed to cold (it gets that white coating). However, the bar did not look right - it was dense and rubbery. I contacted the company since it was a product problem as far as I was concerned and not an Amazon problem - they told me about the reformulation saying their customers wanted this "improvement".  They offered a coupon for a free box, but I already have 5 boxes that my sons will not eat.  This is really sad that what was a really good GF product has been made virtually inedible and that the company is very confused about this. I tried one of the old and new bars a few minutes ago and agree 100% with my sons. The sadest thing is that my son's friend at school loved these bars and he doesn't even have to eat GF (which is a big endorsement for any allergen-free product) - he also found the bars inedible and thought they were moldy.<br /><br />The only issue that I would attribute to Amazon is that I have these on subscribe and save and I feel that I should have been notified when the product changed, since this is NOT the product I had subscribed to. They are no longer labeled clearly as "Coco Loco".

review/summary: A Good Snack
review/text: I wasn't eating the old bars, so I have no comparison to what they 'used' to be like.  The bars are not moist, which is actually nice to me, as I'm tired of all the moist snack bars out there.  I keep these pretty readily on hand, and probably have 4 or 5 of them a week.  The individual price of these at the store is a bit high when you compare it to the overall size, but purchased from Amazon, the pricing works out to a pretty decent amount for what it is; a small snack.<br /><br />My wife, who is not gluten sensitive, even enjoys these bars, and keeps one in her purse for those low blood sugar moments when she needs food immediately.<br /><br />While they are on the dry side, they aren't so bad as some reviews have made them out to be.  I don't find it necessary to wash it down in order to clear it out.  It's similar to a more condensed brownie.  It's not overly sweet like a lot of the snack bars are, which is something else I was looking for.<br /><br />I've been keeping these bars in stock, along with other GF snacks, for the better part of a year, now.  I'm happy with them, and will continue to purchase them and keep them in stock.

What infuriates me is the size of the product, which is NOTHING LIKE the picture on the package, and barely half the size of the individual wrapper! I wouldn't even call it a bar, it's only slightly rectangular, more like a small thumbnail-shaped chunk. Definitely check out the video that one reviewer posted to show the actual size. I certainly won't buy these again, and it makes me want to boycott the company, even if they make other, better-tasting GF products.

review/summary: What a RIP-OFF!!!
review/text: The size of the "new and improved" bar is less than half the size of the packaging.  In each package is now a one to two bite-size bar.  Ridiculous.  My non-celiac child actually likes these, but my celiac son dislikes the "new" bar, and I was buying them for him.  The size of the bar is about half of what is shown on the box.  Total rip-off.

review/summary: Irresponsible packaging is the 1st clue: this product is horrid
review/text: From the box, you might think these bars would be about the standard size of say, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PA6H82">Larabar Original Fruit and Nut Bars 18 Bar Variety Pack 2 Boxes</a> or  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMME">KIND PLUS, Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants, Nutritional Boost, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a> or even a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N7MYU2">Glutino Chocolate Banana Organic Bars, 5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6)</a>...THINK AGAIN!!<br /><br />The box is mostly full of air, and so are the individual packages. The individual wrapper is about 3.5" long, but literally half of it is inflated with air to maintain shape, because the bar itself is NOT even 2" long. It is literally just 2 bites big. PATHETIC. This is environmentally irresponsible of the Enjoy Life company to create such waste in their manufacturing and packaging processes, consuming that much in raw materials to contain AIR??? Idiotic!<br /><br />That air exposure might account for the stale taste on the outside of the bar. But it doesn't account for the way the bar itself is such a wad in your mouth that just gets stiffer and gummier the more you chew it, and so hard to eat that it won't go down the esophagus at all without gulping an entire drink behind the measly 2 bites.<br /><br />Wasting the packaging space like that also misleads unwitting consumers into thinking they might actually get some *product* for the outrageous prices. Granted, outrageous prices seem to be the hallmark of all things gluten-free, since the consumer has such limited choices...the makers feel fine with padding the profits so heavily, pursuing profit without conscience. You wanna buy a lot of NOTHING and end up trashing what your hard-earned money got you since what little is there isn't edible? Buy this snack!<br /><br />Two words sum it up: IRRESPONSIBLE and DISGUSTING!

review/text: My son has significant food allergies.  We honestly thought that already prepared baked goods, and especially baked goods would be out of the question for him.  That is until we found these bars.  They're very soft and chewy, and even my other children, without food allergies, enjoy them.  I purchased a large case for my son take take into school, in leiu of cupcakes, and all of the kids in his class enjoyed them as well.

review/summary: Kids LOVE them!
review/text: We recently went gluten free as a family to see if it would help with my son's autism. I had already purchased these bars when I read these reviews ... I was expecting my kids to HATE them. But I'm shocked to say that they LOVE THEM! My daughter gave me a bite of hers ... nasty ... it reminds me of the "fat free" cookies we all used to eat in the early 90's. Odd texture and all. But again ... my kids both love, love, love the bars. And my son - the one I was most concerned about - calls them his "Z bars". He loved "Z bars" prior to going gluten free. They were his favorite snack to take to school. I'm so glad to have found a replacement!! A friend told me that Enjoy Life allows you to print one coupon a day from their website. I'll definitely be doing that since apparently I'll be stocking the pantry with these! :o)

review/summary: i'd give it minus five stars if i could
review/text: The first time i purchased this product there were 5 small bars in the package, about 1/2 the height of the box (which is an extremely misleading marketing technique - they make you believe that you're buying more than you're actually getting). The wrapper on one of the bars was torn and i had to bin it. I didn't make a big deal over one bar even though i paid around $6 for the box of 5. I bought it again hoping there would be no torn wrappers, but there were two, which left me with only 3 bars (the ones in torn packages were rock solid, not that i would eat unwrapped bars anyway)! The third and the last time i bought this product 4 bars had wrappers with tiny wholes in them, they weren't hermetically sealed and were stale, tough, and inedible. Only one bar was properly hermetically sealed and contained a bit of air in the wrapper.<br />I thought that purchasing defective product three times was a bit too much (for $18 spent on 3 packages i only got 8 bars which i actually could eat as opposed to 15 which i paid for). I phoned the company and told them what happened. They refused to issue the refund and they didn't seem to care about the defects at all. They offered to send me one box of bars (with no guarantee that they would not be defective), which i declined, given my previous experiences. I will not be purchasing anything by enjoy life ever again.

review/summary: Do Not Want!
review/text: I recently tried these because I love the chocolate cookies they make. I was expecting them to be just as good if not better, but boy was i wrong... First of all these things are disgusting! They're thick, dry, and totally bland. Not to mention the fact that their about an inch and a half. Looking at the box they appear to be ATLEAST double that size. I ate one by itself and was extremely surprised, so giving them the benefit of the doubt I tried it with some ice cream. it was about .1% better.<br /><br />Bottom line, these things were not worth the money. So many other great snacks out there that taste way better!

review/summary: Great, dense "ice cream sandwich"-ish treat
review/text: I can't weigh in on the "original" version of this product because I never tried it, so this is a review of the current one.<br /><br />The negative:<br />The posters who had an issue with the irresponsible packaging are not off base.  The individual wrappers are twice the size of the bar inside.  Not cool!<br /><br />The positives:<br />First, it's tasty.  I happen to like the dense, cake-like texture and not-too-sweet cocoa flavor.  This is exactly what I expected and what I was looking for.  Imagine an ice cream sandwich without the ice cream.  This product tastes very similar to the "sandwich" part.  (another reviewer actually suggested putting ice cream in between smashed bars, and so it appears she felt the same way I do.)<br /><br />Second, it's healthy. Gluten free, nut free and low in calories and fat. I felt great after eating one and was totally satisfied (only 120 calories and 3.5 grams of fat).

review/summary: Old recipe please!
review/text: I recently purchased a box of the OLD recipe cocoa loco bars and really liked them. They looked a bit unappetizing but tasted great and had a good texture. Went back to the store today and all they had were these, the new formula bars. The new ones look better but the taste is way off and they are gummy in texture whereas the old ones were more cake-like. Very disappointing. I'll try one more and see if it grows on me, but I'm pretty sure I'll end up tossing the rest of the box.

review/summary: Less like chocolate, more like dates
review/text: As with other Enjoy Life products, these bars are either "love 'em!" or "hate 'em!"  They just don't taste like chocolate to me - they taste more like they have a lot of dried fruit in them.  However, they are more than gluten free, they are egg, dairy, AND gluten free, and organic to boot, so with that profile, it's hard to duplicate any delicious snack bar.<br /><br />I do like the slight crunchy texture they have.  For what you get in the box, they are expensive, but most GF products are.

review/summary: Exceptional Snack Bar for the Exceptional Body
review/text: My exceptional body is sensitive to many of the ingredients used in most prepared foods, e.g., wheat, dairy, peanuts, lemon and soy.  Additionally, I do not eat foods that contain processed sugar, high fructose corn syrup, preservatives or artifical food coloring or flavors. Since the foods I do eat are not always readily available, I carry a snack bar with me in case of a hunger attack.  Enjoy Life snack bars meet all my eating and health requirements and even taste really good. I have been enjoying Cocoa Loco and Very Berry snack bars for over six months and I am looking forward to trying their new flavors. My husband says  eating with me is like buying a car with Ralph Nader. I READ the labels! Thanks to Enjoy Life food can be fun, tasty, good for you and chocolate.

review/text: If I could give a product minus twelve stars this one would get it.  We bought six boxes of these only to open sealed packets and find the product covered with a hairy white mold.  Of course it was all natural, non-GMO, preservative free, gluten-free mold!<br /><br />There is a very good scientific and rational reason why competent food makers use preservatives, and that is to preserve the food.  Here we see the benefit of an irrational and ignorance based prejudice against the use of preservatives - the woo woo friendly preservative free all natural food goes bad precisely because it has no preservatives.<br /><br />I called the manufacturer and the best they could offer was an apology, which was obviously sincere, and some coupons good for future purchases.  Fat lot of good a handful of coupons will do me when I am never buying these again while shopping online.<br /><br />RUN AWAY!

The single portions are 1/3 of the size of what they used to be. The box hasn't changed! It lookes as big as before. So when you open it, it's mostly air! The box is empty except for 5 small pieces barely bigger than mini hershey bars. I will try to return these. I used to like this product but I hate it when companies start to rip off their clients. That's the end of me buying this stuff and in fact the end of me buying anything from this company Enjoy Life from now on.

review/text: I never tried these when they were good before the recipe change, according to the other reviews, and I don't normally eat grains (my version of gluten free is an SCD/grain free diet), but when my son, who is gluten free, told me how horrible these were, I was in disbelief, (he loves Schar cookies, anything by UDI's, etc....)  To see for myself, I took one bite of these cocoa Loco bars, and after chewing a few moments, had to spit my bite out in the sink, which is highly unusual for me as I can stomach a diverse variety of foods more sensitive palates may not enjoy.  I cannot believe they market this as food for human consumption.  It is beyond utterly and completely gross in texture, and in taste.  What a shame they sell these as they are.  This is the one time I would give a product less than one star, if I could.<br />How in the world did these ever pass a taste test panel?  What was the company thinking?

review/summary: Gluten Free Sad Face
review/text: I was passing by my favorite place to pick up snacks and healthy meals in hopes of nagging a parking spot and getting a freshly made gluten free brownie or GF chocolate chip cookies for the road (which incidentally was made with palm sugar, almond flour, blah blah blah etc. TASTY) Sad to say: no parking spots + me in a hurry = gluten free tears.<br /><br />On my way home, I stopped in Fresh Plus to pick up cat food....and saw these. Immediately went back to the missed gluten free brownie. Which would have been 2 dollars. These were around 4? I opened one and it was completely small. I crumbled it up with my plain greek yogurt and added some honey for good measure. Not too bad.<br /><br />Then, after dinner I had another one by itself and oh my gosh. Disgusting. Recommend these only for mixing in with something that has moisture. Lots and lots of moisture. Probably just should've stuck with the gf brownie. Next time, I'll buy 2. Same amount of food (no joke). Same price. Completely more tasty. Surprisingly fewer calories per square inch. And just better all around. Nothing but sad faces over here.

review/summary: OK, but I'll never be buying them again.
review/text: I'm allergic to both dairy & tree nuts, so when I saw that these were supposed to be free of all of the major dairy allergies I figured "what the hey- it'll be nice to eat something I know I won't have a reaction to."<br /><br />Ugh. Just ugh. The taste of these runs somewhere between a tootsie roll & one of those icky protein drinks that nobody (not even the dedicated protein drinkers) really likes. Someone here likened the taste to rubber & I think I'd agree that's a pretty accurate statement. Every once in a while you'll get a bite that isn't that bad (hence the tootsie roll description), but mostly this is just a bland & generally inedible mess.<br /><br />And this isn't even going into the other things about it. I had to drink a lot of water after this to not only wash the taste out of my mouth but to also rinse the bar off of my teeth & gums.It literally caked my entire mouth. The other issue that I sort of had a problem with was the size. Don't get me wrong- I'm glad this wasn't a big bar because that meant that I didn't have to choke down some huge thing, but for what I paid for the box & for how many calories one bar is (120), the bar is itty bitty. It just didn't seem like I got my money's worth out of it.<br /><br />I'm one person that will never be purchasing this product again & I'll probably end up giving the rest of the box away at work. I'll probably end up avoiding the rest of the company's products if this is what I have to look forward to.

review/summary: This stuff is terrible.
review/text: Inedible. It tasted like cocoa flavored sand. I hear it used to taste better but I can't vouch for that. I was extremely disappointed because there are so very few snack type foods I can eat with all my different food allergies. Most of the other foods under this brand are pretty good, I think they just screwed up with this one.

review/summary: Enjoy Life Cocoa Loco bars
review/text: The Cocoa Loco bars are okay, but I preferred their original recipe for them!  The "new and improved" recipe isn't as good.  They are drier and the texture is to powdery, too much like eating cocoa powder.  The original was more like a chocolate granola bar.  Hope they bring back the original soon.

review/summary: Not Good
review/text: I ordered these for my daughter who was having to change to a no milk, no soy, no yeast, extremely low carb diet and was really missing her sweet treats. She has eaten about 3 bars and enjoyed them. However, every one since then has been moldy when opened. She is frustrated and I am not happy about spending money on a product that seems to get moldy easily, even when stored in a dry, dark climate.

review/text: My family eats a gluten-free, casein-free diet and the Cocoa Loco bars USED to be a staple for us for a quick breakfast before my son went to school.  The changes Enjoy Life made to the bars make them not as tasty or as chewy as they previously were before the changes.  These are still pretty good but not as tasty as they used to be and are definitely no longer one of my son's favorites.

review/summary: Tasty but a little hard on the system.
review/text: My child who has celiac disease rejected these after one bite but I thought that they were not bad at all. The flavor is more of a date with honey than a strong cocoa flavor and I enjoyed eating them.<br />However, there is very definitely flaxseed meal in this bar and I usually find a few not very well ground seeds everytime. If you are sensitive to the effects of flax on your digestion then this is not going to be something you want. I can have no more than one a day.<br />My younger son loves these but he too has a hard time with the flaxseeds so we will probably not puchase these again.

review/summary: Grainy texture... not very chocolatey
review/text: After reading several reviews, I thought these would be good, but decided to buy a box at Meijer before I bought in bulk on Amazon.  I'm glad I did. They have a grainy texture and are not very chocolate-y at all!  I bake a lot of my own gluten free, sugar free treats, so maybe it's because I was expecting them to taste like what I usually bake, but they are not very good unless you are used to more of a chocolate flavored cardboard bar.

review/summary: But when there is so little I CAN eat....
review/text: To be honest, I didn't try these BEFORE they made the change people are talking about, so I have nothing to compare it with except what I make myself.  I am on a very, very strict diet and it is one tiny, little (yes, it is tiny) thing I can eat without making myself, so that alone is worth the five stars to me.  That it is also chocolate is an added bonus (I am not comparing it to brownies or real chocolate, which I haven't eaten in years, but having not had any chocolate for so long, and being highly allergic to most sweeteners, this satisfies my chocolate cravings.)  I eat it a nibble at a time with a swig of unsweetened almond milk (makes it last longer.)  So when the rest of my family eat their brownies in front of me, I pull one of these out and don't feel so sorry for myself.  I also like the Buttercrunch bars which taste a little like a not-very-sweet-inside of a Butterfinger.  I must be desperate.....

review/summary: Covered in mold, questionable customer service!!!
review/text: Ok, so I want to start this by saying that we have been eating Cocoa Loco bars on an almost daily basis for about 2 years.  My son can not eat wheat or dairy, and he absolutely loves these little bars.  They have made a wonderful, irreplaceable breakfast bar, or snack for the car.  We also order cases of Enjoy Life granola and chocolate chips on a regular basis.  So this review is coming from someone who REALLY likes their products.  Fast forward to 3 1/2 weeks ago: we go onto Amazon and see that the bars have been changed to a "new recipe."  This really worried my son, but we ordered a case and anxiously awaited their arrival.  The bars came and EVERY single one was covered in GREEN, FUZZY mold.  Yes, we opened each and every bar in the whole case!!  So, instead of calling Amazon, I called the company direct, feeling like they should know about this asap.  I talked to a representative from the company and she said that they already knew about the mold, but it had been too late and a few cases were sent to customers.  She said that they would send a replacement case asap.  I was so happy and figured that we could expect the new bars in a few days. 3 wks passed and I realized we hadn't received the new case.  Sent a long email to the company telling them how disappointed I was and after a few days I got a one line email saying the case would ship today.  No explanation, no apology, nothing.  So, I won't hold my breath about the replacement, and I sincerely hope this company works on their public relations skills.  (I wouldn't have even written this email if someone just admitted that they had "dropped the ball" and apologized)  The allergy community definitely needs good brands and hopefully this one will improve.

review/summary: Great pick-me-up
review/text: Cocoa Loco Chewy bars provide a great pick-me-up between meals and, in a pinch, in place of a meal.  Unlike other commercial gf products, Cocoa Loco bars satiate hunger rather than leave an empty feeling or provoke cravings.  The bars have a good taste, excellent mouth feel, and a nice density unusual in gf products.  The bars I have purchased through Amazon have all been consistent in size.  Sometimes when I buy them in stores, the bars seem to have been compressed, perhaps by pressure from stacked boxes.  Compression does not affect taste or satiation.  I have read many critical reviews unfavorably comparing the bars to brownies.  These bars are not brownies and do not serve as treats or desserts.  They are great for traveling or to keep in the office.  This is the only flavor of the Enjoy Life bars I like, but I can recommend Cocoa Loco highly.

review/text: Hugely dissapointing. I can't imagine there's a customer buying this product after the first purchase. Overpriced to say the least: 3.99 plus tax. The "bars" are oversized tootsie rolls in size, they must have used a supoer-zoom lens when they took the picture and if you threw one at someone,you'd send them to the hospital, they were hard as rocks. Tastes like chewing chalk that gets slimey but has a chocolate taste to it at some point. I want to know who thought it was a good idea to sell these? Threw them all out..and I dislike wasting food, but this is not food.

review/summary: PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT LIKE PIZZA CRUST
review/text: BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are expecting a rising pizza crust, such as what you might get from standard pizza dough, then you'll need to look elsewhere.  That being said, these are pretty good in their own right.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I rather like the way these pizza crusts taste after being toasted up.  They soak in flavor from sauce or cheese well, without becoming soggy or wilted.  They have a good bread flavor on their own, also, and make a good base for a BBQ chicken or BBQ pulled pork pizza.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />I think the texture is the only thing I can complain about with these - the Schar Crusts are a little more dense than I would like.  However, this is a usual complaint about all gluten-free items.<br /><br />SIZE<br />These are definitely personal pizza sized.  With sauce, cheese, and toppings on this crust, I can usually eat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pizza on my own.<br /><br />USES/ VERSATILITY<br />If you can expand your mind beyond making just pizza with red sauce and mozzarella, then these crusts are quite useful.  I personally love them with some BBQ sauce and chicken.  They make a nice bread/ carb base for anything I might otherwise eat on flatbread.  As a gluten-free option, these crusts are a wonderful thing to have at your disposal.

review/summary: Believe it or not, this is the best BBQ sauce on the market.
review/text: And I've tried them all.<br /><br />Maybe its the anchovies. Who in their right mind but these radio clowns John Boy and Billy<br />would put anchovies in barbecue sauce right! Well why not, most all good steak sauces and<br />Worcestershire have anchovies, and you cant make a decent Caesar Salad without them either.<br /><br />What this sauce does to food is amazing. For ribs and chicken it just doesn't get any better.<br />Not a real tomato taste like most mainstream BBQ sauce, and not a mustard flavor either like<br />you will find in Florida and South Carolina. And although JB&B are in North Carolina, its not<br />a traditional NC style sauce either and thank god for that cause NC BBQ is the most overhyped<br />and overrated stuff I've ever had. So they went in a whole new direction with this recipe<br />cause there's nothing else like it.<br /><br />I use it as a finishing sauce on the grill, or you can dilute it with water or vinegar and<br />use it for a marinade, even on steak. Its also great on rotisserie chicken and wings. If you<br />want more heat, get this Hot and Spicy version, its better than the Original Grillin Sauce<br />IMHO. But its not too hot, not going to set anybody on fire.<br /><br />BTW, my favorite recipe is for ribs using Emeril's Rib Rub and John Boy and Billy's Grillin<br />Sauce as a finisher. Great combination. Check the web for other more creative recipes like<br />The Spammer (one can Spam, one bottle Grillin Sauce and an oven) haw haw

When his latest variety was recalled, I tried what the store owner recommended and was more than surprised. Chip always had flaking skin and almost instantly this began to clear up.  He always licked his paws to the point of there being no fur on them.  After less than two weeks he has quit licking his paws and the fur is slowly starting to grow back.  He seems far more bright-eyed and bushy tailed, energetic.  His coat is shiny and that doggy odor has disappeared.  It's like he's a new dog.  I hope this change is permanent!

review/summary: Life and Money Saver!
review/text: My shar-pei has always had a sensitive stomach. From puppyhood, I've learned to be careful what I feed him.  When he reached his golden years (I'd say around nine years old), he seemed to have additional issues (like allergies) that just aggravated his sensitive stomach and I felt like I was back to the drawing board in attempting to find something that would suit him.<br /><br />I've tried cooking for him, prescription foods that I can only order from the vet, steroid shots once a month.  It got to be a pretty expensive endeavor and all the while, my dog was losing weight. Then, I had the fantastic luck of meeting a woman who told me about this food and I slowly replaced my shar-pei's dry prescription food with this. In addition, I've started supplementing his food with some oats mixed with pumpkin. And voila!<br /><br />On my last vet appointment, he claimed that he's never seen my dog look so healthy and that he had been honestly afraid that my dog was at death's door on our previous visit. No more steroid shots.  No more diarrhea. Now, I never did the allergy test on my dog to figure out what it was that I had to avoid, but all I can say is...it's not in this food. My dog is doing way better in this food than the uber expensive prescription food I used to give him. And Amazon's subscribe and save make it the cheapest place to get this once a month :)

review/summary: Great Dog Food for Dog's With Food Allergies
review/text: I have two French Bulldog pups of which one has mild food allergies. Over the years our family has tried just about every premium dog food out there to not only keep his food allergies in check but also find a palatable dog food he'd enjoy eating. About a year ago I stumbled across Nature's Variety dog food in a local pet store and after reading the bag decided to give the brand a try. Largely we've seen good results with Nature's Variety Instinct.<br /><br />The Instinct formula's are designed around a wholesome, grain-free approach; the ingredients list is impressive and features proteins first, no fillers and thus a better dog food all around. The individual formula's are designed to be rotated with minimal adjustment required for your pup. We have been very successful in rotating the different Instinct blends - Salmon, Beef & Lamb, Duck & Turkey. The only exception being the Chicken formula which caused my pup to have non-stop runny stools and a very active digestive system. This might be the result of a chicken allergy that we've previously not encountered with other brands.<br /><br />Recently we decided to try the Lamb Meal formula with a limited ingredient list and the results have been far better than expected! This formula almost instantly helped relieve my pups runny stool, his gas output (Frenchies are notorious for being gassy) has fallen dramatically, and perhaps most importantly my pups devour their food happily.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!

Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be "agricultural ingredients." Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as "necessary vitamins and minerals," which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and "other" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from "natural"<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: "includes mutant organisms" and "recombinant organisms", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is "extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane."<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: "genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid" and "extraction with solvents such as ... hexane." Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.<br /><br />Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom<br /><br />The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health.

review/text: As a Graaaaaaaandmama I want whats best for our little guy, and this product is our first choice after breastfeeding. I was visiting my daughter's family to see the baby and he had run out of formula which Mom uses to supplement. He likes it much better than his previous formula choice. I bought him the first can and then the store in PA said it was discontinued! VERY glad I found it on this site thanks.

review/summary: Earth's Best Soy Baby Formula
review/text: ~Earth's Best Infant Formula Soy Iron, 13.2-Ounce is a great alternative formula for the baby who is lactose intolerant and for the parents who want a formula that is balanced nutritional. It is easily digested even by the most finicky eater.<br /> Our granddaughter had gastric surgery at 3 weeks of age and continued feeding with the formula right after surgery without any problems. The powder easily mixes unlike most formulas.<br />I have bought other Earth's Best products and all are great.<br />At Earth's [...] they have gift baskets sampling of all there products.<br />The Amazon price of the formula for one can is the same online as in my store. But not all stores stock it yet. Thus why I buy online.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: Although this is more expensive than the popular brands, I've come to really trust and like the Earth's Best brand. This soy formula has been the perfect alternative to breastmilk for my little one after my current pregnancy caused me to wean earlier than I would have liked! It doesn't have as strong of an odor like I've noticed with other children who drink the other soy formulas. Maybe that's just me being partial to my own child, but I've always thought that soy formulas made kids smell kinda funny!

review/summary: Soy Dangers!
review/text: It's outrageous that processed soy is being offered as baby food.  Large amounts of harmful hormones (phytoestrogens) are harmful to the thyroid, and extensive processing of soy creates toxic residues (such as protease inhibitors) that are very unhealthy.  This is the last thing that I'd feed to a baby.  Be informed, there's a lot of research on this, please read:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />there are literally hundreds of more links,<br />just google soy dangers, or soy toxin and do your own research.<br /><br />Shame on Hain's!

review/summary: Bite Oppsite the Pinch
review/text: I use these for emergency blood sugar support when on the road or camping...I think these are great.  I prefer agave over honey because of the lower glycemic index (supports stable blood sugar longer).<br /><br />I don't know why other reviewers had a hard time opening them.  Just bite at 90 degrees to the pinch and it pops right open, and won't open when you don't want it to.  Just don't put them in a crunched bag unless you have them inside plastic to be safe.  I've never had one break open and spill.<br /><br />Great product.

review/summary: Give them a try...
review/text: I was a little skeptical when these first arrived.  In fact, it did seem to take way too much effort to get into them like another reviewer mentioned but over time I found a trick.<br /><br />If you either cut the bottom off with scissors or bite the bottom and tear it open a bit, place the stick in your hot beverage giving it a squeeze or two then wait a minute.  The nectar becomes warm and thin enabling you to easily squeeze the contents into your hot drink.  Now that I've found this trick I keep a bunch of them in with my tea bags when I travel - which is a lot.  Hopes this helps, these are a great product and a great price.

review/summary: Be VERY careful when ordering this product...
review/text: While the majority of the "Nectar Stix" reached me intact, there were quite a few that didn't. I would problable blame it on the packaging of the product, plus the fact that the seals are REAL easy to break on the stix. Nothing like a nice gooey mess to contend with when you open the box.Fortunatly these weren't the main order and the rest was intact. I won't be ordering these any time again....<br /><br />Good thing its 109 degrees outside and the ants are probably hiding underground to escape this freakin heat wave, which sounds like a good idea to me as well... whew....

review/text: I love the agave, but the stix are not practical on the run.  You have to have scissors.  I would like to have them with me, as I would a packet of splenda.  They are not easy to open, and it is difficult to get it into a hop beverage.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: I use this masala always since it is the best with authentic taste and all ingredients in it. I dont have to add ginger garlic separately if I use thsi masala for making the biryani. Awesome is the only word. Suddenly our local indian/pakistani grocery stores stopped stocking this and i was shocked. Finally I found this on amazon and ordered it. the only difference is, it used to be $1.00 at the local stores but online it is $2,00 oer packet but still worth it.

review/text: I saw this at Whole Foods and bought it from there.  I wanted something nice to bring to a house party and didn't feel like bringing flowers.  It was a hit!  It really is very pretty and memorable.  It was one of a kind, plus a small piece made a nice dessert with coffee.  Well worth the price.  It would be fun for a chocolate tasting event.
