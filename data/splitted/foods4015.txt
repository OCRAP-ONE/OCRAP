review/summary: Like Finding Buried Treasure
review/text: One by one, every grocery store and big-box retailer in our metro area has stopped carrying liquiud sweeteners.  All they sell is powders.  I have no idea why they have made the decision to force us to use powders.  They are NOT the same, and we prefer the liquid.  So I was thrilled to find the liquid products for sale on Amazon.  Of course, 12 bottles may last awhile, but it won't spoil.  Free shipping was a real bonus.

review/summary: Great way to sweeten tea
review/text: The title says it all.  This is a great way to sweeten your iced tea.  It's much more efficient than tearing open little pink packages.  You have to experiment to get the right amount though - enough to get just a hint of sweetness because too much gives it a bitter taste.  Sweetened this way the tea is pleasant but not cloying,  and I can put away over a gallon of it a day.

review/text: You can't get this stuff in stores anymore so I tried all the alternative sweeteners in my coffee.  I wasn't satisfied with any of them.  The little envelopes have too much sweetener so I throw half of it away and the individual packaging makes it more expensive needlessly.<br /><br />If this is the taste you are used to and find others distort the flavor of your beverage as I did, you'll be as delighted to find this product as I was.  Recent research says this artificial sweetener is not as unhealthy as others.  I was glad to learn that previous bad press has been proven incorrect.<br /><br />I would have been happy with a couple of bottles, but I'm definitely set for life now with 12!

I wanted something low in caffeine and not expensive.  Eventually I learned that Lavazza is the best bargain around and found their Top Class blend to be a very good replacement.  Here are my impressions of some of the Lavazza whole-bean espressos:<br /><br />Pienaroma - high acid, low aroma, fruity, medium roast, mild, low caffeine.<br />Super Crema - high acid, medium roast, mild, low caffeine.<br />Grand Espresso - low acid, high aroma, medium roast, spicy finish, high caffeine.<br />Top Class - moderate acid, aroma, and caffeine; medium/dark roast, spicy finish.

However, since the cats like the yeast, they get in on their food. One 18 ounce bottle seems to last forever. Also, they do not have fleas.

review/summary: Love this instant screen
review/text: We used our bug off, 60 x 80, all last spring and summer and intend to begin using it again this year.  It fits our double doors very well both side to side and height.  It is easy to go in and out and the snap closure works instantly.  Our dogs easily learned to go in and out so, if you need to keep a dog inside this wouldn't work for you (unless your dog is very well trained and can learn that he is not allowed to go through the screen).  The screen opens up our outdoors to us with plenty of filtered light and breeze.  would recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: OK, but does not close automatically. Needs to manually close.
review/text: The screen set up is pretty easy. The sides of the screen need to use velcro stickers to adhere to the side frames. The top is secured by a hanging rod. Weight is sewn to the bottom to ensure it does not lift. The automatic "magnetic" door does not close automatically. The two screens overlap by a few inches. They depends on the magnetic pads to shut it closed. But the magnetic pads do not align easily and need to manually align them to get a proper seal. It is essentially a screen curtain.

review/text: I have 60" french doors. Easy to install. No tools required. I did it alone. Keeps the mosquitoes and flies out like it is supposed to, and lets fresh air in. Negatives: You can't just walk though it. You will need to use your hands to open and close it. Also, my cats are dumb and it took them a while to figure it out (maybe that's a positive since it keeps them out side). Bottom line, I would recommend this, but you should know about the opening and closing issue.

review/summary: As advertised- fits and works great, super easy!
review/text: I ordered this screen so I can keep my French doors open in the spring and fall without having tons of bugs get in the house.  It truly does install in minutes- just slide the screen onto the tension rod, open your doors and place the rod at the appropriate height for your doors.  The added velcro helps keep the sides in place.  I think that overall the magnets do a great job of keeping the opening closed, but it is a good idea to just make sure it closed properly after you go through the doorway.  No, it doesn't automatically close perfectly without help every single time, but come on people- it is a screen with magnets for less than a hundred bucks- you have to give it credit for doing the intended job so well even if it isn't perfect!<br />For me, the length and width was perfect. I feel like the screen material looks nice and is of good quality, and the opening functions well enough for the purpose.  I think I paid a fair price for a good product that I am getting lots of use out of.  I would purchase this product again, or in different sizes for my other doors.

review/text: We needed a screen so desperately for our french doors because of the insane fly problem at the beach in the summer. We got a quote for $800 for a professional screen which was unheard of, so I decided to do some research and found this screen. Reluctant at first because it was priced so low I wasn't sure the quality would work for us. BUT! I was wrong! I LOVE this screen! It is of great quality and is very easy for my dog and 2 year old to get in and out. Most importantly my house is bug free. I would recommend this screen to anyone! Easy to install and to take up and down if needed! I am so happy with it!

Also, my cat can pull it down as it is held in place at the top with a rod. The screen fits with most of my needs and I feel that it was a good purchase.

review/summary: Sweet, thick and smoky!
review/text: This is one of the very best Kansas City style BBQ sauces I have ever tasted. Being thick, it sits on the meat rather than sinking in and does well for stuff that you want to have sauce on top of (some like their ribs that way, I like hotlinks that way). The flavor is really well mixed and rounded smokiness and lightly sweet with a touch of spice; well balanced sauce that goes with anything smoked or 'cue'd.

review/summary: Simply the best bottled BBQ sauce on the planet
review/text: My uncle introduced this brand to my mom at a BBQ  he had last summer and explained this is what he uses on ribs, and chicken to get it so good. Yes he was right my mom passed down the info to me I been trying it with my crockpot bbqs, george foreman, showtime rotisserie, flavorwave bbqs etc and yes the outdoor bbqs let's not forget those. This is a extremely good sauce that's all I am going to say as to not give away to many spoilers but this sauce is the "sauce" so to speak. and great price for it to. I use it frequently and buy it exclusivity now.

review/summary: Wonderful tea!
review/text: I used to only make coffee with k-cups in my Keurig. I would make tea, but just used the hot water and my own tea bags...figured that it wasn't worth the extra cost. Boy was I wrong! I was at a hotel and they had keurig machines and had a few K-cups of tea there...I took them home to maybe try...and was very pleasantly surprised when I did! Why was I fussing with bags and steeping times, when I can have a perfect cup with the touch of a button? I mean, I bought the machine for the convenience, why wasn't I doing that with tea?<br /><br />I liked the Celestial Seasonings Earl Grey the best from those samples, but took a chance on the Bigelow here because it was cheaper, and found I liked it more. It has a nice sweetish, flavor...and Earl Grey IS supposed to have that nice citrus flavor from the infusion of orange...this does. I found the other brand to almost be slightly spicy which I DO like (especially in Constant Comment which I am STILL waiting for in K-cups), but it didn't seem "clean" like the Earl Grey I know. I even use the large size button and the tea is still good...though obviously not as strong as the small. I like mine with sugar only...but this flavor lends itself well to honey, lemon...or even (yes!) maple sugar (or even syrup!)<br /><br />Just a straightforward, easy-to-like cup of tea.<br /><br />Edit: You may want to keep an eye on the price of this (and most k-cups) here because the prices and sellers seem to change.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I'm surprised how much it tastes like coffee. To be completely accurate, it tastes like a watered down coffee (like the kind you get at hotels) with hazelnut flavor -- and a *very slight* earthy undertone. If someone gave me a sip and didn't tell me what it was, I'd think it were coffee, let's put it that way.<br /><br />There's not all that much root per teabag though, and since I like strong coffee I only use 6 oz of water per bag and steep it covered for 15 mins. Then with some cream and sugar it's quite good.<br /><br />As for the liver tonic claim, well dandelion stimulates bile flow and supposedly helps clear out some stuff gunking up the liver. I don't know about that yet, but so far I haven't noticed any ill effects from drinking this. I feel fine, if not outright good after drinking a cup, but that's as far as I can confirm the effects.<br /><br />And with even decaf coffee containing 5-15 mg caffeine per serving, this stuff being completely caffeine free is a blessing for those of us who go bananas and light public property on fire when we get the slightest bit of caffeine. Anyone who needs a coffee substitute, do give this a try.

review/text: I've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as "coffee tasting" or with "roasted flavors," but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this "roasted" flavor.

review/summary: GOOD FOR YOU, BUT WORST TASTING TEA EEEVVVEEERRR
review/text: As an avid tea drinker of all corners of the earth, I have had hundreds of teas, and everything from this company as well. I read about this tea as a very powerful health herb but all the reviews said it tastes bad. What do I care? I'd rather be healthy. I never take sugar in my tea either. If you've read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was. You can't imagine how bad it is. Without exaggeration I would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt. Yes, as a 32 year old with children I know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink. My recommendation is to let it steep for a shorter amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea. As you know, the longer it steeps the bolder the tea becomes. Yea, don't do that with this. Four stars because it is apparently very good for you and I thank the company for bringing it to us regardless of the taste of death when other tea companies are using Artificial ingredients to make their teas taste better.

They're small enough that I can give her one or half of one easily each time she returns with the ball when we play fetch, but they're not so small that she can't catch it or bite my fingers off trying to eat it from my hand. Other treats I've tried have been too big, have had some ingredient she can't handle, or have had a bunch of ingredients that aren't natural which I don't want to give her a lot of. These work out great.

You won't have the exact same texture or the precise taste of fresh eggs, but then, what would you expect? They're powdered. When you eat them, your mouth and taste buds still say "yup, that's egg allright." A very reasonable product for those with reasonable expectations.

review/summary: Great for baking
review/text: These eggs are perfect for baking, but NOT for eating by themselves.  Use them for baking only and you'll love it.  I live in rural alaska where eggs are not easy to come by.  We keep a can in the fridge and it lasts us a year or two of baking.  We still use real eggs for omelets or fried egg sandwiches.  Also if you don't open the can until you need it they will keep forever, something like 7 years.  You can also buy these from honeyville grain's website.  They have flat $4.99 shipping anywhere in the lower 48 no matter how many items you buy.

review/summary: If you add a LITTLE liquid,you are golden!
review/text: I see alot of people slamming this product for using other than baking needs,and I guess I can understand if you are cutting this powder with 2-1 water and trying to scramble!However,if you try using milk(I actually use powdered milk as well,but thats your call),and just add a tiny little bit of liquid at a time until you get to the consistency you need,and make sure to butter the pan(use a little oil as well to keep butter from burning),you will find this item is NOT as bad as all that scrammbled,it is however,hard as heck to try amd make an omlet out of this stuff,but add a few other items,green peppers,onions,selentro,spices,etc,and you will find they arent all that bad,they definately are NOT farm fresh eggs,but no-one ever cliamed they were,just cut WAY back on the liquid to powder ratio,and cook it SLOWLY using a buttered luke warm pan,bring it up to medium to medium low temp stirring constantly until done,you will find yourself liking this stuff,just my opinion,but give it one more shot using milk or powdered milk,and only tiny bits at a time,and you may be surprised!

review/summary: Great for a large group to feed.
review/text: As someone who has taken up backpacking this summer, I have dived head-first into recipies beyond that of trail mixes.  Alot has been written about the taste of powdered eggs vs. that of regular eggs, all I can say is that there is a definite difference-but just remember-when you're in the middle of nowhere-this product will take care of your craving for eggs.  The product comes in a coffee-can sized tin that probabily take an individual like myself about a whole season of weekly camping to go through.  This product would be great for those trips with a group of people to cook for.  I've also tried the product in baked recipies with a fair amount of success

review/summary: Powdered Egg Whites
review/text: Not quite as tasty as liquid egg whites, and some care needed to dissolve the powder in water or milk, but they cook up great and you can control the thickness and richness by the powder to water/milk ratio.  Never needs refrigeration, easily stored, great for camping or backpacking or when you run out of refrigerated liquid egg whites, as it is an extra hassle to drive to the store in the traffic, rain, or snow.

review/summary: Not bad...........not bad!
review/text: Well i read all the reviews VERY carefully before i bought theese things....i was a bit scared at first naturally eating a egg from powder but i kept thinking about the buffet eggs...we all know thir not real eggs yet theres something magical about them! lol i figured i could make my own shoneys buffet at home...(kinda lol) but anyhoo i made some right when they got here as i was anxious to try em....lemme say when i tried them i wasnt very hungry at all so im sure that had something to do with it...but in all honesty their not bad all.... they aint like the buffet eggs...granted ove only made about 3 eggs..(3 tsb) one thing i did learn is DO NOT COOK THIS EGG ON A HOT SURFACE! cook it slow...this aint no real egg....it gets all dry and, well, nasty to be honest. but if you asking yourself of you should buy theese eggs, and you have the spare cash and if you dont feel like running to get a dozen eggs every few days then yeah id deffinetly do it...they taste pretty good actually, but one thing i noticed was the "yoke factor" if i had it to do ovre again i would have gotten the egg whites....as im using these just for breakfast eggs.<br /><br />theese are really yolky...i always eat the yoks too...but theese seem like powderd yolks to be honest...lol so if you doing some baking and need yokes get theese! but if your like me and want scrambled eggs...get the whites they may be more but theyre probbly worht it.<br /><br />but if your a super yolk fan get theese...anyhoo thats about it..<br />they are decent eggs, and i would probably get them again (whites next time)<br /><br />anyhoo...<br />thanks!

review/summary: Great addition to an Emergency Pantry.
review/text: For those of you out there that are stocking up on emergency supplies, this is a really good purchase. I had purchased these eggs in a smaller bag in the past at my local camping store and when I saw them here I decided to get some for my emergency supply. They taste like what you would expect of powdered eggs but for some reason people want the 100% exact taste of freshly cracked eggs, which would make about as much sense as expecting powdered milk to taste 100% exactly like fresh dairy milk. Go figure!<br />  I have used these eggs in the past to make brownies, microwave brownies at that, and they came out OK. I personally love to make Tomato, Pepper and Onion Omelets with these eggs but to each their own I would say. Are these eggs tolerable enough to eat? Well, considering that one morning I made a Cheese and Tomato Omelet for my wife using these same eggs and she barely noticed the difference until I told her afterwards, I would say these eggs work out well in a pinch. And in an emergency situation these eggs will taste like gourmet food to those who are starving, so this product gets an A+ in my book.

review/summary: If there were no Chickens Left
review/text: I guess I got the title wrong. If there were no food left is what it should really say. I broke down and opened up this can to try it out and kind of wished I had waited till there was no more food left on this whole planet. When that day comes, these powdered eggs would taste pretty good. But knowing there is a grocery store a few miles from here and knowing that I could pack something much more tasty if I were to go backpacking, I would have to opt out on packing these powdered eggs. They are edible, but they are by no means a viable replacement unless you used bacon grease to cook them in or you had some ketchup to put on them. Something to add some taste to them as they are bland with a tint/hint of egg flavor. Some people were looking for what ratio of egg powder to water they should use. Well, it does not really matter so long as you actually dissolve the powder since the cooking process evaporates the water. However, I do believe that you might want to use more than an even 1:1 ratio. I think a 1:1.25 ratio would be better. Make them a little more runny so that they spread out over the pan you are cooking them in. As for the rest of my can of eggs, I suppose I am going to have to vacuum seal them and hope they last till the end of food as we know it.

review/summary: Great for dog food additive!
review/text: I have never eaten dried eggs, so I can't comment on the taste or quality for human diets.  I bought this product to add to my dog's food because I have a couple of picky eaters, especially one older girl who doesn't have much of an appetite sometimes.  I feed only top quality, high protein, all natural dog food, but even so, I sprinkle a tablespoon of the powdered egg on top of each dog's meal and add a little water.  My dogs love it.  In addition to adding taste, it's low in calories and a great coat supplement as well.  I would highly recommend this product for this type purpose.

review/summary: Honeyville whole powdered eggs are "TASTELESS"!
review/text: I have an Indian (American) friend, that gets free whole powdered eggs from the gov commodity program. She has often made me "yummy/flavorfull" egg sandwiches (i.e. scrambled eggs...)!<br /><br />I decided to buy some Honeyville & try it? What a disappointment for scrambled eggs (don't know about baking...?)!<br />1. Their is NO flavor, whatsoever!!!<br />2. Sticks "hard" to oiled stainless frying pan (fried like a pancake. pre-heated to med/low)- Worked better when I mixed in 1tsp of Canola oil, per egg... (like waffles...).<br /><br />For 1 egg sandwich- I mix 1/4 cup water, to 1/4 cup mix (they say 2-1), which was a runny mess (maybe for baking?).<br /><br />Limited shelf life...- I store unused mix in the freezer!

Easy to mix and cook. After mixing with water it looks thinner than regular eggs, but it cooks well. If you are not sure, order powdered eggs in a smaller package and try it first. Will definitely buy again once it runs out.

review/text: I bought 5 lbs of this instead of my usual order from Sweet Maria's.  I had some of each on hand to compare, and right away I saw that the Coffee Bean Direct beans were full of misshapen beans and even a few stones.  When it came to roasting, it was much more difficult to get an even roast in my iRoast2.  When I drank the first few cups, the difference was even more striking.  I will be pawning this off on my relatives who don't know better, and ordering a replacement from Sweet Marias.<br /><br />As bad as this review is, there is nothing horrible about the beans, but with an equally priced and far supperior competitor out there, there is no reason to buy this one.

review/summary: Very nice taste, easy to roast and well packaged
review/text: I just started home roasting and this was my first purchase of green coffee.  I am a coffee enthusiast, and living in a small town, home roasting is the only way to get fresh roasted coffee as the stores just don't sell inventory fast enough.<br /><br />My first batch of this coffee was great tasting with nice body and earthy flavor I would expect from Sumatran. It was packaged well and I received it in 3 business days.<br /><br />From past experience with store bought Sumatran, I like a city plus or maybe full city roast rather than the very dark vienna or french roast the stores seem to like. Roasted to city plus or full city, this product produces a flavor that is full and earthy, but not over the top like a dark roasted Sumatran can be. Lighter than city plus will taste grassy like most coffee. Just my preference and your experience will tell you what works for you.<br /><br />I read some home roasting how-to articles on the web and tried to roast using an air popper to a city plus or full city, ending up with nice medium colored and evenly roasted batch. The aroma when newly roasted is kind of "raw", but after an hour or two it is fantastic.  It wasn't very tricky to roast and I've been able to repeat the results as often as I need fresh beans, usually 6 to 8 oz. of beans each weekend.<br /><br />After letting the roast "breathe" for a day, it made great espresso in a 15-bar pump espresso machine with fair crema, and in a 3-cup Italian moka pot. With a coarser grind it was terrific in a French press as well. I haven't tried it in a drip machine. The results have been consistent from batch to batch and I would buy it again.

I also bought another variety in the same 5-lb bag size. I've already roasted about a pound of each and am very happy with the results. I am very partial to the Sumatra. Getting a nice dark roast without burning is always a challenge but it seemed easier with these beans. When the oils were released from the beans the aroma was excellent. Will be buying more from this vendor.

review/summary: Beans Crawling With Bugs
review/text: I'm fairly new to home roasting, and was very excited to find unroasted beans on Amazon. I usually procure my beans through Sweet Maria's, but I like the speed and convenience of the Amazon purchasing process. I ordered a 5lb bag of unroasted Sumatra Mandheling beans and they arrived the following day.<br /><br />It was late in the evening before I got around to opening the bag. As soon as I cut the top off of the vacuum sealed bag, I noticed that the beans didn't look quite right. They looked sort of "mealy", as though something had been eating them, and they smelled off. As my eyes focused a bit better, I quickly saw the cause of the problem. Bugs. Little reddish-brown beetle-like bugs, crawling all over the beans. UGH! I took a few pictures to document the problem, closed the bag, wrapped it in a couple plastic grocery bags, and stuck it in the freezer.<br /><br />The following morning I called Coffee Bean Direct to report the insect infestation. Though the person I spoke to was professional and polite, she was completely disinterested in assisting me. She kept repeating, "You bought the beans from Amazon, you'll have to deal with them to get a replacement or refund." I told her that I wasn't worried about replacement/refund...Amazon is fantastic when it comes to making things right. I just wanted the company who actually imported & packed the product to be aware that they had a serious insect problem. Again she was completely disinterested. Afterward I did call Amazon, and they sent out a replacement immediately. The replacement bag didn't contain any live bugs, but the beans were again so bug-eaten that they are totally unfit for human consumption. Again, Amazon made things right and issued a full refund, then pulled the product from the site so that no one else has to get a bag full of bugs.<br /><br />I have contacted the USDA, the FDA, and the local health department for Stockton, NJ, where Coffee Bean Direct is located. The gentleman at the health department was a bit thrown off by the name of the business, as his department has neither issued a certificate for, nor inspected, a business by that name. Similarly, the FDA stated that they would be seizing imports for this company at it's point of import. They are very concerned that this company's products may be introducing non-native species of insects into the country.<br /><br />CBD is a company to be avoided at all cost. The beans they offer for sale are inferior quality beans, and not subject to even a minimum of quality control. And they do not stand behind their product. Who could blame them, really?

The whole point of purchasing green and roasting your own is to achieve real freshness in coffee. I will never purchase coffee again on Amazon. When I attempted to return (which was most of the product minus 2 cups) I was told that was not possible.

review/summary: Pretty good beans for the price
review/text: This is a good bean for a commercial bean, I will always try to buy from this vendor for my personal stock.  Coffee Diret's beans are always fairly well cleaned and sorted, not a lot of trash and the bag always weighs a couple ounces over.  It roasts up very well, I go a little into second crack and it doesn't get that burnt flavor.  Do let them cure a day after roasting or you'll get that peculiar grassy kind of aftertaste.  If you order the sampler from them and the cups are broken (mine were), just call Coffee Direct and they'll send you more.  They are very friendly and responsive to the customer's needs.<br /><br />Check Sweet Maria's out of Oakland, CA for some other Sumatra varieties, a little more pricey but still well within reason considering the higher quaility. I buy their beans to change things up a bit, keeping the Mendheling as my primary stock.<br /><br />Oh yeah, coffee comes from third world nations so you're gonna find a bug or a rock every great once in a while.  Just kill the bug, pluck out the rock or whatever needs to be done and try not to have a meltdown over it.  You can bet the big companies that sell ground coffee don't bother with picking the bug out, I'm sure that bug gets roasted and ground up becoming part of the end product.  Things are better now than they used to be, I haven't found any nasties in my beans in about ten years, used to be every other bag!  By roasting your own coffee you're taking control of what's actually in the coffee and making it just the way you want it, good for you!  I hope this was helpful!

Excellent idea if you entertain during the holliday season. Brings the flavor of Spain to your kitchen.

review/summary: Great but no holder
review/text: Hi,<br /><br />The ham is good. It arrived wrapped in plastic sous-vide in a box delivered by UPS. That went great.<br />It's really good.<br />Not as hard to cut as I was concerned.<br />BUT the picture is deceiving : there is no ham holder included. You need to buy it separately for about $60 or so.<br />Also note that , apparently due to US regulation, the hoof has to be cut of before shipping.
