review/summary: Every can was damaged - what are they trying to pull
review/text: Our dog loves this dog food. But, after my experience with ordering this product online through Amazon the dog may not get it again, as I am not only upset with Amazon for allowing it, but also the manufacturer who passes on their damaged cans to the public through an online site.  I ordered a case of this product and every can in the shipment has large dents in the can.  And because of the location of the dents, on the inside cans, in the packaging, you can tell it wasn't damage done during shipping.  These cans we packed that way. Never again will I order anything like this online.  It has actually soured me on using Amazon.

review/summary: This is good stuff.
review/text: First and foremost, all foods won't work for every dog, your mileage may vary.<br /><br />That being said, I bought a few cans of Wellness Just For Puppy and it's been the best purchase I've made since acquiring a malnourished 6 week old puppy. She's putting weight on at a good pace and her coat is looking wonderful.<br /><br />Let's face it, all the filler and things they put into much of the pet food available is no better than us eating Big Macs every day. It's food, we'll survive on it... but it's not the best we can have.<br /><br />Wellness Just For Puppy is a much better choice than a lot of other foods, try it out, it's your choice!<br /><br />Happy eating!

review/summary: smells like actual food
review/text: Wow. I just got a yorkie puppy, 10 weeks at the time of coming home. Breeder sent me home with mighty dog canned food. Worst smelling product I have encountered, my house and puppy stunk. I know dogs are not human, but a product that has that scent cannot possibly be good for the dog. I went to petco and got some supplies including wellness puppy treats. He loved them so much I decided to quickly switch to this dog food. No transition just fed it to him, he loves it, eats more, and has absolutely no problems. I am happy with the ingredient list. Highly recommend. Also when I first opened this I was pleasantly surprised to see actual pieces of vegetables in the can, plus it smelled kind of like tuna, much much better then the horrible smelling mystery paste before.

review/text: I got a pekingnese puppy from a friend and we started feeding her science diet puppy food, we started to notice it looked like she was having some type of seizure, here legs would go in different directions and she appeared to be drunk, my husband noticed that she behaved this way after we fed her the puppy food.  I went to the store and found Wellness Puppy food, we gave it to our puppy and she did well with it.  It was a little costly so I looked for a  better price online and I have been getting it online ever since.  Our puppy is now 7 months old and is doing well.

review/text: Well, when we got our dog Valentine as a Valentine's Day Surprise, the next day we rushed to PETCO and they told us that a healthy food would be Wellness and Blue. We got Blue dry food and Wellness canned food. Our dog ate Wellness for a month and a half, and them she didn't really want to eat it anymore, sniff and walk away. The same thing happened with Wellness treats. If your dog would eat anything I would recommend this, but if your dog is a picky eater, you should have other foods as a back up option. We ended up giving the food and treats to our neighbor and owner of Valentine's brother, and that dog will eat ANYTHING, so at least the food didn't go to waste.

review/summary: dogs LOVE this food
review/text: My dogs eat the Merrick canned food with Fromm dry.  They can be picky with the different flavors, not really liking the flavors that are venison or trout or buffalo, etc.  My fancy local pet store that i was buying their food at has a nice selection of Merrick wet food but never carried cheeseburger and fries.  When i saw this flavor i had to buy it and i am glad i did.  I just received my second case today and my doggies LOVE it. Other favorites of theirs are wingalings, smothered chicken, bruts and tots, campfire delight, grammy pot pie, turducken, cowboy cookout, and ballpark bonanza.  I like supporting my local independent pet store, but amazon saves me about 50 cents a can with our almost 10 percent sales tax rate, so i buy their favs here by the case and supplement at the pet store with the flavors amazon doesnt carry as well as continue to buy the fromm dry there because they are cheaper.

A simple scoop of vanilla ice cream is transformed by the inclusion of a butter crisp. I also love them with tea...or straight out of the box.  Don't be daunted by purchasing a pack of 12 boxes.  The cost is a little over half of what I paid in the store.  Lastly, unless you hide them in a dark corner of your pantry, you'll never have to worry about the shelf life, because they will be consumed quickly by family, friends, and yourself!

They cost a lot more locally and are very fragile, so bringing them from France always leaves me with a box of very delicious crumbs. These came well-packed and (mostly) whole, so they are suitable for company. 12 boxes may seem like a lot, but they go very fast. Highly recommended.

Remind me a bit of a graham cracker.  You can also eat a bunch as one serving, which is always a plus.  I also wondered when I opened the box how I would ever eat that amount of cookies, but now I'm pretty sure it's not going to be enough.  They did arrive broken somewhat even though Amazon put in extra packaging air bags. Doesn't change the taste, so I don't care.

review/text: I have purchased a carton containing 12 boxes.<br /><br />At least half the boxes had a few crumbled thins in them and 2 of them had the taste of rancid butter.<br /><br />The rest were up to my expectations; but, overall I was disappointed.

review/summary: So Simple, So Fantastic
review/text: Sugar, butter and eggs are three staples of almost every kitchen.  Who knew that these three ingredients could combine in such a way to produce Jules Destrooper's wonderful butter crisps?<br /><br />I actually learned about butter crisps from my wife's aunt who makes them each year at Christmas.  She always gives us a lot of them and I always eat way more than I should.  I love these treats and they have become a highlight of Christmas for me.<br /><br />The other day I was walking through a local store and happened upon these Jules Destrooper Butter Crisps and immediately grabbed a box.  While they aren't quite as good as the homemade ones of my wife's aunt, they come in at an extremely close second place.<br /><br />Homemade always beats the store bought brand in my opinion, but Jules Destrooper will now get me through the year until December rolls around.  If you enjoy a lightly sweetened, terribly addictive treat, I highly recommend Jules Destrooper's butter crisps.  They are a great snack any time of year and are the perfect compliment to ice cream, coffee or all by themselves.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Greatest Cookies EVER
review/text: They are crisp, buttery yet light.<br /><br />Unlike some other cookies, they even taste great when they are broken into smaller pieces (as shipping by Belgium is liable to do sometimes).<br /><br />The only downside is they are addicting - there are about 24 wafers per box and before you know, it's time to order another 12-pack :-)<br /><br />Yes, it seems like a lot but if you need to remove temptation - these make great gifts. As you can see, the boxes are classy and in most gourmet stores, EACH box can sell for nearly $6! ... so you will also seem a genuine benefactor :-)<br /><br />The only thing wrong with these cookies is that Amazon makes it too easy to obtain :-)

review/text: i have loved this product for years, and when I saw them on sale at Amazon, I jumped and placed an order.  It si very rare for Amazon to mess something up, but they did this time.  Their shipping method reduced the cookies to shards and crumbs.  You could never serve them in that condition.  But they make a fantastic crust.<br /><br />Lets face it, on this one item, Amazon completely dropped the ball on shipping.

review/text: I know that product because I was raised in Belgium.<br /><br />I send Jules Destrooper to my adopted soldier and he loved the waffles more than<br />the thins.  But he nevertheless liked the thins more than expected.<br />His buddies liked them too and I doubt any package is left.<br /><br />Not everyone likes this specific taste (spekuloos is made with cinnamon)<br /><br />Personally I love Jules Destrooper tiny waffles best.  All is excellent tho.<br />highest quality.  Delacre is also excellent.  Lotus is less good. too much sugar.<br /><br />A favourite brand that develops taste without making you feel saturated with fat.

Although it isn't an issue to me because my family and I just eat them plain; it may be for some who serve it with a parfait and want excellent presentation or something like that. But that was just my experience. Will be purchasing more most likely when we run out.

review/summary: Elegant cookies of excellent quality
review/text: All of the Jules Destrooper cookies are made in Belgium with good quality ingredients and packaged well.  They are quite attractive and whenever I serve them to someone who has never had them before, they always comment on them.<br /><br />The thins are especially elegant, thin and crisp, wonderful with ice cream or a warm beverage.  My only complaint about Jules Destrooper cookies is that it is very difficult not to eat a whole box at once.  Whenever I see them at the dollar store, I stock up and try to hide a few boxes in the top cabinet.<br /><br />Ginger Thins - These have plenty of nice chewy little bits of translucent candied ginger (5%) that contrast with the almost brittle cookie and have a good balance of spice (ginger and a hint of cinnamon) to sweet.  These are wonderful with tea.<br /><br />Almond Thins - Crispy with lots of almond slivers and slices (10%) and a pronounced flavor of both brown sugar and butter.  I appreciate that they aren't loaded up with almond extract, making the taste more delicate in than the usual almond cookie.  Especially good with ice cream, cr&egrave;me br�l&eacute;e, or any custard-based dessert.<br /><br />Butter Crisps - These are also nice and crunchy but with a more neutral flavor, very buttery, similar to an ice cream cone.  They are excellent with a thin smear of jam and hot chocolate or with ice cream.<br /><br />Paris Butter Waffles - These are not quite as brittle or elegant as the others but because of the deep waffle pattern, they are the perfect vehicle for hazelnut chocolate spread (Nutella) or speculoos spread (Biscoff spread) and a cup of coffee.  This variety does have artificial vanilla, which is actually preferred by many for baking cookies.

review/summary: My new found favorite.
review/text: These cookies are delicious. I first tasted them when a box came in a Mother's Day gift basket.  When the last crumb had vanished, I searched for more on Amazon and, sure enough, my favorite shopping spot came through.  This crunchy, buttery waffle cookie is a terrific addition to a bowl of Blue Bell (yes, I'm a loyal Texan) ice cream or a good cup of tea or coffee. We even eat them with a cup of yogurt or kefir as a light evening meal.  You'll find your own favorite situations for this tasty treat.  The only thing I would change is the packaging.  Each thin box holds only 8 cookies, although each cookie is about 1 1/2 x 3 inches, so one cookie is plenty to eat in most cases.  Also on the positive side, the small packaging ensures that the crispiness lasts after the box is opened. I should add, the cookies are in two plastic nests of four cookies inside a foil package inside the cardboard box, so a good clamp keeps the opened cookies crisp and whole. Bon apetit!

review/summary: Awesome and addicting
review/text: Wonderful flavor and crunch. I especially enjoy them with my tea. The ingredients are natural, and since I don't remember seeing the ingredient list with the product information I'll give it here: wheat flour, brown sugar, butter, almonds(10%), salt, leavening:sodium bicarbonate. I use to buy these at my grocery, but only if they were on sale. Amazon's price beats the sale price, so Amazon is a very good bargain. Knowing how thin the cookie is I was concerned about the shipping breaking the cookies, but frankly the product shipped from Amazon was in better condition than the grocery version. These truly are wonderful, but beware that once you've opened a box it's very hard to stop at a single serving (8 cookies). There are about 30 cookies per box, and I confess, I've eaten an entire box in a day. If you like the flavor combination of brown sugar, butter, and almonds then you will really like these cookies.

review/summary: The Swedish Chef Would Be Proud!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of all things swedish, from Lingonberries to salt cod to Lutefisk to those yummy red candy fish. When I saw that Jules Destrooper had invented yet another Swedish delectable, I could not wait for my package to arrive!<br /><br />After assaulting the UPS driver and absconding with my "butter waffles" (which are more like cookies), I went into my kitchen and sat down in my breakfast nook to eat them. A hearty glass of milk was all I needed to drench the entire box and consume it. In reality, I ended up saturating the cardboard box and must have eaten that as well, because when I was done there was nothing left save for some soggy nuggets stuck to my ceiling. I assume they are from my delicious waffles and not from my earlier experiment of stuffing a cornish game hen with popping corn to "make its own stuffing." I am still picking bits of hen from my bushy, inappropriately dark eyebrows.<br /><br />Also, some recipe ideas for these waffles include topping them with olives, tuna salad, anchovy and pretzel (an old Slavic favorite) and peanut butter. Sometimes I give these to the neighbor children when they behave themselves, and actually I have only given one out to one neighbor child. My neighbor's kids are usually misbehaving and absolutely do not deserve any of my tasty cookies! Anyway, it turns out the one kid I gave it to was actually a lawn jockey statue, which makes sense because my neighbors, the "Davenports," have very light skin. They are actually quite pasty and I am waiting for the day when one of them develops melanoma, because they are always out in the sun, in their pool, having a "heck of a time," under the sun's deadly rays, oblivious to the cellular damage they are inflicting on themselves. I prefer to stay inside during the daytime and nighttime hours, usually venturing from my house every fortnight to collect my mail. However, when I know a delivery of Jules Destrooper Butter waffles are arriving, I am on "high alert" and spring from my rascal mobility scooter whenever I hear a car door close.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE these waffles. Buy them, and If you don't love them too, send them off to me!!!

review/text: I am always on the look out for soy free food and when I found this at my grocery store I literally screamed with excitement.  Truthfully these aren't as good as saltine crackers, but hey, they're made with better ingredients and soy free.  I ordered these from amazon and I'm very disappointed with how they held up in shipping.  I generally end up with about 15 whole crackers and the rest ranges from 3/4 of the cracker to a crumb per box.  I can't recommend getting these delivered to your door unless your area doesn't have them stocked at the grocery store.

review/summary: Awesome! Late July Organic Saltines 6 oz.
review/text: I went looking for a saltine cracker specifically because the typical commercial brands are very salty, and they contain nitrates.  My hands, fingers, and toes tighten and swell when I eat them.<br /><br />I found these outstanding saltines in the Green-Wise section of the Publix for $2.49 per 6 oz. box.  They are certified organic by the USDA.<br /><br />The crackers contain organic wheat flour, organic palm oil, organic oleic safflower oil & sea salt, organic evaporated cane juice, leavening (baking soda, cream of tartar), yeast, & enzymes.<br /><br />Just like the label says, they are crispy, old-fashioned soda crackers with no synthetic pesticides, or artificial ingredients.  The packing is so unassuming, but the product is superior.<br /><br />The flavor is just like saltines I enjoyed as a child.  I love to eat them with cheese & homemade salmon spread.  I cannot wait to try their other products.<br /><br />I rate these crackers 5/5 for taste, texture, size, freshness, & appearance, and I rate them 5/5 for cost and affordability.<br /><br />Each 6 oz. box contains 12 (4 crackers) servings, 2.5 g fat per serving, 120 mg sodium, 10 g carbs, 0 g sugar, 1 protein, & 60 cal. per serving.<br /><br />They are so delicious and wholesome, you'll have trouble putting them down--so don't eat out of the box.  Get a saucer instead or you'll go through the box without realizing it--all gone.

review/summary: Great buttery cracker
review/text: These crackers are buttery without leaving that greasy mouthfeel.  They seem more like Ritz than saltines, but I was expecting that from reading the other reviews.<br /><br />They are packaged loose in boxes (not in rows), but I didn't have any problems with excessive cracker crumbling during shipping.  Most of the crackers in each box are whole with a normal amount of crumbs at the bottom of the box (similar to what I'd expect if I picked them up in the store).<br /><br />I just wish I could order a half case!

review/text: These are the best saltines ever! We use them in everything and put everything on them. I buy them locally for 1.89-2.50 a box and usually stock up when 1.89 a box. Their other items are great too. Very low allegiant even when made near others it still doesn't effect mine. So it shows you how well made and clean they are. Plus organic.<br /><br />I want to say they are also iodine salt free and kosher friendly? Cant find info to confirm it. But check a box at the local market I think they are.

review/summary: Bragg brand is very good
review/text: I have been a big believer in Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar with Mother for acid reflux.  While ordering more vinegar I decided to try a bottle of their Olive Oil and it is very good and at a very good price for organic Olive Oil.  The packing was amazing, I think you could have dropped the box off the top of a building and the bottle would be protected.  It took me quite awhile to get the tons of bubble wrap off the bottle.  But then again, it's a good thing, you don't want a broken bottle of Olive Oil.

review/summary: Makes delicious gluten free tortillas
review/text: I use this to make great tasting homemade tortillas. Simply add some hot water to it and a little salt and leave it sit for an hour covered after mixing. Roll into 2 inch balls and then use a tortilla press (or rolling pin if you are brave and patient) and voile, you have gluten free tortillas ready to hit the hot skillet. I've also been making baked "chips" by cutting a tortilla in 8 and baking it at 450 for 6 - 8 minutes. This is a great solution if you are looking for no oil corn chips but cannot find them.

review/summary: Makes killer tamales!!
review/text: I purchased Bob's Red Mill Golden Masa a few months ago, but I have been using it often since then.  I made a ton of tamales for Christmas and New Years and they turned out unbelievable.  The corn taste is awesome.  I also made corn tortillas with it for the first time and they turned out perfect.  The recipe on the bag for the corn tortillas works so well.  Just remember to let the dough set covered for at least an hour before using.  Also, it helps to add a little bit of baking soda for some lift.

The only suggestion is they could add a little more of the bbq flavoring, that would move them up to the top 5 category and at this price they can't be beat.

review/text: I am not familiar with Roganjosh; I bought this spice because it was less expensive than the Curry powder of the same brand (both featured in Amazon's Add-on program) and the ingredients sounded similar.  It arrived cocooned in so many layers of bubble wrap that I couldn't even see the spice bottle.  All that bubble wrap must have been for show though, because the plastic cap on the bottle was cracked wide open AND there was no safety seal.  I threw it out.

review/summary: No Acai BERRIES ! very misleading label - not healthy
review/text: Notice it doesnt say Acai BERRIES?<br /><br />That's because the interior of the candies are actually just a berry flavored gelatin - like the inside of a jelly bean. So these are just chocolate covered jellybeans, not real chocolate covered berries. Ingredients are fruit juice and fructose. Frankly it tastes like the main flavoring ingredient is sugar and cheap grape/apple juice to me. You cant even taste Acai.<br /><br />This product is intentionally trying to ride the healthy berries and chocolate bandwagon.<br />Yet it is full of unhealthy ingredients unlike what it label shows.<br />So this is NOT a healthy snack like they are trying to portray.<br /><br />If chocolate jelly beans are what you want thats fine, just be aware that the label is very misleading IMHO.

review/summary: Chocolate Covered Mystery
review/text: The bag describes these as "Dark Chocolate Acai with Blueberry".  So, I bought these thinking I was getting a dried acai berry or blueberry covered with dark chocolate.  After a closer reading of the front of the bag as well as the ingredient list, the thing that is covered with chocolate is described as a "fruit juice piece".  The ingredient list names several fruit juice concentrates in addition to acai and blueberry.  I've heard of "dried fruit pieces" and I've heard of "fruit juice", but what is a "fruit juice piece"?  I didn't know you could have a piece of juice!  It seems like all of Brookside's products contain the mystery "fruit juice pieces".  What exactly is covered with dark chocolate?

review/text: My husband got these for me for Christmas because I asked for chocolate covered blueberries from a local chocolatier.  I was a bit hesitant that these would be as good as the local candy store, but they are very good.  I don't really know what acai tastes like, but with the blueberry and acai flavors together it gives a sweet-tart taste wrapped in dark chocolate.  These are very delicious.  I'm not giving up the the chocolate covered blueberries locally, but these are definitely worth trying and I would purchase these again.

I bought a bag of BROOKSIDE DARK CHOCOLATE ACAI BLUEBERRY at my neighborhood COSCO for the excellent price of $9.59. My family and I gobbled them down as fast as we could and went back for more! Go get some and you can too! Check your own store in-person or on-line for prices and availability. This is a delicious product!<br />True they do not have blueberry's inside them. Uh...so what? Hopefully you won't make a meal of them. Think snack. Put them on ice cream, in pancakes, in a trail mix or eat them plain. Think, outside-the-box or bag in this case! These little treasures are fun to eat, taste good and are good for you! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039OVW74">Brookside Dark Chocolate Acai with Blueberry 2 Pounds Resealable Bag [Misc.</a>] are great!
