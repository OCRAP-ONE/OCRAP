review/summary: Mainly Sugar (#1 ingredient)
review/text: I was really excited about this tea, because I grew up drinking spicy chai at home. After reading the wonderful feedback I did not hesitate one bit to buy this. This tea is very sweet. The sugar in it takes over the spices. If that is something that you look for in spice tea then this will probably be a tea for you. I expected something that packed more punch.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: This spiced tea mix is absolutely fabulous. I like to just open the can and smell it. My kids love it, too. The blend of spices is perfect. It has a little caffeine kick (so do beware of that if you give it to your kids).They no longer sell it at my local Sam's Club, and so I have resorted to getting it on line. Well worth the price because once you love something, you're willing to pay extra to have it on hand.

review/summary: beware it is so good its addicting
review/text: although it is a powdered mix you have great control in the amount of flavor you put in your cup. If you put the 3 recommended tablespoons in your mug with hot water then it tastes similar to Dunkin Donuts chai with copious amounts of sugar.  But with one tablespoon it tastes like the result of using an actual tea bag with a pinch of sugar. So this product really can appease everyone; beware if your not careful this tea will become addicting.<br /><br />F.Y.I.  For some reason at the Sams Club in Bangor, ME and only Bangor this 2 lb tea canister is sold for $7.00

The balance, craftsmanship, and consistency from bottle to bottle is amazing. Many Americans have no idea this distillery exists, but those who are in-the-know understand the brilliance and elegance of this expression. Too pricey for you? Try the 12 YO, it is magnificent and usually a third the price.

review/summary: Outstanding.  Low Allergen
review/text: I love this cat food!  I currently have four cats, two of which have food allergy issues.  As if that wasn't bad enough, 3/4 of them are finicky about dry cat foods!  I settled on this brand after trying so many others (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL2IC">AvoDerm Natural Chicken and Herring Meal Formula Adult Dry Cat Food (18-lb bag)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000633ZI0">Natural Balance Original Ultra Premium Dry Cat Food (15-lb bag)</a> among others).  This was the first one that not only did my cats love the taste of, but I saw a noticable change in my female cat who has the worst of the skin/digestive allergy issues.  My male cat also showed improvement in his coat and skin.  I mix this with another wellness product <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BOVE54">Wellness CORE Original Cat Food, 12 lbs.</a> and they're pretty happy cats!  I also use the Wellness puppy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002I0GXG">Wellness Just For Puppy Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag)</a> for our Vizsla and she loves it!  I will be sticking with this brand!

review/summary: So far so great!
review/text: When I brought home my Linney a couple of weeks ago, the shelter sent her home with a brand new bag of Science Diet, which all the cats at the shelter had been living on. I've been reading a lot about cat nutrition lately, and I ultimately plan on changing her to 100% wet food, no dry. I wanted to keep her on a pretty normal feeding routine for the first month or so, however, since she is going through so many changes already. I knew I wanted to get her off Science Diet (corn and animal by-products? And they are vet recommended?!?) ASAP, so after some research I thought Wellness Dry would be the best choice to at least get her off the crap food and on the way to a natural diet, while giving her as little stress as possible.<br /><br />I transitioned slowly, adding 25% more Wellness each night until she was transferred.  There were no issues with getting her to eat it, she loves the taste and transitioned very easily. She's been on 100% Wellness for about four days now, and already I am seeing an incredible difference in her overall appearance. I honestly thought I wouldn't see that big a change, as she never really had any issues. Her condition now, such a short time after switching, is amazing. Her coat, beautiful to begin with, is incredible. It's so unbelievably soft, like the softest ermine. Her eyes are brighter. She hardly sheds at all, has stopped itching as much, and she actually seems calmer and has a better night-time routine than before. I'm being humble when I say she was quite flawless before, but this diet has turned her into something extraordinary.<br /><br />Just by looking at the two you can see how superior Wellness is to Science Diet. The biggest observation is the fact that there is no coating of oily fat on the Wellness food, unlike on the Science Diet. 'Junk' brands spray their kibble with a fatty coating, which makes the food irresistible to the cat, and also adds a lot of problems, namely overeating and obesity. There is no such spray on the Wellness, and Linney loves it just as much, I am very pleased to say.<br /><br />I am going to be taking her off this food eventually, as odd as it seems to say after such a rave review. From what I have gathered, a wet diet is the best thing for a cat and it is what I intend to do. Still, I don't think I could have found a better transition diet for her, and I couldn't be happier, and neither could Linney, for that matter.

review/summary: Real food for your cats!
review/text: If you want to feed your cats the best food you can find then this is it.  All you have to do is look at the ingredients.  Wellness is made with de-boned chicken!  Cats need their diet to consist mostly of protein.  If you look at the crap that's in other brands you see a lot of grains or even worse.  In some of the so called healthy cat foods you'll see only chicken meal top the list, but that's just not good enough.  Chicken meal (meat, bones, skin, and byproducts) is fine for dogs, but a cat's digestive system is more sensitive.<br />My cats are in great shape, and super healthy.  They love the taste too.  If only they made my food this way!  Well, I guess we always have tofu and celery.  Yum.

review/summary: Did we get a bad batch?
review/text: My cats will eat anything - and I mean anything - probably because of the time they spent in the local shelter before I adopted them.  However, even though they will eat anything, I invest in the best food I can find.  I started out with Science Diet, then moved to Blue Buffalo varieties.  I was happy with both of those, but I saw the Wellness Indoor Dry Cat Food recently and thought I would give it a try. I followed the same transition process I always do with new food, mixing a bit of new with the current. Because both of my cats are so easy-going, it only takes a few days to transition, and the only reason I follow this is to prevent any upset stomachs.  My cats would be happy to jump right in with new food.  I expected nothing different with the new $35 bag of Wellness.  How wrong I was. For whatever reason, neither of my cats will touch this stuff. They ate around it when I had it mixed in with their other food. Once I started filling their bowls exclusively with this Wellness food, both of them stopped eating altogether. I carried the bowls to them, and both of them turned their faces away quickly and ran off.  I really don't understand what it is about this particular food that caused such a negative reaction.  The ingredient list appears fine, and I certainly paid a premium for this bag of food - which I will now have to throw out.  I thought about giving it to the local shelter, but if my former shelter cats hate it, then I don't want to pass it off on some other cats, especially if I happened to get a bad batch.  After another day of the cats refusing to eat, I headed out to 7-Eleven late at night to buy a little box of whatever cat food they had on hand.  I brought home a small $2 box of Friskies, and my cats ate it up immediately.  I don't plan to continue with Friskies, but the fact that my cats went nuts for Friskies (out of hunger, sure, but they had never eaten Friskies in my home before), just confirmed my decision to throw out the Wellness.  I cannot afford to ever buy this product again and I certainly cannot recommend it.

review/text: I left a comment on another review commiserating about our picky cats. My cat won't eat this stuff, and he doesn't care how good for him it is. The reason I still give this food five stars is really because of the company. I emailed the company from their website asking for samples of all their different foods so that I can find one which my cat will eat. They responded promptly, and within a few days I had samples of all of the different types of food that they have. Turns out my cat is more of a high protein kind of guy.

review/summary: A good substitute for real tea when the real item is not available
review/text: The Green Energy Tea Fusion tea powder allows you to make instant ice green tea wherever you happen to be. All it takes is to fill a bottle with a few ounces of cold water and shake. The end product is a green tea that's honey-lemony tasting, low-calorie and, the maker claims, is made of mostly organic ingredients.<br /><br />Each packet has enough powder to make an okay-tasting 8-16 oz. amount of cool green tea. All you need to do is start with a bottle of cold water, take a sip or 2 to make some room for the shaking that's to follow, drop the powder in, then shake the bottle and... here's your cool green tea. It tastes the way you would expect iced green tea to taste when spiked with a little bit of lemon and honey. The taste, when 16 oz. of water are used is comparable to the gallon-size 'green diet ice tea' containers you could buy from some grocery stores only a little more diluted. When used with only 8 oz. it begins to taste like serious tea but than you'd want a second packet. The powder tea packets give you the ability to make instant green ice tea wherever you are and whenever you feel like without having to carry along a gallon-size canister. In addition, the makers claim that the caffeine and the EGCG (100mg) from one packet are sufficient to 'boost' your metabolism if taken three times daily.<br /><br />As far as contents, the main ingredients listed are: organic Japanese green tea extract, organic Yerba Mat&eacute; extract, organic Guava seeds extract, organic Aloe Vera extract, organic honey crystals and some others.<br /><br />The powder has 23 calories but none of them came from saturated fats or trans fats and none of the sweet taste comes from sugar because no sugar was added.<br /><br />I enjoy drinking this when no better options are available - such as the ability to make 'real' brewed green or, better, white tea. I do not see it as a regular substitute to 'real' tea. Since the product does meet my expectations - produce a reasonably decent drink when nothing better can be had, it gets it's 5 stars and my endorsement (for emergencies only) because I can't think of much that could be done to make it better.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />EGCG also known as Epigallocatechin 3-gallate is a powerful anti-oxidant that can be found in green tea but not in black tea.

review/text: These are the best Cucumbers I have ever grown! I planted some last season and they really are "Sweet Success". They are the easiest seeds to start and grow like crazy. Keep them off the ground on some type of trellis or tomato cage and you will get cucumbers that average 2 to 3 lbs each. No kidding, these cucumbers were as big as the Zucchini we grew! They grow to be huge and can be between 12 to 16 inches long. They never turned bitter and we couldn't eat or give them away fast enough. There growing season was long here in So. California. I planted in the ground in April and picked the last cucubers on Christmas day. They were still delicious...<br /><br />I had some seeds left over from last season and they sprouted in just a few days.<br /><br />I will buy these again as soon as I see them available.

With a little Ragu sauce or a package pesto mix, and some peas or broccoli on the side, it's a decent meal that's ready in 20 minutes.<br /><br />I bought these Tortellini because they came in a 16 ounce box.  I hadn't tried the La Piana brand before, but I am pleased with it.  The tortellini cook up al dente in 12-15 minutes, and the large box makes enough for everyone.  I ordered the cheese filling but they also come in eggplant/zucchini, squash, and potato/pecorino fillings.<br /><br />With free SuperSaver shipping on orders over $25, this is a good buy.  I will be ordering more.

review/text: Each year we buy several pounds of Jordan almonds for use in our museum Christmas display. They make very attractive candy trees, which always garner compliments from our visitors. This season's order arrived quickly. The price is fair and the quality outstanding - no broken candies. I see that this company is no longer selling this product, and hope that's a temporary situation.

review/text: My 10 month old took one bite made a face and refused the rest. She eats anything. I tried it and so did my husband. It tasted like potting soil and has a very bitter after taste. I feel like some of the veggies are not cooked long enough and thats why its bitter.

review/summary: They call this baby food!?!?
review/text: My 1 year old will eat anything...well that was until I gave him Happybaby Gobble Gobble. Immediately when I opened the package I was turned off by it. It looked and smelled awful...this does not look like tastey baby food at all. Against my better judgement, I still let my son try it. The first bite he choked and gagged. I thought, "ok, it's just too thick". So I thinned it out with a bit of formula and tried again. Second bite he spit it out and tried to scrape off what was left on his tongue with his fingers! My son is NOT a picky eater by any means and loves food in general, so I knew this MUST be awful if he wouldn't eat it. Rather than torture my kid, I threw the rest out. Thankfully I had only purchased two pouches at the store before commiting to a pack of 16 on Amazon. If only I had read the reviews first!<br /><br />Bottom line, don't torture your kid with this OR waste your money!

review/summary: It's just ok
review/text: My baby is a wonderful eater and has loved all of the variety I've given him until this food. He tried it and vomited instantly. I tried the next day and just let him smell it and he vomited again - lol. I tried it too and it was not tasty to me at all. I had two of these packs left so I waited a couple of weeks to try again. He liked it that time. Anyway, don't give up and keep trying because they just may like it after a few tries (or even 15 tries). It's a healthy meal.

review/summary: Watery, flavorless, sour
review/text: Agree with the reviewers who pointed out this is too watery, acidic, and tomatoe-y. It doesn't taste like beef at all. It's a little sweet from the tomato, not in a good way. I think it's a problem with all Happy Baby foods I've tried--they are all sweet, maybe to appeal to baby's tastes. This works well for the fruits and veggies, but not so much for the meat and chicken. I want my baby to eat savory food too! The texture was not appealing--very mushy with some quinoa globs. Again, where's the meat? I guess I'll stick with the fruit pouches, and make my own baby meats, which my girl loves.

review/summary: My baby and my cat won't eat this!
review/text: We had ordered some of these pouches after trying some other Happy Baby products that my baby loved. These had very little flavor and my baby tried a couple bites and then started to fight me. She even gagged in the process. Bummed that I had ordered a whole box, we tried again to no avail. Next, we  tried to feed it to the cat because she seemed interested when I opened the pouches. My cat won't even eat it. I recommend getting a small quantity to see if your baby likes it before ordering a whole box.

review/summary: Wonderful Beef Stew by Happy Family
review/text: This Beef Stew is fantastic!  It actually tastes like beef stew, no artificial flavorings or colors.  Everything in it is organic and there is quinoa too.  Babies need to be able to taste what real food tastes like.  This product delivers!  All of the other baby beef stews taste like a mystery and loaded with extra "stuff" that babies do not need.  It has great portable packaging for moms on the go.  Great price too!

review/summary: Just Love this Combo!
review/text: One of the things I just love about HAPPYBABY organic baby food is the unique combination of ingredients they offer.  I mean, how many companies utilize quinoa as the primary grain in their baby food?  I love that HAPPYBABY thinks outside the box to come up with an innovative mix of super healthy foods for our babies.  The bananas, black beans and rice work well together, both in taste and texture, and I know this is one meal my baby will gobble down every time.  Did I mention how much I love the portability of these pouches?!  I only wish they had been around when my older daughter was a baby!

review/summary: dried texture and crappy blend for baby food
review/text: I have tried many different flavors from many different brands and by far, this particular flavor from Happy Baby is the worst texture and taste that I ever bought for my baby.  My baby just doesn't like it.  I let her try it three times and she just hates the texture and the taste.  I don't why they made the food so dry to begin with.  Turkey itself gives a little dried texture compared to chicken and they should have taken that into consideration.  And the food is so lumpy and it's not even in good chunky blend either.  In the end it was a total waste of money to buy this product.

review/text: Fish has that all important DHA that helps brain and eye development so I went looking for a baby food with fish. I was so excited to find WILD CAUGHT salmon in a baby food (wild caught salmon does not have the mercury content other fish have)! Plus it has other super foods such as lentils, sweet potatoes, and carrots! But all this goodness is only good if baby will eat it and she gobbled it right up!!

review/text: We bought a 16 pack and have 13 left.  Of the 3 that we tried, she never once finished a single pouch.  I tried it and was really surprised because it is well seasoned with herbs and spices compared to other things she will eat.  It could be the texture - I don't know.  It's a little mushy, like baby food.  Probably would be better with pasta instead of amaranth, although I appreciate the diversity of grains.  Anyway, I love it, she hates it, so 3 stars.

review/summary: So good with an avocado!
review/text: This has been my baby's (now 21 months) favorite since he was 10 months old. He seemed to be bored of it after a couple of months. My husband then was going to claim the rest of pouches as his snacks and started to have it with an Avocado, my son reached for it. So now, we mashed, somewhat, an avocado in the Ratatouille and he would inhale it down in no time! It's also a go-to meal when we are having spicy grown-up food and I'm too lazy to cook him up something else. It also helps him "go" regularly.

review/summary: Try Before You Buy in Bulk
review/text: My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!

review/text: My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes fishy. Salmon is good for baby brain development. I tried to put butter or some seasoning to cover the fishy taste, but my son still does not want to eat it. He like other happy baby product like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either.

review/summary: *Less Sodium than other brands
review/text: My baby loves this salmon combination a lot more than the popular chick chick (which is actually her least favorite). Yes, it does stink... its fish! I don't care for fish myself, smell or taste, but she digs this and its good for her. This brand has a much lower sodium content than plum and sprout and is cheaper on a different website. I make most all of her other foods but am not quite ready to tackle preparing meat so Happy Baby has been great for introducing chicken, fish, beef, and turkey.

review/text: My 18 month old likes them, but he will eat pretty much antying. My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon.

review/summary: yay! NOT SWEET , finally!!
review/text: I love the happy baby and similar brands of organic baby food in pouches, but they have one MAJOR downfall in my eyes- most of the blends are SUPER SWEET. It's difficult to find many pouches with just vegetables, and no super sweet fruits mixed in. I hate the idea of teaching my child that everything MUST taste sweet (spinach, broccoli, peas, etc- they're always mixed with mango, pear, apple, etc- they always just taste like fruit.) I LOVE that he Amaranth Ratatouilli is not sweet at all- it actually tastes like vegetables!! My child loves it. We frequently mix it into other things- pasta, rice, etc. It's great topped with cheese. One bit of warning though- this blend seems pretty acidic, so babies with sensative tummies might have trouble- I would just mix it in smaller portions with pasta or something else.

review/text: Mama Grain and Amaranth Ratatouille from Happy Baby have been long-time favorites since my son was about 10 months old. Even now he is a toddler, he still eats Mama Grain on occasion - it's good to take with us if we're eating out and he's being picky about what's available. It's thick and filling enough to supplement his meal. It has a sweetness from the bananas, obviously, but the black beans and the quinoa grain also help making it more lasting. So full of goodness! I agree the taste seems a little weird at first to us adults, but I actually like that's a different flavor - help to keep his taste buds open to different tastes, hopefully...

She didn't like it the first time, but after a few attempts she enjoys it.  She screams when I try to feed her any other brand of salmon, and so I think this one is worth a try.  If they don't like it, just mix it with something they do like. Great ingredients, great product.

review/text: I really wish my toddler liked this. It seems to be very high quality and it would provide more variety in his diet. Every so often he'll eat it, but it usually needs to be mixed with something else.  I think it tastes fine, but it wasn't a hit. I bought a case so I keep trying.

review/text: My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.  Not all the time, but often.  The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.  He won't eat much when he's in pain, but these are easy on his gums.  They are organic and a quick meal.  My son is strong and a very healthy weight.  I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible.  Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.  He loves the whole line.

review/summary: Happy Salmon Eating Baby
review/text: I was worried about it before I served it to my 12 month old... but after a tentative first session (there is a pretty strong salmon smell, and he seems opposed to strong scents), he's since eaten this package w/o problem, and finishes it every time!  We're pretty pleased with this meal - great texture and I feel good that he's getting some salmon in his diet.  We had one instance of diarrhea after eating this for lunch, but since it only happened once, I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the salmon package, but definitely I keep an eye for now.  It might have been one bad package in the stack... so it's still probably advisable to not serve this if you're going to be away from home :).

review/text: I really like the Happy Baby "Chick Chick" pouches and thought this would be a great way to introduce seafood to our baby. However, the consistency is much different - much thicker than the chicken pouch, and the smell! Well you definitely know it's seafood! It reminds me much too much of cat food.<br /><br />All is not lost - our little guy would eat it, provided I dunked each bite in some pureed sweet potato or squash first. But, I don't think we'll be buying this flavor again.

review/summary: My 18 month old liked it, my 3 year old did not.
review/text: My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein, and try upping the fish. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien, and were salmon.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon.

review/text: I purchased two boxes of this because previously I had purchased Happy Baby Chick Chick and my daughter loved it.  When I opened this pouch up I couldn't believe the smell and texture of the "food".  It smells just like cat food because it's fish.  And the texture is just like canned cat food.  I have two boxes of this that I can't use because my daughter gags as soon as I bring the spoon up to her mouth.  I don't blame her, I'm gagging as soon as I tear the package open.  The nutritional facts are outstanding but they need to make it taste and look better.  The Happy Baby Chick Chick is an actual hearty puree with pieces of chicken and pasta.  This is not even close.

review/text: I got a few different flavors of the HAPPYBABY food and this one in particular causes my daughter to gag and vomit. My daughter does not have a weak stomach by any means and eats a lot of different foods. But for whatever reason when she eats this flavor it comes right back out. After the third try I am giving up and concluding there is something wrong with this item.<br /><br />Even more disappointed that there is no option to return it with Amazon. I did however reach out to HAPPYBABY directly and are working with them to make this purchase a positive experience. For that I have changed my review from 1 stars to 3 stars.<br /><br />For now I will stick with the Chick Chick and Gobble Gobble flavors!

Unfortunately, the recipe has apparently just been updated (though not reflected on Amazon's page as of 2/24/2012) to include totally different ingredients (except for the chicken). Now my daughter absolutely refuses to eat this product. The consistency and flavor seem to have drastically changed. Hopefully your child will enjoy the new blend, but I wanted to provide a warning for those of you that may have tried the other version...

review/summary: Healthy Alternative for Working Moms
review/text: I give props to any mom, especially one that holds down a full time job or two, that can puree and strain her own food.  If that's you, hat's off.  You're my hero.  I'm no superhero, so my goal was to find the best quality, best tasting food with minimal processing.  Let's face it, there are plenty of organic options out there.  And these days, I think most of them are good.  The little man likes the Gerber organics fruits.  They're easy to find and inexpensive.  But hands down, the Happy Baby products are the best quality, best tasting (in my opinion) and most convenient of them all.  The pouches are great, especially for when we're on the go.  We can eat the fruit varieties without even putting on a bib.  The Chick Chick is the man's favorite (bib required).  The negative is that they're about twice the price of the Gerber fruits and meats.  So if you're on a budget, this may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, keep some pouches around for when you travel.  Baby will love them!

review/summary: Does NOT promote healthy growth and development
review/text: I was hoping that the new recipe would include more protein/fat than the original, since in my opinion, the protein/essential fatty acids that are abundant in salmon are the best reasons to feed it to a baby.  Well, I should have taken the time to research the nutritional info before purchasing, because this item actually contains less of both. If you can manage to get your baby to eat an entire pouch of this, he/she will get a mere 1 gram of protein, or 6% of the RDA for a baby, .5 grams of fat, and 50 calories.<br /><br />That makes this a nutrient poor food.  And HappyBaby a pretty despicable company.

review/summary: Don't give up and give it more then one try!
review/text: I gave this flavor to my 6 month old son but he did not like it so I tried to blend it, but still no luck. It does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends. So I mixed the blended beef stew with green beans ( 1,5 oz of beef stew with 3,5oz green beans ) and my baby ate it all no problem. I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br /><br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it.

review/text: What HAPPYBABY needs to realize is that when you have a steady customer base, you should not change the recipe of a product!  My daughter loved this original recipe, but this recipe is COMPLETELY different.  I tried giving it to her 3 times - she refused to eat it.  I then blended it with chicken broth and she does eat it now, so it turned out to be a texture thing.  HOWEVER, the whole reason that I purchase products such as these are for the convenience of having an organic product that can travel easily - so it is very impractical for me to travel with chicken broth and a blender!  I'll be cancelling my subscribe and save subscription to this product.

So I am not where the chicken is cuz you can't taste it. But my daughter absolutely loves it. She gobbles down the whole thing in minutes (except her teething time).<br /><br />Although I am skeptical about the chicken part, I have to trust the labeling that says heavy amount of protein is in there.<br /><br />I also tried the turkey and chicken training meal from Plum brand. It has way too much spice in there. Not for my baby who is just starting out on protein. I will try the Plum brand a bit later. But you can definitely taste the meat in their products.

review/summary: Baby HATES the new recipe!  (Loved the old formulation).
review/text: My 9-month-old absolutely adored the old recipe of this product, which was organic chicken, sweet potatoes, and brown rice pasta.  She would gobble up an entire pouch every time we offered it to her, and often ask for more.  Unfortunately, Happy Baby had to go and ruin a good thing by reformulating the product!  The new Chick Chick recipe consists of organic chicken, vegetables and quinoa, and my baby completely DESPISES it.  We've offered it to her several times now, and each time, she makes a face, spits it out and turns away from the spoon.  I see from several of the recent reviews that many parents and their babies feel the same way about the new recipe.  I can't for the life of me figure out why Happy Baby would change the formulation of its Chick Chick baby food when it was perfectly fine and delicious the way it was.  I definitely won't be buying this product again, unless Happy Baby goes back to the old formulation.  Grade: D-

review/summary: This used to be a good product but the new "recipe" is really bad.
review/text: This used to be a hearty and great meal for my twin girls who have both loved it since they were 9 months old but they recently changed the recipe and it is watery and disgusting now. Very disappointed. And it seems that amazon does not allow you to complain directly to Happy Baby or return the product even though it has changed. seems unfair.

review/summary: ARG!  Recipe has CHANGED!
review/text: My son loved the original recipe Chick Chick but Happy Baby has now changed the recipe.  My son retched upon the first bite of the new meal.  Why do companies try to "improve" upon something that already works.  I'm guessing to cut corners somehow (ie. cheaper ingredients).  It's a shame.  I now have a case of the new recipe that won't be eaten.

review/summary: My baby hates this stuff!!!
review/text: My 10 month old baby hates this stuff!!  I've tried giving it to him on 4 separate occasions-but everytime he tastes it--he makes a disgusted look and won't eat anymore.  I even tried mixing it with his favorite foods and he just takes one bite and looses his appetite and won't eat anymore of anything for the rest of the night!

review/summary: Yummy protein
review/text: I usually buy Sprout and thought I'd try this food since it got other great reviews.<br /><br />I am pleased with this meal.  It's a little less chunky than Sprout's stage 3 meals...so I worried a bit less about my baby gagging on it as he's learning to chew more.<br /><br />Also, the chicken, sweet potato is a big hit with my baby.  He ate it all up!<br /><br />These organic meals are a very nice alternative to making my own food for him.
