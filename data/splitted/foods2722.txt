review/summary: Not orgeat... [UPDATE]
review/text: [Update: Within a day of leaving my initial review I received a call from the company regarding my feedback. Best customer service I've ever experienced, and overall great quality product, just not a traditional orgeat.]<br /><br />I purchased this syrup expecting a normal orgeat syrup. While this is an almond syrup, it does not taste like other orgeat, and does not make nearly as good of a mai tai. It's a good almond syrup, just not what I was expecting.

review/summary: 3.5* snack for a non-chocophile
review/text: It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!

review/summary: The portable and edible Oreo
review/text: One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

review/summary: Flavor in, Calories Down, Fat Nearly Out
review/text: As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack
review/text: We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the "Oreo Biscuit").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the "modern" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for "hill"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the "cream" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: "Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.

With this product, you sacrifice both.<br /><br />It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of "100 calorie" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these.

review/summary: THESE ARE TRUE 'MAINSTREAM' DIET SNACKS --
review/text: FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, "100 calorie packs" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + "ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS" & "ARTIFICIAL COLORS" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.

review/summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review/text: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of "A Star Is Born" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

review/text: I don't usually like really crispy cookies, but the taste of these changed my mind.  I like that you get quite a few for only 100 calories.  I often go for "quantity" over "quality" so I would rather have a few thin crisp cookies than one regular cookie.

review/summary: They're not bad
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I do not like Oreo cookies at all. I think the cookie part is bitter and I hate the white cream filling. When a friend suggested I try these I was reluctant and kept telling her that I was not interested. She insisted so I tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all. I'm diabetic, so this is not a snack I will be eating often, but a few here and there won't hurt. If you're expecting these to taste like Oreo cookies (I'm one who's glad they didn't!!), then you'll be disappointed. But if you want a chocolate snack that's low in calories and fat please give these a try.

review/summary: Fantastic little treats!
review/text: Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the brand extension of Oreo's to cakesters. And while I had low expectations, I must say these are better than normal Oreos. Although I can't say it'll beat the combo of oreos and milk, these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt-free.  If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.<br /><br />The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience. Certainly worth a try - guaranteed enjoyment!

review/summary: Great 100 Calorie Treat!!
review/text: I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving. So, when I saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version, I could hardly wait to try them, and I must say I am very impressed!<br /><br />While some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry, mealy consistency, these cakes are moist, decadent and taste 100% like the originals.....just smaller. I would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version, but is watching calories. Good job Nabisco!

I monitor how much fat I ingest for many reasons, health being the most important.  One package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1/4 of the fat.<br />I also like the fact that they come in individual packages:  They don't go stale;  you can take them on trips, movies, park, etc.<br />Great tea or coffee cookies too!.... and, of course, good old milk.

review/summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review/text: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYEL1A">A Star Is Born</a> the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

review/summary: Oreo flavored crackers without the creme filling
review/text: These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.  The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.<br /><br />The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.  The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, "Humm these are good!"  This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time.

review/text: Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre.

review/summary: Delicious Mini Chocolate Treats Help Weight Loss Efforts!
review/text: I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.

review/text: I love the Frontier soups I  have tried because they aren't salty and the dehydrated ingredients in them absorb liquid well and are tender.  They include recipes to add other items to the soup to personalize it to your taste.  They also make a lot of soup if you have a family to feed.  I find them to be very versatile, easy to cook, and not salty which is often the case with boughten soup mixes.  They have flavor but not overwhelming and you can add your own seasoning if you want.  Just be aware that they will make a lot of soup when it rehydrates so only use part of the bag if you don't want a lot and be sure and use a big enough pan as it will expand as it cooks.

review/text: Move over, jellybean. There's a new kid in town who can pack a complex taste in a deceptively simple-looking candy. Extra's Strawberry Shortcake gum does taste eerily like, well, strawberry shortcake, when first chewed. I can't say it will replace your desire for dessert (there's something to be said for texture and, well, substance, after all), but it is definitely a mouth-pleaser. Even after the shortcake taste is gone, the gum tastes moist and juicy for a long time. I love several other Extra Sugarfree flavors, and I'm adding this to the list.

review/text: Okay, so Extra Sugar Free Dessert Delights Strawberry Shortcake gum doesn't taste at all like fresh strawberry shortcake, but it does taste exactly like Strawberry Shortcake, the doll.<br />It tastes exactly like the dolls smelled. Or, you could say it tastes like a stick of strawberry flavored chapstick melted in your mouth. How can gum taste like wax, you might ask? Well, somehow, it has this weird mouth-coating artificiality that almost exactly recreates the Strawberry Shortcake experience. In this, I am of course referring to the Strawberry Shortcake cartoon that my sister used to watch when we were 9 years old.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this gum, chewing it and imagining myself tearing the strawberry-scented hair from an undeserving brat's sacchirine cheerful little plastic doll, defying the little monster to attempt to stop me. It was a fantastic experience of um, fantasy.<br />I gave some to a coworker, and she loved it, too (but she has pica), and preferred it over the drywall she had been eating for lunch. Apparently, it's also 5 calories, which makes it slightly more fattening than that same wallboard, but less fattening than the chapstick she ate yesterday.<br />If you're on a diet, and have pica, and love Strawberry Shortcake, then this is your new favorite gum. Drop that wad of notebook paper you've been chewing on, and go pick some up.

review/text: I remember those great commercials for Extra, years ago, boasting that the flavor lasted an extra, extra, extra long time! However, this gum is great if you only want to chew it for a short period of time. The strawberry flavor is really good, at first. I find that after only a couple of minutes, the flavor is lost and the gum base is approaching unbearable and I have to get rid of it. Maybe this is the new business model- have the Extra flavor wear out?<br /><br />Also, just FYI, this gum is a softer base, which prevents forming huge bubbles and that "snappiness" found in other chewing gum products.

review/summary: Could be better, could be worse
review/text: I'm dieting, so there's a limit to what I can and can't eat. Unfortunately dessert is usually on the "can't" list. (At least the desserts I want to eat.) This seemed like a pretty good compromise and for the most part, it is.<br /><br />The initial flavor of this is pretty good once you get past the initial eyebrow raising of "strawberry shortcake flavored gum?" aspect. The only downfall is that the flavor doesn't really last all that long and there's a strange chemical aftertaste to it. None of this was bad enough to make me throw the pack away, but I admit that I probably won't buy this particular flavor again.<br /><br />I do, however, recommend the apple pie flavor. It still doesn't last long, but it doesn't have that funky aftertaste.

review/text: This taste more like Hubba-Bubba or an off-brand, kid friendly, gum that shouldn't really be called a desert flavor. It has no taste, what-so-ever, of Shortcake. Instead, there's just artificial strawberry and a bit of tang. It last a while but loses the tangy-ness. Disappointed.

Love using the pods instead of cleaning up all the grounds (I know not a purist but I'm old and lazy) and besides in a Delonghi 155 I think it would be hard to tell the difference. Good value too.

review/text: The answer is:  not really.  All but one of my 4 cats picks around the Wysong kibble, leaving it in the bowl.<br /><br />I love the concept but the kitties aren't sold. Not by one little dry piece of kibble.<br /><br />I have mixed it in with their other foods - and they pick around it.  It's been over 4 weeks and they just won't eat it.<br /><br />The formerly feral kitten who has only been indoors for 4 of her 9 months won't eat it and PURRS when I give her the other dry food.<br /><br />The 7 y.o. cat who thinks broccoli stalk bits and mango and strawberry crowns are food - steals bitter lettuces out of the salad bowl.  Even he won't eat it (though grudgingly with some water added, he'll eat some).<br /><br />The greedy 6 y.o. cat - who growls at the 7 y.o. over broccoli bits and who always hoovers everyone else's food - won't eat it.<br /><br />The geriatric cat who has pretty much eaten everything I have given him in 14 years (he's 19) - won't eat it.<br /><br />Even the ants won't eat it!<br /><br />Is there any cat who eats this and likes it or is it basically kitty prison food?<br /><br />I updated my rating to a single star - great concept but if the cats won't eat it, it's not really worth buying.

review/text: FONTINA VAL D'AOSTA cheese, sold by IGOURMET, is a tasty, raw-milk cheese. It is NOT the most tasty cheese I have ever had, (that place being rserved for Royal Port de Salut cheese, with Royal Havarti cheese being a close second.)  But this fontina val d'aosta cheese IS tasty, especially when allowed to stand out of the refrigerator and on the table for a while.<br /><br />This is a firm cheese, but it cuts easily with a sharp knife.  The (I hope!), edible rind of this cheese has a nice, somewhat smoother flavour, and is of a texture comparable to bread with a very slightly-more-than-normal hardness, but still delicious and edible, nontheless.  The cheese itself has a nice, but very mild flavour, and even though the ingredients do not list "liquid smoke", or anything smoked, in the ingredients, the very faintest of smoky flavour does come through -- at least to me.  It tastes a like very lightly-flavoured Swiss cheese.<br /><br />The ingredients listed for this cheese are simple: Unpasteurized milk, Rennet, Salt.  The salt flavour is NOT apparent in the flavour -- but if you eat enough of this cheese, you will get very thirsty, which is a sure sign of salt in anything!<br /><br />Unpasteurized, (or "raw") milk cheeses might -- if some at the "august and SO very learned" FDA have their way -- become illegal in the USA(!)  Or so I have read on the Internet.  This is the reason I bought this, and another type of unpasteurized cheese.  I've never had unpasteurized cheese before -- so I wanted to sample it before it becomes illegal!  Those "wonderful" fuss-budgets at the Federal Food and Drug Administration, (FDA), seeming are SO concerned about the welfare of the American people, that they fail to notice that unpasteurized cheese....and unpasteurized milk.....when carefully made, under sanitary conditions, does NOT kill anyone!  I can personally attest to drinking (legal!) raw milk....which did not taste differently, as I remember, from pasteurized milk.  Only it's supposed to have more nutrition.  It stands to reason that, if unpasteurized cheese did kill people, much of France, (where Louis Pasteur was born!), and the rest of Europe, would probably be dead by now.  But they aren't!  Will unpasteurized milk and cheese kill only Americans, but not Europeans, then?  Or is this just one more way our "beloved" Federal Government wants to impress their power over the rest of us -- their consituents, who voted these "PUBLIC SERVANTS", of ours, into office.  (Will Rogers said that he wanted to "go down to Washington and see how our HIRED HELP is doing."  And, in all reality, that IS what these "powerful" people really are...!)<br /><br />A few years ago, visiting relatives in Canada, I came upon a packet of "Sweet N Low" artificial sweetener.  Reading on the label that it contained CYCLAMATE, I threw it away -- because, in the USA, cyclamates have not been legal for at least 20 years, and I didn't want to injest anything that old.  Then I rememberered -cyclamates are STILL LEGAL IN CANADA.  Do cyclamates, then, kill Americans and not Canadians?  Or is this just another power-play by American "Food and Drug" officials?  It is all very confusing and disillusioning to someone born and bred in the (seemingly?) "land of the brave, and home of the free".  Or is that actually, "the land of the slave, and the home of the thief?"<br /><br />At any rate, I do hope our beloved FDA will never make unpasteurized cheese, such as this "Fontine Val d'Aosta", Italian cheese, illegal.<br />It's only cheese, true -- but if they take away our freedom to eat unpasteurized cheese....what next will they take away.  Hmmm....as this IS Italian cheese.....maybe the Mafia DOES have a few good purposes, after all?

review/text: I got one of these kcups in a sample pack a few months ago.  I've been hesitant to try it as I am not the biggest cider fan.  I looked up the nutritional info- 10 calories, 1 carb- if it's not sweet enough, I have Splenda.  So I brew it and my kitchen starts smelling like a caramel apple.  I found myself fanning the steam from the cup towards my face.  My first sip was heavenly.  I decided to put it over ice since it is summer and it's great cold as well.  I am one happy girl right now as I keep drinking it.  Try it.  You'll love it.

review/summary: My favorite K Cups!!  Only 10 calories!
review/text: I was a bit scared to order these, because of the mixed reviews...I honestly cannot figure out how it's possible to NOT love these!  They are probably my favorite K Cup beverage...AND the cheapest, to boot!<br /><br />I am used to drinking artificial sweeteners (diet soda, Splenda, etc.) -- maybe some people didn't realize that these were sugar-free (i.e., people don't know how to read product titles & descriptions)?  If you're used to straight-up sugar, maybe these would taste off, like people think diet soda tastes bad if they're used to regular.<br /><br />As a diet soda drinker, these taste awesome to me!  I seriously want to drink one or two of them every day when I get home...and by the way, it's June now, so I imagine in the winter they'd be even better.  :-)  I think these also taste good cold.  I make them on the 10-ounce Keurig setting -- 8 ounces and they're too sweet...which is great, since I get 2 more ounces of cider.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd say give them a try...they're cheap, and I think they're awesome.  I guess just make sure your taste buds are used to artificial sweeteners, and you'll probably love them too!

review/summary: OBSESSED!!!
review/text: I am absolutely OBSESSED with these k-cups. I don't want to admit to how many of these boxes I've gone through in the past few months. It's embarrasing.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, sweet and tangy. It's better than any other hot cider drink I've tasted and the best part is, it's sugar-free and only 10 calories. As a treat, I like to top with fat free whipped cream -- it seems like SUCH an indulgence, but it's very low in calories!<br /><br />As someone who is always watching watch I eat, I do not like to "drink" my calories if I can help it -- which is why I shy away from the other hot cider/hot chocolate/teas for my Keurig. Most clock in at around 60-80 calories, so I only have one every few days or so. I can't drink one after another...like I do with these. See? I told you I was obsessed!<br /><br />All that said, I am someone who is USED to eating/drinking artificially flavored/sugar free drinks. I'm a diet soda/Crystal Lite drinker, so the taste isn't anything "new" to me -- in fact, I don't quite understand what all the complaining is about these k-cups on here is all about.<br /><br />You can't beat the price -- I'm on the subscribe 'n save plan but I am already ordering more frequently than that because I drink these k-cups like a fish!

review/text: As someone who is used to artificial sweeteners, I have to say that these were exactly what I hoped for.  Are they a little extra sweet?  Sure.  But let's be honest, I haven't had real apple cider in years and this was close enough for me.  If you're watching your blood sugar and would like a non-coffee/tea treat for your keurig, I recommend these.  The caramel ones are decent too, although they are stronger than these in my opinion.  A single 24 pack is a fairly reasonable price, try it out for yourself.

review/summary: Too Sweet
review/text: The sweetener used in this over powers the flavor.  It has a decent aroma but the closest approximation of taste I could give it is hot apple juice with extra sugar.  It may appeal to someone that likes very sweet drinks without the calories.  I enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AWTR6M">Green Mountain Naturals Hot Apple Cider</a> and was hoping this would be a caramel flavored, less calorie laden, version but was sorely disappointed.

review/text: the spices apple flavor would be so much better if it had not been a sugar free product. that small detail was not listed in the description of this cider. I really don't like the taste of artifcle sweeteners. tart is always better that sickly sweet.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY!!!!!
review/text: I'm not a picky eater but this is by far the worst tasting thing I have every had (and I've had Moxie). It has a bitter taste almost like warm pennies and the flavor stays in your mouth. I couldn't even finish the cup and don't plan on using any of the others. Not only does it taste bad but the smell itself as bad as the flavor. I would not recommend this product!

review/text: I've read lots of negative reviews about this, people saying it has a bad aftertaste and an artificial flavor taste. I was pretty skeptical buying it, but I'm definitely glad I did. I love it! I'm not even a big 'apple cider' person, but it really is fantastic.

review/text: Love it, this company makes instant K-cups, which means you can open them and pour into a cup of cold water, most tasty, and they make good popcycles. Best of all not made with sorbitol, made with aspartame.

review/text: I drink a lot of sugar-free beverages, but these are TERRIBLE. When you brew the cup, it smells like melted butter and the taste is not good at all. I wouldn't waste your money.

review/summary: Outstanding
review/text: In December 2011, my husband and I visited Colonial Williamsburg VA. Their cider is absolutely fantastic and I just loved it. I thought I would never find anything like it at home.  When I saw this product, I thought perhaps it might be similiar and I wasn't mistaken.  It is so great. Drinking it brings back the memories of a wonderful vacation to Williamsburg.

review/summary: Ew!
review/text: I buy little powdered cider packets at the store by the hot chocolate and occasionally simmer my own hot cider. My Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider was the third K-Cup I tried (I just got my machine for Valentine's Day). I figured it should be used at a lower water setting so I went with 8. It smelled great while brewing but tasted AWFUL!!! I now have 23 K-Cups I need to find a home for.

review/summary: really strong flavor
review/text: When I made the first cup, I was not sure about the taste. It is more caramel than apple flavored and seemed a bit too sweet. But after making it again, it was more like having a dessert! Now I am enjoying it. There are so few sugar-free k-cups available with the various fancy things, so I appreciate finding this.<br />UPDATE:<br />I made another cup of this drink today and I chose the largest size cup to brew in my Breville k-cup brew machine. That was a good thing, as the flavor was not so highly intense. It was most enjoyable when the flavor was not as concentrated.<br />Next, I will try using the "iced drink" setting and see if this flavor is good when done as an iced beverage.

review/summary: Very Good!!
review/text: I was a little unsure about purchasing this because of all the bad reviews. I then realized the product was very cheap in price and I kept telling myself "You get what you pay for". After a few days of debating, I finally decided to purchase it, and I am so glad I did. It is very sweet and a little bitter, but what else would you expect from something that is caramel apple? In my opinion, it has a nice rich flavor, without the artifical or chemical tastes.
