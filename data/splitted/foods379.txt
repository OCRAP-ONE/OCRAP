review/summary: Grows on you
review/text: The first time I tried this coconut water I thought it was kind of bland.  It is not super sweet and the flavor is subtle.  However, after a workout one day I tried it and it was wonderfully refreshing!  It quenches your thirst like cool water, and the extra boost of electrolytes brings your strength back.

review/summary: Nature's own soda pop and great for athletes' too
review/text: Crisp when chilled and refreshing without synthetic flavorings or added sucrose, Zico is the packaged beverage my yard men prefer. The smart-paper carton packaging created less bulk waste than canned drinks, and nature's own engineering packs this fruit punch with five electrolytes, the most overtly critical of which is potassium. I didn't think I would like this product but bought it because I cannot quite manage the full-time taste for spring water and herbal tea my yoga regime suggests. VERY helpful for those weaning themselves off alcohol and conventional mystery soda-pop.

I am from Brazil and I sure know what young coconut water tastes like...and what they did to the taste of it is nowhere close to real coconut water.

It literally taste like plastic.<br /><br />I stopped buying ZICO and went over to O.N.E., not as tasty as the Tetra-Pack ZICO, but atleast doesnt taste like plastic!!!<br /><br />KEEP AWAY FROM ZICO, until they change it back to Tetra-Pack!<br /><br />Aparently i found out after some dabling online. Its not 100% coconut water, they changed the process where they make the coconut water out of CONCENTRATE.....honestly...concentrate??? No i am pissed off.....

review/summary: Bad News! FYI! The only coconut water that is MADE FROM CONCENTRATE
review/text: I've tried C2O, Vitacoco, and Naked coconut water. All of them contain one ingredient:100% natural coconut water. However, ZICO is the ONLY coconut water that is 1) Made from concentrate and 2) contains added "Natural ingredients". At trader joes, Zico costs about 2 bucks, which is the same price for C20 coconut water and Vitacoco which both do NOT have "natural flavors" added to it and are NOT from concentrate. The packaging advertises "30 percent less sugar"...well that's because they took out 30% of the coconut water and replaced it with water. It was so nasty that they had to add "natural flavors". Do not buy this brand. When I was a little kid I used to suck on my water squirt guns and the taste of this coconut water resembles that-like plastic/water with a small hint of coconut water. The other brands are so much better and are actually natural. For the same price, go get a coconut water that is not from concentrate. My favorite is C20.

review/summary: Fake.
review/text: This is the product that rocked my world... In a bad way. After buying this I realized that some companies (and people) will do anything for a profit - like rip off their fellow man.  Here's how....<br /><br />Zico used to be real 100% coconut water. Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified "natural flavor" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.<br /><br />Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?<br /><br />This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.  And if that means 30% less sugar (ie 30% less actual coconut water in the bottle) it also means 30% less electrolytes than you should be getting from a 100% product too.  It's just logic.

review/summary: Potassium Explosion!  Cholesteral Marvel!
review/text: I used to not like Coconut water.  When I was in Thailand in 2005 I had a fresh one sliced open and could barely put it down.  Years later, by forcing myself to love it, I now am addicted.  You can learn to love this stuff.  And with its many muscle revitalizing and cholesterol healing properties, you can too.  Coconut water reportedly has a unique long-form cholesterol that helps regulate bad cholesterol, among other healing properties.  Not a low calorie food, are you kidding?  This is nothing compared to juice, tea, soda, etc..  The only natural drinks that have it beat on calories are black coffee and tea. This product is not from concentrate and tastes delicious.  If I could afford it, I would only need this one drink for life and I'd be happy.

We decided to stick with Zico but it doesn't contain extra sugar or other fruit juices like some of the other ones that we've tried. What I also like is the fact that I can subscribe for the product through amazon to get the case sent to me every month! This definitely takes the hassle out of going to the store to get it and I think it's set at a great price point. We've been going through our case so fast (we're pretty active) that I've increased my case count to 2 every month!

review/text: I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.<br /><br />Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.<br /><br />However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut.

review/text: I've always enjoyed the original Zico coconut water, but thought I'd give some of the other flavors a try. The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other. Unfortunately, the Zico drinks with "natural mango flavor" taste like someone dropped a mango flavored hard candy into my Zico drink. It's not terrible, but that's definitely NOT the refreshing flavor I was hoping for, especially after a hard workout! I think I can manage to power through the remaining 11 drink boxes I bought, but I won't be wasting my money on this drink again.

OB said to drink more liquids but I still have morning sickness and liquids before 10 AM dont stay down.  I tried several different coconut waters and found this Zico chocolate, ONE with guava and Naked plain to be the three I prefer.  This Zico chocolate is my favorite!  It is good in the morning when milk is too heavy and fruit juice is unappealing.  I feel much better after a couple of weeks drinking 1-2 coconut waters a day in addition to as much regular water I can stomach.  It is an expensive habit, but prescription anti nausea pills or going to the ER from dehydration is more expensive.

review/text: I received my case of Zico Coconut Water within the two days advertised by "Amazon Prime".  It was interesting to me that, what with the free shipping, this was more than a dollar a bottle cheaper than I buy it for in the grocery store.  It came double boxed.  That is, there was a compartmentalized container with the liter bottles carefully packed within, this box was surrounded by air bag packaging and packed within a larger sturdy cardboard container.  Great packaging.<br />  My wife uses this product and her comments follow:  As to the taste.  I found I prefer Zico over the other brands as it doesn't appear to have any "hidden" sugar added to hype up the taste.  My previous brand, Vita Coco,  did not declare added sugar, but it did leave that sugared drink after taste in my mouth and was noticeably sweeter.<br />  I cannot say that I particularly like the taste of coconut water, but it has the nutritional potassium I need in my diet, and is easier to keep around than bananas and has less calories.

You would not believe how happy I am to have found this and to have it available in the USA. I cannot taste a big difference between this and the real thing. Perfect for the cold winters of South Carolina. (Just kidding, the winters here are 60 degrees F). Seriously, if you like Tim Hortons french cappuccino, this will make your day.

review/summary: not so flavourful
review/text: I like the French vanilla available in any Chevron extra mile store & was looking towards a similar taste but this one feels more like a chocolate drink, I was expecting to have a bit more of coffee taste. As of now I add some instant coffee to the mix in hot milk to get the flavour I wanted. Would try some other brand next time.

review/text: First time you taste this (especially with milk), you LOVE this.<br />But it's not something you want everyday. Rather, maybe once in a couple of weeks or so.<br />I use my espresso machine for everyday coffee. This is for that rare occasions<br />when I feel like something sweet. This can be also achieved by stopping by Starbucks<br />every week or so.

review/summary: Tim Horton's hot french vanilla cappuccino
review/text: Purchased this for my husband as he and I both LOVE this at Tim's when we go to Canada.  However, unless you have a machine to froth this up when you make it, it isn't worth the money.  Lower priced items in the stores are just as convenient.  The one thing that does make this better than the crap you buy in the grocery store though, is that you don't get that kind of bitter, caffine-like taste with this stuff.  Maybe I rated it low, but I guess we thought it would be as good as what they make in the coffee shop back home...hope this review helps.  My husband says he won't have it again, so I have two full canisters to myself--goody!

review/summary: Not as described - Not Coconut Oil - Oil Blend In The Packs
review/text: I searched and searched for what I thought would be an economical pack of popcorn for my 8 oz popper.  We like the theater style popcorn and the coconut oil - if you know the hi-temp hopper style poppers, you are familiar with the different oils that can be used and that coconut oil is the preferred oil for many people who want that authentic movie-style popcorn taste.  The description on Amazon says that these packs come with coconut oil.  The cardboard case the packs came in also says coconut oil.  But in the fine print on the individual popcorn packs, the ingredients listing says that it may contain a variety of oils including coconut, canola, etc.  I'm crying FOUL play here.  If I wanted an oil blend or an oil that was not coconut, I would have bought that.<br /><br />So - for a $30 case of snacks, will I be returning it - probably not - return shipping will kill me and I will still be without popcorn.  Will I buy some accurately labeled popcorn from another seller - I reckon so.<br /><br />Last thing - I am rating this as a 1 star so that my review stands out and is read - I doubt my single star rating will affect the overall rating much - and that is actually ok for me.  Understand, I am not reviewing the taste of this product - telling you that this popcorn is a 3 or 4 out of 5 for taste is meaningless when to me 5 stars would be popcorn cooked in coconut oil - which it appears I am not getting with this product.  Kind of like being a fan of all beef hotdogs and ordering one but when you read the fine print, you find out what you are getting is an all-meat hotdog -- which may include beef or pork or chicken or who knows what.  The all-meat hotdog may be ok tasting and be a 3 or 4 out of 5, but that's not the point - if you order all-beef and are served something else then that is going to be a disappointment.

review/summary: No muss, no fuss - perfect popcorn every batch.
review/text: We use these 8oz premeasured popcorn, salt/flavoring, oil packets two at a time in our 16oz Gold Medal popcorn machine. The premeasured packets ensure a consistently good result every time. (Paragon no longer makes a 16oz packet.)<br /><br />Recently, we've started omitting the salt/flavoring from the second packet in each batch - theoretically cutting the salt content by 50% - this still results in great tasting popcorn and makes our salt-conscious guests happy.<br /><br />We find it easier to empty the oil into the kettle if the packets are at a warm room temperature. This makes the oil flow freely from the pouch, instead of having to try to push out a solid piece from the packet.<br /><br />The coconut oil in the packet means our guests with peanut allergies (ie: peanut oil) can usually have this. Coconut is noted as the best oil to use in these high heat popcorn machines.<br /><br />While the cost may be slightly higher to use these packets over purchasing bulk popcorn, flavoring (ie: Flavacol), and oil (ie: NaksPop "sticks"), we find this much easier to use, and get a much more consistent flavor - batch to batch. The individual packets also keep the popcorn fresh and the moisture content of the popcorn consistent.

I don't like canned sardines, but I love those snack-packages of smoked salmon when I can get them, (which is not often) and this tastes closer to the salmon. Very tasty. The texture is nice too. I got full eating it on crackers with cream cheese, and there's still a lot left. It goes a long way.

review/summary: A tasty treat!
review/text: These kippered snacks (herrings) are a great way to add Omega 3 fatty acids to your diet.  Each 3.5 oz. can contains 1.4 gms of Omega 3.  This fish is an excellent source of protein as well (18 gms per can).  The smoked flavor is just right and it seems to combat any fishiness. I only wish that they had less sodium (460 mg per can) and I am wondering what sodium hexametaphosphate is.  Most of our family likes them including our 18-year-old son. Our dog loves them and the liquid in the can.  The fish are meaty with a good solid texture and there is very little liquid in the can.  I like them with cold pickled beets and cheese souffle, a meal that I grew up with and am now enjoying once again after many years.  They are at Dollar Tree for $1 per can right now.

review/text: The smoke flavor is light and so is the texture, allowing the flavor of the fat and fish to come through. Most kippered things are hard and almost rubbery, this is flaky and buttery. No one part overpowers the other. Compared to other brands it's a gourmet treat.

review/summary: So far it's been terrible corporate support
review/text: We've loved this brand for a long time, but just purchased some and it was literally riddled with parasitic eggs.<br /><br />We emailed the company at [...] and not one response.  It's been days now.  We finally had to guess at an email address for the parent company, Bumble Bee, and at last got a reply.<br /><br />Their websites do not accept feedback without harassing the bejeebers out of you with 'spam guards' that won't accept their own words typed exactly as typed (and some of the words are fuzzy beyond belief and some are upside down, too).<br /><br />So just TRYING to get customer support has been a real hassle.  I should never have had to work that hard to get a response or to feel heard, so I cannot give this a full 5 star rating despite finally getting some resolution and usually a good product that isn't totally revolting with things that ought not be there with the fish.  We are afraid to open the other cans we bought now despite coupons en route in case they're just as gross and we spent a lot of money this time.<br /><br />They need to absolutely redo their websites for feedback and I hope they do so soon.

The items I could consume, tried and enjoyed were the three biscotti, two truffles.

review/text: I was expecting homemade creamy soft banana bread.  I bit it and was a little surprised by the texture.  It almost had a crispy quality to it- like the innards of a Crunch bar.  There were little crisp pieces in every bite!  Not like my homemade recipe AT ALL.  Back to the actual bread part of the banana bread- it was good!  Not the same as homemade- but it was good!  It also had walnut pieces on it- which is great for nut lovers like me!  I prefer pecans on banana bread- but walnuts will do.

review/summary: Good Texture, Balanced Flavors.
review/text: I received a Quaker Soft Baked Banana Bread Bar as part of my Influenster Summer Beauty Vox Box. I'm staunchly anti-banana, but this little treat sounded right up my mum's alley, so I had her eat it. This is what she thought. Keep in mind, Mum is already a big Quaker fan, and an even bigger fan of banana nut bread. She had Quaker oats for breakfast this morning actually. As prompted by the directions, she microwaved it for 10 seconds. She liked the packaging, since you could see the product, it had a full ingredient list, and plenty of nutritional information. The bar is 1.48oz (42g).Mum's initial thoughts were that the bar seemed to have decent nutritional value, and would make a convenient lunch time/after work snack. When she took her first bite, she seemed really impressed that it tasted "like real banana nut bread!", and said it had a crunchy but chewy texture with lots of almonds. She said the banana and nut flavors were well balanced.  She really liked it, she ate it super fast (she always yells at me about eating too fast ;_;). She saved tiny morsels of it for both our dogs, who agreed it was delicious.Overall, Mum really liked this Quaker bar. She said she'll probably buy a box of them next time she goes to the grocery store (provided she can find a coupon). She thinks full price ($3.30 MSRP for 6 bars) is reasonable, but like me, she kinda loves saving money. Her only complaint about Quaker's Soft Baked Banana Nut Bread Bar is that it contains corn syrup, aside from that, it was a hit. She gave it a 4/5.

It certainly tasted as good as some of the less healthy options, but it was only 140 calories! Unfortunately, it didn't really satisfy my hunger so the calories weren't worth it.

review/text: I also received this as part of my Influenster Vox Box and I have to say that I'm disappointed in the taste. Upon receiving this item, I was really excited as I love Quaker Oats' oatmeal, flavored and even the whole oats. When I prepared to try this, I heated it up as it suggests on the packaging. I thought the smell was quite wonderful and was preparing to savor that first bite. Unfortunately, the taste of this cereal bar was not too pleasing. It had an artificial taste to me. However, I thought the texture was nice and the amount is perfect for a breakfast on the go. I would be willing to give their apple crisp bar a try as I may have more luck with that.

review/text: This cereal bar had me skeptical at first.  Usually products with banana in them have fake banana flavoring that tastes funky.  I was pleasantly surprised.  These bars taste almost just like eating banana bread (texture aside since bread and a bar are slightly different).  These make a great snack or breakfast on the go.  They weren't even very crumbly (just be careful of the nuts on top), either which kept my car happy and clean as I ate it on the way to the gym.

I've had Luna bars and Clif bars - they taste "healthy" but its edible and even good in its own way.  I don't think this one really is..

review/text: The Bottom Line:<br />Great packaging. Robust flavor. Correct portion size - substantial and filling without feeling overly-full. Another great product from Quaker.<br /><br />More Details:<br />I LOVE the flavor of banana bread, and having a Quaker Soft Baked Bar is a great way for me to get that flavor without the work of baking or buying a loaf (that would undoubtedly go bad before I could finish it!) The bar has a very nutty texture - which I enjoyed. I am interested in trying other flavors to see if there are some that are less chunky. Tried half without warming and half with (just 10 seconds in the microwave)...definitely preferred the warmed-up bar! Tasted soft and more "homemade." Give it a whirl! Overall, this great breakfast when you're heading out the door or a filling snack to keep ya goin'. Next step for me: seek out other available flavors and Quaker products!
