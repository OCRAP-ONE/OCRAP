review/summary: Conscientious Seller
review/text: I was not satisfied AT FIRST with this product.  After posting a less than glowing review, I was immediately contacted by the seller (distributor).  They graciously sent a new "fresher" bag of coffee.  This is much closer to what I remember.  Try with sweetened condensed milk as suggested, it is served that way in Jamaica.  Now if I only had some coco bread to go with it.<br /><br />Thank you for the prompt, courteous service.

I wish the price were lower & we had to sign for our package that came directly from Jamaica (hey, it is real!), but it is so worth the splurge!

review/summary: Jablum leaves me nonplused...
review/text: When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.

review/summary: Nothing to write home about
review/text: Believe it or not, I bought this at a yard sale for 50 cents.  The packaging was perfect and looked exactly like the photo.  It doesn't expire for another 6 months.  I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)

review/text: I bought this coffee after watching a documentary on Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, thinking it would taste exceptional compared to regular coffee.  This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  We brewed it in the drip coffee maker and also tried it in the French press and neither one of us were impressed.  At this point, our preferred coffee is Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend...it's much cheaper and more readily available.

review/text: A co-worker of mine went to Jamaica for vacation in Feb. and bought me a 1lb. bag of the ground.  It's expiration date was March.  I brewed it as soon as I got home.  To me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week.  I wonder if it was due to the expiration date, or does this coffee really taste like this.  If so, I will never buy again.  From all the hype, I was expecting much more.

review/summary: Great tasting time and money saver
review/text: I like to use porcini mushrooms in sauces and ragouts.  Using the smaller bits costs less and takes up less storage room over the larger size porcini pieces available from this vendor. While I love the flavor of porcinis I don't think they are very pretty so larger pieces generally do not add visual appeal to dishes.  I sometimes add a few black trumpet mushrooms for visual presentation.  JR has great Black Trumpets too.<br /><br />JR Porcini Kibbles are very high quality and are just the right size.  So to use them just soak them in hot water for about half an hour, no additional chopping needed.  I use a ladle to retrieve the hydrated mushrooms from the water then strain the water through a coffee filter to remove any grit.  I use the resulting 'porcini tea' in my recipes.

review/summary: good size, good value, good flavor, but sandy!
review/text: these 1/4 inch chunks of dried mushrooms pack a great deal of flavor. the photograph is not really accurate, at least for my batch--mine were more consistently sized and larger than the shreds that are depicted.<br /><br />i have bought many packages of whole porcinis at much higher prices, and the quality of these nuggets is roughly the same. the mushrooms are of good, consistent quality--i've not encountered any dark, crinkly, off-flavored pieces in the package (typical for inexpensive porcini).they've worked well in the recipes i've used them in. one complaint: i cannot seem to get all the grit out, no matter how many times i strain, sieve, soak. that's true of some much more expensive mushrooms, so not a deal killer for me. it's hardly noticeable.

review/summary: our crazy dog train-me snacks
review/text: I gave this product a 3 as our puppy enjoyed these but didn't seem crazy about them. The problem I had they had a sealable package but if you get any air in them they dry out! I would find some pieces that my puppy didn't finish and they would be hardened, I found that a couple of times, it seemed to me that the puppy didn't devour the snack. I wanted a snack for easy training and I would put them in my pocket for outdoor training, and like I said the puppy did eat them but didn't seem crazy for them. I did order the chicken and received the bacon but didn't return as I didn't want to go through that process and kept the bacon.

review/text: These are good treats and my dogs like them.  I don't like to use such dry crunchy treats for training, though, since the dogs need to take a while to chew them and can choke on them a bit if excited.  For training I prefer softer moister treats that I can break into smaller pieces but these are good for regular treats if a bit more expensive than others.

review/summary: It's alright.
review/text: This food has a nice sweet flavor which my son enjoys. It is very much a puree, as you'd expect from a 2nd food. There are visible lentil pieces which are the only identifiable food particles. The serving size is somewhat small, and the pouch can be tricky.<br />The pouch material is thicker than Happy Baby pouches, and it has a zip - loc type seal as well. My issue with the resealable pouch, is that food gets caught in it and it's hard to get out. Once you've used part of the pouch and you zip it closed you need to run water over the top to clean off the remaining food. I like the idea, it just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />In addition, the thickness of the pouch and gusseted bottom make it somewhat difficult to get all of the food out, the package has a very wide mouth, so there's more to control when getting the food out.<br /><br />Over all I have to say the food is good, but the packaging was frustrating enough for me that I won't buy it again.

These are one of the only prepared baby foods that do not have BPA in the container. The glass jarred baby foods have BPA in the lids, even the organic brands. It comes in a BPA free pouch, which is resealable, recyclable, and very portable.  I do highly recommend all of the other level 2 flavors.

review/text: I purchased these instead of the senseo pods based on others' positive reviews.  Unfortunately, one pod makes one small cup of weak coffee.  The pods are larger than the Senseo pods, so I can't use two to make a decent cup of coffee.  Very disappointed.  Should have stayed with Senseo.

review/summary: It might be blueberry lemonade, but turns out pink
review/text: I enjoy the powdered mixes more than the premixed, since they take up a lot less cupboard space. I enjoy a stronger drink, so usually I use two, however in this case, a single package was ALMOST enough.<br /><br />Like most of the flavors, this tasted mostly of "sweet," but this did have a subtle taste of both blueberry and lemon aid.  One of the better ones I have tried.<br /><br />Just a quick caution, the 5 calories noted are for 1/2 of a package! A full package goes into 16 oz of water, and is 10 calories.  Be sure to compare prices, since Amazon isn't always the best price on these.

review/summary: It's Godiva but it's not the good stuff
review/text: While there is no debating the quality of Godiva chocolates I was disappointed to find that there aren't many chocolates in this basket and those that are there are crudely made chocolate spheres rather than the exquisite chocolates that are Godiva's hallmark. Some of the packages you see in the photo only contain one or two chocolates and the whole thing is rather 'puffed up' to look like you get more than you do.<br /><br />The coffee was particularly bland - just ordinary coffee as far as I could tell. Didn't even taste as good as the Tully's I normally drink.<br /><br />I had no issues with the collection itself and it did make a very nice gift but I wouldn't pay $50 again for it - maybe $30 - $35 would be a more reasonable price.

review/summary: The proverbial mixed bag
review/text: I love coffee flavored candy, so I figured this would be right up my alley.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Coffee Candy is the best of the three. No filling, nothing fancy, just nice rich, yummy, coffee flavor.<br /><br />The Latte Candy would be my second favorite. These have a sweet, milky center. It tastes nice, but has a slightly chalky texture.<br /><br />The Espresso Candy wasn't so great. These have a gooey coffee center. The flavor is good. I didn't like the texture of the filling. Another issue with the Espresso is that many of the ones in my assortment were broken, making them a sticky inedible mess inside the wrapper. The Coffee and Latte flavors were all unbroken.<br /><br />I have no regrets ordering the assortment, but in the future, I'll stick to ordering the Coffee candy and pass on the Espresso and Latte.

review/text: I had prior experience with Bali's Best Coffee and have always enjoyed it. Consequently, I was eager to try Bali's Espresso and Latte Candy. However, I found the espresso to be disappointing. It has the taste of strong but stale coffee although another person might have a different reaction. I have not yet tasted the latte. Overall, I think United and Kopico are better than Bali's.

Not only does it break up in your mouth, but the texture of the center goop is nauseating like a blob of snot. It breaks into sharp shards first, then you get the gross inner surprise...bleh!!! If you like high fructose type syrup, then this crap is for you.

review/summary: It's good
review/text: What can be said about Quinoa that somebody shopping for it doesn't already know?  One thing I've seen - a lot of talk about "pre-washing" and how it's worth a couple of dollars a pound.  I don't agree.  It's not a lot of trouble to wash some grain.  Put it in a sieve, hold it under the faucet, let the water run a minute and dump the sieve into the water in the cookpot.  Pay yourself two dollars.<br /><br />Plain, boiled quinoa tastes a little funny to me.  So, I found I like it half and half with rice.  A cup of rice, a cup of quinoa, four and a half cups of water.  Bring to a boil.  Simmer covered without stirring for 15-20 minutes.  Push the rice/quinoa apart a little with a fork to see if there's any water left on the bottom of the pot.  Let it sit covered with no heat for ten minutes.  It is a LOT faster than rice.  But the rice cooks completely - I have no idea why.  I like it that way with butter, salt and pepper.  But I'll add things like sausage and/or chopped onions, peppers - it's like making an omelette - try it anyway you fancy and you'll like it. It keeps nicely in Glad or Tupperware in the refrigerator.  Scoop some out, microwave it, melt some butter in it and enjoy.  Hard to believe it's healthy, too.<br /><br />I bought this big bag six months ago and eat some every noon and often under goulash or stew.  It's been uniformly good and I haven't found anything in the bag other than Quinoa.  But, if I were to find gravel or something else in it, I'd contact Amazon or whoever sold it to me.  I haven't needed to very often in more than ten years of dealing with them but when I have, Amazon has been immediate in doing whatever it is they decide needs to be done to make me happy.

review/text: My comment regarding freshness in the title is about how fast you and your family consume the couscous in each box. I live alone, but since couscous is a staple of my diet, the packaging is not an issue.<br /><br />If you occasionally eat couscous I recommend, instead, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011T2ZJS">Marakesh Express Couscous Plain Can, 25.2-Ounce Can(Pack of 6)</a>. The quality of the couscous is on par with this one, and the packaging is of a superior design that allows you to keep it fresh for longer periods.<br /><br />What I like about this, the Marrakesh brand and my other favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDP5TI">Vigo Couscous, 10-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> is each are consistent in preparation. What I mean by that is if you follow the instructions to the letter each serving of couscous is going to be identical to past ones. I have used brands that I will not name that are not as consistent or as repeatable when preparing it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this brand for those who consume couscous regularly (2-3 or more times per week.)

review/summary: Mushroom Salt
review/text: My son was delighted to receive this as a gift for Christmas.  Awhile back we were given a gift pack of various salts and this flavor was his favorite.  It quickly was consumed and he commented about how much he missed this item.  Now he has a replenished supply.  We paired it with a bamboo salt box for a really unusual gift.

review/summary: Undrinkable
review/text: In short this does not taste like tea.  I does not smell like tea.  I took my first jar back to the store because of the smell.  I thought it had gone bad.  Very fishy smelling.  I tried very hard to get used to the taste but I still have not made it through the first 1/4 of the glass.  Iced tea in any variety should not taste like fish.  I tried it with and without sweetener.  Another reviewer pointed out that it contained maltodextrin. Why is that in there? Nestea is just tea, no extra ingredients.  Lipton, if you ever read this, can you answer why?  That must be the odd taste.  Maltodextrin is also a highly processed food.  Just go all natural and the taste should be better.  So overall no good.

review/summary: Repulsive product
review/text: This product is terrible! I love decaffeinated instant tea, but this is HORRIBLE! I never write negative reviews. If I don't like something, I simply dispose of it, but this is worth a warning. My first impression was that it gave of a strong, almost fishy smell. The taste was almost non-existent, and it was all around gross. After a week, I tried it again and it had the most horrible fishy smell I have ever smelled. As this is a 3pack, I tried another container and it had the same smell. I checked the bottom of the container and it says it expires in 2014, but something about this product has a putrid smell. Buyer beware!!!!! Once you buy this product, you may be introducing it to the TRASH...I did!

review/text: I thought it tasted terrible...not the usual Liptons. My previous purchase of Lipton's unsweetened was not decaf, and it was excellent, so I don't know if this tasted bad to me because it is decafeinated, or because it contained maltodextrin in the ingredients (it wasn't pure tea).  Anyway, I am going to try Nestea next.

review/summary: Excellent! Doesn't taste like Nestea's nasty decaf!
review/text: This tea is just like the caffeinated kind.  It seriously doesn't taste any different to me.  My dad and I love lipton instant tea but we get kidney stones quite often and caffeine only fuels kidney stones so I have scoured many grocery stores in search for a "decaffeinated" lipton tea only to find the NASTY (putting it politely) Decaf Nestea.  No decaf Lipton anywhere.  I finally found this on Amazon and was so excited.  I hoped it would be like the regular caffeinated Lipton Instant Tea and it was a true pleasure when it arrives and I tasted it for the first time.  Not a thing tasted different from the caffeinated kind.  I purchased two packs of 3 for me and my dad to split and now I'm about to buy more as I have already used up almost all three bottles.  LOL!  Anyhow, if you are fearful of decaf instant tea because you tried others and were very disappointed, try this kind, you won't be sorry that you did.  I bet you'll come back for more all the time like I plan to.  :)

review/text: I have 3 kids and one dog. I was buying a 20lb bag every few months while grocery shopping with my kids, and it was one of my least favorite things to do. Then I had to store it out of the way, because it didn't fit anywhere that was easy to access. Now it is delivered to my door, and it is so much easier to handle and store because it a bunch of smaller bags. My dog loves it too.

review/summary: Beef Straganoff
review/text: January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.

review/summary: Better Than The Cubes.
review/text: I've used Knorr Boullon Cubes before and was always satisfied with them. Good product. This time when I went to replace them  the store had only Knorr Caldo Con Sabor De Pollo bouillon powder so I purchased this 7.9 ounce jar. Works fine. In fact, I like it better in-as-much as I can adjust the amount much easier and stir the ingredient in much quicker than with the solid cube. I'm not certain why the label would be in Spanish as the product was bought in a store that was British owned. Oh well, such is life.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I read about Cacao Beans and the health benefits that come with eating them... they are extremely bitter but that is what they are. There is nothing bad about the product itself, but the beans do not taste like chocolate even though I had dared to dream. They are still good for me, however, so I will continue to eat them until the bag is finished. It was my own naivety that lead me to believe I would enjoy eating them. This should not deter anyone who really wants to benefit from all their healthy goodness.

review/summary: Chewy, Gummy, and Flavorful
review/text: My husband is addicted to gummy-type candies but is extremely particular. Living overseas, the major brand of gummy candy you see everywhere is Haribo but of course my husband despises them. DOTS, on the other hand, he loves so I thought I'd buy these tropical flavored ones to break up the monotony. They are exactly what you'd expect from DOTS (chewy, gummy, flavorful) and the flavors are pretty good. Both he and I prefer the regular dots to these but they are good every once in a while just to have something different.

review/text: My family loves these and the fact that the primary ingredient is fruit juice makes them a somewhat better option than candy.  The pieces are a good size and the flavors are great.  Not the typical, boring, phony tasting flavors.  These are all unique and the pieces all have their own unique taste.  I use them as after work-out carbs and my wife brings them to work to keep her going when she can't take breaks.  Not entirely "guilt-free" snacking, but still a very reasonable option.  Plus, IT's SCOOBY DOO!! :)

review/text: Because my local WholeFoods and other stores had run out of quinoa, I looked into buying it online.  And even with shipping costs, this turned out to be a good decision, as in the US Northeast, quinoa costs skyrocketed around August 2008, from $2/pound to $4 and up.<br /><br />This is a bulk bag of quinoa from Angelina's Gourmet, shipped quickly in a box, and is in all respects just like what you'd buy in the bulk section of your local health food store.  Excellent value both financially and nutritionally.

review/summary: OK quinoa
review/text: This is a good price at which to buy....but....I noticed that the grains are not fully cleaned for all of the debris. For instance there were black shells and broken minute stem pieces etc., in the mix. The taste was still good. I would advice rinsing at least three times to get the grains all washed clean before cooking it. You still have to learn to live with the black pieces and the minute stem pieces. The trader joe's quiona are slightly more expensive per pound but it was really really clean and spotless and all it needed was one rinse. For those of you who are new to quinoa remember to rinse it well before cooking it.<br /><br />The box barley held the ten pounds when it arrived. They should have used a slightly thicker box. I noticed that this quinoa for some reason was more crunchy than the trader joe's product. I also noticed recently that costco is beginning to sell a 10 lb bag too. So check it out.

review/summary: Quinoa
review/text: Until last u\year I had never heard of Quinoa. Now I am hooked. I love the taste. Although I'm really not that keen on the red. But the white (or gold) will be found in my pantry from now on. Just cook it like you would rice, but keep a watch on it as it will stick. Most recipes say it cooks in 10 min. but I cook mine covered about 20 at a simmer in salted water with a little olive oil in the water.. Also you can use stock instead of water. I even threw some raw chicken in a pot with Quinoa (added some celery, onions and some spices) it was great. I make a double batch and keep the leftovers in the fridge. Good for breakfast w/milk , as a side dish or just a snack. Excellent for diabetics (like myself).<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHUYD4">QUINOA, 10 lb Bag</a>

review/summary: Great for Diabetic Meals
review/text: Quinoa is one of the blessings of a diabetic struggle to find foods that don't kill the carb limits, but still give you a sense of having some kind of starch with your meal. It is actually a seed that is filled with great omegas, thus it has a lot to offer. It is very bland if you just cook it in water, so you have to cook it with items that have good seasoning. It cooks easly and takes on what ever flavor you are preparing it with. I tend to mix it with other things such as lintels or wild rice and if you dry roast it in a pan with other legumes, it will have a richer more nutty taste.<br /><br />If you are a diabetic looking for a substitute for your rice and mashed potatoes, this could be your ticket. Buy a little to try it. But once you have it in your pantry, you will never want to be without it.
