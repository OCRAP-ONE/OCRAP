review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

review/text: I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.

review/summary: SO disappointed -- not at all what I was expecting
review/text: The television commercials for Pepperidge Farm's MILANO MELTS cookies really worked -- I couldn't wait to buy a bag! I'm a big fan of the original Milano cookies -- the cookies themselves are light, crispy, and perfectly paired with rich dark chocolate. So what could go wrong with Milano cookies filled with dark, sumptuous chocolate creme?<br /><br />Well, MILANO MELTS are disappointing. First, the cookie itself: It's sort of a "double-thick" Milano cookie, which means it lacks the lightness and the delicate crispness of the original Milanos. It's very hard around the edges, and the texture seems dense and unappetizing. Then, there's the "dark chocolate creme": It just lacks the flavor of the chocolate on the original Milanos. Additionally, there's nowhere as much creme as you see in the TV commercials (or pictured on the package). The creme is mostly located in one half of the cookie -- I took my first bite and wondered, "where is the creme?" All I saw was a thin line of chocolate, which was tasteless buried inside that thick cookie. There was more creme on the other side of the cookie, but it was nothing like what I was expecting.<br /><br />These are simply not as good as the original Milano cookies (which are wonderful). This is an interesting-sounding idea that just didn't pan out. Stick to the original Milanos -- they will not disappoint.

review/summary: Mmm Good - a review of Mi-Del's Ginger Snaps
review/text: I am the sort of mom who likes to bake my own cookies because 1) it's fun, and 2) I like to know what goes into them.  However, when that is not practical I buy these ginger snap cookies.<br /><br />I don't mind giving them to my family because they are mostly organic (70%) and they don't contain hydrogenated oils nor corn syrup.  In addition, they contain iron - from the molasses - which is  something you don't often find in a snack.<br /><br />Four Stars.  A superior product in my opinion.  The whole family loves them.  Even my extremely picky son.  The flavor is zingy with a definite bite and each cookie is only 26 calories.  One of the few store-bought treats that I have no problem handing out to the children.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/text: My wife and I prefer them just a bit stale - leave them open for a day or so to get just the right amount of chew.  If you don't, they're very, very crisp (but still very good).  Snappy, even.  :)<br /><br />I'll also agree with the comment that they can be inconsistent from one bag to the next, but even when they're off, they're pretty good.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, one person's spicy is another person's bland.  For my family, they're just the right amount of hot after a few cookies.

review/summary: All Natural Ginger Snaps
review/text: When Whole Foods stopped stocking my favorite ginger snaps, I decided to get a 12-pack from Amazon instead of settling for the "365" brand, which had sugar as an ingredient, giving it a sandy texture in my mouth.  Mi-Del is the real deal and are great with coffee.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic dehydrated cane juice, canola oil, unsulphured molasses, ginger, baking soda, sea salt, soy lecithin (used as an emulsifier).  Product of Canada.<br /><br />Update:  I placed my order about 6-months ago and finally worked my way through the 12-pack.  They are not as fresh tasting now, of course but they still go great with my coffee and I consider them a healthy snack.  My sister thought they were too spicy but I love that ginger spice and just placed another order.

review/summary: Good cookies!
review/text: These cookies have a clean, crispy chocolate taste -- without the chemical-laced aftertaste of other commercially produced cookies. They are all-natural and made with canola oil, as opposed to the oils that can add to cholesterol problems. The ingredients are mostly organic and they are sweetened with dehydrated can juice, as opposed to the less-healthy commercial alternatives.<br /><br />Now, for the problem: I have never found these cookies in a market near me, and we have only purchased them through Amazon. Because these wonderful cookies are not pumped-up with weird chemical preservatives, the necessity of purchasing them in such big lots means that you are going to be eating a lot of cookies in a short period of time, or going in with a friend on sharing the case! However, given the high quality of this product, you should have no problem splitting up the order.<br /><br />Yummy and highly recommended!

review/summary: Crunchy Little Cookie - Delicious
review/text: My order for Mi-Del Ginger Snaps arrived a few hours ago and I tried my first one ... okay, I'm on my 10th cookie now.  My first bite of one I noticed it had a hard crunch.  I like crunchy cookies, others may not.  I read here that you can leave the top opened on the bag overnight to soften them.  The cookie is about 3-4 bites worth.  On my first bite I could feel a little tongue tingle.  Each subsequent bite produced the same warm tingle and THAT is what puts this ginger snap in a class of its own, never losing that 'bite'.  It's not too overdone or underdone on the spice, it's a perfect little cookie.  Not to mention they are 26 calories each, and ingredient that are pronounceable, this makes for an excellent little treat with coffee, tea, or vanilla ice cream.  Excellent product that I will purchase again.<br /><br />Note: Expiration date on the bags are December 17th, 2010 but I don't think they will last that long.<br /><br />--Sailor Hill, CA

review/summary: Well worth the money
review/text: I originally bought the Mi-Del cookies at a local odd-lots store over a year ago. I felt a sense of loss after the store stopped carrying them, since no other local grocer stocked them. So I was glad to see that they were available, albeit in bulk quantities only, via Amazon. I love these cookies, and best of all, they're about as healthy as you can find anywhere. I have to watch my intake of saturated fats, and per 5-cookie serving, the Mi-Del snaps have zero grams of sat-fat. They're delicious, with a nice, somewhat subdued chocolate flavor and a crunchy snap. I keep them in the fridge and they maintain their freshness for MONTHS. Twelve packages may seem like a lot, but I look forward to devouring every one of them. I've also tried the vanilla and lemon snaps, and they're equally outstanding.

This is probably because they are made with natural ingredients and dont have the preservatives found in other cookies.<br /><br />But honestly i love these cookies they are sweet, crisp and very gingery ... even my sister and brother in law who don't eat anything "healthy" or "organic" because they think it wont taste good, where impressed with the taste of these cookies.<br /><br />Now they are hooked too and buy them all the time.

review/text: This cookie stands up very well to dunking in milk (about three dunked bites per cookie), and with mostly organic ingredients is about as guilt-free as possible in a cookie. We like a crisp ginger snap, and while the bag isn't self-sealing it seals well if you have a clip. We find the ginger level to be just right -- not overpowering, but definitely there.<br /><br />One correction to the ingredient list posted on this site -- there's no grape juice concentrate in the cookie, according to the bag I'm looking at right now and the Mi-Del website.<br /><br />Per serving size of 5 cookies: Calories 140; Total Fat 4g; Carbs 22g; Fiber 1g; Sugars 11g.

review/summary: So good people are taking them from me!
review/text: These cookies seemed to be a pretty good deal when I saw that there was a special offer on them. I LOVE cookies (who doesnt??) but am kinda picky about texture. I dislike soft mushy cookies although if desperate...but I know that "snap" cookies are usually not soft so I took a chance and ordered a case!  I live alone so a case of cookies was, at once, both frightening and decadent---but I think I am going to have to order another case!  Everyone who tasted these asked me "so where did you find these?"  Of course, since I am the online shopper from hell, everyone figured I found some obscure website and paid a fortune. "Natural" and "Organic" are buzz words for "gonna cost ya more" but the price was great per bag. After I told my friends and family who tasted them that I ordered a case---the bags started disappearing pretty fast! I got hit with guilt---What are YOU going to do with 12 bags of cookies? (duh--eat them!) and everyone was very happy to lighten up my stash by taking a bag so I dont overeat! Dont I have the BEST friends and family??? LOL  Seriously--I was happy to hand them over! I enjoy turning people on to new finds. I gave a bag to my Parcel Post guy and my UPS guy (after all--they lug all the boxes to my apartment!) and they were happy! And there is a method to my giving-away madness (especially to the carriers)! Less dropping and throwing around of MY boxes!<br /><br />Ok--they are nice and lemoney (?) but they could even be a bit more lemon-like for me! They are made with more healthful ingredients (no trans-fat) so even though I am pigging out on cookies--I dont feel nearly as guilty! And at less than $2 a bag--I think they are a greal deal! Plus it never hurts to have extra cookies in the house because a cookie emergency can happen at any given moment!  So--order them!  I think you will be pleased!

review/text: I eat these snaps by the pound, everyday, all day.  Anything ginger tastes good to me.  I'm signing up for the auto-ship, otherwise I'd make umpteen trips to the store.  Finding a cookie with unsulphured molasses is difficult & a requirement for me - I'm anaphylactic to sulphur.<br />My husband is now munching them too, so I'll have to double my order!<br />Thanks Mi-Del!  :)<br />Kristina

review/text: I love to bake but I don't always have time.  When I'm really busy, I buy MI-DEL cookies because they taste as good as homemade. My favorite are the ginger snaps. They're crunchy with a real authentic ginger snap taste. I love knowing that they're all natural and the kids LOVE them.

review/text: Yes, they're hard and really spicy, but I like it!  And what other cookie can you eat 5 of for only 140 calories and 11 grams of sugar?  And ginger is an anti-inflammatory spice that is good for headaches, arthritis, high blood pressure, you name it!  And they're made with whole wheat and no refined sugar... Wow, this is the world's most perfect cookie!

review/text: I bought these cause I'm a chocolate snap lover, and I had been craving some. The lack of trans fats and description drew me in.<br /><br />Let's just say this: I took these over to a family party, and none of the kids liked it. NOT ONE. And most of the adults, the best they could say was, 'Eh.' I think two folks had more than one.<br /><br />I'd have to say skip these cookies. They don't make your mouth sing with chocolatey snappy joy.

review/text: I absolutely love the Mi-Del ginger snaps, so I thought I'd try these in vanilla, thinking they'd be just as tasty.  Unfortunately, they didn't have the vanilla flavor I'd hoped for, and I wasn't crazy about their consistency.  They almost seemed stale, although I'm sure that's not the case.  As I actually prefer the name brand vanilla snaps, I gave these away to my local food pantry.

review/text: I ordered both the vanilla and the ginger snaps, and like both kinds. The high quality organic ingredients provide a "guilt-free" eating experience. I'm not sure if kids would go for them, but will try them out on my nephews next time I get a chance. I ordered two 12-packs so will have cookies for quite a while. Mine expire 6/20/08 so don't buy TOO many in advance.

review/summary: disappointing taste
review/text: I like the fact that the Mi-Del cookies are low-fat and use some organic ingredients.  I love the Mi-Del lemon and vanilla flavors, and their ginger snaps are ok -- BUT these chocolate snaps are no good.  I'm a chocolate lover, so this is rather disappointing.  The taste is similar to the ginger snap, but it's off quite a bit - slightly bitter.  It's as if they didn't put enough sugar in these snaps to counter the bitterness of cocoa powder. It also has a poor aftertaste that's slightly bitter (the lemon snap aftertaste is awesome keeps me wanting more).<br /><br />Gotta give it 1 star - yeah, I ate 10 of these to give them a chance, but I threw away the rest of the bag. The crunch and texture is the same as the other Mi-Del Snaps, but the flavor is off.  Not Recommended.

review/summary: DREAMING OF CORNBREAD
review/text: This Penquin Cornbread has me dreaming of cornbread and smelling it when there is none.  I like others got it at COSTCO; this was originally about a year ago.  I had a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  Now I went back for more and nothing but an empty shelf.  (I think they just keep it around the holidays.)  Since I can always depend on AMAZON, I checked here.  Well you/they do carry it which I am thrilled about, but you're/they're out.  Don't get me wrong I can usually do without cornbread for long periods.  HONEST.  But not since this Penquin Cornbread.  It's good and goes with so many dishes.  The perfect compliment.  It also seems to substitute for meat if you're eating vegetarian chili or an all vegetable meal.  The other store bought varieties just didn't fill that bill, too sweet and flimsy.  OK AMAZON I'LL JUST CHECK EVERY DAY.  OKAY.  Really folks this stuff is unusually good; just add 1 egg and oil.  Convenient as well.  I usually line my black iron frying pan with foil and spray with PAM.  You can order it from the company (Penquin) but for such a high delivery fee.  I'm trying to wait for AMAZON hoping it will not be as much for delivery!!!

review/text: Like all of you I am dying to get more of this wonderful cornbread.  I finally gave up and called the company direct to see where I could get it.  The rep told me it is only sold at Costco during the fourth quarter.  They will start selling it in late September.  Not sure if it will be at all Costcos but it is worth calling your local store to make sure they order enough for you for the next year.  It usually has a year or longer shelf life so I recommend stocking up.  He also suggested I go to Target and get the Honey Amber Cornbread.  It is very close to this one.  I think he said it was by Archer Farms, I'm can't remember.  I hope this helps all of you who are dying to get more of this wonderful cornbread.  Have a great day!

review/text: I love corn bread and corn muffins, and have been eating the cheap stuff for years. Every so often I will make my own from scratch, but that's too much work for the time I usually have. So when I found this mix, I was very excited. And after tasting it? I was even MORE excited! It is so moist, with actual pieces of corn in it! My husband, who really DOES NOT LIKE corn bread even likes this! My dad, who I consider a corn bread connoisseur, LOVES it and now wants this instead of his regular corn bread. It's not available everywhere, so I end up buying multiple boxes to ship home with family!

review/summary: "Seasonal availability" and southern style baking advice
review/text: When I found the shelves at Costco empty and complained to the checkout cashier she smiled and informed me that Costco will carry this wonderful product during the spring and summer months only. Sure enough, it's now March and I found it there last week! What a relief.... I think they have it wrong though, it should be on available year round, and certainly during the fall and winter when comfort foods such as chili are frequently on the supper menu. On another note: if you want to enjoy it even more, try baking it the way the Southern grandmother would: simply add an extra couple of tablespoons of oil to a heavy cast iron skillet, place it in the oven while it is heating up, remove hot skillet and pour in the cornbread batter. You should see the oil go up the sides and sizzle a bit. Bake for about 35-40 minutes as directed. This extra oil and hot skillet method creates a very " crispy " bottom and side crust (not to mention a few more calories, but you want to be authentic, right ? ) Serve with some cooked greens such as swiss chard, kale or collards.... dee-licious!!  You can also have more cornbread for breakfast the next day if there is any leftover, which is unlikely.

review/text: This is the best cornbread/muffin mix ever! First of all, it's so easy to make even my husband can make it! Second, it smells delicious -- like roasted corn.  I love to be woken up by my husband's freshly baked cornbread on a Saturday morning.  Third, it tastes amazing...not too sweet, moist yet still crumbly. Finally, it has whole corn kernels in the mix that rise to the top when you bake it so it not only tastes and smells great, it looks great too!  We have brought this cornbread to dinner parties as a side dish and have gotten lots of compliments.<br /><br />You can add an extra egg or two to turn it into corn muffin (and maybe some more sugar if you like sweet).<br /><br />I too am having a hard time finding it at my local costco and have signed up to be notified on Amazon when this product becomes available.

I make most things from scratch, but this mix is by far the best!  I am delighted to be able to still keep it in my pantry.  BTW, you can always tweak this by adding a spoon of sugar, or a can of creamed corn. I usually saute some finely chopped onion and poblano pepper, toss them in with the other ingredients and bake.  YUM!!!  (If Costco has picked it up again, it's not showing up in this area, yet.)

This is the best, sweetest corn bread.  We used to buy a number of boxes each year as it has a great shelf life and would last until Costco sold it again each fall.  Were sure to serve it to friends and family.  Our grandkids have been asking about it for the past year since Costco discontinued it and we are delighted to be able to get it through Amazon.  Thanks for carrying it and making it a prime item.

Back in the US, I tried to find some good Turkish tea. I ordered several kinds. After doing thorough testing (!!) we decided that this was good tea, but not the best we found. Our favorite was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RJARJS">Black Tea (Turkish Tea)</a>.<br /><br />We brew it in a cast iron Japanese tea kettle, pour boiling water in it, then dilute it in the glass or mug to the concentration we want. We often sweeten it with honey, and I typically add a drop of lemon.

review/summary: The Best Seasoning Ever
review/text: We discovered this on a trip to Maui in 2009.  It was so wonderful to find it again online when we returned.  It is a great seasoning!  We use the Hawaiian Island Original and Smoke.  The smoke can be used on virtually any meat and the original is a great addition to anything from scrambled eggs to potato salad!  It has seasonings that can only be found on the Hawaiian islands.  Truly unique and delicious!  We were very happy to find it in the 32 ounce size!  Much more cost effective!

review/summary: Delicious and versatile
review/text: Have used these in two recipes since receiving them a few days ago.  They were delicious in both recipes.<br /><br />For the first meal, I used ground turkey to make turkey burgers.  In a mixing bowl, I combined the crumbs with one egg, chopped red and green bell pepper, chopped Vidalia onion, garlic powder, oregano, and salt.  Mixed it all into my ground turkey and made burger patties, then sauteed them in olive oil on the stovetop.  They developed a beautiful brown crust, and were moist and delicious.  I have to say that they were even better than the way I normally make them.<br /><br />My second time using them was last night, I made baked haddock.  On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, I laid out 2 lbs. of boneless, skinless haddock.  In a small bowl, I mixed crumbs, garlic powder, and oregano.  I had also ordered some Schar GF table crackers that arrived all broken, so I smashed a couple of those up into fine crumbs and mixed them in too.  I sprayed the fish with Pam olive oil spray, topped each piece with the crumb mixure, sprayed the top with a little more Pam, and baked them for 40 minutes at 350.  They were excellent.  I couldn't even tell the difference between these and the crumbs that aren't GF... in fact, maybe these were even better.<br /><br />I highly recommend these, and I will keep a lot of them on hand to use in any dish requiring bread crumbs.  You should be aware that they do contain soy, in case anyone is allergic or sensitive to it.  (The crackers do not contain soy, so if you're sensitive to it, buy those instead and smash them up.  They are a tasty alternative.)

review/summary: Defective!
review/text: I ordered this item, a 10 pound BAG of sour cherry Jelly Belly jelly beans but what I received was a previously opened BOX of jelly beans which were crystallized and melted together and looked nothing like the image above. In addition, the jelly beans were simply dumped into the cardboard box with no wrapper whatsoever. This box had a seal on it which had been cut through and then retaped. The external shipping packaging was undisturbed. When I have ordered Jelly Belly jelly beans from other vendors, they have come in plastic bags, shipped in a cardboard box.<br /><br />Since I really wanted what I had ordered, I was disappointed to see that upon return of the defective merchandise, I was only eligible for a refund, not a replacement as Amazon was out of stock on my item. I sent the item back and was surprised to see that today, when my return processed, there is now 1 ten pound bag of sour cherry Jelly belly jelly beans in stock. I wonder if the in stock item is the very same defective item which I just returned.

Try Superior Nut thru Amazon instead; they packed them right and it arrived perfect!

review/summary: Liquid Gold
review/text: I'll never be able to make chicken soup as delicious as my grandmother's. I'm too lazy to stand over the stockpot for an hour skimming like she did. I'm too impatient to wait for the stock to chill so I can remove the solid fat at the top. And I'll never be skilled enough to make my own noodles. Even so, my chicken soup is pretty delicious thanks to good ingredients and this broth concentrate. Unlike most supermarket bouillon and aseptic broth boxes, this stuff actually tastes like chicken, and not like Chicken-scented-salt.<br /><br />I love that it takes up so little room, has minimal packaging and especially love that I no longer have to schlep boxes of chicken water home. With a family member who must avoid nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers) this product's ingredient list is perfect! (And I know Gramma would approve of the schmaltz.)<br /><br />I use this product to fortify soups, gravies, and sauces. It adds a lot of flavor to home-cooked dishes, elevating them from the everyday, thrown together in a hurry meal to (alas, nearly) "Made especially for you with love and care by Gramma."

review/summary: Very convenient and tasty
review/text: Savory Choice makes well flavored broth concentrates that are very convenient to use. This reduced sodium chicken broth tastes just as good as the others. If you just need a little broth, it's so easy to reach for a stick of broth rather than open a can and not use all of it. The broth concentrate in the stick mixes with a cup of water for normal strength broth. Sometimes I just add the concentrate to the liquid in the pot of what I'm cooking and stir it in when I want to up the flavor. I use both the chicken and beef broths regularly and the turkey broth at the holidays.

review/summary: Pricey and not too good
review/text: The true test of any broth, be that in solid form, powder or liquid, is in the taste. You heat one cup of water and use it then you drink it (of course herbs, pepper, tabasco sauce, etc., can and should be added for the test, nothing wrong with little creative add ons) and once you are done you will know if this broth met the basic requirement of taste. The taste on this product is not equal to that of the competing brands. Rather sweet and of course one pays extra (I do mean extra) for the lack of salt on the preparation. I use regularly the Savory Beef and even though it is a little on the pricey side I have to admit we like it a lot. I thought that reduced sodium might be an interesting and healthy option, only to discover (a little too late) that it does not meet the taste test. It is more sweet than I am sure it would be if I was to boil a whole chicken for the broth it yields.  I suppose that this product tries hard at being good for you and maybe it is, but for the money and the quantity provided it falls short of the mark. Perhaps the regular kind might be better and when one thinks about it the reduced sodium is a relative thing. Say you are making dinner for 4 and you decide to use regular broth without any salt constraints all you would have to do is refrain from adding additional salt and your probably be okey in the sodium intake department, plus you would definitely get more honest flavor than using this product. Only four packets are included with each box and that, my dear reviewers, is like liquid gold in its value. The regular Savory include 12 per box and that is a little more encouraging when you are trying to get a nice deal. If you just boiled on cup of water and dissolved one of the packets in said water and drank it you wouldn't be able to say: "Far out, this is one great cup of broth!". Much too sweet to taste really like chicken broth and perhaps you might need two of the liquid gold packets instead of one, for a truly invigorating cup. Tried it, used it and hereby give it 3 Stars at the most for this delicate, sweet tasting, sodium free version of chicken flavor.

review/summary: Chicken broth
review/text: For several years now, I've been using the Savory Choice chicken, beef, and vegetable liquid broth packets.  I've used both the regular and reduced sodium chicken broth packets.  For the many soups I make in the Rival mini-crockpot, I usually use a Savory Choice regular chicken broth packet. I first purchased a box of the broth packets at Whole Foods and later, from Amazon.  I like to make a variety of soups.  The Rival mini-crockpot will make probably 2 cups of soup.  Add fresh vegetables (or frozen meatballs), an envelope of the Savory Choice chicken stock, chopped onions, and a splash of olive oil and let the soup cook for quite awhile for the flavors to blend. Using a purchased appetizer to make a soup also works for me.

review/summary: Taste is great! Packaging leaves lots to be desired
review/text: As far as taste, there are no complaints. It is very meaty, not much sodium taste. These sticks are also only 80 calories with 45 coming from fat. It also has a fairly high 5g of protein.<br /><br />The packaging, however, sucks. These rectangular boxes are made to be displayed in a store. The edges are perforated so that the box can be torn to look like the above box. If you barely press on the sides of the box, the perforation breaks and the top of the box opens. This leads to the meat sticks being thrown out. Consequently, there are missing sticks when you receive the shipment.<br /><br />For the past few months, I have purchased 2 boxes a month on subscription. For the past 2 months, I have been missing over half of a box worth of meat sticks when they arrived. I did complain the first month and I was credited; but this month, I did not check the boxes until I had had them for a week or so. I do not feel good about complaining about this two months in a row. I will suffer this loss.<br /><br />As far as what is causing this, I can only offer conjecture. 1) Amazon is using robots to pull and pack this stock. Those robots are squeezing the boxes too tight and some of the meat sticks are slipping out in route to the shipping box. 2) The people grabbing the boxes are squeezing too tight and slinging the sticks out.<br /><br />While my kids and I thoroughly enjoy these sticks, I am cancelling my subscription. I cant keep calling to complain about no receiving all of my purchase for fear of getting banned. It is too aggravating to continue to buy these and not get what I pay for. IF the company chooses to repackage these in a box that will not tear open easily, I will set my subscription back up.

My husband, who is not GF, likes these bars as much as I do. Buying them through Amazon, particularly on auto-ship, saves me about a dollar a box over grocery store prices. Thanks Amazon!

It was sickeningly sweet. Eight grams of sugar isn't too much, but I'm used the the taste of Kashi granola bars, which don't come near the sweetness of these. Rice Krispy treats made according to the recipe with marshmallows don't even taste as sweet. It didn't taste like fruit but like some bad artificial flavor attempting to mimic fruit but falling way short. I'm sorry to be writing such a strong reaction, but this product was just yucky tasting. I don't plan on ever trying anything else from this brand. I'll stick with Kashi.

The lemon tastes like frozen lemonade; the strawberry tastes like frozen strawberries without the seeds.<br /><br />I've looked for these locally, but no one has them. Glad they're offered on Amazon, even if they are pricey.

review/text: I have tried other Italian ices, especially the ones carried at our Walmart (in western NE we don't have a lot to choose from) but these were wonderful.  Refreshing but not overly sweet.  An adult sweet ice treat!!

review/summary: Simply the best
review/text: Totally refreshing with great flavors. Our freezer is never without them in the summer.  I usually don't like at least one flavor in multi-flavor assortments, but I love all of these.  Don't think twice about buying them.

review/summary: Best Ice pop
review/text: This is by far the best Ice Pop on the market.  It is hard to find these in the stores around my house so I purchase on Amazon.  Only problem is I eat them too fast and then there gone!!!

review/text: Advertised as being "16 Pack", but the box I received only had 8 Ice's.  Other than that they are great.

review/summary: These are the Best 50 calorie treats out there!
review/text: That's right! 50 calories.  Why they don't hype that I will never know.  And the flavor is just so great.  They are so different than the regular freezer 'pops' you get in the store.  I took a box to my grandkids and now they can't get enough.  They are always asking for more.  Great for a hot afternoon treat.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GOZ43G">Wyler's Authentic Italian Ice - 16 Pack of 2oz Freeze & Serve Bars</a>
