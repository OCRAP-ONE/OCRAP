review/text: I emailed the following to Ocean Spray:<br /><br />*Blueberry Juice Cocktail<br />The new Blueberry Juice Coctail does NOT taste like Blueberry at ALL!!<br />Your add & label are misleading.  This is more like cranberry juice with a splash of blueberry.  I don't like cranberry and I am extremely disappointed.<br />Your tv ad should have the guys in the cranberries with a few blueberries - that's realistic.

review/summary: Nice taste in a "blueberry juice drink blended with two other juices from concentrate"
review/text: Ocean Spray Blueberry Juice Cocktail has a strong flavor of blueberries and a secondary flavor of grape juice with a nice finish and aftertaste of pure blueberry.  The balance between sweet and tart is perfect--Ocean Spray always seems to get this right.  It's not pure, fresh juice but then again, they aren't trying to fool anyone into thinking that it is.  Pepsi Cola actually distributes it.<br /><br />I was disappointed to see that the bottle was 15.2 fl. oz. or 450 mL when 16 oz. or 500 mL would seem to be much more logical and less chintzy, especially since the serving size is 8 oz.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed it but have to knock a star off for the tooth enamel-unfriendly  ingredients and almost total lack of nutrition as well as the tricky volume of the the bottle I tried.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Water, Cane or Beet Sugar, Blueberry Juice from Concentrate, Grape Juice from Concentrate, Apple Juice from Concentrate, Malic Acid, Natural Flavor, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Sodium Citrate<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Per 8 oz. Serving:<br />120 Calories<br />Sodium 35 mg<br />Potassium 35 mg<br />Total Carbs 29 g<br />Sugars 28 g<br />Protein 0 g<br />Vitamin C 100% RDA<br /><br />Note:  They were giving away bottles of this purple-blue drink in Greeley Square (Herald Square's beautiful little sister!) the other day and that's how I got to try it.

review/summary: Perfect for after Easter, too!
review/text: I recently bought this product here at Amazon, feeling it was possibly a risk based on one bad review out<br />of two. But personally, I have never experienced any problem with food items from Amazon so I trusted in<br />that fact when I saw these at great sale price after Easter. I do know people who love these eggs year round.<br /><br />They arrived well packed within Amazon box inside a Reese's 36-count display box. Two rows of 6 stacked 3 high.<br />The same 1.2 oz size found in the popular 6-count packages. Purchased mid-April 2012 with a Best-By<br />date of December 2012. Bright crisp, unblemished packaging.<br /><br />Last but not least, they are fresh and delicious. What more can I say?

review/text: This was delivered while the weather was still quite temperate. We brought them in immediately and the package was not warm inside. I can't prove it but I find it hard to believe this was a 2012 product. The cardboard inserts in the packages were soaked with oil. The eggs had obviously melted partially and then cooled.<br /><br />All of the other chocolate candy delivered the same day was fine.<br /><br />Reese's eggs usually have the creamiest filling of any of their products, but these had crunchy crystals within the peanut butter filling.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the quality and if my suspicions were correct and they were sold in this condition, shame on you.

It was as good as I remembered and my daughters also developed an affection for it.  The taste is strong enough that a little goes a long way.  It's especially good with sweet-potato fries and I'm thinking of ways to use it as a base for barbeque sauce.

I have been unable to find anything as good since.  The blood orange is my favorite.  I even enjoyed the grapefruit mixer despite hating grapefruit.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun cocktail that isn't too syrupy.  It only will make you 5 martinis per kit but I think it's worth it.

review/summary: A Favorite Candy
review/text: I got these first at my local gas station, and was hooked. I got my nieces hooked on them, and then they discontinued. I bought out the clearance Kazoozles, and then looked for them here.<br /><br />The candy outside is like a soft, smooth, sweet cherry twizzler, and the inside is a delish filling that really blends nicely with the outside. It's hard to describe, but if you really like good candy try it out.<br /><br />I wish they were a little cheaper, because I hate spending over $20 on candy, but the 24, 8 stick packages will be worth the price I think. They are about $1.60 at the store retail, and have 2 sticks. These have more per bag and are less then 1$ a bag. I haven't got them yet, so I will come back and comment on the freshness and size.

review/text: I actually stumbled across this chocolate by a stroke of luck when a friend offered me some.  I have to say - it was truly outstanding!  I'm a heavy Green Tea drinker so the thought of getting this same taste in chocolate was amazing.<br /><br />I consider myself a "foodie" with a broad palette, yet still, the taste profile caught me by surprise.  I have never tasted chocolate that finished with a clean, almost earthy finish.  I can only equate it to experiencing the essence of coco.  Not the heavy, weighted down version so prevalent in traditional chocolate products.<br /><br />Can't wait to try the other TOK products.

review/summary: WATKINS  PURE PEPPERMINT EXTRACT from Amazon
review/text: Watkins product is as good if not better than I remember it as a kid, when my Mother bought it from the Watkins Man that visited all of the Rural homes in my home town of Arkansas years ago. I was so pleased that I could get this in an 8 ounce bottle, and not the 1 or 2 ounce bottle that you get at the regular grocery store. It is Pure, and the strength and flavor of it is phenominal. I really loved it in my Irish Mint Walnut Brownie Recipe, as well as my Peppermint Pattie Candy Recipe.For the recipes you can go to Just A Pinch Recipe Club, and type in my name, and you will find the recipe I used , with this top QUALITY INGREDIENT. I am so happy that I found it at a reasonable price from Amazon. The quality is unchanged. It is the BEST. Especially if you do a lot of cooking as I do. I also ordered 2 bottle of the Orange Extract, and it is just as good as ever also. I LOVE WATKINS PRODUCTS, and I love that Amazon carries it, and I order enough that I get free shipping. Thanks AMAZON & WATKINS FOR delivering a great product at a reasonable price, compared to other companies. You REALLY ROCK AMAZON AS ALWAYS. I Rely on you and your great company for so many of my daily needs. Thanks so much.

review/summary: Worst Chicken Noodle Soup I've Ever Had...
review/text: These are one of the new "light" soups Campbell has created. I wanted something with a little less salt, so I chose the Chicken with Egg Noodles. I shared this soup with a friend of mine. We both agreed that the chicken broth was horrible. Salt wasn't the problem, there was a particular herb flavor that just didn't belong in the soup. Everything else was fine. The egg noodles were still firm. The chicken were in big chunks though there just weren't that many. The veggies were good too, the celery and carrots were not mushy at all. However, I simply cannot recommend anyone purchasing this because of the horrible broth and the lack of chicken and veggies. It's mostly water in a can.

review/summary: Superb Teas!
review/text: After receiving a gift card for Amazon, I had to buy this tea sampler box.  My wife and I both love tea and have it at least every other day if not more often.  We particularly love samplers too since we have different tea tastes.  I really love the Nana (mint) tea, the lemon and the raspberry.  She loves the English breakfast and Earl Grey.  My highest compliment is that these Wissotzky teas taste real, unlike many other flavored teas that often don't taste as you'd expect.  When you brew a cup of lemon tea - guess what... you get delicious lemon-tasting tea.  The box is nice.  Nothing special, but a nice clean look and I really like the inside lid's labeling that gives a little information on each tea flavor in case you're not sure what flavor you want any given day.  Oh yeah, the other great thing about this sampler are there aren't any "filler" flavors.  Each flavor is unique and delicious and I'm sure we'll happily finish the entire box and be back for more.

review/text: The description does not mention anywhere that "nana" is mint. I probably would not have ordered this assortment if I'd known that -- I absolutely detest mint, though I was able to pass the 10 mint tea bags to someone else. But as a result, I've paid for 8 varieties and gotten 7.<br /><br />Saying that, the others look to be good. The cherry tea has a wonderful fragrance, for example, so although I've not tasted all of the 7 I like what I've tried and gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />It's the usual problem with assortments: you can't control the mix. I got this because there looked like some flavors I really wanted, and it got a good review for quality. But it would be so much better if there were some way I could CHOOSE the flavors from a listing.

review/summary: The best mix
review/text: I first tried this mix about 6 years ago when I lived in Arizona. This is the most amazing margarita mix. It is very natural tasting, not too sweet, and not too tart.<br /><br />In addition to making fantastic Margarita's I also use it as an ingredient for marinating Fajita's; both Chicken and Skirt steak.<br /><br />I could buy this locally in the AJ's stores in Scottsdale. When I moved back to Chicago, I was lucky to find this mix at Cost Plus world markets. Unfortunately, they no longer stock it.<br /><br />I can order on the web, but shipping is a killer, and no free shipping on this.

review/text: I make margueritas for a number of friends who are marguerita fans.  They all agree...this stuff is yummy!  Especially when combined with a top shelf tequila.  When ordering, shipping is expensive for a single bottle.  But ordering multiple bottles only slightly increases the shipping charge and keeps the total cost per bottle much more reasonable.

review/summary: NEVER AGAIN!!!
review/text: This product has made my dog SO sick! She hasn't stopped throwing up for the past hour and is clearly in pain after eating a Dentastix. I recently found out about how bad of a brand Pedigree is. Their Beneful food has killed dogs!!! When the owner of the dog contacted Pedigree about the incident they sent her coupons for more of their products, talk about heartless. Before posting this I read about several stories of some other very sick dogs after eating Dentastix. Never again will I buy another Pedigree product. They clearly do not care about the well being of animals and shouldn't even be on shelves anymore if you ask me!

review/text: These are the 1st dental chews that are making a noticeable difference in my dogs' teeth.  They are also the perfect size (large) for my medium size shelties.  I have had problems in the past with detail sticks getting caught in one of my dog's intestines.  After a $200 vet bill, I was very hesitant to use them again, but my dogs have not had a problem digesting these.  The ridges force them to take their time chewing.  They are a little more pricey than other brands, but with the subscription price and easy digestion, they are WELL worth it!  These in combination with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PICL5E">PetzLife Oral Care Spray, Peppermint, 2.2 ounces</a> make health teeth and happy dogs!

review/text: My German Shepherd, who is 100 lbs., would chew up bones like a hot knife through butter, and naturally, I've decided not to get her simple bones since her sensitive stomach would force her to throw up. So, over time, she'll have tartar problems as evidenced on her teeth. Looking around the store, I've decided to try the Dentastix and gave one to my dog. I had my skepticism due to the size of sticks yet was advertised for large dogs. Needless to say, my dog literally ate the whole thing within seconds without attempting to chew. So, there went a wasted product. Time for me to return it for a refund.

review/summary: Now this is a morning tea!
review/text: I have never been a coffee person, even in the morning.  Instead, I like a good hot cup (pot) of tea either before of after breakfast. Unfortunately, I never found a tea that kept my interest.<br /><br />I tried the normal supermarket brands.  The normal imports of English Breakfast and Irish Breakfast.  Nothing held my interest, so except on the really cold days, I skipped morning tea and had a flavored tea around mid-morning.<br /><br />One winter day, while ordering a couple of Kusmi flavored brands (Trioka & Prince Vladimir), I thought why not give their morning tea a try? My first pot full told me this was no ordinary morning tea.  Full flavored with enough caffeine to keep me alert, but without the wired feeling that coffee can give.<br /><br />Too often, flavored teas can give the hint that the creators are using flavorings to hide cheap tea leaves.  Not so with the Kusmi flavored blends, so I expected that I could chance this blend.  I was correct. The tea stands alone with a flavor that is a pure tea blend with a pleasant flavor.<br /><br />Now I should point out that I drink my tea in loose leaf form.  I cannot speak for how their Morning Tea is in the bag.  But if you are searching for a quality cuppa for your mornings, I would try Kusmi's blend loose or in the bag.

I think it works perfectly as a Milk Substitute, My family uses it in our cereal, as a regular glass to dip with cookies etc. I would give it a 5/5 but it would be better if they offered a smaller package size to start with, I was a bit hesitant on ordering a large case since I wanted to taste it first, I have only had the package a month and already have gone through 3 packs/bottles but I understand the hesitation some would feel ordering it the first time

review/summary: A bit different, and wonderful
review/text: These peppercorns are a beautiful rosy color, which clues you in before you even get a chance to open the package that they're not the peppercorns you've known all your life. When you do pull open the bag and inhale their aroma, you'll find they combine the scent of pepper with a wonderful fruity, almost floral overtone. It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse. It was a memorably different flavor. Now I'm looking for ways to add them to more dishes, to see what new nuances they can impart to old favorites.

review/summary: Wonderful aroma!
review/text: When I opened the package a wonderful aroma was greeting me! This was the first time I experimented with Szechuan Peppercorns. They are not really peppercorns but husks. You have to dry roast them for a few minutes then grind them. I used them in a oil based marinade for my chicken dish...very yummy and pleasantly unusual. Delivery was fast and the peppercorns appear to be super fresh.

review/summary: Not seed-free
review/text: Although these are said to be "hull-only," there are still a lot of seeds--so much so that I can't cook with these until I have sorted through and removed all the little black devils lurking amongst the delicious hulls. If you find that your dishes have an unpleasantly gritty texture, the seeds are to blame. Delicious, but not as advertised.

review/text: I ordered an 8 oz. package of peppercorns...wow, just wow...that is a LOT of peppercorns. Unless you expect to use these a lot, think about a smaller package! I may be using these in the nursing home.<br /><br />My package arrived quickly, and was well packed. Looking at a previous review that insisted the package was lightweight, I weighed my bag of peppercorns upon arrival and it was exactly 8 oz. So I wouldn't be too concerned about a lightweight package.<br /><br />These peppercorns are beautiful, with a lively flavor and plump appearance. They are not shriveled like many peppercorns. I used them to make Kung Pao chicken and ZING they about burned my face off! But in a good way. Such peppery, fresh, citrusy hot flavor. Love them!!!<br /><br />If I ever run out (ever)...I will reorder from this seller!

There are a few black centers still but it's much better quality than the local Asian grocery at roughly the same price.  As someone else noted 8oz. is a LOT of pepper -- it may take a while to use all this up.

review/summary: Healthy, But Doesn't Taste Like Carrot Juice At All
review/text: I love pure carrot juice, and have been drinking it for years, either fresh squeezed or refrigerated.  This is the only non-fresh, non-refrigerated form of carrot juice I've ever encountered.  It contains nothing but organic carrot juice and 1% lemon juice.  I like the fact that it's organic, because carrots tend to accumulate chemicals (such as pesticides), and since it takes a lot of carrots to make a serving of juice, I'd rather not drink non-organic carrot juice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't like the taste of the product at all.  It's sour, probably because of the lemon juice, and lacks any of the sweetness or carrot flavor I associate with carrot juice. I asked the company about this and, to its credit, it promptly informed me that the product includes lemon juice to lower the pH and allow it to be flash pasteurized, which in turn allows storage without refrigeration, but greatly affects the flavor. I'm sure the company would offer a better-tasting bottled carrot juice without refrigeration or preservatives if it could, but until it does I won't buy it again.  But it does contain lots of nutrients.

review/summary: Even Mr. Bi...Witch & Moan Loves It
review/text: A few years ago, my cat was diagnosed with food allergies that previously undiagnosed had led to IBD and then Pancreatitis. We went through just about every limited ingredient food to find one he would eat consistently.  He finally settled on Nature's Variety Instinct. Lamb and Rabbit he'll eat every time and all the time. Duck and Venison, he'll also eat just not always.<br /><br />He still suffers from IBD and will have pancreatitis flare ups if given chicken, but his coat is soft and shiny. He's active (at 13 yrs old). And he rarely throws up. I couldn't survive, he couldn't survive, without this food.<br /><br />I'm glad the company finally started to make 3 oz cans. Mr. Picky doesn't doesn't like leftovers. It doesn't hurt as much to toss out 1.5 oz as it does 4 oz.

review/summary: Best cat food!
review/text: I love giving this food to my cats, but more importantly, they love being fed this food!  It is a coarse pate and I have learned that you have to be careful when you open it, or you will get the liquid surrounding the food on you and the counter.  I just open it carefully and empty the liquid in the bowl first and then cut up the main food.  I have read some reviews where customers didn't like it being so dry, but I'm OK with that.  I always add a little water to my cats food anyway so I'm not worried about them not getting enough.  I would rather pay for food and add my own water than to get some of the foods that are over 80% moisture.  I feel like I am paying for water with those, but not with this.  Good deal for a very good food.

review/summary: My sickly and finnicky kitty now has a sleek coat and loves his food!
review/text: We have 5 cats, all of whom are pampered and loved.  I bought this food when one of my special guys lost a lot of weight and became sickly.  His coat was ragged and sad looking, and he looked thin.  Of course, we went to the vet, and got an infection treated (thank goodness it was treatable), but the vet thought that he might have a problem with wheat.  So we tried this food, and although it is expensive, I count it as cheap because of the change that my guy has had.  The food itself looks more like meat than usual canned cat food, but the real proof is in the excitement with which my boy eats!  Now, his coat is sleek and healthy looking.  Instead of nosing the food and then walking away, he eagerly eats it.  He has gained weight. He is frisky again, which I never thought I would see.  He had been so listless, and now with a little weight on him, he is playful and happy once more.  I think that his antibiotic therapy did a lot for him, but I think that this food helped provide him the nutrition to complete his recovery.  And the wheat issue? I have no idea if it is real or not, but now I'm probably not going to go back to our old food, at least for a good long while.  Love the Nature's Valley food.

review/summary: Good product, but very expensive.
review/text: I just rescued a cat and have been trying to find a good food for him. I got him about 3 months ago. He was overweight and not very active. I had him on Blue Buffalo Wilderness, which he really enjoyed. His coat was better and he was losing weight and being more active. Then I read about how canned food is better for cats, because of the extra moisture, so I ordered Instinct for him. He's been on it for a month, and I haven't noticed any added benefits over the less expensive Blue Buffalo. Instinct canned food is so much more expensive, but I would have been willing to keep him on it if I had noticed a significant weight loss or behavior change, which I didn't. I think I'll be getting him the Blue Buffalo again. If you can afford to feed instinct canned food to your cat, it is a really high quality food. I'm just not sure it's worth the money.<br /><br />One tip, though, if you are trying to help your cat lose weight, definitely go with a grain-free food. He was on a Purina Prescription weight loss food when I brought him home. When I switched to grain-free, I noticed a huge difference in just a week. One big plus, the cat box doesn't fill up as fast because he eats less of the food, since it has fewer fillers and more nutrients.

review/summary: Higher in calories and fat compares to other Instinct cat food formulas
review/text: I am a firm believer that cats should eat good meat (lots of protein, average on fat, and grain- and gluten-free) and that is why I feed my cat only grain-free canned food or raw meat.  I successfully managed to get my cat to lose weight from 19.75 lbs to 14 lbs after 10 months of strict diet.  However, after I fed him 2 packages of this lamb formula cat food, he gains 1.5 lb in 2 months.  This lamb formula has 11% of protein, 8.5 % of fat, and a whooping 141 calories per 3 oz can!  Since I give cat 2 cans per day, that is 40 calories he does not need!  No wonder he gains so much weight...  I am back to the duck, chicken, and beef formula.

My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk. It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their "flavors" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is "good" food, I can't imagine the crud you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you! Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.

review/summary: Lenin is dead, long live the Prince!
review/text: Sing in me oh muse on this snow day, and let me proclaim the many virtues of this fine tea. The scent and flavor of this tea are as close to my conception of ambrosia as anything else that has yet crossed my palate. It is full without being overbearing, it is seasoned without being overpowering. It's great with anything from English breakfast fare to hardy curry.<br /><br />Since conception, I have been in love with tea, but "the Prince" was my first fine tea. I have still not recovered from the episode in which my father-in-law-to-be proved to me that bag tea was a crime against humanity. And yet despite amorous flirtations with rare white teas and other wondrous Indian and Chinese estate varieties with unpronounceable names, it's still my favourite.<br /><br />Never mind the tea purist snobs who rank on it because it's flavored with spice. Would they send back a fine filet because the chef elected to use some pepper or shallots? Ignore the herbal tea-totalers who regard caffeine as sinful. They probably want to outlaw yoga on Sunday too.<br /><br />Of the five or so Kousmichoff varieties I've had, this one is the clear winner. I've gotten my best results using HOT water steeping for five to six minutes. The stuff is potent enough that you can get, gasp, a reasonably tannin-free second infusion.<br /><br />My only reservation is this; once you've entered the universe of fine tea, you can never be satisfied drinking Lipton, Salada, Twinings or Tetley again. In guise of gifts, I have managed to get many of my gastronome friends and relations addicted so that I may sup of it when I visit. Isn't it a delicious irony that perhaps the greatest bourgeoisie decadence of the Romanoff dynasty is  today preserved by our friends in socialist France? Viva la Revolution!<br /><br />rws, 26/1/05

review/text: This is a delicious black China tea blend presented in a beautiful, highly giftable tin box.<br /><br />This tea is available in 35 oz, 8.8oz, 4.4oz and tea bags; I usually get the 4.4oz tin as I am the only black tea lover in the house. One tin of 4.4 oz is enough for one large cup a day for ~3 months so I am guessing ~100 cups (I use a 1.5' mesh infuser).<br />As usual with Kusmi, the tin is beautiful, with raised flower details and old-fashioned design and colors.<br /><br />The blend is a glistening black tea with pieces of citrus peel.<br />The nose is reminiscent of a bergamot Earl Grey with spicier notes that I would describe as all-spice, nutmeg and even a hint of turmeric.<br />The mouth is smooth, low tannins, with beautiful layered flavors of vanilla and soft spices and a savory-sweet finish.<br /><br />Kusmi recommend a brewing temperature of 85c to 90c (~185F to 195F) so make sure the water sits for a few moments after boiling before pouring over the tea. I usually like a rather long infusion time, maybe 5 to 7 minutes. I do not add anything to this tea but a sweetener would probably work if you like.<br /><br />To my knowledge, Prince Vladimir was one of Kusmi's first blend in the late 1800's and remain one of the most popular. I would highly recommend it to lovers of complex flavored black teas. In particular, if you already appreciate some higher-end bagged teas (Mighty Leaf Vanilla Bean or Orange Dulce?), I think you should give this superior blend a try.<br />Cheers!

Being a person who generally likes my tea and coffee black with no flavoring whatsoever, I was rather suspicious of the orange, grapefruit, and other extra 'scents'.  However, I was delighted with the concoction.  The extras are definately present, giving a slightly citric quality to the tea but are not the least bit overpowering and provide a unique  aroma that is quite pleasing.<br /><br />I do recommend steeping it for a long time to get the most out of the leaves, especially if you are to get the citric scents that make it so unique.

They have great flavors, melt in your mouth, and stay with you once you're done, and once you have one, you can't stop there.  A great gift to any friend!

review/summary: Best Lollypops!
review/text: I order these through Amazon since I moved away from the West Coast and can't get them locally any more.  They are wonderfully flavorful and creamy, they're silky except for the chocolate which has a very slight nubby texture as you go.  My favorites are the chocolate and the butterscotch, but the vanilla and the latte are very good.  Whenever I put them out for others to take, they're always surprised at how good they are.<br /><br />The only down side is the same one you get with any hard candy, sometimes you get sharp edges as they get smaller.

review/summary: The best Chocolate Ever
review/text: I first saw these in Dubai.  It was the best Chocolate I ever had.  I bought a bunch to bring home but didn't have a whole lot of luck finding it here in the States.  Then I saw this on Amazon.  I ordered it as a surprise for my husband.  It's a little pricey but worth every dime.
