review/text: This is by far the best coffee I've ever tasted.  I drink coffee black so I'm a comparison shopper for gourmet beans.  While it is expensive, you can taste the difference.  It definitely has a woodsy flavor with no aftertaste.  It's pure.<br /><br />Although I wouldn't drink it every day - it's an awesome treat and highly recommended for those that can appreciate it.

review/summary: Not What I Expected...
review/text: I bought this Kona brand of beans based on reviews and think the responses are somewhat exaggerated. I would imagine that some of these reviews are employees or friends of Aloha Island Coffee?  After shipping I paid $27.45 for a bag of beans that are okay, but nowhere near phenomenal as the review rave. Milestone brand found in most supermarkets retails $10 a pound and easily rivals the flavor of this brand. I will accept the fact that my disapproval may be due to my specific low acidic taste requirements. I do not like strong coffee with a bitter overtone, albeit this medium roast is on the strong side.<br /><br />In favor of Aloha Island Coffee, they did not hesitate to refund my money, keeping true to their claim of 100% satisfaction guaranteed.

review/summary: An excellent Kona blend.
review/text: The Diamond II is great. Rich but very smooth, not bitter at all. This is one that people will try and comment on without knowing anything about the coffee beforehand. I ordered it as a present for my dad, who loves coffee, but as soon as he brewed a pot it disappeared because of the amazing aroma. Everyone would suddenly decide to have coffee once they could smell it. The only people who didn't seem to really enjoy it both drink coffee that I find revolting. My stepbrother, who regularly drinks coffee that's been heated all day, and his girlfriend, who loves instant coffee, thought it was too weak. My advice: if you really love good coffee, then keep the Kona for yourself.<br /><br />Caveats: other reviewers imply that this is 100% Kona. It is not. It is a blend, although a very good one. Also, it is a medium roast.

review/summary: Fatal Flavor Flaw
review/text: Roland Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce have a strange and unpleasant, vaguely chemical taste that is hard to describe, slightly metallic, perhaps an artificial smoke flavor or dried spices.  Roland doesn't generally manufacture their own products but private-labels those from other manufacturers and I have to wonder who cans these.<br /><br />Other brands that I have tried like San Marcos and Casa Fiesta are much better and cleaner tasting.  My advice is to buy one of those brands or at least try one can before committing to a case of these if you haven't tasted them.<br /><br />Besides this fatal flavor flaw they are pretty much the same as any other chipotle in adobo, nice whole peppers swimming in sauce, smoky and addictive to people who like to eat hot peppers.  They will squirt when you bite them so I usually cut them in half in the kitchen.<br /><br />Bottom line, I have been using them in recipes where they lend heat and the flavor will be buried but I can't eat them with chips or use them as a sauce on top of anything because of the flavor and I won't be ordering them again.

review/summary: Jerky Cannon
review/text: WOW this jerky cannon is really NICE I mean super NICE. for many years I've been using the Nesco jerky works jerky maker yes the red & white cheap piece of plastic thingy LOL. I've been wanting to replace that for years just never got around to doing it. I just happened to see this jerky cannon and thought I would try it out. well I'm kicking my self for not buying this years ago as soon as I opened the box and seen this thing my Nesco jerky works thingy went right in the GARBAGE. now for this jerky cannon this thing is SUPER nice heavy duty and works fantastic. this cannon is big and very well made and should last a life time. the barrel it self is just under 15" long & is solid Alum, the push rod is solid steal, the nozzles are solid seal, the handles are plastic coated steal as well. over all length from end to end is 22" long. it also comes with a brush to clean the barrel very nice. it also comes with two packs of backwoods jerky mix, looking forward to trying that out and comparing it to the Hi Mountain stuff I've been using. the only thing left to say is about this L.E.M jerky cannon is this is well made & solid and WELL worth the money. I would highly recommend buying this I'm VERY VERY happy with this product well done L.E.M. will also be buying the double jerky nozzle & the 6" round nozzle for stuffing casings.

review/text: Much better than the plastic one I owned before. I make Jerky from Ground beef for my booth at a local market. I produce on average 15 pounds a week. This gun makes it easier bye reducing the amount of refills. It is a little clumsy given it's large size. But not needing to refill so often, helps. Metal tube is a winner. Just be careful of air pockets. This builds up unwanted pressure. Thats how I shattered the plastic one.

The only plastic parts are the thread on ends and the piston itself, and those are probably around three-eighths of an inch thick.  It was very quick and easy to setup and use.  The brush made cleaning it quick and easy as well.  This should last forever, unlike the Nesco jerky gun I previously had.

review/summary: Best Value Out There
review/text: I've been buying jerky for, oh, 40 years. This is one of my favorites. It's salty but not too salty. It's not shredded and re-formed but instead solid slabs of beef. The product has always been moist when I received it. And to top it off, the price is very competitive with other quality jerkys. Can you buy another brand cheaper at the outlet store? Sure, if price is your only driver. But if you want actual good jerky at a good price, this is an excellent choice.

review/text: Do I need to say more? This is the best jerky I've ever had, and quite different from the usual stringy stuff that sticks between your teeth for weeks. Is it possible that this is composed of separate chunks mashed together? Possibly, but the result is the most tender jerky ever, with no hint of fat or gristle. The only downside I can think of is that because it's so much easier to eat and chew, you could go through an entire pack before you know it.

review/text: I bought this at Walmart because it was cheaper than buying the envelopes. It says to refrigerate it after opening and to use it in six months. I did just that. When I first opened it, my bread rose very well and had no problems. The next time I made it, it wasn't so great and the breads got shorter and shorter as time went on.<br /><br />I really am not a typical bread baker so I cannot compare it to others. I just know that this is really only good if used quickly.<br /><br />Besides, the price here is absolutely too high. At present, it's  $19.49 + $5.49 shipping = $24.98. That's $8.33 a jar! I checked my local Walmart just yesterday, it's $3.98 a jar.

review/summary: Low Quality and Substandard Rising
review/text: I've been baking for many years, and have been making my own artisan bread. I have used this yeast for a long time in the past, but I suspect when the company changed hands in 2004 something happened to the production, as the yeast has decreased in quality by a GREAT amount since then.<br /><br />This yeast, while it does work, is not active enough to properly make REALLY good bread. This is a "get by" kind of yeast that should be bought in a grocery store as a last resort.<br /><br />The yeast needs a significant amount of added sugar to properly activate, and even then this is unreliable. I have had some batches of this yeast simply fail to proof at all. Generally only good for pan baking, as opposed to freeform or artisan baking. The yeast does not provide enough leavening during the baking process to rise the loaf in the oven after the transfer to the baking stone. (Transfer in artisan bread tends to degass the dough slightly). Loaves end up flat and the crumb very dense.<br /><br />If you are truly serious about your baking I highly suggest picking up some SAF instant yeast, or if you are stuck with buying it last minute get some of the Red Star yeast packets. SAF is superior (as is instant yeast), but either of those options will provide you with better results than Fleischmann's.

review/summary: Next best thing to Brach's
review/text: I'm not going to argue for or against circus peanuts as an idea; you either love them or loathe them, and I happen to adore them, though I understand why you wouldn't. They're bright orange marshmallows shaped like huge peanuts and flavored like bananas. The inventor must have been on some serious drugs to think this was a good idea.<br /><br />But there is wide variance in quality between the brands. The very best -- lovely soft texture, bright color, just enough fake banana flavor -- are made by Brach's, which are quite hard to get online unless you want to buy them by the case. These are not quite as good as Brach's, but they're pretty good -- texture mostly soft with small patches of crystal, good color, fake banana flavor almost just right.

review/summary: Best marshmellow-based orange-colored banana-flavored candy ever
review/text: Circus peanuts are delicious, they are quite possibly the best candy ever invented.  As long as you get them when they're somewhat fresh and aren't so hard that they destroy your teeth when you try to bite into them, that makes it rather difficult to get all of the circus peanut goodness out of them.

review/summary: Ode to the Circus Peanut
review/text: How do you say DELICIOUS with 2 words? Circus Peanut. The artificial banana flavoring always makes my mouth water. If you are lucky you'll get a peanut from the original batch made in the 1800's! I like to give these out to the ungrateful neighborhood cretins at Halloween, but they just repay my kind gesture by egging my house.

review/text: I had to return this item. The peanuts were not marshmallow at all, but hard as rocks. I doubt it would be humanly possible to bite and/or chew these peanuts. They were all stuck together in the package and there was residue all over the inside of the bag. I'm not sure if they are super old or the bag was not sealed properly. The bag I received was from sweetgourmet.com. First item I have ever had to return to Amazon. We are prime too so we are buying on here a few times a week

review/summary: Taste Like I Remembered
review/text: I used these circus peanuts in goody bags for toddlers.  Our theme was "Leaving On A Jet Plane" and since airlines used to give peanuts as a snack, decided I wanted to give out circus peanuts.  Circus peanuts are difficult to find in stores.  The brand I did find was harder than a rock so I took a chance and ordered online.  These circus peanuts arrived soft and fresh.  I ate one to make sure they were soft enough for the toddlers and they actually were!  They also tasted like I remembered from my childhood.  Each individual peanut was also bigger than the brand I had looked at in the store.  If I need circus peanuts again, I'll definitely buy this brand!

review/text: I love these fruit punch packets.  I have a sweet tooth, and I also love to cram food in my mouth in the evening when I sit down to read a book.  I seem to have a need to read while I'm eating, and also a need to eat when I'm reading, even if I'm not hungry.  Since I *love* to read, reading can put me in danger of destroying my waistline.  So, I mix a packet of fruit punch into a tall glass of cold water, stir well, then add ice and a sipping straw.  Very sweet and satisfying, and I don't notice an artificial sweetener taste at all.  I'll easily drink 3 of these a night, and it keeps me from eating junk food while I read.

I use this, frequently mixed with the pomegranate variety in a large jug, and I'm good to go. I also frequently mix one of these with the new K2O pink lemonade with protein & fiber since weight loss is always an issue, and this definitely perks up the somewhat bland pink lemonade. I'm on subscribe & save which makes this a real bargain.

review/summary: My favorite "singles" flavor
review/text: This is the flavor of Crystal Light that I loved as a kid, now available in small single serve packages.  The only difference is that I now use one packet to flavor TWO 16.9 oz bottles because the flavor is quite potent.  I carry bottled water with me everywhere, so this is a nice change of pace.  It quenches thirst better and is an improvment over soda, though after paying for bottled water and the Crystal Light, it's about the same price, if not a little more expensive.  I'm giving this 5 stars because Fruit Punch is my favorite flavor of all the brands and flavors of single-serves that I've tried, however it really is too sweet for a single serving unless you're craving Kool-Aid level sweetness.

review/summary: Loved it even though I thought I hated Crystal Light
review/text: I, at least used to, hate Crystal Light. I always found the aspartame to be a little too heavy, and after drinking a Light mix I'd get a sort of irritation that felt like I had a sinus condition. Whatever that issue was, I don't have it at all with this drink mix. I'm not sure if that has to due with a perfected recipe or a change in my body's chemistry, but either way I'm happy to enjoy this mix.<br /><br />So what do you get? At the time of writing, this product was being sold with 10 packets at a relative cost of under a dollar per packet. Considering the quality of the product, that's a good deal. Pop a packet a day to mix up your drinking water, and one box can last two work weeks. Not bad. To note, this is the sort of packet that flavors one roughly twenty-ounce bottle of water at a time, instead of the larger variety that might do a whole pitcher at a time.<br /><br />The flavor is, to me, Kool-Aid Fruit Punch. This is a high praise, as I remember Kool-Aid's fruit punch flavor fondly from my childhood. Of course we're trading sugar for aspartame, so there is a difference in the final effect, but the flavor is there. And the aspartame isn't bad. This tastes like a light fruit punch, it does not taste overly much of artificial sweetener. There's never any grittiness, nor does the flavor linger for too long as a sugary drink might.<br /><br />The packet also mixes very well. Drop the contents into a covered cup or bottle of water, and I'd reccomend shaking but it doesn't take too much work to stir. Not once has the mix formed any undissolved chunks or required excessive shaking or stirring in my experience, while I have sometimes seen this with off-brands.<br /><br />So it's a high-quality, tasty drink mix. I couldn't ask for more.

But I saw this in my organic food aisle and I took a shot. Yummy! I ate it with some organic texmati brown rice with some fresh dill. Wonderful.<br /><br />I'm one of those that follows the body for bloodtype diet. I'm AB positive. Unfortunately, meat intake is limited to lamb and turkey. I can seriously get bored with that. And shrimp is out. I love shrimp being asian. But salmon is great for me. I was debating on going online to buy wild salmon online and it just was too expensive for me to buy in bulk.<br /><br />Obviously you're going to pay a bit more for it. But ask yourself how much does your health cost to you in the long run? People spend far to much money tricking out their car. Or clothes and makeup to look gorgeous. I admit I do put in the effort to look attractive on the outside. However what about inside your body?<br /><br />I can't believe they sell this on Amazon. I never buy food online but never say never. I think I'll make an exception. This stuff is great. And based on my own protein intake per day this makes for two meals. And I'm a 5'1" athlete. Single and on the go. I still save money compared to going to a gourmet sushi restaurant to get fresh fish. And what's great about this company is they are eco-conscious. Part of their proceeds they donate to help support marine conservation. A++++ overall. Thanks for putting out a quality product that makes me feel healthy and contributing to the conservation of the global community.

review/text: (I have had roughly 30 cans of this. ) 2 stars stands for I don;t like it. 3 stars is "it's OK". But I don;t think what I have been experienceing is OK for the price and hype.<br /><br />There is no denying how good this salmon is, it's premium wild salmon. But! The quality varies can to can. Which is unfortunate.<br /><br />For instance:<br /><br />Can 1: A nice almost single filet with medium chunks.<br />Can 2: Medium Chunks of fillet with some flakey tiny tiny pieces. Big pieces of struvite.<br />Can 3 and 4: Like Light tuna like consistency (gross and not warranting this high price), basically like filler. Lots of small struvite particles. Like biting into rocks, glass, crystals, etc.<br /><br />I decided not to buy this stuff anymore, as I like more of the fillet, or medium size chunks. I got too many cans that were flakey stuff, the same consistency as light tuna is. WAY too expensive for the inconsistant quality. Addressing the struvite, while it is commonly known that it is a mineral and natural, and that it is rare to get...I tend to doubt it...unless I have won the struvite lottery.Conistantly with my order of 4 cans, there are two cans that contain it. Generally the ones that have the flakey filler in the whole can. While most if it is small, I have had what looked like a geode, about .75 inches long, and .5 incles high, fanned out crystal. No way my teeth could crunch it. This is entirely too high for me, and nothing ruins an almost $5 can of salmon like crystals inside.<br /><br />My theory is that they noticed their salmon had huge struvite particles (Can 2), and started to almost puree the stuff (can 3 and 4) to save from a loss, or to pass the buck the the consumer. Which does not go unnoticed.<br /><br />This is how I view it and it is my opinion. If it was $2 a can I would buy more, but the supermarket alternatives are less expensive, and while most of those do not have the occasional fillet piece, I feel it is a better value over all. If the quality control was better on these, I would be buying them every week, but consistancy needs a lot of work, and company either needs a better QC supervisor, or to lower the price. The quality does not match what is advertised in the 30 or so cans I have had. You be the judge.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Out of all canned on market - these are the best yet!
review/text: I absolutely love this brand and we have tried many of them. We used to order Wild Planet but ever since the earthquake in Japan we got weary since they pack theirs there. This company claims to be packed and shipped from Alaska and that makes me feel a little more comfortable. My husband and I have chemical sensitivities and so many foods are off limits for us. We tolerate this very well and feel a difference in taste and quality. I highly recommend trying this kind. I saw one review badly rate due to "glass-like" substances - that's bones. They rarely have bones in them but on occasion you will get some bones BUT it isn't as bad as some out there and really people - it's seafood! You are going to get bones here and there - otherwise go buy some spam. lol... Anyway, highly recommend!!!

review/summary: NOT BPA FREE!!  Enough to make you flip your lid!
review/text: As you can see, the company has a prominent PBA FREE CAN seal on the label.  If you look closely, perhaps with a magnifier,  you will see an tiny asterisk after the word "CAN", however, there is no corresponding asterisk on that side of the box.  On the back of the box, in an inconspicuous place, at the bottom, underneath the recycling information and the larger print address and email address, in tiny print you will see "*lid not included. Obviously the company believes it is important for consumers to know if their product is BPA free, as they clearly state it on the front of the box in LARGE LETTERS, so isn't it deceptive that the description does not apply to the lid, which is indeed part of the can?  Even if I were not concerned about ingesting BPA, I still would not support a company that would intentionally mislead their customers, especially in matters of health and safety.

review/text: When I saw on the label it contained salmon, water "And nothing else!"  I immediately purchased it and continue to do so.  Love salmon. Love WILD Salmon. And I love even more being able to TRUST a product NOT to slip in MSG in one form or another.  I make salmon paddies and loaf and sometimes just eat it from the can. I just wish they would make red salmon as well.  Actually, it's not that much more expensive than pink salmon you buy in the store, but it is BETTER.  I have it on auto and plan to leave it there as long as Henry and Lisa produce it.  Highly, highly, highly recommend.

review/summary: It was great until they got rid of the attached can opener
review/text: This used to be my must-have food for my hiking, biking or xc skiing trips, but no longer so since the maker changed their cans.<br /><br />It is superior in terms of taste than most of other brands I tried (from Wholefoods) for two reasons:<br />- It uses wild Alaskan pink salmon. This type of salmon has higher fat content and is much more tastier than the leaner/dryer sockeye salmon.<br />- It is canned in its own juice instead of spring water.<br /><br />I have had the older version (the one w/ attached can opener) for years. The new can does not have opener anymore as of July 2012 at Amazon and Wholefoods. The product picture is outdated. As I buy these cans strictly for my outdoor trips, attached can opener was a crucial feature to me. Therefore, I take off 2 star for this product.<br /><br />For now, I will stick to their canned tuna that is still packed in cans with an opener.

review/text: I like this the least of the three lavender extracts I've tried. For my palette, there is an unpleasant, harsh, chemical aftertaste.<br /><br />I understand that not everyone tastes things the same way. I often find the same taste in artificially-sweetened products with xylitol and sorbitol.

When I ate the dried Bhut Jolokia pepper my face turned red and my nose ran, going right to the fridge to grab some milk. With this puree, none of that happened.  Sure it's spicy, but if you're looking for the hottest pepper ever, it's probably better to just get the actual pepper itself, and not this puree.

review/summary: Sparkling Ice Coconut Pineapple
review/text: This is one of my favorite sparkling ice flavors.  It has a nice tropical taste and decent ingredients, making it a good substitute for soda for me.<br /><br />What I really taste in this soda is the pineapple.  That's the most predominant flavor with the coconut being very light.  It does put me in mind sometimes of a alcoholic tropical drink, but maybe that's just because that's where those flavors end up mostly.  It's rare to see a non-alcoholic drink incorporate the same flavors.  And I liked the fizziness the carbonation added, it's one of my favorite elements of a drink.<br /><br />The ingredients are good although sucralose is the sweetener, which I'm not a big fan of.  I would prefer real sugar if anything.  But it uses natural flavors and spring water, and the ingredient list is relatively short compared to a lot of other things.  Best of all, it's zero calories, so I don't have to feel too guilty when I drink it.  And they even throw a few vitamins into the mix.<br /><br />Great soda and one that I buy several times a week.  It never seems to grow old.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: While the product did taste exactly as it's described - pineapple with coconut - it was far too sweet for our taste. This extra sweetness is surprising in a zero-calorie drink. We decided to use our remaining bottles in mixed drinks at social events. We are fans, however, of the other flavors we tried, which had just the right amount of sweetness and bite. So, no need to avoid the entire ICE line - just, maybe, this one if you don't like super-sweet drinks.

review/summary: Amazing !!
review/text: I picked a bottle of this up randomly at the local supermarket after tiring of diet coke ALL the time.  Made with Splenda it doesn't have any nasty aftertaste and the added B vitamins are a definate bonus.  Chill it and its nice and refreshing in this hot weather.  Tastes more of more pineapple than coconut to me.  Love it so much I've subscribed to a regular delivery from Amazon ... can't beat that :)

review/summary: GREAT STUFF!!!
review/text: Actually, I was drinking one of these when I thought I'd check if there were any reviews.<br />The votes are in, and all two of us give it 5 stars. Coconut & pineapple puls refreshment.<br />What's not to like?<br />I looked forward to trying it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002D2C4XO">Alacer Electro Mix, Lemon-Lime 30 [0.1 oz (4 g)] Packets</a>, and the Tangerine-Lime water I've been addicted to for about 12 years is still great, but a change to this is refreshing.

review/summary: Great sparkling water
review/text: I recentaly started drinking ICE sparkling water and have tried all of the flavors.<br />Even though they are all very good The coconut pineapple is the very best.<br />It is so refreshing, both of the flavors work so well together.<br />I would highly recommend it to everyone. Even my daughter who hates coconut<br /> has decided that this flavor is her favorite.
