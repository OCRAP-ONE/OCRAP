review/summary: Perfect hibicus tea
review/text: Ordered this for my husband and I to try.<br /><br />Fair warning: It smells SO STRONG and SO SWEET when you first open the tin that we thought it was going to be terrible to drink!<br /><br />We brewed up a pot and I found the tea to be pretty mellow, slightly sweet from the dried berries with a subtle hibiscus undertone. It was fantastic! We decided it will probably make a better iced tea than hot but still, very good. I love that the Rishi brand comes in it's own sealed tins with instructions. Highly recommended for anyone who likes floral teas!

review/summary: If you like a plain oatmeal this is perfect every time
review/text: Maybe because I grew up in China with rice porridge and savory sides for breakfast, I found this a welcomed relief from the "apple cinnamon" "maple" "raisin" 14g of sugar stuff you typically get in an instant oatmeal multipack. I pour it in a mug and top it off with the hot water available at work, wait, stir, and it comes out creamy and smooth without any microwaving. As another reviewer noted, there is a slightly salty taste, so if that's not what you want in an oatmeal, then this would not work for you.

review/summary: Saves a lot of calories and money
review/text: This might not be as great as the coffee down at your local cafe or Starbuck's but it is the next best thing, low in calories and fat. With all the calories you save, you can dress it up with your own cocoa powder on top and still be ahead of the game. Buying in bulk means saving even more money. Just keep in mind that the pack will be half milk discs and half coffee discs so it will be more expensive than buying just straight coffee. You might want to use only half the milk disc by brewing two cups and then splitting it.  Some people find Gevalia bitter, but it is certainly better than Maxwell House. I love the House Blend Starbuck's discs myself, with one of these creamers. Still a fraction of what you have to pay in a shop. Enjoy!

review/summary: An Essential Condiment
review/text: Any decent Chinese or Vietnamese restaurant or food truck provides its customers with a botttle of Sriracha. Tuong Ot Brand Sriracha, easily identifiable by the rooster on the bottle, is by far the most common brand. Tuong Ot Sriracha is like the Heinz Ketchup of Asian food.<br /><br />What does it taste like? Purely spicy. Whenever I use Sriracha, I find that it doesn't really add any flavor to my food. The flavor comes from whatever spices were in the food to begin with. Instead, the Sriracha merely amplifies the spicyness. It really helps out with bland cafeteria food.<br /><br />Why should you buy it? You can use it to make anything spicy. It's pretty cheap, and you will use it far more slowly than ketchup. Also, it doesn't really seem to go bad. Most restaurants keep it unrefrigerated. I've had an unrefrigerated bottle for over a year, and it still seems fine.

This tea is weak at best, and not a good representative of Japanese Sencha bagged tea.<br /><br />Instead I would recommend Maeda-en, Yamamotoyama, and MyGreenTea as better tasting and more authentic Sencha. Amazon sells all of those 3. Considering the price of Harney & Sons tea, spend your money on a better tea. Even Kirkland brand green tea has more flavor vs. Harney & Sons.

review/text: Usually if you're a coffee drinker, you may like green tea that is roasted, such as the Hojicha variety. If you usually drink just water or light drinks, you'll want something crisp and fresh, such as a Sencha. Harney & Sons Japanese Sencha is one of the best tasting green tea around. It is my favorite! The flavor is soft and light. It has a very pleasant aroma, and the color of the tea is a beautiful light green. Plus the added benefits of anti-oxidant in green tea, I would recommend this product.

review/text: I bought this steak for my father in law for Christmas because he had always wanted to try Omaha Steaks, and I heard good things about it. I purchased the private reserve because it is a higher quality of meat than the regular cuts and wanted to get him something extra special, but was I in for a surprise. I should have stuck with the cheaper meat.<br /><br />The meat came with extremely large amounts of fat all around. We had cut off a significant amount of fat prior to cooking,and the steak was still fatty once it was cooked. I was very dissapointed and so was he. We were going to call Omaha Steaks to complain, will never buy this brand again. Very unhappy with it. The taste wasn't even something that was worth raving about either. I could have went to the supermarket and bought a prime rib on sale that tasted better than this was, which i have in the past, and didn't spend nearly as much as they charged.

review/summary: Unflavored "Cream of Wheat" Substitute 5-star Winner
review/text: Go to any grocery store and peruse the cereal aisles.  What do you notice?  There's an unFlavored Oatmeal but Wheat-meal is flavored Maple/Brown Sugar and Apple/Cinnamon.  And all they have are boxes that allow the contents to get dry, stale, and allow flies and moths to lay eggs ... uggh.<br /><br />I'm a simple person with simple tastes, but I still don't like maggots crawling in my oatmeal and wheatmeal or picking them out with a spoon. Hurrah for Sturdiwheat.  Oh, they got the many flavors the other have, but no maggots and moths.<br /><br />So, the few weeks between bowls of wheatmeal doesn't subtract from the flavor.  I stay happy.

review/text: The best tasting low carb noodles I have found.  You do not detect any difference in flavor.  I have found all of their products to be equally great. Shipping and delivery were fast and the package arrived in good condition.  To make the shipping cost worth it, I purchased six boxes and gave some to my daughter since I would not be able to use so many boxes in a reasonable period of time.

review/summary: Fantastic. The only dog food my Doberman will eat.
review/text: I have a 6 year old Doberman who is UNBELIEVABLY picky about her food. She would rather go hungry than eat most dog foods - literally, if I try to change her food, she'll refuse to eat. I've used other Nutro products (ONLY various dry foods) before and whe enjoys those as well. I have even reviewed some of the others.<br />About a year ago, I came across this specific product when they were out of the Nutro I normally purchase for her. I brought it home concerned she'd turn her nose up at this as well, but I was stunned when she just went right to it and completely cleaned her bowl. She never does this. It's always a battle to get her to eat, but not with this food. Of course, she would pick one of the most expensive dog foods out there, but if it makes her happy I'm happy.<br />Ultra cuts down on the amount of waste that she leaves outside, which is great because my yard isn't that big. The food obviously tastes good to her. It also cuts way down on her shedding. Her coat is now very shiny and extremely soft. When people see her, they always think she's just been groomed. So far (I've been using it for about a year,) she's maintained her ideal weight as well as plenty of muscle tone. It keeps her energetic without becoming hyper.<br />My doberman is my baby and completely spoiled. I take no chances with her health and well-being.  At this point, I've been nothing but thrilled with the results I've gotten from feeding her Nutro Ultra, and to me that's worth the price.<br />My advice, try one of the small 4.5lb bags first. I started to notice a difference in her coat, stool, and energy level in about a week. A small bag SHOULD be enough to see if it's going to work for your dog or not.<br /><br />***NOTE*** FDA RECALL OF NUTRO PET FOOD - APRIL 2009<br />After the hundreds of pet illnesses and deaths attributed to Nutro's canned food in North America, I permanently changed her food to Blue Buffalo. I have a new review posted of that product. I no long recommend ANY Nutro product, nor do I have any plans to purchase anything they produce in the future.

review/summary: More "cool" than "honey"
review/text: The peppermint flavoring almost completely overpowers the honey. Not bad, just not what I was expecting, given that peppermint Altoids taste like peppermint; cinnamon Altoids taste like cinnamon; licorice Altoids taste like licorice; ginger Altoids taste like ginger... I expected to taste honey, with some mint, rather than overpowering mint and a mere hint of honey.<br /><br />Still, they are pretty good. They don't have as much of the bitter note as peppermint Altoids. But they'll have to call the recipe something other than "Cool Honey" to get that last star.

review/text: Regular Altoids pack a bit too much punch for me to use them regularly. The Cool Honey flavor is delightfully refreshing without assaulting my taste buds. While I wish they had a bit more honey flavor, they are wonderfully unique and we enjoy them regularly. Indeed, we make sure each vehicle has a tin that is readily available. A bit hard to find in local establishments, ordering a case via Amazon proved to be a good deal.

review/summary: By the end of 1 cup my bloated belly was half its size!
review/text: I have been suffering from a bloated stomach--looking like I was ready to deliver any minute--for going on 2 yr.  I have had MRIs and blow-in-the bag tests and gastric emptying tests and upper GIs and on and on and none showed a reason for the bloating.  Even had my gallbladder out since everyone (me too) thought that was the fix, but the bloating remains long after the gall bladder is gone.  So here I was bloated like a pig with pressure and pain and general misery, searching for yet another solution. Doctor had none. I ordered the fennel tea thinking yeah, sure, but what the heck--a total skeptic.  It arrived this morning. By the time I finished the first cup at least 70% of the bloating was gone, taking the pressure and pain with it. A couple of hours later I am practically "normal." So I am a believer (although I need to see if it continues to work) I am not good at putting things in my mouth that taste "funny" but this is not a bad taste at all (as in I didn't have to gag it down).  I am going to be excited to see if this really continues to work.  Right now I am thinking it is magical. Oh as an extra bonus--their customer support person was terrific, competent, kind, and American.

review/summary: Excellent Product...Love It
review/text: Fortunately, I do not suffer from IBS (my sympathies to those who do); however, minor health issues and a diet that includes sugar-free products and a lot of fruits and veggies often lead to uncomfortable bloating and an upset tummy.  Further, I've been trying to lose weight and haven't had much luck with a few stubborn, remaining pounds.  So, when I stumbled across a website that heralded "Heather's Tummy Tea Fennel" as beneficial for bloating, it tweaked my interest.  After further research revealed fennel's usefulness for tummy pain and, possibly, weight loss I decided to give this product a try.<br /><br />So far, I love this tea.  It works like a charm on stomach problems and my tummy has felt much better while on my current diet.  Although I've only used this tea for two  or three days, I've already noticed slightly less tummy bloating and the scale was down a couple of pounds this morning.  So, for my money, this product has been doing exactly what users claim it does.<br /><br />In fact, it also yielded a very unexpected benefit in my case.  I've suffered with chronic muscle pain for 8+ years following an on-the-job injury.  I've been having an especially bad flareup with my shoulder for the last several days.  The usual treatments--heat, massage, painkillers, stretches, etc--have not been helping so I've been in agony.  Then, yesterday, I drank a cup of this tea for my tummy and promptly forgot about it on my way out the door to do errands.  About an hour later, I suddenly realized that my shoulder and neck weren't hurting anymore.  Since I hadn't done anything else to help the pain that day and had not taken any pain medication, I can only assume the fennel must have helped relax the spasm in my shoulder and neck.  Whatever it did, I was most grateful.<br /><br />Anyway, even if Heather's fennel tummy tea didn't do anything at all to help my various pains and discomforts, I would still love it because it tastes fantastic.  I steep it for 10 minutes--as the package directs--and then add Splenda sweetener and a bit of milk...it is sooo tasty and is a real treat for someone who can't eat sugary goodies.  I also love that it's all natural and uses whole seeds.  When the majority of products these days are overly-processed and/or have sugar and other crap added, it's really nice to find something that has been left the way Mother Nature intended.  I very, very highly recommend.

review/summary: Like a miracle!
review/text: I had gone through a very stressful year, with a divorce, a move, and also the death of my father. I had lost about 20 lbs, which for me, was a lot, because I was pretty thin to begin with. I was then diagnosed with anemia. To try to boost my iron level, I totally modified my eating regime, to include red meat and wheat. Not sure if this was the cause, but not only did I get back to a normal weight, I was EXTREMELY bloated. At first I thought it was just weight gain, but it was all in my lower abdomen and no where else on my body. I looked pregnant. I walk several miles a day, so I really didn't think I had just gained weight. Even though I don't have full blown IBS , I have been known to have digestive issues, so I thought I would give this a try. Not only did the bloat completely go away in about 2 days, I feel less hungry and just overall better. I drink a cup before each meal. Don't experience any side effects. I am so thankful I found this!!

For me fennel in general has been a great relief and I like Heather's tea bags because they taste good, they smell good and there are enough seeds in each tea bag to prepare tea in a big mug. I also tried their soluble fiber and that was a great product as well. Overall I recommend Heather's products and especially this tea if you are on the d-IBS side and need relief from cramps associated with it.

review/text: I would say I have very mild IBS, with the primary symptom being feeling bloated and gassy some of the time.  I have tried otc medications, herbal teas, stress relief, and diet changes to ease my discomfort, but nothing seems to work as well as the fennel tummy tea.  Sometimes, one cup gets rid of the problem.  Other times it takes double-bagging or several cups in a row.  The tea tastes quite pleasant, too.  Recently I have concluded that Culturelle helps lessen the frequency of these episodes, and the fennel tea helps to lessen the length of the episodes.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: I do not have any definite diagnosis of IBS, but since late last year (around December), I began having symptoms of bloating, constipation, which I attributed to weight gain (from a size 0 to size 2), though no matter how hard i tried to change my eating habits and lifestyle, which included adding probiotics and prune juice to my diet to address the symptoms, my waist line remained the same (though i lost two, three pounds in 4 months). It seemed that no matter how conscious i was of how i ate, my tummy still was huge. i knew my digestive system wasn't working properly.  I didn't like the way i felt after every meal, no matter how small the portion is, i felt like my tummy was about to burst! I chanced on Heather's Fennel tea while doing an online research of my symptoms, out of frustration. I ordered it, and have been enjoying the benefits of this tea for a month now. I am so glad I gave this product a chance. I drink it thrice a day during meals, and my tummy is a lot flatter now, not bulging as much, and my waist line is getting smaller every week, no more constipation. Another pro that I noticed, and I hope that this will continue, is that my PMS is not as bad. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: It got me through Christmas!
review/text: I have had mild IBS all of my adult life...  I drink this tea all day and it has eliminated the bloated feeling and gas.  It is the ONLY thing that got me through Christmas. With all the holiday foods around, it allowed me to indulge a little and survive without having to "pay the piper". It is certainly an acquired taste, which you might not like if you do not favor licorice.  It really helps bloating if you use it on a regular basis even if you don't have IBS...

review/summary: Works for Gastroenterologist
review/text: I rarely leave comments on a product. That being said, I can not say enough about this tea. I work for a gastroenterologist who was looking for an alternative to the traditional medications for IBS. We use it in the recovery room after colonoscopies and give a sample to the patients to take home. Every patient that has been back to the office for a follow-up appointment has nothing but praise. If you suffer with IBS, give it a try.

review/summary: Tummy Tea
review/text: I'm not sure how well this tea will be for my tummy, but so far, I'm enjoying it very much. If you like the taste of licorice, you will love this tea. If you don't, then don't buy it!<br />I add a pack of Truvia sweetener to my cup for more sweetness and it is perfect! Soothing and flavorful....and it does give you a full feeling so I think drinking it before dinner might help in eating less. I like it afterwards though,,,,takes the place of dessert for me and supposedly helps with digestion.<br /><br />I love the canister the tea bags come in and they smell very fresh and are larger than the normal sized tea bag.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.

I drank the tea and am completely amazed.  The bloating and gas are gone, my stomach feels great, and is actually flatter!!!  Fennel has a very distinct taste.  I add honey to my tea and it tastes great.

review/text: I don't usually leave low ratings on items, but I was really disappointed with the taste of this tea. It smells really great, but the taste of the brewed tea is really bland, and does not correlate with the aroma of the tea bags in the box. I love fennel tea, and usually buy mine overseas. When I ran out, I purchased this product instead. Sadly disappointing.

review/summary: Strong Fennel
review/text: These are larege tea bags, with about twice as much in them as in Alvita or Seelect fennel tea bags.  When I brewed up a cup according to the instructions, it was just too strong for my taste.  Maybe you like your tea strong or need it that way for your condition.  After trying it several times, I concluded it was just too much for me and went back to other brands.  They leave me feeling much better than this does.  For those who would need or enjoy it, I'm sure it would be very good.

review/summary: Mixed opinions
review/text: I was very excited to try a new flavor of licorice. I am a licorice aficionado - I truly try every flavor and shape I can get a hold of and love most of it. I can't say that I was overly impressed with the flavor of this brand, though. It had somewhat of a medicinal taste. While licorice was originally intended as a medicine, I don't think it should taste like it. I had a few pieces, then shared it with my family. Out of 6 other opinions, three said they did not like it, two really loved it, and one is just a candy addict so pretty much likes anything. So the vote is pretty much split, but all said it did taste a little like medicine. The flavor was not unpleasant, just a little strong. I love that it is made from organic sugar, and the texture is quite soft, but not gummy. Overall a good product, just not something I would seek out to buy again.

review/text: Being French I grew up knowing how important it was to use a good unrefined salt. The one from Brittany being the very best. No! It's not foolish to spent money on a  basic spice. It has a very delicate flavor (almost floral) and you don't need a lot. Will taste great on salads. A clear healthy winner.

review/text: Not really sure if I can describe this salt properly. Yes, it has a wonderful flavor without too much of a salty flavor. It's very clean tasting. Mostly, though, I think it seems "creamy". Yea, I know that sounds weird, but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment. I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.

review/text: I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, "French gray" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.

review/summary: Does its job
review/text: I bought this food for my young cat which used to suffer from urinary tract issues. After going to the vet and getting very expensive food from them, i decided to give this purina One a try. It did a great job at keeping my cat healthy, and never had a problem with urinary tract again while on this food. The only reason i give this 3 stars and not five, is because my cat doesn't like it(he is not really a picky eater, he eats a wide variety of things). He will only eat it when absolutely starving or when mixed in with other dry or canned foods. Right now i am feeding him friskies special diet canned food, as well as iams proactive health original with chicken. This combination he really enjoys and it has given great results with his UTI problem (which has not reoccurred in over a year). Since i still have about half a bag left of PurinaOne, i just leave out a bowl for him at night so he can eat if really hungry, but half a cup usually lasts about 4 or 5 days before he eats it all. It is a very good product which does its job wonderfully, it is just not for my particular cat.

review/summary: Works good for our Cats
review/text: I have 2 cats and one developed crystals in his urine - after hundreds of dollars in vet bills and the expensive food (which you can only get a Petsmart if you have a prescription) I thought there had to be an alternative food for my cats. We've been feeding this to both our cats (one is prone to Urinary problems and the other isn't) - seems to be working fine for the past...4 years about. Our cats have never been picky eaters, so it was an easy switch and no my issues.<br /><br />My only gripe with Amazon is that - Walmart sells the 16 lb bag for $21-$22 and it's sold on here for $29. Not really a deal, so I do buy this cat food elsewhere.
