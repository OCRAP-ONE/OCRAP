review/summary: A great "outdoor" cookie
review/text: These cookies are great on a hike, camping trip, etc.  Full of fiber, not too sweet and very filling.  The chocolate chips are delicious.  Tho' the cookies are soft, the oats give enough body to stand up to dunking in coffee, etc.<br /><br />I found the manufacturers website by accident and tried their sample pack of 4.  Two packs each of the original and two of the raisin.  Like 'em both equally, but ordered the 12 pack in the original from Amazon.  They arrived tightly packed, none were broken.

review/summary: It tastes good
review/text: I've used this, mixed with a splash of heavy cream, to flavor my coffee for the last couple of weeks. I've tried all kinds of syrups and extracts, but this is the only hazelnut flavor that has been as tasty as the CoffeeMate Hazelnut creamer.<br /><br />My only problem is that there's no list of ingredients anywhere on the label...or on the Amazon page...or on the company's website. The main reason I'm trying to get away from CoffeeMate is because of all the artificial ingredients, so without knowing what this stuff is made of, I personally have little reason to continue buying it. And it ain't cheap.<br /><br />If you don't care about artificial ingredients or high prices, I definitely recommend this stuff.

The electrolytes really help you recover fast from a hot day, to a rough work day, to a heavy work out. These things are awesome. Plus the LIGHT mango and peach flavor is great too!<br /><br />But these packs are actually kind of hard to open honestly. I mean some of them will open fine, but twisty caps on them aren't the best. I actually had to take a knife and cut out the piece that was holding the spout to the tetra pack on some of them. But the 11 oz packs are really awesome.<br /><br />Do give these a try. And you will never go back to Gatorade!

review/summary: Great coconut flavor, with nice mango flavor
review/text: Coconut water is supposed to be a healthier version of a sports drink- good balance of electrolytes with natural sugars.<br /><br />I like the taste and value of these (the 11 ounce ones were too small for a session at the gym).<br /><br />If they are far from their expiration date, the mango flavor almost tastes like fresh mango's. Closer to it, it still tastes fine, just not as good.<br /><br />Of all the flavors I've had (pineapple, plain, passion fruit, acai), this is my favorite. The others aren't bad, but if you like the taste of mango, and a little more bold flavor, this one is the best.

My roommate thinks they are gross but I prefer it to the taste of other sports drinks.  Peach and Mango flavor is a lot sweeter than some of the other flavors I have tried.

review/summary: Best of the Flavored Coconut Waters
review/text: I have been enjoying coconut water for over 2 years.  For the most part I love the natural "regular" variety, but was able to buy a variety pack through Amazon.  After tasting the different flavored varieties, I found that I liked the tangerine but LOVED the peach/mango.  So far, the boxes I have enjoyed have been very consistent in flavor, which is the only downside to coconut water that I have found to date.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about these waters was the container.  It has a small screw top that makes the container resealable and less likely to spoil and/or spill in between drinks.  At 17 ounces it is unlikely for me to finish drinking it in one sitting so I really appreciate this small innovation.  I wish they could do this on the 11 ounce containers but this product is costly enough without adding to the expense.<br /><br />I am giving this particular product 5 stars, because of the combination of great taste and the innovative packaging.  If you need to pay attention to sugar, stick with the unflavored coconut waters because this is sweet, with about twice the natural sugars of the unflavored.  Not a reason to downgrade the product, but something to make a note of if sugar is an issue in your life.<br /><br />Give it a try and enjoy!

review/summary: Quality problem, Unknown sediments
review/text: We just had 4 cases of these from amazon and these are NOT the same as 11.2 oz ones. There are numerous brown specks or particles floating in the drink if you look it closely under the light. We didn't discover this until we realized that the drink did something funny to our stomachs afterwards. The constitution is much murkier than previous 11.2 oz packages and doesn't taste the same. We think this has a different processing procedure than the 11.2 oz packages. Maybe it has to do with the factory filtration system or even a serious quality control problem. As with all other food imports, very few are actually sample tested by FSIS/DOA for safety or against the ingredients listed by the manufacturer. Any feedback to us from other reviewers is encouraged. We'd like to know what these brownish particles are and why they are there. If you find it exactly the same as 11.2 oz ones, let other readers know too. For now, we'd suggest you go test one in a local supermarket and see if it's to your liking and compare these with 11.2 oz ones.

review/text: It's my FAVORITE gum, but I can't find it ANYWHERE.  The one place that did have it (Walgreens) sold out of it and didn't restock.  It's been that off and on since I first discovered the gum...sometimes I can find it, sometimes I can't.  This is the longest period of time when I can't find it.

review/summary: stopped the barfing himalayan
review/text: After about 6 months of cleaning up cat barf, lots of trips to the vet, changing litter 3 times and food about 8 times, I finally tried Science Diet Mature cat Hairball dry food for my 12 year-old Himalayans.  They had always eaten SD Sensitive Stomach, but my male big boy started throwing more than just hairballs...yellowish thin stuff that required lots of scrubbing on the carpets.<br /><br />This stuff really works!  I read lots of cat food labels and reviews before I tried this, but nothing worked and I was getting suggestions that I should put my precious Sherman down.<br /><br />Now he is happy and healthy again.  I don't know how this food works, but it surely did for my cat.<br /><br />Thank you, Science Diet!

review/text: We've used this cat food for years... LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!  Since I like to order from Amazon, I decided to give this supplier a shot.  I was not paying attention, and it cost me.  I paid the same amount for a 7 lb. bag from this supplier that I would for nearly twice that amount at PetSmart.com.  Next time, I'll stick with PetSmart.  I ended up paying about $1.50 per pound too much.  Good thing my kitties are worth it!

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Not the best taste for fruit snack
review/text: I purchased these fruit snacks to give them a chance at curbing my sweet tooth. These fruit snacks leave a very strong aftertaste in your mouth. I tried the Fruit Grove Nuggets which left me with an overwhelming flavor of banana. Next I tried the Orchard Sours, I love sour candy, and hoped this would taste better. This flavor left me with a strong taste of lemon rind in my mouth. Lastly I tried the Berrilicious Nuggets hoping I didn't waste all my money on these. The Berrilicious left me with the flavor of blueberry as an aftertaste. This wasn't so bad compared to the others. I will eat the Berrilicious, but not the others. I, personally, will not buy these again.

review/text: I first found these during a whimsical trip to a little neighborhood popcorn and candy store and bought a box. They were so good that I *had* to get more and instead of paying the obscene prices the candy store was charging, decided to google for them instead....and of course, found them at Amazon.<br /><br />The item listing correctly says "vanilla", the product description section is incorrect - these are NOT chocolate. I've only tried the vanilla ones, and that's what I was looking for, so until they showed up, I was a little apprehensive due to the incorrect description.<br /><br />They come in a shrink wrapped carton of 20 packages and each package, although sold by weight, contains about 20 tiny cookies filled with vanilla cream. Not cream like Oreos....liquid cream in just the right amount so as to not overpower the crunch of the cookie. Nom nom nom.

Save your money and go with the Tiptree brand.

review/summary: Pina Colada best cold
review/text: This matcha smells like Hawaii in tea form!  I've only been there once and have missed it ever since.  I'm sitting here in 60 degree weather drinking matcha that will take me to a warmer place.<br />My first impression of this matcha was heaven!  I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep in the yummy goodness.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I could not wait to dig in to this matcha.  If I had a piece of pineapple in the fridge I would have paired this matcha with it.  I think that next time I will try preparing this iced and be sure to have some pineapple on hand!<br />I always make sure to warm up my bowl and chasen under a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  My matcha does not cool down as fast when warming the bowl.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha, water and my sifter!  I didn't forget it this time.  I think I might need to get a matcha preparation bag so that all my tools are handy.  I tend to get excited and forget a key item.<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha. Once that was properly mixed I added a teeny bit of sugar and 5 oz of water.  I added a bit less water this time as I wanted the matcha to be thicker.<br />The smell of this matcha once mixed with water takes on different notes...almost a chemical smell.  I did get notes of coconut and a touch of pineapple but it's almost a fake smell now like an airfreshener.  I'm surprised that the smell would change from the powdered form to when water was added.  The quality of the matcha is very good, I think it's the flavoring that is throwing it off.<br />I'm just so sad that this flavor will not make my keep cupboard.  My plan for the rest of Pina Colada is to mix it first as a latte, then try it over ice.  I might try cold brewing it in the fridge, but I'm not sure you can do that with matcha.  If all else fails, I will add it to my health food drink which is a vanilla base.  I'm hoping that maybe it'll be perfect one of these ways so I can add it to the keep cupboard!<br />To try Pina Colada Matcha from Red Leaf Tea visit here:<br />[...]

review/summary: Like a tropical vacation in matcha form
review/text: Pina Coladas are my favourite tropical boozy drink! Okay I'll also drink them without booze, but that kick of rum keeps me happy. Haha! I love the creamy texture of ice cold, slushy coconut milk with the tang and sweetness of fresh pineapple! A drizzle of grenadine and I'm taken to my happy place. To be fair, I haven't had a pina colada quite like the ones in Cuba. That was my only hot resort holiday, so it has lots of good memories and good drinks.<br /><br />I was hoping to recreate that deliciousness by making a slushy, creamy, matcha smoothie with this matcha! To be fair, that was the best result, after trying this hot and as an iced latte - slush was the way to go!<br /><br />My Pina Colada Matcha slush might have been better, but I used waaay too much matcha by accident, so it was a bit too strong in the flavouring department. I just crushed some ice with agave and milk to make the slush, so as the ice melted it did become more palatable. I really think the trick for this one is to make sure to use around 170 degree water (that tempers the bitterness) and use a little less matcha powder that you would usually. With other flavours, I could go crazy and dump 3 tablespoons into a cup and it was palatable (and energizing!), but less is more with this particular blend!<br /><br />When I'm out of this tea, I think I will order some coconut and pineapple separately and do some blending of my own! I still have total faith in Red Leaf Tea - they hook me up with delicious matcha, and I can't wait to try more flavours!

review/text: There are so many fruit flavors and I couldn't pick one, so I went with this blend of tropical fruits called "Tropical Matcha". When I first got a whiff of the matcha it smelled very fruity, almost candy sweet.<br /><br />I put 1/4 teaspoon in a water bottle a shook it up to give myself a nice fruity drink. The flavor is very light on this one. It tastes a lot like a fruit punch of some sort. It's hard to specifically point out one type of fruit over another. If you're a fan of punches, I'd definitely give this a try. Since I was having a hard time detecting the flavor, I added another 1/4 teaspoon of matcha. The flavor was a little stronger, but I didn't really get that overly strong matcha taste, which is good. I bet tossing some sweetener in here would bring out the fruit taste even more.

review/text: I love banana bread. Love it. When I saw that the Oatmeal to Go bars came in this flavor, I immediately snapped it up off of the shelves- after all, they make for a great easy breakfast to carry in my car or purse. (It's also nice & fast to feed to sluggish nieces when they are running late.)<br /><br />I might be too overly harsh towards this, but while it did taste yummy I didn't really see where it reminded me of actual banana bread. It tastes similar to it, but not similar enough & like I said- that might just be me being overly picky. The texture of it is nice & it does fill the stomach nicely. Plus it's lower in calories & healthier than grabbing a bag of Cheez-its from the company vending machine (got to love working nights when everything is closed) & eating that as a breakfast.<br /><br />Will I buy this again? Yep. Like I said, this had a good flavor to it & I enjoyed eating it. I just can't get past it not tasting more like fresh banana bread.

review/summary: Buyer beware of ingredients
review/text: My dog is a finicky eater and in the stores when I bought the packets that come 4 flavors to a box, my dog loved the chicken and the turkey but none of the other flavors so buying just one box full of the flavor he liked seemed perfect. However, I had not fully read the ingredients before making the purchase. The good part is that it is all meat with no grains and my dog seems to have an allergy to many things which makes him finicky. BUT it has onion powder and garlic powder. Now these may make it taste better and the dog seems to enjoy but it also causes damage to his already weakened liver. Had I read the ingredients fully before even as finicky eater I would not have purchased because I know onion in any form is very dangerous to little dogs. Garlic not much better but worse for one with weakened liver already. So after having a package or two of his favs, he got sicker and has gastritis terrible..  had to go to vet and is still recovering so won't be using the rest of the packages.<br /><br />Read full ingredients before giving anything to your little guy and be sure he's able to digest these products.<br /><br />Now I just buy ground turkey and ground chicken, or whole, cook it up myself and give it to my little guy making certain there is nothing in the food that can cause him severe illness.

review/summary: We should own stock in this company
review/text: Our house goes through at LEAST 2 full boxes of these individually wrapped bowls of Oatmeal per week.  My stepsons wolf through 2-4 packs per morning, though they will consume any oatmeal put before them... they fight over the fruit and cream so we tend to stick to boxes of that.<br /><br />Often they mix and match, dumping a packed of bananas and cream in with a packet of strawberries and cream.  I don't mind, two growing little boys can eat as much oatmeal as they want in our house.  You couldn't ask for them to eat a more healthy snack.  The other thing that is nice is that my 7 year old can make his own.  So on Saturday mornings when he's up before the rooster crows, he can come down and make his own oatmeal while he waits for everyone else to get up.<br /><br />For the adults, Oatmeal still tastes great, and requires a lot less work then I remember my mom going through when I was little.  It's excellent for your health and can actually lower your cholesterol.

review/summary: What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I bought peaches and strawberries flavor in my grocery store because they were on sale. I noticed they were the most expensive ones there so I figured that must be the best there is. How wrong was I. First thing that hit me was how sweet they were. I could barely finish eating. Then I looked at the label and found far too many artificial ingredients. But that's not all. I noticed that peaches and strawberries are strangely similar in taste and shape. After reading a label I found out that they do not even put real strawberries and peaches in the oatmeal. Can you believe that? The most expensive oatmeal on the market and no real fruit. What they do is they put artificially flavored apples in there. Company with such experience in oatmeal making can't afford to give its customers REAL FRUIT? What a shame. I will never buy any of their products. Never!. Oh just to compare what there is available on the market please visit Traders Joe. I found blueberry flavor with REAL blueberries, cranberry with REAL cranberries. So it is possible to make a great product you just have to make an effort QUAKER and stop fooling your customers.

review/text: This assortment is a great alternative to the same flavors over and over again. I do find that they arent as filling as others but I think that has to do with the "cream" aspect. I gave all the peaches away as I don't like peach but everything else is delicious. I was also pleased to see that there are not many  more calories in these as the regular flavors

review/summary: Good made with milk
review/text: My little girl loves Quaker oatmeal and I love how easy it is to make. Here is how I make it: 1. open package into microwaveable glass or ceramic bowl. 2. Pour milk over mix. I can eyeball it now, but it's just a tiny bit more than what is recommended on the package instructions. 3. stir well. 4. microwave for one minute on high power (ten). 5. stir. 6. microwave on medium high (seven) power for one minute (depends on your microwave, you work it out). 7. stir. 8. repeat step six. 7. Stir, pour onto flat plate to allow to cool down more quickly.<br /><br />If I see that it's too thick after step 6, I add a little milk. If it doesn't stick to the spoon at least a little by the end of step 6, you used too much milk. Usually we like cinnamon sprinkled on top.

Especially with 72 of them to deal with now.<br /><br />Finally, they say you only need one pod, because they made them too big. Talk about making virtue of necessity. You can only fit one pod in the two pod attachment. The best you can do is to use the two pod attachment and brew one 4 oz cup at a time. Then put in another pod and brew the 2nd 4 oz.

review/summary: It must be mislabeled
review/text: First off, I should thank the generous people at Tabasco for including a free jar of their salsa with my purchase of 1/2 gallon of Chipotle Tabasco sauce. But, after the first taste of their salsa, my first thought was, "There must be some mistake." There is now way this sauce is what Tabasco considers "Hot" salsa. If you think I am hardcore pepperhead, I'm not. To exaggerate a little, I've had marinara sauce that is as spicy as this salsa. And not only is this sauce so mildly spiced, it is surprisingly sweet. I say surprisingly because, how could a company that has established it's name based on their tangy (vinegary) hot sauce make such a sweet salsa. I will admit this salsa doesn't rank among the worst tasting salsa's I have tried (in the mild category, where it belongs,) but when I first pulled this jar out of the package I couldn't help but get my hopes up in all regards. But, then again, maybe that is the reason I received this as a free gift, perhaps my initial thoughts were true.

I honestly prefer the 3-pack of full size boxes.  I think you get more bang for your buck.  You GOTTA get the bang for your buck.  I get them every 3 months and the price has always been between 6.50 and 8.50. This is a tremendous bargain. One of these boxes at Duane Reade costs $4.99+. I would probably get it delivered more than once every 3 months if I ate breakfast more.<br /><br />This is by far my favorite cereal, and while I may sound like a child, I'm 27. Since you're curious, the other members of the Cereal Rushmore are:<br />Cinnamon Toast Crunch<br />Frosted Flakes<br />Corn Pops<br />Honorable Mention: Lucky Charms<br /><br />Boom, done.

review/summary: Maybe ok for a little pup, but monitor!
review/text: My 8 month old pit mix pup chews everything, including the landscaping, seat belts, and our English mastiff.  This product apparently has a wonderful flavor; he worked on it non-stop.  At 48 pounds he's a decent chewer, but certainly not the jaws of death, yet he managed to chomp off 1" sized chunks within 20 minutes.  I had to throw the bone away a half hour after opening it.  I didn't want to chance the good flavor tempting  him to swallow the pieces.<br /><br />That said, flavored Nylabone products are generally big hits here, so I quickly ordered two chicken flavored Soupers.  They don't offer the same satisfaction as being able to knaw off a piece and therefore are not chewed on as often, but they last years and have been a safe option in our house of many dogs.<br /><br />I'd recommend the Flexible Bones for little, really young pups and weak chewers.

review/summary: Not worth the cost for the amount of time they last. Plus, possible safety hazard to the dog.
review/text: I have a 35-pound 6-month old Keeshond, who I would classify as a "moderate" chewer. I bought her this bone because she enjoys chewing things with a little bit of "give," and the Durachew Nylabones seemed to be too hard to hold her interest for extended periods. Indeed, after some insecurity about this bone, my Keeshond took to it just fine. She seemed to enjoy lying on the floor, munching away on it for several minutes at a time. After the first session, I saw that her favorite chewing end had begun to fray, but the instructions stated that such fraying is normal and that the surface of the bone is designed to fragment into small pieces the size of a grain of rice, which are miniscule enough to pass through the dog's digestive tract without creating any dangerous or life-threatening obstructions.<br /><br />However, after only a couple more chewing sessions, I noticed that her favorite chewing end was wearing down to the point that nearly an entire nub was gone. Luckily for both of us, I never left her unattended while she was chewing on this bone. Earlier today, during one of her play sessions with the bone, I looked down and saw the bone lying on the floor, with my dog standing above it chewing on and trying to swallow something. The thing she was chewing on fell out of her mouth and I quickly swooped in to pick it up: It was a piece of the bone, substantially larger than a "grain of rice"--about an inch long by half an inch wide. Though I cannot say for sure that a piece of such size could cause a bowel obstruction, I did not want to take any chances. The packaging advises the dog owner to throw the bone away as soon as large pieces begin to break off, and I did just that.<br /><br />Look. My dog is not a Pit Bull. She is a Keeshond. Keeshonden are not known for being aggressive chewers. And, although I will concede that my dog definitely enjoys chewing on things, she is not more of a chewer than an average dog, and there is no world in which she can be considered a "powerful" chewer. This bone only lasted for a week of occasional chewing? It should have stood up to more punishment. I only gave it a second star because my dog genuinely seemed to like chewing on it. Otherwise, I consider this bone a safety hazard.<br /><br />If you do choose to buy this bone, make sure you always supervise your dog when he is chewing it so that you can stop him if he starts to break larger pieces off. The instructions probably only give this warning for the purpose of waiving the company's liability, but they are right.

It's barely chewed on.  They "eat up" the regular size nylabones though!  I buy the 3 pack now.

review/text: My dog is a rescue and had really bad teeth so many of them had to be pulled. But even with just a few, she LOVES to gnaw on this. I love how focused she is when she get her nylabone... because she just really gets into scraping her teeth against it.<br /><br />I have bought several different nylabone flavors/types but she always seems to prefer the original and chicken flavor.<br /><br />I also follow the directions and steep them in chicken broth for a while so not sure it that flavor penetrates inside because I rinse it off after steeping.<br /><br />She seems to lose interest in them after gnawing off the nubs on one side... so they don't last too long. In less than a year, she has gone through 8 of them. I wish they were less expensive.  I have found that ordering directly from this vendor (entirelypets)-- you can usually find coupon codes to offset shipping costs.  In the end, much more reasonably priced than buying from the local pet store.

review/text: These chips were so awful.  I bought these because the description had some key words that are usually a turn on for me and others in my family, i.e. hickory, cheddar and multigrain.  Also, it was a Gold Box deal for a case and the deal was close to the same as what 3 or so bags would have been anyway.  So... what a deal !<br />Well, they came and I was really looking forward to them.  I dug in as well as my kids.  It took only a few moments and after eating a few, we realized just how horrible these were.  We couldn't get past the few we ate and I realized I had just burned the $13  I think what was so bad was that the taste was so artificial tasting and texture was like, no substance... perhaps liked puffed chips (if there's such a thing).  And you just wanted to spit them out.  I don't like to throw food out, but that's where these ended up going.<br />I even offered them to a friend who brought a bag into her office for anyone to try.  Nobody there had the stomach for them.<br />Maybe they are healthier than regular potato chips, but I'm not eating these for reasons of health !

review/summary: OMG! Not for children! But, the BEST sauce out there!
review/text: I discovered this sauce while passing a small hot sauce booth. There was a commotion as people were shuffling around trying to find something cool to drink for a teenager who took a full-dip on a chip. He was salivating like Pavlov's dog and his eyes were streaming tears and his whole head was turning all shades of red and purple while he kept flopping his toungue out of his mouth. Not a pretty picture, but, I had to find out what caused him to be in his current state. Someone just pointed at a bottle and said, "He ate a little of that!" I picked up the bottle and it was Predator Great White Shark hot sauce. Well, I was weened on tamales and hot sauce, so I gave it a try. I took a 'dip' and this guy said, "Don't do it! That's exactly what that fellar did!" I didn't have the violent reaction the young teen had, but, I'll admit, it was hot! But, what I really noticed, was it had a GREAT flavor. Most hot sauces based on habaneros have a smokey-flavor and it's usually too smokey. This one is just right and leaves a good after taste. This would probably make a great sauce for cooking with if you want to add some heat, but not the smokiness of habaneros.<br />I would not recommend it as a dipping sauce - unless you really like it hot.<br />Caution: if you find the "Hot" sauces in supermarkets (or Taco Bell Fire sauce) as hot, those would be a 1 on a scale of 1-10 compared to this sauce (giving this sauce an 8+).

It clocks in at 175,000 scovilles, but compared to blair's possible side effects which has no extract and is 100k scovilles hotter, this stuff tastes horrible. Do yourself a favor when you're looking at sauce in this heat range, look for something that doesnt have capsaicin extract in the ingredient list, and gets its heat from red savinas or some other naturally hellacious pepper.

It's great to add to chilli, soups, sandwiches and anything else you don't want to change the flavor with an overpowering sauce or add it to your flavorful but wimpy sauces to kick up the heat.  Start out with a few drops first then add more, I've killed more than one meal by adding a few drops too much.  NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!

review/summary: Actually hot
review/text: Predator is great for making dishes hot with very minimal addition of the hot sauce so it's actually a great deal.  One bottle lasts a long time.  Almost every other hot sauce, no matter how stupid the name, isn't actually hot.  This stuff is so hot you often only have to add a drop to a large bloody mary to add a nice buzz of heat.  2 or 3 drops and it'll get really hot.  So I use this stuff whenever I want to reliably adjust the heat of a dish or drink without having to dump in a gallon of sauce.  It's very efficient.  I'd say about 5 drops of this stuff will warm up a gallon of bloody mary mix about as much as an entire bottle of tobasco would.<br /><br />So if tobasco is a 1/10, and all those combustion, or ass-blaster, or insane this or that hot sauces are maybe a 2-3/10, then this stuff is a 9-10/10.

review/summary: Good for Packaged Tortillas
review/text: There's not much to say as I know everyone has probably had packaged flour tortillas.<br /><br />I will confirm that these arrived in fresh, good condition, well packaged, and with a distant expiration date.<br /><br />They are tasty; a little better than many other brands of packaged flour tortillas I've tried.  These tortillas are on the thin side, which is a big plus for me, as I dislike thick, doughy tortillas.<br /><br />These are what I would describe as the "standard" diameter size.  That is what I wanted and expected.  However I am pointing this out because they are labelled as "for burritos".  Where I come from, that would mean the very large diameter tortillas.  Just thought I'd mention that so everyone is clear on the size.<br /><br />Also, these packages contain less tortillas per bag than I usually encounter.  Again, where I come from, tortillas are usually bagged in packs of a couple dozen at least!  These contain eight tortillas per bag.  I actually like this, as I can keep one in the frig for quick and easy use without worrying about them drying out or going bad.  The unopened packages store well in the freezer.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase this product again.

review/summary: The BEST!!!!!!!!!
review/text: The jelly beans are absolutely fantastic. I was set people up and ask if they want so, well of course they do. It's so funny when they respond by spiting it out and say "That taste like moldy cheese." I crack up:^D hehehehehe!!! I recommend these jelly beans to everyone. I really wish they would come out with a poop flavor. I heard they have owl's poop. However, I never seen it.

review/summary: GROSS / FUN!
review/text: Kids and adults loved these.  Its a fun game to do with your kids, which one will you get?  Juicy Pear or Booger?  (Which by the way the kids said this was the grossest one).  They loved the experiment.

review/summary: Perfect for a Harry Potter  Party!
review/text: I bought two boxes of these jelly beans as they were the closest thing you can buy (at a reasonable price) to the Harry Potter "Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans". I bought two boexes because I thought there'd only be 20 beans in a box but in fact there must have been at least 40. We had way too many left over. The kids got a huge kick out of daring eachother to try one. Shipping was fast and included in these $6/box jelly beans.

review/summary: Very good product
review/text: This is my first order for this dog food.  I was really surprized at the contents and that there was no by-products.  Although this product was a lot more costly than what I had been giving my dog, I will continue buying this product.

review/text: We have 2 Shih Tzus, one of which is an extremely picky eatter. I have tried many of the flavors and he loves all of them...can't believe it. I really like the variety pack...they can have a different flavor every day.  The food is not disgusting smelling or looking as alot of them are. Very happy with this product!

review/summary: all my dogs love it
review/text: Some of my dogs are finicky and won't eat most canned dog foods, but they all love this food.  It makes a great treat or topper for kibble.  Two of the types in the variety pack (pork and beef) are thick and pasty and are good for hiding pills.  The other two (chicken) are soupy and are great to mix with kibble.

review/summary: Add a kick to your Asian creations.
review/text: Having visited Indonesia many times, I became aware of this great product - actually a Dutch Brand.  It is a chili paste which includes onions and is especially delicious added to Asian or Oriental soups (including Ramen products), or in making Nasi Goring.

review/summary: Some good, some bad, and not alot
review/text: Some nice pieces in there, some pieces I've never ever heard of and definitely far less than I thought it would be. The amount of candy here should be $14.99 to be fair. It was an ok experience, but wouldn't buy again.

review/summary: Lots of candy but not all 80's vintage
review/text: There was definitely a lot of candy in the box but about half of them I wouldn't say were 80's candies. No redhots or sugar babies. I thought the description of what would be in the box included those, even though it did say that the selection would vary. I just was expecting more stuff that I remember from the 80's.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: Not great, too much of this stuff is still way too readily available up to this day in 2011, so even though it's from the 80's, there still no real nostalgia. Perhaps doing other foods like doritos or Pepsi but with their OLD logos would have been much more fun... although that would probably be a lot more expensive.

review/text: Basically bought the candy as a present because of the Pop Rocks (meant a lot to the person who this gift was intended for).  No Pop Rocks were received although the shipping was quick.  Never would have bought it if I had known that it would be missing something that was pictured.

review/summary: Nostalgia candy
review/text: I bought this for my husband because he loves candy (not chocolate) and he definitely loved it. It does have some candy that isn't his favorite, but it is good to have a variety. I know there are some negative comments about the quantity, but I thought it was perfectly reasonable for the cost. I will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Terrific Gift Idea
review/text: I bought this for my wife on our nineteenth anniversary (please don't tell her I told you that). It arrived well ahead of schedule giving me time to unbox it, hide it and prepare it for the big day. When she opened the box, she spend a good while reliving the summmer days from her youth enjoying these authentic treats.<br /><br />The candy is authentic, brand name, quality goods. The quantity is great. No cheap imitations or ridiculous knock-off as I've seen on other candy basket websites. This gift is a winner. It'll make you a hero and your gift comes later.

review/text: I ordered this for a friend of mine, who's my age, thinking that she might enjoy reliving a bit of our childhood.  She absolutely loved it; it brought back so many fond memories of growing up.  It's a great idea for a unique birthday gift, especially if your recipient is hard to buy for.
