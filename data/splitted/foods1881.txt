review/summary: Not Your Mother's Maxwell House
review/text: It's not Yuban, but it's not bad.  It's also not the Maxwell House that became famous as the watery church basement coffee of days gone by.<br /><br />It's got a robust flavor that surprised me, and no after taste to ruin it.<br /><br />Better than average brew for a rock bottom price.<br /><br />It's just what American needs right now--a decent cup of coffee that's not a budget-buster.<br /><br />Bravo, Maxwell House.

review/summary: That Last Drop is Still Good
review/text: Coffee consumption is about one of these cans in 8 days.  Our consumption is just plain coffee and no frills.  With Maxwell House we get decent tasting full bodied coffee at a reasonable price per container.  This Dark Roast is considerably better  to us than the standard original coffee from Maxwell House. Admittedly we usually switch between this brand and another depending on price per ounce; however, now this is our brand of choice.  One of these days we might splurge and try one of the gourmet types but the odds are close to zero as long as those brands are far too expensive for our tastes.  The container keeps the product fresh and ready to use.  It does not particularly enjoy the land fill and at about four of these per month there is little demand for more empty containers.  I must admit I use the grey tops to assist me in building my anti-ant device to protect hummingbird feeders and it works quite well.  Who cares when the coffee is this great.

review/text: I just received my order of Guylian Seashell chocolates from TheOnlineCandyShop.com. Normally these chocolates are some of the most amazing chocolates you've ever tasted, however what I just received must have been YEARS past their prime...they are dry, chalky and stale, and must have been stuck in a far corner of an old warehouse.<br /><br />I wish I could blame a long shipping period on the condition of the received product, but they came to me quite quickly. I have ordered these chocolates online, via Amazon, in the past with great satisfaction; however I will NEVER order from these folks again and recommend that you reconsider your own order, and perhaps select Amazon partner company for your order.

Recently we purchased the HDP curly chews and Mattie LOVES them and enjoys chewing the same one over a number of days (she is a small dog) until they are completely gone.  As advertised, they do not have the odor the other chews had either.

review/summary: Even picky hubby likes this GF pancake mix, and this is enough for lite eating couple...
review/text: We had given up pancakes for more than a year, cause we were reducing carbs and eliminating gluten. But I got a craving for some and tried the Pamela's. I liked it. Hubby liked it. I find that I use MORe mix than the directions (or less water) to get a consistency I prefer, a denser pancake, less runny batter.<br /><br />HOwever, no matter how you prefer (thin, thick, light, dense), this is a tasty mix.<br /><br />I ordered these to have single serving, hence keep the mix fresher tan using the big bags and having to worry about mess or spillage or spoiling.<br /><br />This makes two pancakes of about 5 inches diameter, one for hubby, one for me. We top it with fruit or sugar-free syrup. I add vanilla extract and, sometimes, Splenda to the batter. I use coconut oil. Works great.<br /><br />The main point being these taste great and have a nice pancakey texture. No weird flavor. NO funky texture like so many GF products that try to substitute for wheat tend to have.<br /><br />Not wheat, not gluteny, but very nice. You should be able to enjoy these in your GF plan. :D

review/text: The first time I had the Green Tea Chai was at a cute little tea shop in my neighborhood in Fresno, CA . This was not typical chai tea. I don't know what you would call it, because my husband doesn't like Chai tea and he LOVES this! It's sweet, but not too sweet, and not as cinammon-y spice-y as other Chai teas. I LOVE the Green the best, and then the Vanilla - also amazing. I am hooked on it. And the powder COMPLETELY dissolves so you never feel like you're drinking something powdered - like those nasty envelopes of hot chocolate. It's just the YUMMIEST, most unique flavor.

review/summary: Delicous, addictive....
review/text: This lobster bisque is superb. I actually convinced my boyfriend--someone who is not a seafood fan--to partake and become addicted to it. He was actually trying to bargain with me to MAKE MORE!! I will surely stock my freezer again and again with this delicious classic dish. It soothes the throat and is very creamy going down. The flavors are very subtle yet easy to notice. The slight aftertaste will leave you wanting more and more. I'd give it six stars plus, if I could!

review/summary: Better than you think
review/text: OK, the idea of frozen lobster bisque is a bit iffy. However, this was not bad at all. It is not the greatest lobster bisque I have ever had, but it is downright solid. And for frozen, hey, big plus points there. It tastes like real lobster meat, and, while not exactly generous in their portions of lobster meat, they most certainly do not skimp on it. It is a little less creamy and zesty than I am accustomed to, but again its not bad by any stretch of the imagination. I will be buying more of it for sure.

review/summary: Child Friendly Gluten Free Bread!!!!!!!
review/text: We stopped into this cute bakery on a recent trip to San Antonio where it is located.  We bought a loaf of their gluten free white bread for our 8 year old recently diagnosed with Celiacs Disease.  He loves this bread!  When I made him a grilled cheese he said it "tastes just like a real grilled cheese!"  It has a great taste and NO BITTER AFTERTASTE as is commonly the case with other gluten free breads we've tried.  Unfortunately, it is much more expensive(about $2.50 more when buying a single loaf)than the Udi's Gluten Free White Bread we usually buy at our local grocer BUT, in its defense, the loaf is much bigger than an Udi's Gluten Free White Bread loaf (my son calls Udi's toy food sized bread).  A slice of this Little Aussie Bakery White Bread is the closest in size to a regular slice of bread that we have found since he got sick.  I wish we lived in San Antonio because I would love to be able to buy him this bread exclusively but with the expensive price per loaf and expensive shipping ($9.99 for 1 loaf) we just can't afford it:(

review/summary: Great hot sauce
review/text: If you like your hot sauce fiery hot AND tasty, you should do yourself a favor and buy Marie Sharp's.  It has a carrot base, which is why it is orange, but all of the other ingredients (onion, garlic, select habanero peppers,etc) are fresh and go well with the base (which you don't taste).  The preservative is natural (vinegar) which gives it a little hint of Tabasco flavor, except this is actually, you know, HOT.

review/text: Many people assume that grade B syrup is somehow or other lower quality than grade A. That's true for most foods, but not for maple syrup.<br /><br />I've had grade B's that were only good for baking or cooking, but this one straddles the fine line between 'strong enough' for baking and 'mild enough' for pancakes.<br /><br />Watch for sales, I ended up getting this for about $15.99 with Subscribe and Save and a discount offer, definitely the best deal around for 32 oz of maple syrup.

review/text: There's an award emblem on this bottle from Gourmet magazine, and after enjoying this maple syrup several times, I can see why.<br /><br />I had read that Grade B syrup was a richer, more flavored syrup via Cook's Illustrated, but living in small town Arkansas, had not spotted any in our grocery stores.  Grade A seems to be what is commonly stocked.<br /><br />But this stuff... oh my.  Darker, richer, and more maple-y than anything I've had before.  Even more than with grade A maple syrup, you use much less to get the same amount of sweetness when compared to "fake" pancake syrup.<br /><br />There is no comparison, particularly in baked goods.  Try it!

review/text: Up until my purchase of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019MYYFA">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Maple Syrup Premium Grade B, 32-Ounce Bear Jug</a> I can only remember buying maple flavored syrups.  I thought why should I spend more for something that tastes the same, but boy was I wrong! The taste of flavored syrups cannot compare to the taste of real maple syrup. We tried it on our waffles this last weekend and it was delicious! The only complaint I have it that it's not as thick as the stuff I'm used to, but I can live with that. This was a great deal when I purchased it on sale recently and should last a while.  Just make sure you refrigerate after opening, as this was also new to me.

review/summary: Very Good Grade B Maple Syrup...
review/text: This is very good premium Grade B maple syrup, which is a VERY high compliment, since I live in the Midwest in a state that produces a large amount of high quality maple syrup that I've been used to consuming my whole life long.  It is thick in texture, dark and full-bodied with a strong, pronounced maple taste.  Compared to a grade A, it has more maple flavor, but is significantly less sweet in taste.  A grade B syrup is usually produced from sap gathered later in the season, after the grade A, but before the commercial grades.  I wish Amazon had it available by the gallon, for an even better price.  For those who are wondering, maple syrup will keep for a couple of years, just fine, if refrigerated and even longer, if frozen.  It does not freeze hard, merely getting very thick, until the temperature is raised, due to the high sugar content.  I have usually preferred the maple syrups we produce locally, but this is one I will purchase again, if the price is right!

I used it as a substitute for corn syrup in pecan pie and got rave reviews from my family. Coombs is generally good quality.

review/summary: A flavor revelation!
review/text: I'd never had "grade B" maple syrup until I tried this stuff. I will NEVER buy the grade A syrup offered in stores ever again. I've heard of grade A described as the "champagne" of maple syrups, and the grade B as the "red wine". I guess I'm a red wine kind of gal. The maple flavor of this syrup is extraordinary, and addicting. I've already gone through one 16oz jug and have yet to try it on pancakes or waffles! I've been using it in my tea and coffee as a sweetener, and a couple of times on ice cream. My housemates mixed some with mustard and glazed a salmon fillet for dinner the other night-it was delicious. It isn't really that much more expensive than other real maple syrups, and I feel the better flavor makes this a great value. I wish I'd discovered this maple syrup a long time ago!

review/text: I was fortunate enough to find this deal doing a Bing search.  I was able to purchase 2 for the price of 1.  That was $12 each, if agreed to automatic shipment. After reviewing that, I found there was no penalty for cancelling the automatic shipments so I took the deal. The Grade B is a stronger maple flavor that I enjoy.  It's thicker and darker than I can find in the grocery store around here.  If that's what you like, I recommend it.  If you find the same deal, jump on it.  This stuff is expensive from all vendors if not on sale.

review/summary: Our favorite non-organic maple syrup
review/text: Our large family loves maple syrup and we have purchased this brand regularly for years.  We prefer Grade B over Grade A because Grade B has a stronger maple flavor, but Coombs makes excellent Grade A syrups for those who prefer their syrup a little "lighter."  We like to buy Coombs Grade B organic maple syrup but this is our go-to product during the weeks when organic is too expensive.<br /><br />Pros: This size is good for our family, and a much better value than the tiny little glass bottles in health food stores that cost a fortune.  The jug is easy to pour from and doesn't make a huge mess.  The flavor is great and works well in all applications: topping for waffles or pancakes, making salad dressings or barbeque sauces, baking cornbread or muffins.  I have done some research on Coombs Family Farms, and the syrup is responsibly produced and free of undesirable additives.<br /><br />Cons: Not certified organic, which is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.  Coombs does produce excellent organic syrups, and I rated their organic Grade B a five-star product.  I would also love to see this available in half gallon or gallon sizes.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: I grew up in Upstate NY (just south of Montreal and just north of the Adirondacks) There were sugar shacks everywhere and I never tasted Mrs. Butterworth's until I was an adult. Now I live in Metro Detroit and I haven't seen a sugar Maple in a long time. I get my pure maple syrup from Amazon and this is the best brand they sell. I recommend it, it's a good quality syrup.

review/summary: Doesn't get any better!
review/text: We prefer Grade B dark maple syrup over light or even Grade A, for some reason.  Grade B dark just seems to have a more full flavor without being overpowering.  The test comes immediately after opening the container: fill a teaspoon, and taste it straight out of the jug.  I honestly have never tasted better maple syrup - and we've used pure maple syrup for many years, tried a lot of brands and purchased many gallons of it.<br /><br />And if they're able to hold the price at this level, we'll continue to buy it.  Maple syrup has just skyrocketed over the past few years, so we thought we'd been priced out of the market for good maple syrup.  The price on this we a little below others on Amazon.com, and considerably better than anything available in our local grocery stores, plus we were finally experiencing maple syrup withdrawal.  So after having used "maple flavored" syrup from the supermarket on our most recent batch of pancakes, we decided to see what Amazon had.  WOW!  We really have not tasted any better maple syrup.  I had to hold back after that first teaspoon to keep from eating another, and another, and....  We satisfied that with pancakes for dinner that night.  :>)<br /><br />This is good - really good!  And we're very careful to reserve 5-star ratings for only the very best.

review/summary: Quality Grade-B Maple Syrup
review/text: Originally purchased for Master Cleanse detox but now I put this maple syrup instead of store-bought Grade A maple syrup. This is far more tasty and flavorful on pancakes, crepes and granola (when make a home made granola or granola bars).<br /><br />This is consistently pleasing me and my family for deep and flavorful maple taste. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Watery, not Syrupy
review/text: I have used their products for awhile, but my recent subscription order for this Grade B Organic syrup arrived and is VERY watery.  Either it was not boiled long enough, or water was added.  Stuff just runs off pancakes and lays on the plate in a pool.  Not very appetizing for a premium grade product.  Have contacted them, so will see what their response is.  May keep my subscription for one more round just to see, but if it comes this way again, will be jumping ship for another brand.

review/summary: A really good buy and great quality
review/text: I make a lot of waffles, pancakes and French toast.  There is nothing like real maple syrup.  This brand is excellent.  I don't care a whit about what "grade" it is.  It tastes fabulous, very rich, you don't need very much on a piece of French toast.  I could buy pure maple syrup at home, but it costs over a third more, and since I have Prime (and use it all the time) it makes it even better.

review/summary: Love it! Will never buy Grade A again!
review/text: Do yourself a favor and taste this out of the bottle first. It has a lot more maple and caramel flavors, without being sickeningly sweet, than any of the A grades. It's actually a shame you have to put this on pancakes, all that does is dilute the flavor. Now, for glazed pecans...!<br /><br />Bottom line: if you love maple, try this.

review/summary: Does what it claims!
review/text: One of my dogs is 4 years old and his teeth are worse than my 8 year old.  He only eats dry dog food but has brown teeth and extremely smelly breath.  I have owned or lived with more than a dozen dogs in my life and hands down his was the most funky breath I have ever smelled.<br /><br />I tried the "Checkups" from Costco (also sold on Amazon) and they simply didn't do anything for him.  I was desperate to find something to give him to help clean his teeth while also taming that horrible breath of his.  I came across these Dingo's and decided to give it a try since they love the double meat Dingo's.<br /><br />I give him two per day (regular size) and he is 31 lbs.  I didn't try to look for any improvements in his breath or teeth for at least a  week, but I definitely noticed it before the second week.  The results were borderline unbelievable.  His breath doesn't smell bad at all.  His teeth are no longer brown.<br /><br />I also supervise him while eating his treats (which he absolutely loves).  To the other person who commented, my condolences to your friend; I too have had a close friend lose a dog (choking on a tennis ball).  While I believe that these can be dangerous if not used properly, I also believe that a tennis ball too can do harm.  The bottom line is you have to watch your dog while they eat treats and use common sense when determining if they seem inappropriate for your dogs size and eating (he eats treats like we starve him).  Also, while I won't try to provide advice on how to treat a choking dog, I will simply mention that spending 5 minutes with Google may in fact be the best 5 minutes spent of your life (or your dogs).<br /><br />One last reason to get these is they are fully digestible, where as rawhide is not.  These go through both dogs without any problems (such as gas)!

review/text: My wife brought this home from the store the other day and I was amazed at the amount of sugar in them.  Every calorie in this comes from sugar.  While Gerber doesn't add sugar, apples are naturally very sweet, they do sweeten the apples by placing them in a white grape concentrate.  The taste is far too sweet to give to a 10+ month old.
