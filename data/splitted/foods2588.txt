review/summary: Sammy loves it!
review/text: We have a golden retriever, Sammy, who has a grain allergy and a thyroid condition.  Ever since he was a pup, he we had a hard time getting him to eat his dog food, always seeming to get tired of any dog food after just a few days.  We tried almost every brand out there, even the really expensive ones.  We finally found Hi-Tek Naturals a few months ago, and Sammy still loves it.  He rushes to his bowl and gobbles it down.  He's healthier than he's ever been, and is acting like a puppy at 8 years old.  We couldn't be happier with Hi-Tek Naturals Grain Free Lamb Meal and Sweet Potato formula.  We'll keep buying it as long as it doesn't change.

review/summary: Love this food:)
review/text: I have had my 2 pups on many various high quality dog foods. The last one I purchased was $60 for the bag and they turned their nose up and refused to eat it. I have to watch because the GSD has allergies. It must be grain free. The one that is sold by a distributor and costs 77 bucks a bag made their coats dry, dull and the GSD shed like crazy.<br /><br />I have had them on TOTW for awhile now and they seem to like it, but decided to try the Hi Tek Naturals grain free lamb. Not only do they gobble it up more so then TOTW...no one is itching from it and I am using half the food which is saving money. It only takes a medium size scoop in each bowl in the morning and again around 6pm. I also squirt salmon oil over it which makes them love it even more. In a matter of a week and half I can see their coats improving, they are super shiny and soft. Full of energy. I am also being careful and following the amount guidelines. I am feeding probably a hair over it, which is 2 3/4 cups per day(8 ounce cup) but no one is gaining weight or getting chunky, which the GSD tends to do easy.<br /><br />I would also like to mention the fact that their "potty breaks", are less frequent and as they should be. Firm. Also, I had seen a poster mention gas. All foods have caused both of mine to have gas( in my opinion if a food has veggies and fruit in it as most grain free foods do, they are going to have a little gas), BUT I have noticed that we are not putting our shirts up over our nose with this food. The only time it has happened is if I myself gave them a carrot or green bean while cooking dinner.<br /><br />I finally found food I can stay with. I can switch between the lamb and the chicken without problems and it gives them variety. Love it! I cannot praise it enough, as it has been a battle finding "the one". And NO recalls either:)

review/summary: Better buy a gas mask too.
review/text: I'm sad I'm writing this review, because I was so excited for this dog food! After the TotW recall I've struggled finding something grain-free and affordable for my 2 Pit Bulls, who have skin allergies and need a high quality diet.<br /><br />I wanted to like this dog good, but I cannot abide by this gas! In ALL MY YEARS of dog owning none of my dogs have EVER had gas this bad on ANY brand or quality of food! I keep searching the house for little 'surprises', it smells that bad. Not only is the smell unbearable, but this much gas is a sign of poor digestion, which means they're not getting all the nutrition they should out of this expensive food.<br /><br />3/5, I would only recommend this to a friend if they had a small dog (the kibbles are tiny, causing my 60lbers to wolf the food down, in-taking a lot of air.) and they wanted to live in a cloud of noxious gas all day long.

review/summary: Just what a dog needs?
review/text: Why is this in my Quick Picks?  I don't even own a dog!  But just from reading the ingredients, I say give this stuff a pass.  It has potato, tomato, peas, blueberries and raspberries in it, none of which are a part of a dog's natural diet. Canines of all kinds get all the nutrition required in the wild just from eating meat.  Anything else is just filler.

review/summary: Best Extra Virgin for the price, bar none.
review/text: We really use a lot of extra virgin olive oil. Our diet is largely Mediterranean. We use it for cooking, on vegetables, salads, finishing, dipping. This is the best. Mild flavor ... what you want for cooking and general use ... you don't want to overwhelm food with a pronounced olive flavor ...  but it has a hint of vegetal grassiness which is fresh tasting. Best utilitarian olive oil. OK, a hundred and twenty bucks (with shipping) is a lot of money. But it's a full Liter! Forty bucks for a decent Italian extra virgin bottle that is less than one fifth or one sixth the volume is standard. Figure it out.  By the way, Italy's guilty olive oil secret is that they sell more olive oil than they produce. How? They rebottle Spanish oil.

review/summary: BBQ Bath - Delicious low-calorie option to marinades or sauces
review/text: I have a hard time cooking brisket.  Despite my best efforts and recipes given to me by friends, the meat turns out tough and stringy.  When I discovered this product my brisket finally turned out tender and tasty so I totally recommend it.  Other than the Apple Chipotle, there are other flavors too and you can use this with chicken, lamb, pork and even fish - Salmon is delicious with the Apple Chipotle flavor.<br /><br />Brining foods in a saltwater mixture before you cook them adds flavor, tenderness, and reduces cooking times. By using smaller quantities of salt, mixed with other spices and herbs, brining can permeate meat with flavor.  Any flavoring added to the brine will be carried into the meat with the saltwater mixture. Because the meat is now loaded with extra moisture it will stay that way while it cooks.<br /><br />We all love the results - you will too.

Our 4 yo daughter loves it, too...which is huge because she will eat as much as we put in front of her without a fuss.  Apple Chipotle is our favorite but all the over flavors we have tried are awesome too (Smoked Habanero my next favorite).  Every couple we have shared this with loves it too and wants to know where they can get more.  Nice work!

It looks like the company changed their formula and packaging (judging from their website).  That's a shame when they had such popular (and delicious) product that was available at Costco.  Maybe Kirkland should consider a private label of this one :-) Either way, I hope they will bring this one back soon!!!

Combined with the extremely high shipping costs, this is a very poor product.  If they sent me another one for free I would put it in the trash, it is just not worth eating.

review/text: SADLY, I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY THAT THESE MOO BULLY STICKS ARE NOT 100% DIGESTIBLE! MY DOG ALMOST DIED AFTER A PIECE DID NOT DISSOLVE IN HER STOMACH.My 3 dogs loved these Moo Bully sticks. I had been giving them to my dogs for over a year with no incident.I was giving these because from all I had researched on this product they claimed to be  100% SAFE  AND 100% DIGESTIBLE. I would always take small pieces away form the dogs that I felt could possibly cause a chocking problem. I always had plenty of water close by. One day I noticed my dog,Lily, was having very loose stools and that were jelly like in consistency.This same day she stopped eating and began vomiting.I immediately rushed her to my veterinarian.Upon his physical exam he noted that her abdomen was hard and distended.He wanted me to leave her with him so he could do a x-ray. He did and found that she had a blockage in her stomach!He then started a series of Barium x-rays to watch the blockage to see if it was going to pass. Over a 4 hour period of watching and repeating these barium x-rays it not only showed that the blockage was not passing, but the "item" causing the blockage was swelling in size, absorbing the stomach fluids.I was told he had to do emergency surgery to get this blockage out of her ASAP. What he found in her stomach was most definitely a piece of the Moo Bully stick! It had not digested as claimed  by the manufacture if swallowed.My veterinarian told me if he had not brought Lily in as promptly as I did,to remove this blockage, she most definitely would have died!He told me that this was not 100% digestible as the manufacture had claimed it to be . If it had been, it would have dissolved in her stomach! lily had major abdominal exploratory surgery  that lasted over 3hours, to remove this piece the piece of Moo Bully stick !She was hospitalized afterwards for 4 nights and 5 days. She almost did not make. Lily refused eat for 5 days. She therefore lost a lot of weight,became very frail and lethargic. Thank god, my veterinarian was fabulous.He was so concerned for Lily, that he actually stayed by her side at night,every night making sure he did everything he could to pull her through this.Once home she was weak and could barely walk. I tried to get her to eat and she refused. I was offering her cooked chicken liver and even this did not even entice her to eat. Finally, the next day, she did begin to nibble on some food. It was a very slow healing process and took Lily over a month until she was herself again.The thought of losing Lily tore me apart. Watching the pain and suffering she went though cannot be put into words.I felt so helpless. It was nothing but a pure hell that she and I went though for weeks on end.I was also feeling so guilty because I gave her the MOO Bully stick.You see, I only feed my dogs the very best, high quality organic dog foods. I never ever ever would give my dogs anything that was not the best and the safest. I never gave my dogs raw hide chewies or greenies( Any dog owner that cares about the welfare of their a dog knows how dangerous and deadly these products are) I started giving my dogs the Moo bully sticks because everything I had read and researched lead me to believe not only were they safe,  100%  DIGESTIBLE, but that they came from Brazil cattle that only grazed on non chemically treated grass, were not feed any hormones and drank from fresh natural spring water.There was nothing harmful in this product. So I stared giving my dogs these MOO bully sticks.I am a very dedicated,caring, responsible animal lover and owner. I wrote letters to the companies I purchased the Moo Bully sticks form as well as the manufacturer. Only one retailer responded to my letter by referring me to the manufacturer.The manufacturer of these Moo Bully Sticks, " Free Range Dog Products " totally ignored both of my certified letters. So many owners have no clue that their dogs may have become sick or died due to a piece of a Bully stick that did not digest. What if their vet missed the symptoms? What if they never took their dog to a vet after becoming ill and the dog died? What if they never discovered what killed their dog? Not everyone can afford to pay for surgery on their dogs, x-rays,lab work,medicines,and a hospital stay. My vet bill was almost $5,000.00 My vet even discounted most of what he did, as well not charge me for everything.In fact, he  he felt so bad, that he did not charge me for staying by her side for all through the night, on those  4 nights. What if a dog died or got very ill when ingesting a piece of these Bully sticks and never came forth to inform the public ? Maybe mine is the very first case? But all it should take is one, to satisfy anyone not to ever buy this product and give it their beloved dogs. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT EVER GIVE YOUR DOGS ANY TYPE OF A BULLY STICK PRODUCT!PASS THIS INFO ALONG TO ANYONE THAT YOU KNOW HAS A DOG. YOU MIGHT JUST SAVE A DOGS LIFE. Please not that I had to highlight a star in order for the site to post this! I would have given it zero stars if i could have!

review/summary: Too strong of ginger flavor!  But read review.
review/text: Before I do the real review, I'll post this first:<br /><br />1)  I did receive a single lolipop as a sample as part of a larger order of salt from Das Foods/Das Salt, and do appricate that gesture.<br />2)  I am a repeat customer of Das Foods (mostly their salt, I've had their caramels once or twice as well) and I've found most of their products enjoyable<br />3)  I don't like a strong ginger seasoning flavor in most candies and cookies, so much of this is based on personal taste.<br /><br />So, having said the above, I did find the ginger to be very overpowering in this lolipop.  I couldn't finish the lolipop in fact, after only a few licks I had to throw it away.  The lemon flavor was present very briefly on the first lick, but then the ginger flavor just overpowered everything.  I suspect I might like a different flavor, and again for people that like a strong ginger flavor this is possibly a four or even five star product, I've rated Das Food's other products at 4 to 5 stars if I recall.  But if you don't like that flavor, this probably isn't one of their products for you.<br /><br />Although technically not part of the product review, shipping of my order as always from Das Food was fast and well packaged, I rated their shipping 5 stars for my last order.

review/summary: Lemon, Yes. Ginger, not so much
review/text: I bought a sampler pack of the Das Lollipops based partially on the the previous review.<br /><br />I love ginger. A lot. I could barely detect any ginger flavor in these lollipops.<br /><br />I will say that they are quite tasty lemony lollipops, with a hint of ginger, but I am still on the hunt for a true ginger lollipop.

review/summary: Candies had been crushed to smithereens.
review/text: I have purchased many different items through Amazon.com over the years and never had a problem.  Never wrote a review. Until today.  I purchased the cherry jolly ranchers along with a box of green apple flavored ones as a gift for my husband who was remembering how much he liked these as a kid.  Never again!!  Both boxes of Jolly Ranchers had one broken candy after another.  I just threw away about ten of them because they are not just broken, but crushed to dust.  It looks like someone just kept pounding on them until they were nothing but slivereens of candy splinters.<br /><br />If I could give this seller a zero, I would.  There was NO care in the handling of these boxes.

review/summary: great for making Moscow Mules
review/text: I bought this to try out Oprah's new favorite drink, the Moscow Mule. You add ginger beer to vodka, alot of lime juice, sugar and soda and serve in a copper mug. This genger beer tastes good on its on if you love ginger - its a very strong element. It adds an unexpected punch to a vodka drink. This one is light and clear in color, not has heavy as some.

review/summary: Fantastic Ginger Beer!
review/text: I grew up as an American kid  in Asia drinking Ginger Beer and have been a lifelong fan. I've consumed copious quantities of the stuff over a period of more than 45 years and I consider myself a relatively experienced aficionado. Ginger beer is not commonly found in my area and so I usually order it over the internet.<br /><br />Of the 10 or so brands I have experienced in the last few years, Fever Tree is undoubtedly the finest. It's clearly made from excellent ingredients with significant care. If you like the taste of ginger beer, this is, in my opinion, the finest you can buy. It's the real stuff!

review/summary: They smell and taste wonderful
review/text: I like to use dried products, such as onions, carrots, spices, and herbs, in cooking because my stomach can't handle the products in their original form. I've had several kinds of dried green onions over the years, and although they became hard to find for a while, I do have two different brand names right now. The dried green onions from the other brand smell a little funny, I don't know why, but they taste okay--I mean nothing is wrong with them. When I opened the Barry Farm green onion flakes, which are air-dried, I smelled a difference immediately. They smelled good enough to eat right out of the package, and the flavor is great, too. I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I bought these Anthon Berg Chocolate Liqueurs Candies for my daughter who is serving in the military overseas.  These are packaged safe; bubbled-wrapped for extra protection from the weather elements and damage.  They arrived in excellent condition.<br /><br />I asked my daughter if the chocolates were fresh -she told me they were the best chocolates she has ever eaten (along with her many friends who shared in the delightful treats).  All wrote back thrilled with how "yummy" they were and said the quality of chocolate were some of the best they've all ever had.  I wasn't sure if it was because they were deprived of such good treats or if they were as delicious as they claimed -but my daughter just came in for the holidays and I purchased more for her and she said they were as delicious home as they were overseas.  So I presume the candies are of high quality and enjoyable.<br /><br />I know what I will be sending in my next care packages overseas to our military and also in the care packages to my daughter!

review/text: This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

review/text: I tried this flavor within a variety pack and LOVED IT!  I usually add cream and sugar to my coffee.  With this k cup I added coconut creamer and found that I did not have to add any sugar!  It was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada.  I absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one!

review/summary: Just Right and you will love it!
review/text: This Wolfgang Puck coffee tasted great. The vanilla flavoring is just right. Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it. It tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor.

review/summary: Good coffee, but lets clear up the flavors?
review/text: I saw the good reviews of this Jamaica Me Crazy coffee, but the reviewers all seem to wander around whether it has coconut, vanilla, caramel, rum or coffee liqueur flavorings.<br /><br />First off, I'm not getting any coconut from it at all.  Some vanilla, but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it.<br /><br />In fact, after I drank a cup I had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think I was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out! :)<br /><br />But its good.  I recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee.  Not really anything else like it and I've tried about 20 different k-cup flavors.

review/text: I used to do the subscribe and save with the Timothy's World Kona, but due to the fact that the price on Timothy's jumped so high, I went to Wolfgang Puck Breakfast in Bed.  Pleasantly surprised, and I must say that I like this one much better than the Kona!  It seems much more smoother, but the taste still retains a nice warm mellow-bold flavor.  Great way to start the day!  Oh, and I love the name of this coffee ;)

review/summary: Too Mild for Me
review/text: I bought this because Amazon had DRASTICALLY increased the price on what I usually buy, so I thought I'd try something new.  I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  It's called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, it's a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that I've started drinking the stronger varieties, it's hard to go back to "brown water.")

review/text: I wasn't expecting this one to be so rich or full!  Yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a French roast but doesn't taste burnt.  I think alot of times a French roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky, but not this one! Very pleased with it and will definitely order again.  If you like a stronger cup in the morning, without being bitter, give this one a try.

review/text: As a French Roast fan, I bought this brand of K-cup with high expectations, considering the name attached to it. I was disappointed. It has a hearty aroma and full-bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />If you're a lover of the more robust roasts, I would recommend trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L41Y8A">Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> instead. It is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you're likely looking for.

review/summary: IT IS NOT DECAF PEOPLE!!!
review/text: I'm amazed how many are being so easily fooled.  What you're seeing is a GENERIC ingredient list that covers multiple coffees.  What it is saying, based on the photo I see above, is that IF the coffee type you have is straight coffee, then all it contains is 100% arabica coffee...  But IF what you are drinking is a FLAVORED coffee, then the ingredients in it are Arabica coffee, and flavorings...  But IF what you're drinking is a DECAF variety, then it contains Arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with Ethyl Acetate, as is standard.<br /><br />So if you're not holding a decaf variety, then there is no decaffeinated beans!  It is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to whichever variety you happen to be looking at.<br /><br />Sheesh.  Think people! lol

I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!

review/summary: These K Cups Have ISSUES - Coffee Not Bad
review/text: First of all, I have owned a Keurig for about 4 years now, and I've tried lot's of coffee.  During that time, I have had an occasion k cup that didn't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.<br /><br />I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.<br /><br />I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.<br /><br />I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect.

review/summary: Good, but not Wolfgang Puck good
review/text: Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful.

To be fair, it is billed as a medium roast, and that's what it is. However, it's just too bland for my taste.<br /><br />If you want decaf with more character, try Green Mountain Coffee's Dark Magic Decaf <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I2SK">Green Mountain Coffee Decaf Dark Magic, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a>, or Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004616B3Y">Emeril's Jazzed Up DECAF 48 K-Cups</a>. They are darker roasts though, so if you want a milder coffee the Wolfgang Puck might be what you are looking for.
