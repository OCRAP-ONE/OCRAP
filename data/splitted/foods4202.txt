review/text: One thing can be said for Jelly Belly - they have excellent accuracy when creating their flavors. This holds true for some of this package's beans including baby wipes, booger, and rotten egg (YUCK).<br /><br />The spinner adds a fun element to these as well. My co-workers definitely got a kick out of trying their luck at getting something halfway normal.

review/summary: Perfect drink on a warm day!
review/text: I was very skeptical about buying this as I have never been a fan of any tea. I decided to give this a shot as I was looking for some new k-cups for my maker and for a new drink as I was getting tired for my packets of flavor added to water. After reading several review I made the purchase. I am very glad that I did! I make this over ice but have learned by trial and error to find the perfect combination of a 16 oz double walled cut filled to the brim with ice. From there I make it on the middle setting. Some people say you can use the pod twice for tea but I only like to use it once and I like the full flavor.  This is a great drink with a good amount of flavor and taste even if you ate not a tea drinker, it is not too sweet either which I like as well.

review/summary: I've been using this for flour for YEARS
review/text: This is one of the best gluten free flours I've used and I love it. My family does not like to to feel like they're eating "healthy" foods, so I have to slip in ingredients and recipes that have great taste and texture. I love that this flour comes from a blend of fava and garbanzo beans. The pancake recipe on the back is the best ever (with real maple syrup of course!). If this is your first time with gluten free, you'll need to add xanthan gum which is from a natural plant source and you only use a small amount. I have substituted this flour in my regular banana bread recipe as well with great results. Healthy and yummy, can't beat that in my book.

review/summary: Blech - it's really bean-y
review/text: I have read so many wonderful reviews of garfava flour over the years.  I finally gave it a try by making the pancake recipe on the back (with an egg substitute).<br /><br />I tasted the batter and was overwhelmed by the bean flavor.  One of the things I liked about the online reviews was that people said the flour wasn't bean-y.  I figured the bean taste would not be an issue after cooking.  The finished pancakes were better than the batter, but still too bean-ish for me.  I was barely able to get down two pancakes and that was after soaking them in maple syrup.  I gave the rest to the dogs.<br /><br />The flour was light and the texture of the pancakes was very close to pancakes made with gluten.  I can see how it would be a wonderful gluten- and grain-free option, but I can't get over the bean taste.  Ew.

review/text: I have always loved the Tree of Life design and this cup reminds me of it. The cup itself is very practical. I use it both with tea bags and loose tea. The little metal filter does double duty in my kitchen as does the lid, fitting another non Tea-Forte cup. I appreciate that the lid keeps my tea warm longer. All in all it's a good value. Without a handle, it fits well in my cabinet. I purchased two others to keep as gifts.

review/summary: Perfect gift!
review/text: I bought a variety of these cups to use as Christmas presents for my co-workers.  I included some samples of loose leaf teas.  Everybody raved about the cups, so I had to go back and order one for myself!  The cup is wonderful.  One tiny flaw is that it doesn't have a handle.  The cup is pretty well insulated so it doesn't get dangerously hot, but it is hard to hold for very long until it has a bit of time to cool.  But I use boiling water straight from the kettle, so that might not be a problem for some people.  The strainer piece is the best part.  It is really big so you can brew the tea nice and strong, and it has a little handle that hooks on the cup.  Plus it's deep as well as wide, so the tea leaves get well into the water without having to overfill the cup.  And it works with most of my other mugs as well!  All in all, this is a great product, and a wonderful gift for anyone who likes tea.

The only downside is that the mug itself gets very hot to the touch. The first time I used it, I had to wrap some paper towels around it. I'm going to have to buy a reusable holder/coozie in order to use it again. Otherwise, I have no complaints. I'm definitely going to get this as a gift for my tea drinking friends.

review/summary: Very brittle shell, but almonds are fresh...
review/text: These ended up being extremely expensive almonds for me, as I broke 2 crowns while eating them (no, I didn't learn after I broke one!). The shells are very hard, even though they aren't as thick as some I've had. I love Jordan Almonds, so I kept eating after the first crown lost porcelain, and a few days later, a huge chunk came off a crown on the other side. Sometimes, I'm not that bright. :-(  Order these only if you have good teeth, or, like me, an insatiable craving for the dang things.<br /><br />Some of the almonds will arrive cracked from shipping, but surprisingly few considering they're just in a bag inside the box. The almonds are fresh tasting, and I didn't get a bad one in the bunch. Well, I don't know for sure, cause I did stop eating them after the second crown came apart!

These candies require strong teeth if you are planning to crunch and munch, otherwise just let your saliva melt the candy shell thin enough to bite through to the almond. The almonds inside were soft and normal tasting.The candy coating is probably a little over 1/16 of an inch thick.  The 5 pound candies (again most of the weight is from the hard sugar coating)came in a strong clear plastic bag placed inside a postal office brown envelope. Two or three candies had slightly broken shells. For my taste I would like more good almond and less hard candy.

review/text: I love Cheerios Oat Cluster Crunch and I hardly ever see it at any stores anymore.  So I was really excited to find it on Amazon.  But when I received my order the cereal was expired.  My order was in March 2012 and the cereal expired September 2011.  I won't be ordering any more cereal from Amazon.

review/summary: The BEST Lentils!
review/text: Pardina lentils are my favorite.  They hold their shape when cooked so, being a vegetarian, they are great as a meat substitute in things like sloppy joes or casseroles.  The dryland hills of the Palouse in eastern Washington and northern Idaho produce the best lentils, dry peas, garbanzo beans and wheat, much of which are exported to India and Asia.  Pardinas are great in soups, salads, casseroles and rice pilafs.  Palouse Brand are the only brand of lentils in my kitchen.

I love that they are certified GMO free and the packaging is quaint and rustic. But, really, the flavor and the knowledge of where it came from are the biggest selling points for me, and the price for the quantity is spot on also. I will buy these again for sure.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: These are excellent lentils, from a great agricultural area. I've been to the Palouse several times, a wonderful, amazingly beautiful region of rolling green farmland in eastern Washington/northern Idaho, famous for photography, rich soil, and, well, lentils.  They even have a lentil festival every August, no kidding. When I saw these lentils on Amazon I had to try them - I belong to Amazon Prime, get free two-day shipping - and they are excellent. Like others say, they are small, firm, and really flavorful. They take more time and water to cook than most other kinds of lentils I've used due to their firmness, but retain their shape really well.  They are also chewy, not mushy, and the flavor is kind of nutty. You can do anything you want with them - make curry, soup, salad, mix them with rice or quinoa or chopped veggies, season them any way you like. I love lentils in general, other faves are red lentils (sweet and mushy, make great soup) and black lentils (tiny and round, and a great alternative to black beans) which I can get at local health food stores, but these are truly top shelf, and I've never seen them in stores. I agree with what someone else said, too, they are very clean, I haven't found any rocks or twigs in them. Just great lentils. I'm ordering a five pound bag this time so I can have them on hand for awhile - and I love knowing I'm supporting a great gem of a growing region by buying them.

review/summary: Love the salsa! Shipping and customer service, not so much.
review/text: This is the best salsa I have ever tasted. It is quite zesty without being hot. The product contains traces of milk, for the vegans who are curious. I ordered 6 bottles from Lizanosite and when they arrived, they were in a small, standard USPS box with 3 sheets of thin packaging paper separating the 6 bottles. The box was marked with about 10 fragile stickers, but not enough to provide extra protection for the product inside. Not suprisingly, one of the plastic bottles had leaked. I notified them immediately and included a photo of the box showing where the salsa had leaked into the cardboard. I had to wash all the bottles (the salsa is very sticky) and of course, dispose of the leaking one. They offered to refund my money, but could not replace the product. They said I could send them an e-mail with my NEXT order and they would add another bottle to my order. This, after I had told them that I would not be ordering from them again. I was not impressed. What a shame...

review/text: Our family fell in love with this sauce while spending time in Costa Rica.  We brought home 2 gallons with us the last time we were down there, but of course it was gone in no time.  In order to get this luscious sauce for chicken, beans & rice, eggs, about any thing you have to pay a premium in the US because it is not available everywhere and the shipping is outrageous.  It is the best thing since Heinz 57(tm) sauce and actually we like it better.

review/text: Seriously, this stuff is liquid gold, y'all!  Once you try it, you will find yourself putting it on everything you eat, from eggs to tacos to burgers and fries.  The only caution I would mention is that it is a bit high in sodium, so you really do have to avoid the temptation to use to much.  If ordering from Costa Rican Store, rest assured your order will arrive in good condition, and probably faster than the delivery estimates they post in their shipping section.  Great product (read: ADDICTIVE), and great merchant!  Enjoy!

I purchased this one for myself after buying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YQUXYI">Giant PEZ Pluto, 1.7 Pound Box</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YQRASA">Giant PEZ Snow White, 1.7 Pound Box</a> styles for the kids Easter basket stuffers. It now sits on my desk at work and I love it. Unlike the smaller PEZ dispenser you insert the PEZ candy still in their wrapper and it dispenses a full pack each time. I love it for when I get a little bored or tired, all I do is lift up Woodstocks head and not only does the cheerful "Charlie Brown Theme" play but I get a candy treat too!

review/text: Like most freeze-dried fruit, this has a satisfying crunch-- great substitute for chips and less healthy crunchy snacks!  My daughter, a VERY picky eater, loves these, so we buy them fairly often. These are great to have in the car or purse since they don't spoil.  The only downer is that they tend to glom onto your molars when you're almost at the bottom of the bag.  So be sure you have a minute to scrape them off... It's really a minor point, but if you're headed to a meeting or something, could be an unpleasant surprise.

review/text: I love fruit but let's face it. Sometimes they just don't travel well, especially if you're like me and don't want to or can't carry around a separate lunch bag so your stuff doesn't get squished. And sometimes freeze dried fruit is just plain cool. (I think that more than a few of us can remember thinking astronaut ice cream was the greatest thing on the face of the earth.)<br /><br />The taste of this is pretty nice. It's hard to make anything banana related taste bad and this is no exception. Sure it's not exactly the same as biting into a moist, fresh banana (that sounds sort of wrong) but it's pretty darn close. What I love is the texture. I do get irritated that the banana sticks to my teeth afterwards (so don't eat these before a meeting unless you can clean your teeth first!), but the crunch and texture is nice.<br /><br />The best part of all is that there's no added sugar to this, which is fantastic. I know that sometimes sugar is used to preserve items, but most times there's really no need for gobs of sugar to be added to an already sweet fruit. It turns what could've been a decent diet item into something that's about the equivalent of a candybar. You still get the sweet with these bananas, but without the added sugar.<br /><br />I love these things and I'll buy them again in the future. They're awesome!

Then I found freeze dried fruit and I am a huge fan. It is crunchy like banana chips but better because it does not have added junk. And buying freeze dried is good especially if you do not have a dehydrator to make them your self. So far I am a huge fan of all freeze dried fruits.

Numi teas are known for their high-quality, organic and kosher ingredients, and in my opinion, are some of the tastiest and best teas I have ever tried. They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest."<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

If you prefer stronger teas, then you may want to creatively mix and match for a new experience.<br /><br />Delicate Tea for Calm Mornings<br /><br />The Numi "Morning Rise," organic breakfast blend has elements of smooth perfection when blended with milk powder or cream. This tea has a mild dreamy flavor when using one teabag. You may want two if you prefer a stronger morning blend. If you are looking for an elegant tea, this blend of Fair Trade Certified Keemun, Darjeeling, Ceylon and Assam black tea is sure to impress. Morning Rise is a delicate tea that awakens you slowly to the day and seems to bring a new clarity to the mind.<br /><br />Dreamy Vanilla<br /><br />Numi teas are blended to an elegant perfection. Numi "Decaf Black Vanilla" is no exception and will please anyone who loves mild black tea with a hint of vanilla. For a richer experience, use two teabags per 8-ounce cup. This tea is perfect for drinking at night when you are relaxing, reading poetry or starting a new novel. The vanilla flavor is enhanced with a dash of cream or even an little vanilla syrup from France. I can recommend Rieme French Vanilla syrup or even a cane sugar to add a caramel twist.<br /><br />Delicate Ginger with hints of Anise<br /><br />Numi "Golden Chai" is a delicately spiced Assam black tea that I like to blend with the Numi "Chinese Breakfast" tea made with Yunnan black tea. Together they seem perfect and I like using two teabags per experience. This creates a flowery tea scented with anise and cardamom and spiced with cinnamon and ginger. If you like making chai with milk, heat some milk in a saucepan and then add one or two teabags. It is much more convenient than having to look around for all the separate ingredients and the spices and tea are perfectly blended.<br /><br />Afternoons in Africa<br /><br />Bushmen's Brew "Honeybush," "Jasmine Green Tea" and "White Nectar Osmanthus Spring" make a good combination for a honey/floral tea. Adding in a little honey enhances the experience. With this blend you can enjoy white tea with Osmanthus flowers, green tea with jasmine flowers and honeybush tea with a mild flavor. You may enjoy this as an ice tea in the summer.<br /><br />Lemon Iced Mint Tea<br /><br />Numi's "Gen Mai Cha" Toasted Rice Green, Simply Mint "Mooccan Herbal Teasan" and Rainforest Green "Mate Lemon Myrtle Green Tea" can be steeped together to create a delicious tea to pour over ice. Add honey while the tea is hot and lemon juice just before serving.<br /><br />The Lemon Iced Tea was the best experience of all the teas<br />and I can see myself buying a box of each tea so I can make<br />this tea again.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great Value
review/text: These candy canes are a great value - especially if you are an Amazon Prime member and get free shipping.  Each small candy cane is individually wrapped.  We used about 1/2 of the candy canes and only found 2 broken!  The container will be re-useable too, once the candy canes are gone!

review/summary: Mini Candy Canes for Valentine Cards
review/text: It was very fortunate that there were 280 because 118 of these candy canes arrived broken. They came in a plastic bag wrapped once with bubble wrap and not in the container shown. I called the vendor and they were very helpful. They promptly refunded half the price I paid for the candy canes. I would order from them again but I won't wait until the end of January to order them if I do this project again.

review/summary: Serves a purpose
review/text: We are heading to Italy in Sept and bringing our coffeemaker and these mini moos along! I bought these at Sam's, for half the price, so FYI.  The expiration date is 3 months from now, early Dec.  I don't think these items ever are more than 3 months expiration.  That is the nature of the beast.  It cannot last months and months up to a year b/c it is real dairy. If you get these with an expiration time frame of 2 or so months to use up, as others have 'complained' of, then you are in the ballpark. What I like about this product vs. others that came before it, is that this is the real deal which is so much better than imitation non-dairy creamer substitutes.

review/summary: Love Them!
review/text: These little creamers are a lifesaver ... even better that they need no refrigeration ... of course I acquired them in the winter, so I can't speak about how well they hold up in the summer yet ... but I'm hopeful :)<br /><br />They're handy, the sixty-day expiration date is fine, and they are easy to store to boot. Though the trash generated bothers me a little (the little portion-control cups add up over time), but since I have no space for a small refrigerator in my office at this point, the convenience outweighs my conscience (so far!).<br /><br />My first case will last me over a month, so in the long run, it's even economical. I have nothing bad to say about this product ... really!

review/summary: Excellent Product, Terrible Shipping
review/text: First off, this is one of those cases where I am torn:  Do I rate the product itself or my experience ordering this product via Amazon?<br /><br />The Product:<br />These mini-moo's are great! 5 stars! I absolutely loathe "fake" half and half in my coffee.  These mini-moo creamers are head over heels better than any of those chemical-laden creamers you get.  I previously bought this same product from Sam's Club and brought it into work.  Let me tell you, I was quite the popular guy.  The cost of the product is well worth it...no refrigeration needed and much better-tasting coffee.<br /><br />The Shipping:<br />Yikes. I saw some of the other reviews about these things coming in all banged up and bruised, but I wasn't too concerned.  I usually have good luck with the condition of things I order through Amazon, so I figured I'd give it a go.  Well....nope...not a good idea.  Much like the others on here, some of the creamers had exploded, and all the others looked crush and wrinkled like the package was dropped onto a battlefield by a B52 (well, you get the idea).  The sell-by date was about 30 days from the date it arrived at my door.  I don't know if it's this particular seller on here, but if you find these in the store, you're probably better just buying them there.  They are just as cheap (if not cheaper), and they usually have a much longer usable time period.

review/text: These are very convenient.  I work in an office with limited refrigerator space, so I take these to work and leave them at my desk.  As others have noted, there are way too many to use before they expire (hence the 4 stars), but I haven't been able to locate smaller sizes locally.  My husband and I split a box for work and we are almost able to use them all.  These taste MUCH better than the non-dairy creamer.

review/summary: Half & Half Delight
review/text: Once in awhile I do like to put a little half & half into my morning cup a coffee, but it a waste of money for me to buy a carton as I'll never get around to using it all before it spoils. I like using Land O'Lakees Mini Moo's Half & Half as it doesn't have to be refrigerated and I can have it in my cup of coffee anytime that I want.

review/summary: Great little Moo!
review/text: First, for those that complain about the shelf-life.... this is REAL MILK.  It is ultra-pasteurized (albeit there is a few preservatives added), which is why it lasts a bit longer and can go without refrigeration.  Nonetheless, it is still milk.  Would you drink milk after it has been in your fridge for 3 months [I think not].  So why would you expect this cream to last any longer?  Don't buy more than you expect to use in the next month or so, and you won't have a problem.<br /><br />That being said, this is a great product.  I prefer the taste of real cream in my coffee, and I order these mini-moos for the break-room in our office.  What can I say, other than it tastes like real cream (because it is) and serves its intended purpose well.  (I've seen the mini-moos in many fine restaurants as well, which would say something for the quality).<br /><br />The manufacturer recommends you store the product between 45-80 F, which is understandable.  Storing it higher may cause the cream to curdle.  For that reason, I would recommend having this shipped next-day or 2-day at most.  Keep in mind the UPS truck can up to 120 degrees on hot days, and if you have it shipped ground, you might receive a box of curdled cream......

review/text: Don't laugh, but I discovered this product at a funeral parlor.  It was such a good idea I've used nothing else since.  The little sealed packs are so nice because it cuts down on waste when pints of half and half go sour in the fridge because I didn't use them fast enough.  The flavor is a real improvement over non-dairy creamers.  I really recommend these.

review/summary: Mini Moos
review/text: The problem with the Mini Moos is that I never see an expiration date until I receive the product.  I'll purchase it, then when it gets here I see that it expires in about two months.  I don't even use up all the product and it's past the expiration date.<br />You should let the buyer know what the expiration date is before we make the purchase so we don't buy too much, then get stuck with a box that is past the date.

review/summary: Great Product, Poor Shipping
review/text: The product is great but these almost always come slightly damaged.  Sellers rarely put enough air-pack in them, and usually ship in too large of a box where the creamers can slam around inside.  Of the 6 of these I've purchased over the past 6 months, 1 has been perfect, 4 have been mostly ok, 1 was somewhat salvagable, and 1 was unusable with creamer everywhere.<br /><br />The creamers themselves are great and make coffee over here SO MUCH BETTER.  I wanted to give the prodcut a 5 star, but I have to consider the failure rate upon shipping because it is an online order afterall. I think 3 stars is fair all things considered.<br /><br />*caveat:  I'm overseas at an APO

I'm through the box and I have yet to find a burst creamer (I'm in Colorado so things usually swell and burst during transit to this elevation).<br /><br />These creamers, as do others, require a nice little shake prior to pouring into coffee to eliminate the dreaded curdled appearance.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and will order more!

review/summary: Solid product
review/text: I prefer these to the non-dairy creamers. We have a K cup machine in the office. I keep a private stash of Decaf K cups and a few of these in my desk in case the cafeteria runs out. I don't trust any other brand of UHT half-and-half. BUT... only today I did some research and found that the International Delight Coffee House Inspirations brand of a similar portion pack of H+H has the same ingredients, and is manufactured by the same parent company as Land O Lakes. The 5 stars are for my "uneventful" experiences with the LOL version of the item bought elsewhere.<br /><br />However, I would really prefer little portion packs of a powdered real dairy creamer, such as the "Everyday" brand that I saved one packet of from an international flight. Apparently, powdered real dairy creamers are more marketable abroad for some reason.<br /><br />I bought a carton of about 50 of these at a local Giant supermarket for use if my regular milk ran out and my parents came over and wanted cream/milk for their tea. They are now gone because I started feeding one of these each day to my cat after he begged for more and trained me by manipulating me with his big sweet eyes until he got some.<br /><br />I spent an inordinate amount of time at BJs looking for them last night. Thanks to another reviewer for informing that BJs does not carry it anymore. Darn Darn Darn, as Herman Munster would say.

review/summary: shelf life too short once recieved
review/text: I got the produced on Oct 23, 2012, and the box stated the expiration date was Jan 5, 2013. So, will only last a little more than 2 months. I cannot use all of the product in 2 months. I will only be able to use about 25-30% in that time, so the actual cost is MUCH higher than I thought. There should be a warning about the short shelf life of the product. If I had known, I would have tried to buy fewer items, or would have gone with a different option. I am very disappointed, and feel that I was deceived. This was the exact problem I was worried about when I made this order, and my worst fears came true.

review/summary: Product was Spoiled
review/text: This is the second time I ordered the Moos off Amazon; the first time was with a different supplier (I think), though both were fulfilled by Amazon.  That first shipment came with a 10 week expiration date, and I had no spoilage issues before that date.  This box came with a 5 week expiration, which was disappointing, but because I split them with a co-worker, was not a big issue.  However, we both noticed the first and sucessive times we used them that they curdled in the coffee. We shook them, but they still curdled.  Maybe this happened during shipping because of the hot weather; the Moos have limited shelf stability, and heat likely does not help.  What I will praise is Amazon's great service; they responded quickly to my email and gave me an immediate credit--that's why the  two stars instead of one

review/summary: Buy locally, always check EXP Date on box!
review/text: My review for 192ct is under the 360ct---I messed up, sorry. I agree with others here, ALWAYS check EXP on box and purchase locally (Sam's, Costco, etc) for big savings, compared to buying online/shipping. Mini Moos are a great quality, convenience item. Anytime you purchase in bulk, you MUST be sure you'll use before EXP. Typically it takes 3-4 Minis per mug/cup. As another reviewer stated, EXP is always within 3 months... "nature of the beast". We use these for our Christmas brunch, serving lots of coffee/tea (14-18 people). I put out 2 small glass bowls full of Mini Moos, 1 at each end of our big table, along with an empty matching bowl for disposal (less messy than cream pitchers). We use up the rest of them after that morning then go back to our usual store brand half & half--current cost $1.78/32oz (Aldi's).

review/text: I really like this coffee creamer.  It does not require refrigeration, so it is good to take on trips.  The "Half and Half" flavor is very low in sugar, which is good for those who must control their sugar intake. It is an excellent substitute for those powdered creamers which contain a lot of sugar.<br />I would really like it if Land O' Lakes would make some of these Mini Moo's in their sugar-free French Vanilla flavor which I always use at home.

They last a long time, don't need to be refrigerated, and you always get the correct amount.  If you buy a carton of half and half, it must be kept cold and usually it doesn't last long as you don't realize how much you're pouring.  Not with the Mini Moo's . . . It makes a good cup of coffee or tea a great cup of coffee or tea!

After doing a cost analysis of having this product delivered to my house or going out and buying it directly from either Sam's Club or Costco, I would have to agree with the other reviewer that going out and buying it from a warehouse store such as Sam's Club or Costco is definitely more cost effective than having it delivered.  The price for the item may look good, but after factoring in shipping, it becomes too costly.

review/summary: 75% of my Mini Moo's are spoiled!!!
review/text: First of all the expiration date of the mini-moos was only 3 months away from when I recieved them.  I tried to remain hopefull and started to use them.  I have found that about 75% of them are spoiled. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase / vendor.

review/summary: 192 creamers that must be  used in 3 MONTHS
review/text: My creamers are coagulating and I have used only half.  I am DISAPPOINTED.  USE ANOTHER BRAND. 192 CREAMERS are TOO MUCH for one person to use up in 90 days

review/summary: Delicious earl grey that's fast to brew.
review/text: I love this tea. It's light but at the same time flavorful. I like to brew it in the mornings with some milk and honey. Also, I can usually get two brews worth of tea per bag. This will be lasting me a while!
