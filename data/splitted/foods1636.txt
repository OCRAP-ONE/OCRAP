review/summary: Wonderful Tea!
review/text: To me, this tea has a great lemony taste.  It is good hot...but I prefer it cold and I try to have a container of it in the fridge almost all the time.  I am a "lemon nut" and I really enjoy this tea....sometimes I even add some fresh lemon for an extra zing.

review/summary: Another Good Stash Tea
review/text: Another good Stash tea.  Very pleasant, light flavor with minimal aftertaste (sometimes use two bags to get stronger taste) that's especially good for upset stomach.  Really impressed with shipping speed - from ordering to my door in less than 24 hours!

review/summary: Peppermint for sure!
review/text: I started using peppermint oil for my sebhorriac dermatitis and someone said to try the tea for digestion and irritable bowel syndrome.  Though I have only used it twice, I have to admit it did help me. Not sure if that is just a coincidence or that it worked.  But two times is enough to convince me to keep using it!!

review/text: This tea is yummy!  Unlike many of their fruit flavored teas, this one has no licorice in it (yeah!).<br /><br />Smooth berry flavors, but not too strong on any one flavor.  It gets better as it sits.  It can steep for a long time and not get bitter at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Best Peppermint Tea We Have Found
review/text: My husband has IBS and peppermint tea is essential to managing his condition. We have tried a variety of the peppermint teas commonly found in our local supermarkets and none of them come close to the quality and effectiveness of Stash Peppermint Tea. We were happy to be able to get it in bulk from Amazon.com.

review/summary: Fruit-Flavoured Tea
review/text: Stash is a very good quality, full-bodied tea and I am a big-time tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea since probably before Superman was born.  I like to keep a bunch of different flavoured teas around, especially some fruity flavours.  I call them dessert teas because I usually don't eat dessert, but I like to have a fruit tea after dinner.  Stash tea bags are usually, if not always, individually sealed in a foil-type packet, so the flavour stays fresh for a long time.<br /><br />The acai berry flavor is delicious!  It has a nice natural sweetness and a very fruity taste.  It is very smooth and is a caffeine free herbal tea.  The 100% natural ingredients, listed in this order, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, orange peel, chicory root, blackberry flavor, blackcurrant flavor, acai flavor, acai fruit powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.

review/summary: One caveat...
review/text: This tea is great! It is very sweet on its own- I like to alternate drinking it with sips of water, which makes the licorice flavor even more pronounced!<br /><br />Just use caution if you have high blood pressure or glaucoma. Licorice root can raise blood pressure. I don't have either condition, but after finding that out, decided that this was better as an occasional treat (as opposed to a daily ritual.)

review/text: This herbal tea is well balanced and pleasant.  It tastes to me like good real lemon, but not acidic.  The ginger seems just enough.  Bonus; you can use the bag twice and get a good cup of tea the second time.  Also, it's nice to steep this with black tea, and get a bit of caffeine if you choose, along with the ginger / lemon flavors.

review/text: This is my 'go to' tea out of all the tea brands and flavors I have tried. I average two of these tea bags at my office every day. I particularly like the fresh blend in Stash brand and I think this particular brand makes superior mint tea over other fancy tea brands. My husband and I each have a box in our separate offices and a box at home at all times. Yes, it really is that good- just try it and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />On a related note- we have tried the Moroccan Mint bags and the Premium Peppermint is much better.

review/text: My favorite tea is raspberry flavor and I have tried every one I have found in the stores. This one is by far my favorite! The flavors are so sweet and I have been able to give up coffee for this one! This is a great price too if you buy two 6-packs you save the shipping. At my local store I can get this tea for $0.15 per bag but on here it works out to $0.11 per bag, which would save me $9.60 on that amount of bags.

review/summary: Best unsung home remedy
review/text: I never liked the flavor of this tea initially, and had a box sitting in the back of my cupboard for over a year, until I discovered its use as a home remedy.  It is soothing to the throat and digestive system, and contains natural expectorants and antispasmodics.  As such, I've found it to be a great reliever for coughs, cold or allergy symptoms such as congestion and sneezing, and even painful periods. Today I swear by this stuff and always have to have a box around for sickness. I've thrown away all my cold medicines and cough syrups, the natural herbs in this tea are better for you and almost as effective without the side effects of drowsiness or confusion. Not a doctor, just a happy customer.

review/summary: Nice tea
review/text: I have been drinking this tea for some time.  I happen to like Chamomile teas they are very a mild, I do not like teas that are to strong.  One bag is enough or me I can put it in a cup of hot water and leave the bag in without worrying if it was to get too strong like other teas do.  Adding just a little raw honey enhances the flavor also.<br />I enjoy this tea before I go to bed and it has a very soothing and the warmth of the liquid allows me to slip into a nice sleep.<br /><br />I like the convenience of a foil package, I can carry one or two with me when I go out to lunch with friends, I just order a cup of hot water and slip this tea into it.<br />I have on occasion I have put this is a cup with some fresh ginger and it makes a totally different tea, and he ginger helps sooth the tummy while the Chamomile tends to relax you.<br />Doesn't get much better than this.

review/summary: Sweet and Lovely Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Yum for Yumberry!
review/text: I don't think I ever heard of "yumberry" flavor before, but it is yummy!  As I have said before, I am a big time tea drinker and Stash makes excellent teas.<br /><br />This one has a smooth, fruity, berry taste and is sweet and delicious.  It would be great served alone, after dinner, or with a piece of good quality cheesecake.  Although I am drinking it warm, it would likely taste great as an ice tea, too.<br /><br />If you want to sweeten it, I suggest natural brown sugar, honey, or agave cactus juice (natural food isle in supermarket).  For this one, I used 2 bags for 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />As with all Stash teas, each bag is sealed in its own foil pouch to protect its delicate flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients, in order listed, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, yumberry flavor, chicory root, blackcurrant flavor, blackcurrant powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.  It is a 100 % natural, herbal, caffeine free product.

review/text: Best chamomile on the mainstream supermarket shelves. Other chamomile teas have had a bitter aftertaste, but this one by Stash is really smooth and fresh. It's neither strong nor bland, just floral and pleasant. Reminds me slightly of chrysanthemum. It doesn't make me sleepy or keep me up, for what it's worth. I had some primo stuff at a local coffeeshop that tasted much like the Stash brand, but had an awesome citrusy floral aroma; been wanting to find something like that for a while, and so far this Stash Chamomile comes closest.

review/text: This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!

review/text: This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc.. To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as "water pills"  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket.

review/summary: Absolutely the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated. In other words, I think all teas taste generally the same: like hot water. Even with sugar - then they taste like hot water with sugar. But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle. Even if they did, it wouldn't be that awesome, since this is pretty much the same exact price it would go for in, say, Target. Unfortunately it is 6 boxes...but I really don't think you can have enough of this stuff.<br /><br />After some trial-and-error, I can now say that, of the few other licorice teas that do exist, nothing really comes close to Stash. I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it. Amazon is a good deal and it's soooo good.

review/summary: Different and Tasty
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.

review/text: Stash's Cinnamon Apple Chamomile is a comforting blend of apples, hibiscus, chamomile and cinnamon. I use two teabags per cup as it gives the tea a much more full-bodied flavor. I've tasted quite a few cinnamon-apple teas and this one is my favorite. There is not too much cinnamon and just enough apple flavor. It is even more delicious when sweetened with a huckleberry honey. You will want to drink this tea while decorating for Christmas or while eating a piece of cake. This tea is especially good with the Butter Rum Cake from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811867811">All Cakes Considered</a>.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?
review/text: I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor "blossomed" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea "dances around the sides of your tongue."  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the "flavor burst", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The "flavor burst" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.

review/summary: Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash
review/text: After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers, 350 mg, 100 capsules

review/text: I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.

review/summary: I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea
review/text: Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.

I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Really great tasting tea.
review/text: I purchased this tea for a neighbor when she had mentioned that she loved the taste. I then went and purchased a pack of 120 (a bit much, I know) but it was totally worth it. The tea has a spicy, yet citrus-y taste that is both refreshing and aromatic. I highly recommend this tea for anyone whom is looking for a new 'everyday' flavor of tea.

review/text: I have to admit I did not actually taste these pops (you'll have to trust the other reviews on the flavor), but I included these in my 5-year-old son's party favor bags along with 4 other items, and they were the first items the kids pulled out. All of the kids seemed really delighted by them (which was the point), as they are not your average tootsie-pop or "ordinary" lolly pop. I noted, however, that they are quite difficult for preschoolers/kindergardeners to open, as they are excessively sealed, but once the wrappers were forcibly removed, the kids really enjoyed them.

However,the texture is perfect so is the taste.<br />  I have a lot of food intolerance and it seems like everything contains gluten or soy. Not these.

After brewed, I added cream and sweetener and it only tasted sweet; there was no buttery or nutty flavor in this coffee, which is why I bought it. I can't quite distinguish the flavors that are in this coffee. Even when I tried this black, it just had a sweet taste with no other flavors. I would suggest buying a syrup and adding it to a regular flavored coffee or trying another brand. I will not be repurchasing this one.

review/summary: Wish-Bone Chunky Blue Cheese - Beware...
review/text: Okay, I decided to pick this up because it was on sale for a unbelievably low price. and I also love a good Blue Cheese dressing. So that evening I made a salad and opened it to pour some on. Well, it was certainly thick and creamy, which gave it good eye appeal, and smelled decent too. So I put a good amount on the salad, then took a great big bite, and oh my God, it tasted like a mouthful of creamy, tart, mixed-up, "cleaning chemicals"! An, almost ammonia like taste! I immediately grabbed the bottle to make sure I hadn't accidentally put the cleaning product I had also bought that day in the fridge by accident, literally!!<br /><br />All of "it" went in the garbage almost as fast as that bite I took flew out my mouth! And, perhaps that thick and creamy look was "floor wax" in there! OK I'm kidding, but what a God awful excuse for a Blue Cheese dressing! I just thank God I didn't swallow, or it would have been "Wish-Bone "blowin Chunk's Blue Cheese Dressing".<br /><br />You've been warned... So, beware, and run away fast! YUK

review/summary: Where's the cheese?
review/text: I bought this product because I had a coupon and was hoping a dressing advertising itself as 'chunky' could carry through. This isn't one of those cases though.<br /><br />First, the taste of the dressing is very tart. We're not talking mild 'dress up'. Somebody at the product production factory got a little too carried away with the recipie creation. So even people really liking blue cheese flavor (such as myself) are going to grimace when eating this stuff. Pouring it down the kitchen sink might be a better option.<br /><br />Then, detecting cheese flavors themselves become hard when there are little to none cheese chunks actually appearing in the product. It was questionable practice back in another era, but today definently, merely having a tart salad dressing should not count as having produced a blue cheese salad dressing.<br /><br />When other shelf dressings have actually now mastered putting detectable cheese chunks into their dressing, Wishbone would be wise to copy their playbook and upgrade the quality of it's recipie.

review/summary: WONDERFUL MIX!
review/text: I like to bake whole wheat breakfast foods for my family and this mix makes it super easy and they turn out so good.  The whole wheat gives it a sweet nutty crunch to the top of the muffins.  It is hard to find a whole wheat mix that tastes fresh because whole wheat flour begins to degrade as soon as it is milled, I don't know how Hodgson Mills does it since these are preservative free, but they really taste fresh!  Each box of mix is the size of a Jiffy mix and makes 6 large size muffins or 20 mini muffins.  I bake mini muffins at 400 degrees on the convection setting in my toaster oven and they are done in 7 minutes, great in the summer when you dont want to heat up the house.  I highly recommend!<br /><br />PS> Just an FYI on the price: I paid about 8 bucks for an 8-pack of boxed mixes using sub & save with amazon, so about one dollar a box.  I notice that when amazon has them out of stock another merchant on here is selling the 8-pack for THIRTY dollars plus TWELVE dollars shipping, WOW, that is the most unethical markup I have ever seen since the Hodgson Mills website sells them for close to a dollar a box too if you buy a 6-pack.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY PAYING MORE!

review/summary: Good But Not Great
review/text: As a mother of four who also happens to be a nutritionist, I am always searching for quick, convenient, and healthy snacks for my kids.  This product is a whole-wheat product as opposed to one made from refined grains. It does contain soy lecithin, which is an emulsifier that is generally considered to be safe, but is now added to so many foods that I would feel much better recommending this product if it did not contain it.<br /><br />Be warned as a whole grain product, the muffins have a grainier and heavier texture that may take some getting used to if you aren't used to buying true whole grains.  You can also add natural sweeteners like applesauce, raisins, or cranberries to enhance the flavor and still keep them a relatively healthy treat. When making as snack I sometimes add dark chocolate chips. Definitely a healthy alternative to the average chocolate chip cookie.  The price was also right.  At about a dollar a box, which gives us 8 muffins even though the box says 6, it is an economical choice as well.

The muffin has a strong, almost bran muffin taste, and is very filling.  Its nutritional value is much better than most muffins as well.<br /><br />The directions for a loaf or bread aren't on the box, but I baked one batch this way. And it worked out even better than the muffins.

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: We just recently added a corgi to our family, and I started researching different types of wet and dry foods for our pup. After trying different raw diets, we eventually settled on the Weruva brand of dog food. Our local pet store recommended it to us, and the girl working actually opened up a can and started eating it! It's processed in Thailand, and before that scares anybody, you have to realize that the food processing laws in Thailand are MUCH more strict than in America (read it up online!). They are not allowed to process by-product in their pet food, or use filler product. Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater. The first night we got him the regular Chicken with Gravy he ate that whole can up. He loved it, and when we tried feeding him anything different he refused. Then we ordered him the Kobe Master flavor and it quickly became one of his favorites. I'd definitely recommend this brand, especially coming from a very concerned dog owner. I won't feed my dog anything else.

She even refused a stranger trying to feed her real meat!(She doesn't trust strangers I guess...)  After months of trying every type in the market.  I'm saying all of this to say that she is super pickyk.  She'll only eat real chicken breast jerky, dingo brand bone with chicken in the middle, and the weruva brand wet food.  (And fresh vegies and fruit... mystery)  Anyhoo, of all the dog food/treat in the market, she LOVES this one the best.  That says a lot.

review/summary: My Shih Tzu LOVES this food!
review/text: My 2 year old Shih Tzu boy loves this food.  I mix it along with Health Extensions so he has the benefit of both types and flavors of foods.  He was typically a poor eater, but now just "woofs" it down!

review/summary: Different canned food for dogs
review/text: This is a little different with the pork in it however my dogs love all of the Weruva brands. Just good simple food made well for animals. 95% meat which is what they need.

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: Please ignore the 1 star review.  That's an Amazon mistake and this terrific dog food doesn't deserve a one star because of an Amazon tagging error.  Weruva is one of the only genuinely human grade dog food products available.  My three pugs had totally gone off their food for days until I tried this brand .... I was going to buy Merrick (which they don't like very much) and found this instead.  It is spectacular.  Doesn't even smell like dogfood.  And, Amazon's price is very reasonable compared to my local retailer.  THIS IS A GREAT DOGFOOD PRODUCT and really worth trying out if you are an animal lover.  BTW - I now give it to my cats too and they are the fussiest eaters in the world -- they love it too.

review/summary: She'd stand on her head for this!
review/text: I ordered both this type and the Paella for our Akita, and I have to say hands down, this is the only food that she gets excited about about EVERY time. She is a picky eater, and sometimes the other food, has to be put in the refrigerator because I don't want it to spoil. I don't give her this "flavor" all the time though, because I want it to be more of a reward type meal. Have not tried the Kobe flavors yet, but am looking forward to...am waiting for the economy to pick up a bit more to try these ones just in case she is not as crazy about these as she is the pork version.

review/summary: Makes my dogs sick
review/text: While the ingredients look good (though the water content is 80% while most of the better brands have 78%) this food has managed to get two of my dogs sick!  Vomiting and uncontrollable bowel movements.  One dog is 17 yrs old and the other 4 yrs old.  I stopped feeding the older girl this food some time ago but discovered I still had cans so I gave a can to the 4 yr old.  After two days on the food he became sick.  He is now on rice and chicken for the next few days.  I cannot recommend this food to anyone.

review/summary: Healthy food for healthy kitties!
review/text: I switched my kitties to Weruva a few months ago, and I'm so happy with this product. The food looks/smells/feels like actual chicken a human would eat, and the kitties love it. While they've always been healthy cats, their coats have gotten even shinier since I've started feeding them an all-wet diet (including Weruva), and they're maintaining a healthy weight and activity level. I'd highly recommend this food to other pet owners, and Amazon's price (with the free shipping) is the best I've seen.

review/summary: decent dog food, but Fromm's is better
review/text: This brand is not bad, the ingredients are all good. However, compared to Fromm's canned dog food, I was not impressed. There seemed to be more liquid in the can and the can was not as full. Also, my puppy's stool turned more runny after eating this. I did not have this problem with the Fromm's canned food which definitely was more solid and less liquid. I give the company credit for using quality ingredients but the food truly looked more watery and filled with liquid. Maybe that is good for cats but I tried their dog food for our puppy.  I will go back to Fromm's and exchange the remaining cans of Weruva.

review/summary: Worst Shipping EVER
review/text: I love Weruva for my dogs, let me say that up front. I ordered 2 cases of this food, and out of 24 cans FIVE were usable. The rest were so badly dented that they were opened and molded. When I tried to return it, I found that This food has a NO RETURN policy. I ended up paying more than $10.00 a can for those 5 cans. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I have been ordering my dog food through Amazon for some time, and this shipping problem is getting worse. Much of the product arrives dented, but unopened. Instead of throwing money away like this, I will pay a little more and pick it up myself! Buyers, please be aware of this NO RETURN policy!!!!
