review/summary: Professional whipped cream
review/text: If you are preparing a desert with whipping cream, this is the product to use. You will have a professional look and the whipped cream with Whipit added, holds in the refrigerator for about three days. Without, it will turn runny in less than a day.

review/summary: A staple in my kitchen!
review/text: I have been using this for literally decades, having found it first in the military commissaries I shopped in. I can't imagine making whipped cream without it. Leftover whipped cream is usable for a couple days if you put Whipit in the partially whipped cream. I have filled sponge cakes with flavored whipped cream (like a jelly roll style dessert), topped chocolate pots de creme for a party and had still-attractive edible leftovers (yay!), and at the holidays I can whip all the cream for pies at once instead of again the next day for the leftover pie. NOTE: It does give the whipped cream a bit denser consistency, but I actually like that. Partially whip 1 c. heavy cream + 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp vanilla extract. When volume starts to increase, sprinkle 1/4 c. to 1/3 c. powdered sugar and a packet of Whipit over it. Continue whipping JUST until max volume. If you notice volume decreasing, stop immediately!

review/summary: Whipped cream stabilizer A++
review/text: I used to buy this in Canada on vacations, but haven't been back in a few years. I couldn't find this in any U.S. store, so I was thrilled to find it here. This stuff is amazing. You simply add it to fresh cream that you are preparing to whip. Once the cream is whipped, it remains stiff for several days. This is particularly handy when you are putting a whipped-cream topping on another dessert that you won't serve until the next day or one that creates leftovers. Whipped cream usually falls flat and gets runny. But not with WhipIt. You'll love it. It's a tad expensive, but worth it, I believe.

review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

review/summary: Tastes great but really acidic
review/text: I think the medium roast is the best tasting espresso I've ever had.  However it gives me acid reflux about half an hour after I drink it.  I've only had this happen once before, with another brand of lightly roasted espresso.  I tried the espresso a couple of times, hoping that something else was causing the reflux, but alas it was this yummy espresso.  I really prefer the medium roast to the dark roast, but I had to go back to my organic beans (and my reflux went away).  But if reflux is not a problem for you, this stuff is really great.  Although it didn't taste as good the second day as it did the first day.  I guess that happens with all coffee though, which is why many people grind their own.

review/summary: Pepsi
review/text: Pepsi original<br /><br />Pepsi is an amazing soda! The taste is like Coca Cola, but theres a diffrence.<br />  To be on the right page, it was the first caffeine soda I ever had. At first I didn't know if I would like it. Then the first drink hit me. I had never ever tried something like it. At last I had my first caffeine soda. For a month the only caffeine soda I had was pepsi.<br />  My parents decided I needed to try something new! So my mom went shopping. Instead of bringing home pepsi she brought home Dr. Pepper. They told me I needed to try something new.<br />  The very first drink of Dr. Pepper I didn't like. I'm not saying Dr. Pepper is nasty, I'm just not into it. Later on in the month my mom went back to get pepsi. I was so happy I did a happy dance. I love the colors of the pepsi brand! They are red, white and blue. Just like the colors of the flag.<br />  9 out of 10 of my friends like pepsi. They have some problems and so do I.<br />  The taste, well lets put it that you can't really tell someone the taste. It's just difficult to describe the taste. You would take a sip and if someone asked what it taste like you wouldn't be able to tell them.<br />  Now this is the important part! If you like Dr. Pepper then you won't like pepsi, but if you like Coca Cola then you will like pepsi! I want everyone to try it. It's an enjoyable drink and I hope you think so too!

I was turned on to this sauce by a dear friend of mine who pointed it out to me in Swiacki's Store in Philly:<br />Swiacki Meats<br />3623 Salmon Sreet<br />Philadelphia, PA 19134<br />This is the BEST place to buy kielbas or any type of sausage in any form by the way, and they always stock amazing goods and groceries there as well.  My very first can was purchased there.  Buy local if you can!<br /><br />Back to the sauce!  They only use vine ripened Jersey tomatoes and I do not know what else they put in their sauce, but it is amazing!  I bake my own pizza now and their sauce is the sole reason!  The flavor and texture combination will literally produce "WOW!" results from guests at your dinner table.  Beleive me, you would never guess the quality of the contents of this CAN!!! (not a glass jar) by the label.  This stuff is amazing and you really need to try it for yourself.  I will step off the soapbox now!  Try it and you'll never look at another jar of pizza sauce the same way.  It's just that good!

Afterwards, we took her on a hike and she couldn't seem to stop "going", had 7 bowel movements on a 2 mile hike; and they were very watery.  She's still not acting back to her normal self.  I guess it makes sense; I wouldn't trust a butcher from a group of people whom I know to be cannibals, why should I trust dog treats made in countries that eat dogs?

review/summary: Thank goodness for the internet
review/text: I used this squid ink for a recipe out of Ferran Adria's new Family Meal cookbook.  I had to buy on Amazon since apparently no one in Dallas has ever heard of or carried squid ink in their stores.  Thank goodness for online ordering!<br /><br />I used two of the four packets for the recipe (for 2 servings of squid risotto), and it dissolved into the fish stock pretty easily.  I was expecting any stray droplets to permanently stain my counter, but that didn't happen.  It wipes up easily.  The taste was good...kind of salty and milder than I expected.  I've never had squid ink before, so I can't tell if this product is better or worse than others, but I liked it and the dish turned out well.  I'm just glad that I didn't need much more for the recipe since this product could get a little pricey in larger quantities.

review/text: Well, this ink was used for squid ink spaghetti (tomato-sauce spaghetti with squid/cuttlefish ink mixed in), and it's a mild and unique flavor. It does not taste fishy at all. If I didn't know what it was before-hand, I would never have guessed it was seafood. One packet seems to work well for one pound of spaghetti. Very glad I bought this, because I got to try something new and delicious!

review/summary: illy issimo caff&egrave;
review/text: Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel. It's not as good as freshly made espresso but it's not bad at all. I do prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo cappucino</a> as a treat.

review/summary: I wish I could make my milk more foamy...
review/text: I tried the traditional chai mix at the coffee cart at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and it was, needless to say, love at first sip.  So, when I found the vanilla chai mix on Amazon, I simply had to have it.  Aside from the fact that all I could do with my milk is microwave or boil it, this mix is absolutely heavenly.  For Chai purists who are used to the traditional way of making chai, this may not be necessarily your first choice, but for those of us amateurs, it offers a quick fix.  My only suggestion is, if you happen to be lucky enough to own an espresso machine that can foam your milk, make sure you do so as it seems to be what added the additional body that I enjoyed at the coffee cart but failed to reproduce at home.

It does not taste like the Kasai one.

review/text: I was looking for something more nutritional and tastier than rice.  This is it!  It has a nutty, chewy taste and lots of flavor.  I am at high altitude and have to add more water and cook longer, but that is common with grains up here.  I have added loads of Porcini (Boletus edulis) to it and it stands alone by itself.  I have also served it with a chicken curry and it compliments it wonderfully.<br /><br />The only drawback is that there is no nutrition information on it - the label is blank.  I have written them and hopefully the next batches will have it updated.

review/summary: As expected
review/text: I'm a novice when it comes to Bonsai. I have purchased an elm and juniper and both arrived well packaged and healthy. Actually, the packaging was a little tough because they were tightly wrapped with some kind of plastic wrap. And although I'm not an expert it's hard for me to testify that the juniper is actually 4 years old. To my amateur eyes it looks to be much younger.<br /><br />The elm has lost a few leaves yellowing and falling but after a few Internet searches I learned why this is happening. The pots were as I expected and I believe them to be of nice quality. The box also had a green bottle of fertilizer which I wasn't expecting but it was nice and I appreciate it.<br /><br />I think it would have been better if the seller would have included a complementary brochure for Bonsai related products such as humidity trays. The reason I say this is because I am a novice and upon initially ordering I had no clue that such things were needed to help Bonsai thrive. At least with a complementary brochure I could have looked through it and say "Hmm, what is a humidity tray for?" and would have gotten around to getting a few sooner.<br /><br />I have had both Bonsai for almost two weeks and neither appear to be dying or on the fringes of dying. And considering this is Winter it's supposed to be the dormant season so I don't expect much activity until Spring.<br /><br />I would buy again from this seller.

review/text: I got sent a holly bush instead of a Bonsai tree.Funny part of the receipt for the correct flora was attached inside. Slightly funnier, because it was Christmas morning. Then I saw that the plant was sealed and a paper that said refunds were void if it took it out and watered it. However, another piece of paper said, "If you don't water this immediately, it will die." SO, I just took the poor thing out and watered it. Now I have a 23 dollar potted plant of something that grows like weeds outside my window. Gee, thanks.

review/text: This was one of the best purchases I've done in years! It was well wrapped, moist and is a very pretty little tree.

It is relaxing and very comforting creating and taking care of these miniatures. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to de-stress their life alttle!

However, I was told two weeks ago, a new product had been mailed.... it never came, as patiently as I waited and even commuicated with the seller. When I finally received it, today the post mark date was exactly one week ago to today's date, meaning they did not mail it when they said they did. The post mark date was nearly a week after the date they told me they sent a new product.<br /><br />The plant was ok - I was really disappointed - expecting something somewhat bigger and prettier.

It came in a rectangular pot instead of a circle like the one in the picture. That I don't mind. It was also very healthy. Wish it had a drainage tray.<br /><br />I see people saying that theirs is nothing like the picture.  I guess the style of tree will vary depending on who you buy it from, since there are different buying choices. I got mine from Sheryl Shop.<br /><br />Update<br />Check your bonsai for spider mites. Mine got infected before I knew what they were, and died within a year and a half after buying. Was still a nice tree though.

I would highly recommend him to anyone looking into purchasing a bonsai tree. For anyone who is disappointed in the size of the tree, as I was at first, please note that these are baby bonsai trees. What fun would it be if you could not raise your tree and watch it grow? I think its exciting to be able to watch the tree as it becomes stronger and more beautiful. As this was my first bonsai tree, Lou was great over the phone and very helpful, he'll even refer you to places to buy supplies for your bonsai instead of heckling you to buy his products. You can tell he's very passionate about what he does. Take my word for it that you won't be let down.

It even came in a awesome oriental ceramic dish with tan pebbles on the soil. There was even a card attached so I can contact the owner (Lou Rindner) with any questions! The website he left me was [...].<br /><br />I purchased a bonsai from this exact seller that came from California last year, it was basically a short bushy twig and died after 3 months of me intensely taking care of it and trying to revive it.<br /><br />If your going to get a Bonsai from this seller, make sure it comes from Florida, or anywhere but California!!

review/summary: You don't GET the tree they show in the picture
review/text: This is my first Bonsai tree. It is obvious it is at least 1 yr old or less and it is a baby bonsai. The seller kind of tricks you with their profile picture. You DON'T GET A TREE LIKE THE ONE IN THE PICTURE. What you get is a small bonsai tree with one main branch and maybe 7 inches in lenght. My tree goes up about 1 and 1/2 inch out the ground then curves at a right angle. I am disappointing but using some wire I should be able to make it look unique I hope.<br /><br />When I arrived home to get the package, it looked like UPS played kickball with the package. There was a big dent in the box like someone stomped on it. Luckily, the tree survived. Since, I have been taking extreme care of it. I water it every Sunday. I give it indirect sunlight and sometimes take it outside on the porch for fresh air. I use a spray mist bottle and mist it once in a while to make sure to clean off dust, bugs and other things.<br /><br />Other than my disappointment in what I got, I am happy to finally have a tree that I can take care of and watch grow.

review/summary: As described. Very nice. I love it.
review/text: Small little bonsai. Arrived tightly package, but foliage was a little dry. Nothing a good misting couldnt fix. Only 3 or 4 inches tall but nicely shaped - looks as though it was trained with wire. I understand why some people have described it as a "twig" but Im not sure what they expected for $9??? This is my first bonsai, and I can already tell you it isnt a houseplant or even an outdoor plant. Its a lot close to a pet. You need to check in on it at least once a day. Other things Ive learned: To water it, use a mister bottle and saturate the foliage until it "rains" on the soil enough to water it. DO NOT put in direct sunlight when the foliage is wet. Also, it likes direct sunlight in the morning hours, but not during midday. I keep mine where it receives direct sunlight until about 1130am. I also move it when I come home from work to get the late afternoon sun. Probably in the winter it can handle longer exposure to the direct sunlight.

review/summary: Don't buy unless you know you what your getting!
review/text: The first picture of this was very deceiving. The tree I was delivered was nothing like the first picture which greatly disappointing me but the thing that made me angry was the fact that the trunk of this small tree was slightly broken. It may have been the way it was packaged because it was awkward to look at but I got to get it out without further damaging it. The shears I bought were the only thing that was just like the picture though and works like a charm. I just don't recommend buying this if you don't know what your getting yourself into.

review/text: The local places want around $40 for a small bonsai like this, so this was a great deal. I wasn't sure how they would ship it to me and have it survive, but it did. It was packaged nicely and arrived before the estimated delivery date! I would recommend paying the few extra dollars for expedited shipping, just in case. It is a great starter tree, and I will get others in the future to make a collection.

review/text: PROS= Product was well packaged-bonsai tree appeared to be healthy- packaged instructions on how to take care of plant- seller contact information encouraging buyer to contact them with questions.<br /><br />CONS- as is to be expected with any plant purchase, the one I received varied significantly from picture in description-different bowl shape and color- my tree appears to be less established- tree bends drastically on the ground, not straight like photo- also growing instructions left out trimming advice although I would imagine that can be obtained online.<br /><br />Overall- good service, just expect to get something that differs from the photo could be as good, or it could be worse.

review/text: I just received my Juniper tree best gift and Japanese black pine tree and I am embarrassed for the company. It took 10 days to get them (not too bad) but they were packaged poorly - crooked and upside down in the box and so puny I don't think they will live. I ordered another juniper from Lousbonsai and received a juniper in excellent packaging and 5 times larger for LESS ! Lou also sent instructions to call him immediately after receiving so he can educate a bit and to call ANYTIME. 9greenbox says if problems, take it to your nearest nursery and ask for advice. Really???? Do NOT recommend this site ever. I am going to do all I can for these poor inky dinky tress. I'm sure Lou will help! Shame. Amazon reconsider this site please. Just awful.<br />ORDER FROM LOUSBONZAI.

review/text: I was a little worried about buying a bonsai tree, sight unseen, especially since it was to be a Christmas gift for a very good friend. Needless worry! The bonsai tree was perfect; its branches were a deep green, it was planted in a black ceramic bonsai dish and included a rock. It had been packaged very well so that the soil was still damp and no branches injured during transport. The company included a sheet of very helpful instructions and a free bottle of liquid fertilizer. It's always nice to do business with a company that cares about its products, and this company certainly does.

review/summary: Juniper Bonsai 4 year old
review/text: When they say good condition they mean it. My bonsai came in great condition. It was on top of newspaper with styrofoam  filled to the top. It was even tightly wrapped with bubble wrap. Keep in mind that they really mean it when they say each tree is different. The tree i got was smaller than i expected it to be. But i dont know much about bonsais. And it came in a cream pot with moss. Which i love. SO when ordering a bonsai try not to get your hopes up because like i said each is different. THe one in the picture is just for to show you the type. For a four year old the price is pretty resonible. Most go in the thousands.

review/summary: Excellent Taste and Good Price for Quantity
review/text: Taylors of Harrogate Irish Breakfast Tea is a true quality blend of this type.  We have drunk Irish breakfast tea for many years, and this is an excellent blend, especially for a bag (which makes it easier).  Other brands we've tried in stores are weak imitations of the type because they tend to cut the blend with cheaper black tea in order to make a higher profit.  ToH doesn't do that and the rich flavor speaks for itself.  This tea is a definite flavorful replacement for coffee... just add cream or evaporated milk... mmmmmm...<br /><br />Do the math on this 6 box x 50 bag count and compare with what you see in stores.  Especially if Amazon offers free shipping, SNAP it up.

review/summary: For True Tea Lovers!
review/text: If you like strong, black tea, then this is the one for you!  My grandfather owned a tea plantation in Assam, India, so I am an admitted tea snob who would only drink tea fresh from the plantation.  It is extremely difficult to find a good domestic black tea within the U.S. (The U.S. is a coffee country, not a tea country - and herbal tea is not real tea!!!).  Black tea within the U.S. is generally weak, watered down and has no taste.  I was pleasantly surprised by this brand of teas (Taylor's of Harrogate in general).  All of the teas that I have tried of this brand have been good, but the Irish breakfast tea in particular is excellent (for packaged tea).  It is a wonderful blend of African and Assamese black teas, with a bold, strong flavor and color.  It is excellent with milk and sugar.  I indulge in a cup of tea with biscuits (cookies!) each afternoon!  :-)
