review/summary: Great berry flavor if you want a blue colored drink.
review/text: My gf and I did a taste test of this and Kool-Aid Twists Blastin' Berry Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZED2M">Kool-Aid Twists Blastin' Berry Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.17-Ounce Packets (Pack of 96)</a>).<br /><br />We found it hard to taste much difference in flavor. They are both good. The choice seems to be whether you want a red or blue color. We prefer red. My personal favorite is Black Cherry.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste. We have changed to using slightly less than 8 cups of water to make the taste richer. We have also increased the Splenda to 12 packets to make it sweeter.<br /><br />Addendum: I decided to decrease my rating to a 4 since I prefer the flavor and color of Black Cherry.

review/text: This is the only Kool-Aid flavor I can drink on a regular basis. The color is very appetizing to me, and it has a lot of flavor. I tried it a few months ago when it was advertised as a new flavor in my store. I bought it regularly, but it suddenly disappeared. None of the stores near me carry it. I really don't understand why, it always sold out quickly.

review/text: This is my favorite flavor of Kool-Aid, hands down. The flavor is a refreshing raspberry lemonade that is quite addictive and a perfect mix of sweet and sour. This pack comes with 96 individual Kool-Aid packets, which will last you for a great while by normal standards. I use this, in particular, at college for a quick drink for friends at dinnertime, and, really, it never gets old!

review/text: My entire family enjoys this flavor.  The color reminds me of a tropical ocean, very summertime appropriate.  Of course, I make it with Splenda rather than sugar, all the taste but none of the cavities/calories.  The company still makes this kind but it is hard to find.  I've found that smaller stores carry it more often than larger retailers.  Thanks to Amazon, I don't have to go crazy searching though.

review/text: I first purchased this flavor at a local grocery store and made it for my daughter during a hot summer day.  Little did I know I would like it too.  It has a great flavor and I make mine with far less sugar than it calls for.  It is a nice cool treat for the kids and adults.  It is also an economic choice.  Since I can no longer find this flavor in the grocery store, I am here at Amazon stocking up for the long hot summer to come.

review/text: 75% of the Torino Classical grissini (thin) bread sticks were broken into pieces.  Otherwise the flavor is just a LITTLE better than the other grissini brands.  All the brands of the thicker bread sticks have a more natural and fresher flavor.  The thicker ones do not taste as artificial as the grissini.  I would have given this 4 stars if most of the sticks weren't broken!

review/summary: bite into the powdery sweetness
review/text: Please, don't bite into white powdered donuts unless you have a glass of milk nearby because that's the ultimate way to appreciate the taste of donuts.  The milk makes them soft and super satisfying.  Actually milk is the *only* way you should be eating donuts (and cookies too- let us not forget the taste of cookies changes thanks to the welcoming presence of a glass of Santa's milk).  I refuse to accept any other way.  Okay, perhaps grape juice and donuts is a worthy alternative.  Just don't DIP the donuts in the juice.  That's what gross people would do.  Though I REALLY don't believe you should be paying 11 bucks for a bag of white powdered delicious donuts here on amazon when the same darn bag is like, right uptown at the grocery store...

I don't know exactly what this einkorn flour is, but it does give Jovial cookies a "malted milk" taste that becomes so addictive that you won't be able to stop with a few.

review/summary: not impressed...
review/text: I was impressed with Jovial's einkorn pasta (had it a few times) and thought I would give their cookies a try.  I don't normally purchase processed foods, but thought I'd give it a go.  Well, I hate to be so negative, but these are not worth it.  Judging by their description (and price!!!) I expected something far better.  Like the first reviewer noted, they aren't too sweet, which is a nice change from your typical boxed cookie.  That's about the end of the positives for me.  The cinnamon and ginger flavor is very bland (really rather stale-tasting, and I've purchased these twice now, just to be sure I didn't get a bad/old batch).  Also the texture is terrible.  I've had imported cookies before and they were better than this.  They are dry and almost tough...they remind me of why so many people don't use whole wheat for cookies.  To be fair, I have baked with einkorn myself (you can buy it online...Jovial sells it, but so do other places, the best price I've found is from the website with the grain's name itself).  Einkorn is a lovely flour to bake with and tends to yield a light and tender product, so I really don't know what they are doing to these cookies.  If you dunk them it helps, but I sitll won't purchase them again.  Disappointing...

review/summary: Not that hot, but good flavour
review/text: We were expecting some more heat from this savina hot sauce. We are of East Indian descent and live in the Caribbean, so we are used to a lot hotter peppers. My husband is the pepper fanatic in the family and he was very disappointed in this sauce. However, I don't usually eat hot sauces and I actually love it. It is not that hot and it has a really nice flavour, so I have been pouring it over nearly everything from spicing up my ketchup for fries, to dotting it over my eggs in the morning. If you have a high tolerance for heat then this is not the sauce for you. If you like low to moderate heat with nice flavour added in then this is a great choice.

review/summary: Follows Melinda's basic winning recipe.
review/text: If you have tried Melinda's Habanero sauces before, or Marie Sharps for<br />comparison, and you like the flavor and consistency, but need more heat,<br />then this is just for you!<br /><br />I agree with Mrs. H, this sauce will not blow the top of your head off.<br />Melinda's advertising is somewhat misleading, as this sauce is listed at<br />577,000 Scovilles, its not. The lower scale of Melinda's Habanero selections<br />are i.e. XXX, XXXX Reserve, etc. are separated by degrees of heat. No doubt<br />this is the hottest of the Habanero family, but I'd hazard to guess this is<br />no more than 50,000 Scovilles, although I'm not doubting the Savinas were<br />tested and certified at 577k.<br /><br />When I mention the recipe, I mean this..."Ingredients: Red Savina peppers,<br />hand-selected choice red habanero peppers, fresh carrots, onions, lime juice,<br />vinegar, garlic, and salt" The vinegar is not noticeable, but in classic<br />Melinda's fashion you get a pulpy carrot/citrus based blast of pure heat that<br />will satisfy most chiliheads.<br /><br />Now I'm not saying this stuff is not hot, it sneaks up on you. And just as<br />you're noticing the mellow flavor of carrots with a lime-juice underscore,<br />you may suddenly realize that the back of your mouth is on fire. But it wont<br />leave any scar tissue or ruin your evening. So as you move up the heat scale,<br />don't pass this sauce by, its terrific on anything. And do yourself a favor,<br />and remove that little stopper/dropper so you can get a liberal dose.<br /><br />5 Scovies!

review/summary: Good for the price
review/text: I got this for $35 for a pack of 24 boxes. Each box contains 2 pouches and each pouch makes two large (2 cup) serving of soup. So basically, if you half the pouches, you are paying for 96 (24 x 2 x 2) servings, which is not a bad deal at all. Compared to the Sun-Bird brand egg drop soup mix, it is a little harder to mix (harder to get the clumps out), and a little less flavorful in my opinion, but you get more than twice for the price (the cheapest I found Sun-Bird is 48 servings for $45). To help with the flavor, I stir in a little soy sauce, and chives. It tastes good.<br /><br />The instructions on the box are odd. It says to add noodles (I've never heard of adding noodles to egg drop soup), and then continue to simmer it after adding the egg, but you shouldn't need to do any more than just bring it to a boil, stir in the egg, turn off the heat and let it cool. The egg is done enough by then.

review/text: When the winter comes with its dark days, this delightful hot beverage will ease you through those somber months. I am not a gourmand, but I know what I like. This is so much better than those dry powder instant mixes requiring only hot water. It is a blend of natural cocoa and Dutched cocoa that is great for recipes.  The Dutched cocoa reduces acidity for a smoother, richer flavor.  I was a kid raised on Hershey's cocoa, this is better. I love it!  Satisfies that deep down choco craving!<br /><br />Just add a cup of fresh milk, 2 teaspoons of sugar and heat it in a microwave oven. Presto! Instant gratitude and cheerfulness!

review/summary: Good Cappucinos, decent Espresso
review/text: Illy's new line of Monoarabica coffee excited me. No more random south american blends that come from here and there, wherever beans are good and cheap. This sounded like a more balanced taste that my senses could enjoy. Was I right? Sort of.<br /><br />Right now I'm working on the Brazil (Guat. next, followed by Ethiopia) and the espresso pulls as it should, forms a decent crema as it should, and has a nice smell, again as it should. What this coffee lacks is any true bold flavor that I was use to in Local Brazil beans. It's not a dark roast, it's more related to their medium roast than coming close to Scura, but that should leave more flavor in the coffee. As an espresso it's very thin in texture and slightly weak in taste to my preference. I pulled my shots on a Gaggia Classic, and ground the beans fresh on a Virtuoso Precisio Grinder at setting 9 micro adjusted to k. Tamped with a Rattle Ware 58mm Tamper, and the shots pull around 28-31 seconds depending on my tamping pressure consistency.<br /><br />As far as cappucinos are concered. It's great. The after taste found in this bean is slightly of a chocolate nature, one person described it as a "tootsie roll after taste". It's very pleasing, especially drinking it as a true cappucino, no sugar added people, measured to exactly the proper specifications, 2 oz Esp. 2 oz steamed milk, 2 oz frof.<br /><br />If you purely drink espresso, try the Scura and thank me later. It's Illy's best beast of a bean and has been my favorite for years (or make a trip to Panama and purchase some fresh Duran Cafe' beans, worlds above Illy if you get their export quality locally). If you make a lot of cappucinos, and the occassional "Mocha-chino" - note not machiatto, learn your lingo people, these beans will be great, especially if served after a dinner. 4 solid stars for now, far too good for 3 on terms of Cappucinos, but no where near 5 due to its poor over all espresso shot rating.

review/summary: The very best breakfast tea on earth. Try it and be thrilled!!
review/text: The first time I drank tea I was nine years old.  Six decades on, I've never stopped.  For many years all I knew about was Lipton's.  Then I vacationed in England and had real Ceylon tea.  The Brits drink it with milk but I didn't pick that up. I packed several hundred bags into my return suitcase and headed home.  After about a year I tried to find equal quality Ceylon Breakfast Tea bags locally.  There's a peculiar organic "Ceylon" tea that uses round tea bags.  Nope.  A fancy French Ceylon Tea that only comes in leaf form from Beverly Hills.  Not bad, but too much trouble in the morning.  There was Twinings, but they stopped supplying **Ceylon** Breakfast Tea and now peddle an inferior "English" Breakfast Tea.  And there have been others.  Then, searching the Web, I found this little specialist company "The Original Ceylon Tea Company."  I've bought dozens of boxes since.  Their English Breakfast Tea is BEAUTIFUL!  That is the only word to use for a tea that is so pure in taste, without any of the muddiness that's in Indian teas or the dull singlemindedness of a Lipton's.  If you would like tea that has the complexity of a good red wine, that is not overloaded with tannins but still has fullness and flavor depth, you have to try this tea.  The little importer who provides this tea does have his own website, but now that the tea is here on Amazon you don't need to explore further.  Add a "six-pack" of this to your book order, brew it with boiling water, sit back, and say AAAAH!  And leave me a "thank you" here, please.  I am just a tea lover who has no business connection to The Original Ceylon Tea Company except as a customer who hopes they stay in business as long as I can sip.

review/summary: Good enough to give as a gift
review/text: Honestly, I hate mustard. But my husband sampled this at a winery in Napa once and insisted we bring some home. When he was nearing the end of the bottle, I made sure to track down another bottle here to put in his Chrismtas stocking. I know, it is kind of a strange stocking stuffer, but he was happy to have a back up of one of his very favorite condiments!

review/summary: cilantro sauce for banana peppers
review/text: I had been trying to cook some good banana peppers. But never could get it to taste just right. If you add this sauce to the mixture before dipping & cooking the peppers it makes them taste great. It was shipped on time. Packaging was great. I will probable order again because I can't find it in the store.

review/summary: An intense grape flavor with an excellent matcha base!
review/text: When I opened this matcha the smell was amazing - but then every one of Red Leaf matcha smells amazing! This one though I wanted to do something different with. Instead of my typical matcha latte I wanted something more eye opening, more sparkly, more vibrant! So today I made something with Italian Sparkling Water, Low fat all natural vanilla creamer, and matcha! This is my take on an Italian Cream Soda!<br /><br />Now of course I tasted the matcha before making my blended drink, and you know what, it was quite good. It was a tad bitter but my water to matcha ratio was a bit off as I intentionally made this one a bit thicker to get my blend where I wanted it to be - but alas it was in-fact GRAPE all the way! I am thinking purple grapes. Everyone tends to have a favorite grape, but this seemed purple all the way.<br /><br />Grape is not normally a flavor I go for unless we are speaking of an ice wine, or something similar, I do love wine infused teas, but as a rule, grape matcha was not one I would gravitate toward, but I got this one because I wanted to test not only the matcha but my own limits. I figure if I love this flavor of matcha then there is no way Red Leaf can go wrong with any of their flavors and so far they have not and trust me I have tired a lot of their flavors!<br /><br />So here I sit with a sparkly, vibrant, creamy, grape matcha that has not lost any of its base qualities or flavors from the matcha powder itself due to all the insane things I have mixed with it. That to me friends says this matcha is supreme!

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: Because I am fairly new to matcha, I have been trying samples from many different sources in an attempt to gain some experience in the area. So far, this matcha is definitely my favorite. It has truly opened my eyes to the beauty of matcha and how great it can taste!<br /><br />I was initially unsure about trying a flavored matcha because I was afraid that the flavoring would overwhelm the taste of the actual matcha. I finally decided to just take a chance and order some... and I was not disappointed!<br /><br />When I first opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised by the sweet aroma. It smells like real grapes, not like grape candy as I had expected. As I prepared my first bowl, the grape smell became more subtle after the water was added. The familiar aroma of matcha then became more prominent. I had begun to think that the grape flavoring had disappeared altogether until I took my first sip. I was still able to taste the subtle hint of grape within the matcha. I am very pleased with the fact that the grape taste isn't overpowering.<br /><br />The overall quality of the matcha is great as well! It is very finely ground and is a vibrant shade of green. It also has a natural sweetness, without bitterness, and leaves a great aftertaste in your mouth. This matcha's quality has by far exceeded any others that I have tasted so far!<br /><br />Red Leaf Tea offers such a wide variety of flavored matchas, and for an excellent price--especially when considering the high quality of their products! I am looking forward to trying many of their other products in the near future!

review/summary: Grapey Goodness
review/text: Growing up, we had a long, gorgeous grapevine in our backyard. Concord grapes...mmmm. Is there anything finer? We had an archway that the grapes grew over, and my brother and I would just sit under it for ages, eating the grapes and spitting out the seeds. Mom would make grape juice and grape jelly and all sorts of grapey goodness...there are few things in this world as delicious as homemade grape juice.<br /><br />When my wife was searching for a house for us while I was still living in the States, I didn't have a whole lot of input. I mean, I could see pictures and such, but really the decision was out of my hands. One day she called me and told me she'd found it, she'd found a home for us. The house itself is kind of small, especially since we rent out the basement, but the backyard...gah, the backyard. It opens up behind the garage into a sort of fairytale....including a long grapevine snaking around the edge of the garage. When she told me about that grapevine, I was sold. This house is our home. We're hoping it will survive when the garage gets torn down.<br /><br />So grapes, as you can see, bring up crazy amounts of memories, and I'm very eager to see which kind of grape flavor this matcha yields. If it's concord, I'll be in heaven. Heck, I'm already in heaven, I love grape flavoured anything!<br /><br />Oh yum. The scent as the bag opens is very much in your face grape. Grape, grape, grape. Guh, it smells so good. The first sip is amazing, like pure grape skittles in liquid form. It doesn't taste like realy grapes, unfortunately, not to me, at least. But it does taste like grape candy, which is almost as good! Remember grape mentos? It tastes like those...yum. Iced, this is amazingly refreshing on this hot summer day. Is it officially summer yet? I think so....anyway, yes. This is a wonderful matcha blend, and if you're a grape fan, it's one you need to try. Need. The smell alone makes it worth it, it smells so amazingly good. I'm so glad they put together a grape blend, I know I'm in love with it. It is totally one of my favorites that I've tried so far and despite having a horrible day, it's putting a smile on my face, so thank you, Red Leaf Tea.

review/summary: Best Store-Bought Chicken Broth
review/text: I had used many different brands of chicken broth before I discovered Imagine Organic Low Sodium Chicken Broth. There is no comparison between this one and other brands.  Imagine's broth is a rich, natural yellow color, slightly thicker than other brands, and full of real chicken flavor.  I love that it is organic and contains no msg. I also love that I can buy it with low sodium content, which allows me to use just the amount of salt I prefer in the soups and gravies I make. This is the next best thing to making your own homemade, slow-cooked chicken broth.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

review/summary: Suggested by Dr. Oz
review/text: This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia<br />so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

review/text: I did a little bit more research online before taking this tea...One time I bought Senna tea out of the blue, just for the heck of it...and decided to drink it one night and the next day I was exploding downstairs.<br /><br />So I decided not to do the same with this one. This tea should be taken carefully. It is used as an immune system booster. I think drinking it four times a week is good enough.<br /><br />I really enjoy the warming up effect it has. Although it is suggested to drink with a meal.
