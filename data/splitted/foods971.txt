review/summary: What a find!
review/text: Can we call these "Cheeseless Doodles"?  They are delightful, and contain no dairy products, so are perfect for vegans in addition to those for whom they are intended: Jews following the dietary laws, who don't have to worry about consuming them during or adjacent to a meat meal.  I'd never thought I'd find them outside of Israel, except perhaps in a specialty store, but this multipack makes them so reasonable that they will soon be your go-to snack.<br />The only possible problem is the presence of peanut--in some schools peanut products aren't even allowed in the school building.

review/summary: The real British baked beans staple food
review/text: Good vegan-friendly baked beans in a tomato-based, rather than brown sugar and molasses-based, sauce.  Nicely spiced, relatively simple baked beans, the way they were meant to be.  I haven't found a better price for them in America, than Amazon's subscription service by the case.<br /><br />They're less sweet than other kinds, such as the Heinz Vegetarian Beans usually sold in America, and have about 35% fewer calories due to having less sugar.  The can I have lists 90 calories per serving, 3 servings per can.<br /><br />Strange "how to play with this food" suggestion:  corrupt your basic beans by adding chunks of green pepper, onion, green olive with pimento and/or (yes, really) radish.  The sauce for these beans works well with all of the above.  I grew up, in the days before ramen, considering a small can of baked beans heated with sliced radishes mixed in, to be an excellent budget dinner.  (Hey, if they work with tacos at Mexican restaurants, WHY NOT with beans?)<br /><br />And yes, they do make a good breakfast, served over toast, perhaps with some sauteed mushroom slices.  As I'm vegan, I've had to be creative at breakfast, when all my friends are eating egg and cheese dishes.<br /><br />Important:  Don't have these in your carry-on when going through an airport gate, no matter how handy of a quick snack they seem to be, with most even being packed with a pull-top lid.  There has been no sadder sight to me than having to head to the gate with my cans of Heinz Beans sitting on top of the x-ray machine as "confiscated goods" because of the liquid they contain, ahead of a 20 hour trip. (!)  That said, they work well for train journeys, because they taste nearly as good cold as they do warm, and unlike other kinds of canned beans, don't need to be rinsed before eating.

I thought it was great until he came down with a fever and intense diarrhea and a low grade fever after getting a piece of it out of the toy.  The vet said that it was recalled a few years back but couldn't find out why. She said to stay away from any pet things made in China as there are no regulations on the making of them.  I won't be giving them to my dog - please be warned and make an informed decision before buying it.

review/text: I have a 1 year old lab/australian shepard mix, 65 pounds, and she tore through the Everlasting treat in 5 minutes.  She liked both the beef and the liver flavors, but I was expecting more from this treat.  I figured the treat would at least last an hour.  I still like to give this treat to my dog because it breaks into small pieces versus a rawhide bone that can tear into large pieces and cause choking or digestion problems.  Ordering the treats save about 40% of the price I pay at my local pet store.

review/summary: Worst Smelling of the Lot, but the Dog Loves Them
review/text: First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really "everlasting" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a>.<br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: The liver discs SMELL. Well, they ALL smell, but these are pretty pungent. I try to make the dog play with it across the room, whereas the other flavors aren't nearly as off-putting.

review/text: I have a golden retriever who loves these treats and they are a good chewing alternative since she has started having some anxiety when left alone.  They last longer when placed in the treat balls but it can be a pain to get them into the ball so I have given them outside the ball as well.  Like I said doesn't last as long but still keeps her busy for a few hours.  If you don't have a power chewer it should last longer but a few hours is the max around here. My dog enjoys the different flavors and she rarely puts it down until she has finished it!

review/summary: Liver licious
review/text: I bought a 2-pack of the chicken flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very "everlasting" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (Liver and Vanilla Mint). I've got a Chicken and a Liver treat in the ball now and she enjoys them both. It takes effort now to enjoy it, and she works on it for over a week until there's nothing left but a treat disc left in the ball. The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it. The Vanilla Mint is her fave though.<br /><br />Two paws up!

review/text: My dog LOVES this flavor, though he also loves the other flavors as well!  I swear by these treats and the Everlasting Treat Ball which these cookie treats fit in.  I have to keep a constant supply of these cookie inserts on hand just to insure that I don't run out.  It takes my dog about a week just to get through one of these cookies because the dog's can only scrape off small amounts of it at a time rather than gulping down big bites quickly.  If it weren't for these cookie inserts and the Everlasting Treat Ball, my puppy would have chewed through all of my furniture, so I can not say enough good things about them.  I will not be without them and have recommended them to my friends, whose dogs love them too.

review/summary: Good treat, but only safe with ball
review/text: This is a good product to use in combination with the treat ball. My Cocker Spaniel uses a medium size. Probably wouldn't be good for a large dog, with a stronger jaw.  The ball itself is made of a sturdy rubber/plastic that is flexible but enduring. My dog's a chewer, and she hasn't destroyed it yet. The Everlasting Treat disks used in combo with the ball seem safe. I wouldn't give the dog the treat on its own, because of the choking hazard. But when in the ball, my dog can only lick and get small bits of treat at a time. It's a good toy and treat to keep a dog occupied. As for the price - I can get a 2 pack of these treats for $7 in a pet store.

review/summary: 11lb dogs: Ball + 2 treats (1 on each side) good for 2/11hr spans of time
review/text: My dogs are obsessed with these.  First I bought the wrong ball - don't be confused with the treat ball where you put small treats inside.  I nearly died when I realized that i needed to buy TWO balls that were more than TWENTY DOLLARS EACH!!  (thinking: "these had BETTER be good")<br /><br />My dogs are 11 lbs each and I got the medium ball.  I think that's the right size.  I gave them each a ball with a treat in both sides.  After two days gone to work (22hrs in total) they've eaten the treats.  So I have to spend at LEAST $7 per dog to utilize these balls for 2 days out of the week.<br /><br />Hmmm...this is like a smoking addiction or something.<br /><br />If you need for shorter periods of time; i.e. while you watch a movie, dinner, gone for  coupla hours, GREAT toy.  I do have to be careful because my two dogs will fight over one ball when another is sitting a few feet away.  I guess they REALLY like them.<br /><br />Good luck.

review/summary: Not everlasting but long lasting, the second time around.
review/text: We have a 5 year old Saint Bernard. It's hard to find treats that can stand up to her for more than 20 minutes so I thought I'd give these a try. First one disappeared literally within 5 minutes. Disappointing. Gave her the second one and it lasted for 2 hours. I suspect the first was broken into pieces and chewed that way, whereas the second was chewed on as a single piece making it last longer. She did enjoy them - a lot. As for it I will buy one again, I'm unsure. She did enjoy it but not enough for me to buy the ball that goes with to make them last longer. So my opinion, go ahead and buy it and your pooch is sure to enjoy it - but it's  50/50 if it's going to occupy them for 5 minutes or 2 hours.

review/text: I have been ordering the everlasting treats for a while now and they really are a great way to keep my Goldendoodle busy.  I have a very bright and powerful chewer who likes to be part of the action at all times.  I only bring these out every few weeks or so because she looses interest if I give them to her too often.  The only down side I would say is that she works on them for so long her paws do have a tendency to get a little smelly and wet so they do need to be cleaned off afterwards.  The key is a treat ball - keep an eye on it.  Once they get stretched out the refills are too easy to pop out.

review/summary: Everlasting...Not Hardly
review/text: I will admit, all four of my dogs loved these.  All the flavors, but, I gave it three stars because of the Everlasting being more like, Neverlasting.  All four dogs, the strong chewers and the two that aren't, finished them within 10 minutes.<br /><br />Such a short amount of "chewing" time, does not justify the price being charged.  Sorry, but I'll spend my $$$ on tendons or moo tubes...

review/summary: Great for dogs in Crates!!
review/text: I bought the initial treat ball at my vet's office, and after it kept my golden busy for a LONNNNNG time I knew I had to find the refills cheaper than they sell them! She LOVES them - when she sees me get it out of the package she follows me nosing my hand trying to sneak it out of my hand. She works at them for awhile, and pops them out of the treat ball, but they still keep her busy. Would be excellant for dogs in crates that need to be kept busy.<br />:)

review/summary: BEWARE - May cause your dog to ignore you.
review/text: If you want your dog to ignore you for a while, this item (with the treat holder)is an ideal solution!<br /><br />I purchased a pair of the Everlasting Treat Fire Plugs with these treats to go in it.  I'll tell you what... my dogs smelled this treat from 10 feet away (I could not, just so you know) and were at my feet.  I handed them each one and they were off!<br /><br />At first they were a mystified -- "Hmmm... I want this.  But what do I do with it?"  And they tried to pull the treat out, but there was no way that was going to happen.  Eventually one dog figured it out -- Lick it, like a liver popsicle.  The second dog caught one, and they both licked through their treats in less than a day.  But they were quiet and out from under my feet.  How nice.<br /><br />Keep extra's on hand for those times you need a break.

review/summary: I don't care for the taste, but the dogs sure seem to like it
review/text: The Everlasting Treats are to be used together with the Everlasting Treat Ball.  (Follow the instructions on how to insert them.  Some of the reviewers had problems with this and the results were not optimal.)<br /><br />My son has a dachshund that devours slippers like they were after-dinner mints and a Corgie that can inhale a sofa leg in under a minute. These dogs are serious chewers.  Nothing satisfied their chewing needs until we found this.<br /><br />The name, Everlasting Treats, is a bit of a hyperbole.  However, it kept my son's dogs quiet and occupied for up to several days.  (Conversely, my own dogs who are not chewers had absolutely no interest in this product. )<br /><br />The dogs are happy and  my son's blood pressure is now down at normal levels.

review/summary: Great Alternative to Oreos and Other Sandwich Cookies
review/text: I thought these cookies were a bit pricey, but with Subscribe and Save, the price is comparable to other organic sweets on the market. Luckily for me, the taste was NOT like other organic sweets on the market, and that is a good thing. While other organic cookies can be very dry and crumble after a single bite, the Late July cookies have a creamy filling that isn't greasy like Oreos. The outer cookie has a good crunch and texture that holds up well and doesn't crumble. There is no such thing as a healthy cookie, but if you get an occasional sweet tooth, these cookies are a great way to satiate that tooth without completely blowing your diet, and are organic to boot.<br /><br />There is no taste, smell or look of green tea in these cookies, you would never know they had green tea if it wasn't for the label. That is also a good thing, and knowing that you can get some of the great benefits of ECGC without a strong tea taste is a nice added bonus to these treats.<br /><br />These cookies are now my official sweet treat splurge that, in moderation, won't blow my food routine.

review/text: These (the Dark Chocolate flavor) are really delicious. I have no desire to ever eat an Oreo again - these are much better. The chocolate taste is fresh and full-flavored without that chemical taste that you find in supermarket cookies. My whole family loves these cookies, too. I get extra hugs from the kids when I pack a couple of these in their lunchboxes.<br /><br />I do think I should warn people that the box is not kidding about these being "intense and decadent." If you like intense dark chocolate in the cookie *and* the filling, there's an excellent chance you'll love these. But if you  prefer a milder milk chocolate flavor, you may wish to look elsewhere. But for a dark chocolate lover like me, these are really awesome.

These are so much better there's really no comparison. I saw these in a store and the box caught my eye. When I saw the ingredient list it looked like something I would like with unusually high quality and healthy ingredients. I thought they were pricey but I thought I'd give them a try. Now they are one of my main foods I ALWAYS keep in stock. I highly recommend these. They are not too sweet but definitely sweet enough. I could easily eat an entire box in one day but usually struggle to keep it down to about half a box a day. Yes they are very addicting!! If you like chocolate I don't see how you wouldn't like these. These are really good!

review/summary: They changed the recipe. Thye're not as good now.
review/text: Late July recently changed the recipe for their Dark Chocolate Sandwich Cookies without any direct notification on the packaging. They disappeared from the shelves in the Denver area and when they reappeared, they were different. The new recipe isn't nearly as good. There's less of the intense cocoa taste that we enjoyed. They're drier. The cookie is more like a dry, less tasty cracker now. Sure they're marginally healthier - a bit less fat, more whole grain and fiber, less sugar. That's fine, but the taste of the cookie has been compromised such that they're just less tasty, empty calories now at 50 calories a pop. We originally switched from Newman's chocolate creme filled chocolate sandwich cookies to Late July's because they were so much better. Now they're not as good. We live pretty far from the Denver area so we stock up occasionally. Since there was no obvious notification of the recipe change on the packaging, I bought our usual supply for a couple of months. Mistake! I'll be donating several boxes to the local food pantry. Hopefully, someone will enjoy them!

review/text: I used to love these cookies, but now they changed the recipe and they taste bland and uninspired. These used to have that certain something. Tasting these cookies for the first time was like finding a taste that was a beloved childhood experience rediscovered. Now they taste like every other mass produced chocolate cookie.<br /><br />When will companies understand that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Another disaster reminiscent of 'New Coke'.<br /><br />We used to seek these out in the grocery stores. Sometimes we'd make a special trip to a grocery store we knew stocked them, just so we could get our 'Late July Fix'. Sadly, I see no need to ever buy these again - unless they change the recipe back to the way it was. But how are we to know, and if they do change it back, can we trust them to keep it that way?

review/summary: Why did you change the recipe?  They are now awful!!!!!
review/text: I have been an avid fan of these cookies for years.  My family went through dozens of boxes a month for our use, taking to functions as our donation, giving as gifts.  They were a dark, rich, wholesome, deep taste experience.  In May, 2012, I couldn't find them on the shelf in any of our normal stores.  After a few weeks, they were back.  I took them home and opened them and was surprised to find that the inside container was different.  It used to be three rows that ran the short end of the box.  Now it was two rows that ran the long end of the box.  No big deal had that been all that changed.  I took a cookie out and popped it in my mouth expected the same dark, rich, wholesome experience, and the cookie tasted so bad I almost threw up.  It was sickly sweet.  It tasted like a combination between an oreo and a health food bar.  All they did was move to the middle ground where those who like health food bars won't like the oreo sweet taste and those who like oreos won't like the health food bar taste.  They are awful.  And, I'm so sad, because before they changed the formulation, these were the best cookies on the market.  I turned so many people on to them.  Now that they changed the recipe, none of us will ever be buying them again.  They are now the worst cookie I have ever tasted.

review/text: I always eat cookies in bunches... 2-3 large cookies, 20 small ones, though I am health focused. When it comes to cookies I can't help it. I tried a vanilla bean with green tea cookie today and stopped at one. It was so special, I didn't need more. The two chocolate biscuits are the perfect combination of cocoa and sweet, and so crunchy. The vanilla bean filling is soft. When you eat the cookie you get the feeling it was home made last night, cooled, you took them out of the jar. No after fullness or taste, that you get from non-organic, super market cookies. Until now I'd only buy the mini white chocolate cookies from Late July, now I'll be buying this one too. Perfect to serve with tea! Amazing product. Must buy!

I have to watch my glucose levels so cant eat more than 1 per day but that one cookie is more than enough to satisfy me. Highly<br />recommended for office parties and kid's birthday parties.

For you health conscious folks out there who can't resist sandwich cookies try these. They are not overly sweet and taste great. You can twist them apart and lick the cream from the inside<br />just like the other sandwich cookie.

review/text: Bought these when they were on sale so I have many boxes!  Really enjoy these cookies and my kids do too.  That's saying something because I remember not liking dark chocolate as a kid.  My husband's favorite is the vanilla bean w/green tea version.  Both are winners in my book.  Thank you Late July  for making healthier snacks and sweet treats!

review/summary: better than oreo's
review/text: My husband loves oreo's and I like natural or organic for my family. So I bought these for us to try. I got to try them first and had to stop myself after eating six, my kids had 2 each. My husband frequently finishes off his dinner milk with a few of these cookies. They are way better than oreo cookies. the taste is great and they dont have that greasyness like oreo's do. You cannot taste the green tea either. I put a case of these on my repeat shipping order for every six months. Well worth every penny and not all that artificial junk in them either.

review/summary: Delicious...but buy the dark chocolate for portion control!!
review/text: I wrote a similar review for the dark chocolate.  I bought both flavors from amazon at the same time, and I still have 5 and a 1/2 boxes of the dark chocolate and only 2 boxes of the vanilla and green tea.  I think that says it all.  They are both very tasty, but the vanilla and green tea are just like oreo's to me...I want to eat them all like the cookie monster.  If you are concerned about portion control...go for the dark chocolate.  Less is more.

review/summary: Crisp, lovely filling--a delicious organic cookie!
review/text: I've had my share of iffy organic treats. Late July, however, has won me over with their consistently quality snack foods. I've tried the crackers (very nice crispiness and flakiness, even), and their cookies rock.<br /><br />I thought I'd stick with the decadent dark chocolate ones (which I love), but these are a nice change. Both are excellent organic cookies--meaning they are hardly all-out healthful, as they are after all a treat, a sweet, carb-filled product that isn't a natural fruit or veggie, etc. But when it's time for you to sit down with a glass of milk or you want a sweet yummy thing after a good meal, these are totally delicious.<br /><br />I do taste some different taste than in chocolate with vanilla cream cookies that I've had before--Hydrox, Oreo, etc--but unlike the really awful Newman's sandwich cookies, these are superior. Very crisp. Sweet. A clean aftertaste, almost fresh.<br /><br />The texture is very satisfying to the teeth, and it just seems to be a product that care is taken with.<br /><br />Thumbs up.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: Hate 'em--But my coworkers LOVE them!
review/text: I had high hopes for these cookies because I adore Oreos and I love other Late July products (my favorite is the mini-peanut butter crackers).  I was disappointed, however.  These cookies taste stale and greasy to me.  They are way less sweet and less flavorfull than Oreos.<br /><br />So I took them to work to get rid of them, and coworkers went wild.  They were gone quickly, and I know some of them plan to buy these regularly now.<br /><br />Each cookie has 55 calories, by the way.<br /><br />I recommend trying to find them at your local grocery store before buying them in bulk on Amazon.  Here in Minneosta, Cub Foods sells them in a 9 oz box for a few dollars.

review/summary: Hard to not eat the whole box!
review/text: These are the best tasting organic cookies we've tried so far!  The cookie has a nice dark chocolaty flavor and good crunch and the filling is creamy and tasty.  I must admit I was hesitant about the "green tea" aspect but you can't taste any tea in these cookies.  By far better than any Oreo in our opinion (not greasy like Oreos).  The worst problem with these cookies is putting the box down and not eating too many!  My 6-year-old's comment after purchasing one box in the grocery store?  "Mommy do they have them on Amazon so we can get a whole case?"  They ARE that good!

review/summary: Fabulous and Out of this World Delicious Cookies
review/text: OMG! The first bite I had I am hooked addicted to those cookies forever. If you eat Oreo then you have this cookie, I bet you'll buy this Late July product from now on. What a difference! I totally love the dark chocolate taste in my mouth. It's not overwhelmingly sweet, it's "rich" though. One pack is just right. I tried to eat 2 packs at one time, then it ended up too much for me. They were over-killing my taste buds. My 15 months toddler likes it too. But only for a little little piece, otherwise, it's too much. I am so happy that I try Late July's products. They are so GOOD!

review/summary: I love Late July products, but this one is dookie.
review/text: These dark chocolate cookies were dry and lacked any flavor. They were very close to cardboard. I payed regular price for them because they would never go on sale. I regret buying them; these were pretty bad and took me and my husband a couple weeks to finish the box. It was more of a chore really. We should have returned them to Sprouts where we bought them, but we were too embaressed to return a box of cookies.<br /><br />I had tried Late July's Green Tea sandwhich cookies and those tasted just like Oreos. They were awesome and that is why I expected these dark chocolate ones to be amazing. Oh well.

review/summary: I really wanted to like them
review/text: Considering I am a huge dark chocolate fan--and I don't mean the Hershey's dark chocolate. I typically like to eat chocolate with 65-70%  cocoa content, and was excited to see the dark chocolate cookies. I tried them and actually (sort-of) liked them at first. The taste was not sweet, but not bitter either. However, after eating a few of them, I had to admit to myself that they just weren't anything special. I tried to give them away at an office party and absolutely no one wanted to take them home after tasting one. I had essentially purchased a case of cookies that I couldn't give away. I typically don't ever leave reviews that are negative; if I don't like something, I just don't review it. However, I tried several other Late July products because I liked the company's stance on many (food-related) issues, and they all left me feeling that same Blah. While others may enjoy these cookies, I just can't recommend them. If you're looking for great-tasting, organic cookies, try Country Choice (also available on Amazon). They are vegan and delicious.

review/summary: Bad
review/text: I was attracted to this box of cookies because of the "brand". "Late July" sounds like a wonderful brand name, and late July does bring back wonderful memories for me: it sounds like a fish fry with homemade french-fried potatoes and cole slaw and hush puppies, an ice bucket, iced tea, a cool breeze blowing from the fan, a porch, and lots of love. That's what I thought of when I saw this brand. Also, it is natural and therefore, vegans can have this product.<br /><br />Vanilla bean with green tea:  The cookies didn't taste good. The flavor idea was pretty good. There was a hint of good flavor. Vanilla bean with green tea sounds wonderful. Possibly, the bad taste was due to all the soy and soy products used.  I managed to eat this whole box (of vanilla bean with green tea) without throwing any out.<br /><br />Dark chocolate:  Horrible.  I couldn't even finish the whole box; I had to throw out most of it.  (And I'm the queen of conservativeness.)  The "dark" chocolate was so dark and so horrible, that it was too much for even a chocolate lover.  The chocolate had a horrible taste.  Not to mention the horrible taste it left in your mouth.  (Possibly too much soy, and whatever was in that chocolate.)  I literally had to go and buy some lemons and ate two, and also some potato chips, just to get that taste out of my mouth.<br /><br />Never again.

A deal for a 5 gallon bucket is significantly reduced when it is delivered as a 5 pound (1 Gallon) bucket. Beware that this is a 1 gallon bucket. I didn't know that they even made a 1 gallon bucket....<br /><br />I could have bought locally for less.

review/summary: Good sprouting barley for making malt
review/text: Product arrived on-time and well-packed.  Very nice 1-gallon drums, too.This sprouting barley is pretty good.  There are some broken grains (perhaps one percent, less than two percent) and a few black round foreign seeds, but I sifted most of the unwanted stuff out before soaking.<br /><br />Germination of my first batch was vigorous, though uneven -- some grains developed acrospires a day or two before others.  Maybe my steep/rest technique will improve that aspect. I'm working on the second batch now, and germination seems much more uniform. Perhaps the first batch suffered from my mediocre technique and the high 70- to 80-degree inside ambient temperatures. It's 60 degrees now, much more appropriate for sprouting.<br /><br />I think this is a two-row variety of barley (these are "plump" and symmetrical, whereas I've read that 6-row is "twisted").  I'm making malt, and am perfectly happy with the results I am getting.

review/text: I have had a hard time staying regular and I heard flax seed was good with aiding that issuse. I tryed this one and was pleased with all the added benifts it has, I have only been on it for 2 days and i'm already going regularly! I add it to my fruit smootie and works great!!!
