review/summary: Excellent dairy-free option
review/text: Our family has used this dairy-free "milk" for over 10 years now.  My husband has been lactose intolerant since college.  We have since had 2 children, now ages 12 and 10, and it is the only soy milk they will drink.  I really like the power because you can make it as creamy as you like.  I have also used it for cooking and it works great!  Our family highly recommends this product.  The only thing I wish they would add would be extra calcium to the mix...then it would be perfect.

review/text: We tried almost every vegan creamer we could get our hands on, that wasn't full of hydrogenated junk, yet I like my coffee very creamy without a bunch of floating powder in the cup.  This dissolves very nicely and tastes very creamy.  You can virtually not tell the difference between this and a non-vegan powdered creamer.  I highly recommend this!

review/summary: Better Than Milk - Great Stuff
review/text: I was introduced to Better Than Milk by a very knowledgable nutritionist when I was recovering from heart surgery. That was 11 years ago. I've used it twice daily since; in the morning on cereal, and before I go to bed with Ovaltine.<br />I use only the original; don't care for the other flavors. This is TRULY "better than milk." One does NOT get any of the junk the dairies feed their cows. Try it!<br />James R. "Jim" Stephens, author of CAMERA SOLDIERS: The Philippine Odyssey and THE WINDS OF OCTOBER.

review/summary: This soy milk is pretty good!
review/text: After hearing how many chemicals are in cow's milk, we decided to try a powdered soy milk.  This product is good.  After it's mixed you do have to shake it up before you use it each time, but that isn't really a problem.  We mixed it according to directions and it's good just like that.

review/summary: New package, new warnings
review/text: I am very depressed... I really, really liked this product, but apparently their manufacturing locale has changed. The product still has parve certifications but there is a new warning on the label that I only noticed after drinking some and becoming uncomfortably stuffy. So, for those who are allergic to anything, I advise avoiding what once was an enjoyable product.<br /><br />Contains: Soy. Produced in a facility that processes or handles milk, eggs, soybeans, tree nuts, what, fish and shellfish.<br /><br />... Seriously, -shellfish-?! Granted, it's the milk that is a personal problem for me, but who in the heck thought that moving the manufacturing locale to a place working with pretty much all of the major food allergens was a good idea?

review/summary: Better Than MILK SOY Powder Original
review/text: Convenient, delicious, useful - this soy milk powder is a staple in my kitchen and at the office. It needs no refrigeration, so a canister is in my office cubicle for a quick soy latte (add hot water and stir until foamy on top) or lovely creamy soup (combine soup base powder + soy milk powder then add hot water) or any one of a bunch of microwave recipes that are easy, quick and practical (a favorite is 1 envelope instant grits mixed with 2 Tbsp soy milk powder, add hot water, stir and let sit to thicken, add 1 tsp honey and enjoy). It's also yummy as a cold beverage, of course. Try pouring cold root beer over 1 or 2 Tbsp, stir, add ice, tastes like a root beer float and foams up, too (use a really tall glass or mug). Only two tablespoons makes eight ounces, so it goes far.

review/text: I'm sorry. I don't understand. This product was not good. I usually use almond milk in my morning oats and coffee, but I thought I would try something different that I could leave at room temp. Mistake. The powder kept falling out of solution in my coffee. So, I had this weird gunk at the bottom of my cup, then sometimes it would float to the top and make it completely unappetizing.

review/summary: I find the taste of this to be rather unpleasant and it is also difficult to mix
review/text: I know that I'm in the minority here.  There are SOOOO many reviews stating that this stuff tastes great and dissolves easily in water.  I don't know if there's something "off" with my family, but we haven't found this to be true AT ALL.  The only reason that I'm giving it 2 stars rather than 1 star is because it can be used in recipes.  If one cannot have milk and needs something on hand for emergencies, it's not too bad in that aspect.<br /><br />I initially purchased one of these nearly a decade ago when I noticed that it was considerably cheaper than Silk.  I thought it'd be great to be able to save some money.  However, it didn't taste anything like other soymilk or milk replacements that I've had.  It wasn't quite as bad as infant formula, but it's not all that far off.  Four years ago, I decided to try this stuff again.  I figured that maybe my initial purchase had been a bad batch or that perhaps the company had changed the formula.  I had heard quite a few good things about this product as well.  However, I had the same experience as I had the first time.<br /><br />I also cannot get this stuff to mix completely.  No matter what tool or method I use, it seems like there are always at least a few chunks left floating on the top.  I also would like to mention that my mixing problems also were not resolved by using warmer liquid.  I'm not a professional chef or anything - but I'd like to think that I'm fairly good in the kitchen.  I'm able to prepare complicated meals and deserts.  I don't know why I can get this product to completely dissolve in water like most people can.

review/summary: Soy Milk Doesn't Get Much Better
review/text: For this lifelong 60 year old vegan, the "Better Than Milk" original flavor soy milk doesn't get much better.<br /><br />I've used this product for close to 20 years.<br /><br />The "Original" has great flavor and no bean taste like some liquid soy milk.<br /><br />It's snap to use. I add it directly to many recipes dry. Add to dry hot chocolate mix and then just add hot water. Mix it right in your cereal bowl before adding cereal.<br /><br />It does take a little stirring to make smooth. Add more for creamier texture and taste. Very versatile.<br /><br />Cost is about the same as liquid soy milk but no worry about it going bad in frig. Just use it when you need it, it's always fresh.

review/text: I love Soy milk.  Since I already use powdered fat-free milk, I wondered if I could find the same option for Soy Milk.  This product was a very pleasant surprise.  It mixes well and tastes great.  Much better than expected.  Now I can have it on hand when ever I want it. I use it for all my breakfast cereal, both hot and cold. You can mix to taste and make it as strong or light as you like.  I prefer the original flavor over the Vanilla, but that is just my choice.<br /><br />If you are looking for an easy way to have Soy milk anytime you like, this is the product you want.  I do wish they had this in one quart packets the same way dry regular milk is available, but getting 2 cans at a time is fine.

This mix is not easy to find in local grocery stores and Amazon made it a breeze to order and ship.<br /><br />BTW, the hot cocoa mix turned out great; make sure to use a good-quality baking cocoa (like Guittard). We followed Alton Brown's recipe () without the cayenne (for the kids). On a cold, blustery day, no one gets left out on the fun when they get asked, "Who wants hot cocoa?"

review/text: It took a couple days to get used to this, but now I like it a lot more than the expensive liquid soy milk.  With this, you can make as much or as little as you need, and as thick or thin as you like.  When I drank cows milk, I always had skim, and the liquid soy milk from the store seemed too thick and sweet to me.  I can mix this thinner just how I like it. Also if you go out of town for a week, you don't come back to spoiled soy milk and have to run to the store- you have as much as you need ready waiting to mix up.<br />Its cheaper and I like it better than liquid soy milk.  Highly recommend.

I live in a rural bush area of western Alaska and find it extremely difficult to get milk alternitives without forking over $500 for a plane ticket to Anchorage.

review/text: I think that this the product I received multiple times was not organic, meaning it could contain GMOs (genetically modified organics - google has lots of info) and that could be more dangerous to my health than worth. The products I have obtained never claimed 'non-GMO' on the package. Before I learned that difference though, I will tell you that this sure tasted excellent, and the price was likewise excellent.<br />On another note, their rice milk product shouts 'Non-GMO' on the can. Thought it interesting to mention the discrepancy in labeling. Unfortunately I thought it tasted really strange, so onto organic liquid soy milk for me.

review/text: This makes a great vegan substitute for coffee creamer. It has more calories, but it takes less, so it evens out for us. My husband insists on using "half 'n half" in his coffee, but he will use this (although he will not use regular powdered coffee creamer). Compared with "half 'n half," it's not really too much higher in calories, and it's "vegan!" I've also used it, reconstituted, in cooking with very good results. I recommend this product to anyone following a vegan diet.

review/summary: Updated - Tasty enough but weightwatchers be mindful
review/text: After reading some of the reviews, I thought this soy milk might not be taste tolerable; however, I got a nice surprise. It tastes just fine. I think that the judgment of taste differs according to whether one is coming to this from cow's milk or from another soy product. I've been drinking soy, and more recently almond milk (unsweetened) for many years. Also, some complained that this is lumpy. There is totally no lumpiness using plain water and shaking (I used a shaker). I thought I was going to need a blender. In addition, this beverage will be a wonderful solution to having a milk drink while traveling. The nutrients are nearly the same as lowfat milk except for far less protein. I did not check for the vitamin D.<br /><br />On the less positive side if you are counting weightwatcher points, this beverage is 2 points; whereas my regular pre-mixed beverage is 1 point. The sugar content is high 5g; (although to my taste it is not overly sweet as some have complained). This beverage seems to have a very slight aftertaste.<br /><br />In summary, I am very pleased with the overall product; especially the cost savings, and the portability. The only reason I won't be using it daily is due to the sugar content.<br /><br />Updated opinion: I have to agree now that this beverage is too sweet, and the aftertaste is bothersome. So, I am only using it now in emergencies. Probably will not purchase more.

review/summary: FREEDOM!!
review/text: I wasn't too sure at first about this product. It seemed lumpy the first couple times I tried to mix it into coffee.  But I liked the convenience of being able to keep a baggie of powder in my bag - that way, I didn't have to deny myself a coffee when I was away from home.<br /><br />However, a recent vacation in Germany changed my tolerance into true love.<br /><br />As a newly-diagnosed celiac (intolerant of gluten and dairy) I can't tell you how WONDERFUL it felt to be able to enjoy my morning coffee while on vacation. I could stop whenever and whereever I wanted to even indulge in a second cup. We celiacs take the small joys where we can find them, and this product gave me such a feeling of freedom. It's a small thing, being able to have an impromptu coffee, but to me, it was a delight.  (Also, I was shocked at how hard it is to find soymilk in health-concious Germany, and how awful the taste was - I threw it right out)<br /><br />A semi-full snack-size ziploc bag of BTM lasted me for 10 days' worth of coffee. I don't know what my problem was initially, but with a little extra stirring, I didn't have any problem getting the powder to dissolve. It worked best if I tapped the spoon to sprinkle the powder onto the coffee, a thin layer at a time.  It really does have a closer taste to milk than most dairy alternatives and doesn't have a strong flavor - no "beaniness" at all.<br /><br />For cereal, it dissolves beautifully into room-temp water, if you put it in a jar, give it a shake, and let it sit for a minute.<br /><br />I will keep a stash with me from now on!

review/summary: Needs Vitamin D
review/text: I am slightly vitamin D deficient, and my doctor recommended I drink milk to correct that.  I am, however, allergic to all animal milks.  I also don't drive a car, so liquid soy milk, being both large and heavy, can't be gotten in large quantities. I was hoping to solve the problem with this product.  I can't because there's no vitamin D in it.  I e-mailed the company that makes it and asked them to add vitamin D, but all I got was the standard "We'll pass your comments along" message.<br /><br />The product is good as far as taste goes, but nutritionally it's lacking a significant nutrient that most people get from cow milk: vitamin D.  Until the product does include it, I think it's misnamed.

review/summary: W O W !  Tastes INCREDIBLY good, MUCH better than milk!
review/text: I forgot the name of the brand when I first tasted this.  I scooped up a teaspoon of this powder and my first thoughts were, this tastes amazing!  Definitely better than milk!  I was expecting at best a good tasting product but a mediocre after taste or a not so great taste.  Then I mixed it with room temperature water and it mixes well and again incredibly good taste.<br /><br />For those worried about protein content please remember that muscular horses are naturally vegans so according to marketing lies they should look like scrawny thin animals and this is not so, the same goes for us humans.  Plus you can mix it with cereal if you like.<br /><br />My reason for buying this is because I love coffee as a mid morning snack and this is going to be an EXCELLENT substitute for cream (cholesterol) or non-dairy creamers (hydrogenated oils/fats.)<br /><br />Hopefully this product will not be sabotaged by a fake low rating from the competitors or people not noticing this product and it not getting the buying attention it very much deserves.  I've been a vegan for 17 years and I've NEVER seen such an outstanding and great tasting product that is powdered, mixes easily, is vegan, and tastes amazing.  If you love this product like I do (I know you will), pass it on and lets keep the ingredients as healthy as it now is.  The taste is so good I really don't think it could be improved further.<br /><br />Also, at first impulse I was going to buy the vanilla flavor but I read a review here that said this original version mixed better and the vanilla tasted too strong.  Well now that I'e tasted this one I don't care for the vanilla flavor anymore.  I guess you were right reviewer, thanks...

review/text: I purchased the powdered soy milk to use on a backpacking trip.  I normally use regular powdred milk but had a vegan on the trip.<br /><br />The powdered soy milk was great and only takes 2 TBS of powder for 1 Cup of milk.<br /><br />It worked out very well.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: when I ordered this product, I was looking for a healthy non dairy creamer in a powdered form.  I was sadly disappointed.  It seems to just clump, kind of nasty.  the only way to get it to blend in is to put it in a jar with a lid and shake it vigorously, not so appetizing for a creamy hot cup of mate'.  Anyway, experience is the key to knowledge.  I'll not make that mistake again.  $25.00 doesn't sound like much to some people, but it's a good chunk to me.

review/summary: Good for what it does and is!
review/text: This definitely has a better taste profile than the vanilla - we can barely use that because it colors our cooking too much.  It mixes well, hot or cold, but does leave a bit of chalky sediment.  If you don't like that, pour off the top into your storing/pouring container and leave the starch behind.  It tastes good, but younger folk are partial to adding something sweet.  But that is what's great, mix it how you like.  I just wish it had a better protein profile per 8 oz compared to Silk, etc.  I guess you can add soy protein to offset - that's why I dink it a star.  Great compliment to having some for food storage.

review/text: We have used this with our toddler during travel (it is terrorism free).  He is allergic to milk and we suppliment with soy milk.  This product does have a good, light taste and it mixes very easily with cold water or juice.  The problem is that there is NO WAY that the can makes 8 quarts of soy milk, well not any soy milk that anyone wants to drink.  At the 8 quarts concentration I can't imagine anyone using this soy milk for anything.  Now at 4 quarts concentration, its a different story.  If this is your expectation then you will not be disappointed with this product.

review/summary: Instead of coffee creamer for 10 yrs
review/text: I've used the original for 10 years or so. I use it instead of creamer in my tea and coffee and it tastes great and by-passes a lot of health concerns associated with regular creamers. I have also found it a great way to monitor my intake of soy products.<br /><br />The Vanilla reminds me of graham crackers (and seems gritty) and the Chocolate is more carob-y.  The issue of sugar that other reviewers have brought up is interesting. I remember comparing it against milk one time and seeing it was about the same.  I have friends that mix it with milk for "half and half".<br /><br />Since moving, I don't have access to my local supplier, "MOMS - My Organic Market".  I've asked Trader Joe's without any results and our local Giant stopped carrying it.  I've been using the liquids for four months - too costly and I can't store extra incase of bad weather.<br /><br />If I must, I'll order bulk.

review/text: I love this type of milk substitute.  It's one of only 2 tofu milks on the market that I know of & the OTHER one has both casein (a milk derivative) AND trans fat, so there's not even any competition in my opinion.  I like tofu milk better than rice milk, because rice milk is sweet, & I like tofu milk better than soy milk because it's lighter.  I don't like that thick, heavy beany taste of soy milk.  I've also tried potato milk (DariFree) & don't like the taste.  I think I got free super-saver shipping & had this in 2 or 3 days!  This wasn't long before the holidays, either.

review/summary: A Good, Portable Alternative to Artificial Sweetener
review/text: I've seen liquid sweetener before but this was the first time I'd seen a Monk Fruit version of it. If you're leery of artificial sweetener then this may be a good alternative.<br /><br />The container is approximately the same size as a MIO (liquid flavoring for water) container. It measures about 2 3/4 inches high, 2.5 inches at it's widest point and approximately 3/4 of an inch in depth.I can easily fit this in my handbag and that's a huge plus to me because I have type 2 diabetes and the small packets of sweetener that most restaurants provide have maltodextrin in them which is bad for diabetics and as per my endocrinologist, anyone who has a family history of diabetes or is pre-diabetic should avoid that substance.<br /><br />This product comes in a sucralose version, a stevia version and the monk fruit. My favorite is probably the sucralose with the monk fruit being a close second.<br /><br />The downside: At the time of this writing, the price here is more than double what I paid for my container that I got at a brick and mortar store. However, I rarely take away stars for price because I feel that the review is about the product, not the seller/vendor and even if the seller makes the price more attractive, reviewers rarely come back and fix their review and I don't feel that's fair to the product.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good alternative to artificial sweeteners then you might want to give this a try.

We were supposed to toss them but forgot and my husband accidently gave them to the dogs today with the very same reaction. I will contact the manufacturer, but wanted to warn all my dog lover friends to be aware.  It is really strange, as my dogs go through 4 - 5 bags of the mini dingo bones every month (they love them) and we've never had a problem. There must be something different in the Chip Twists.<br /><br />Update... the manufacturer is telling me that this has happened before and is caused by "over baking" the product and they will send me a refund...........

review/text: Despite the poor marks given by the previous reviewer, I ordered this assorted Turkish Delight and was pleased with it.  I had just returned from a long trip to Greece and Turkey and missed all of the excellent food, so I decided to order this brand from Amazon, mainly because it was a whole lot quicker and more convenient than ordering it from one of the absolutely wonderful lokum shops in Istanbul where they've been making it for 150 years or so.  I see that previous reviewer had no idea what lokum was going to be like and had only been interested after seeing "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," so maybe that explains her extreme disappointment.  Turkish Delight is a very unusual candy.<br /><br />Is this as good as the perfect, authentic stuff I got in Istanbul?  Not quite, no.  But it was perfectly good and my office co-workers and friends were not shy about helping me eat up 4 boxes of it.  I will say that of the three flavors, the rose was my least favorite, although still good.  It was just a little strong in flavor - a lot more pungent than the rose pieces I had in Turkey.  The pistachio and lemon were quite tasty.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a good product and well-priced.  If you like Turkish Delight and don't want to wait for an order to come all the way from Istanbul, get some of this.

With all of the McDougall instant meals, I've learned to heat it, cover it and leave it for about a half hour if I want everything to be soft.

review/summary: Good, but nothing like Minestrone as we know it
review/text: I've been a McDougall customer since 2004, and I've tried almost all of the food cups.  They are excellent for those who want a vegan, mostly-organic alternative, and of course one pays extra for the convenience and vegan/organic ingredients.<br /><br />The taste of Minestrone soup is good, but it's nottaste of the Italian minestrone that you get in a restaurant.  It can be eaten as is or poured over pasta, rice, a baked potato, etc.

review/summary: Filling and tasty
review/text: It's so very hard to find real non-meat products so was taking a chance with ordering the 6-pack specially since I had never tried this brand before.<br /><br />The soup is very tasty and perfect for on-the-go meals. To be on the safe side, I would let it sit for about 20 min after adding hot water.<br /><br />I had some problems with the spice powder getting stuck in clumps inside the pasta shells, but if you mix it very vigorously after you open it, they dissolve.<br /><br />I did not try the microwave option

review/summary: Very Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: I wasn't expecting much of an instant minestrone soup, but it was half price at the supermarket and I've liked all the other McDougall's soups I've tried, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />It's great! No instant flavor at all. You'd be hard pressed to know it was instant if you weren't eating it out of a paper cup. Even if you're not a vegan or vegetarian, don't be scared off by the vegan and healthy-food claims. This doesn't taste like "health food", it tastes like real food. One word of warning: give it a few minutes more than the 8 minute wait recommended on the package. Otherwise, some of the ingredients won't be completely rehydrated. It's definitely worth the wait.<br /><br />This goes on my list of regular McDougall's orders.

After ordering it from Amazon by the case for several months, I started figuring up how much it was costing me to feed two cats. Wow, I am now back to Science Diet at half the cost and using the larger 6 oz cans which is about half the cost of the Royal Canin. I don't know why I can't purchase the extra light in the larger cans which would make it more of a better deal, perhaps!

review/text: This tuna is a solid piece packed in olive oil.  It is rich and mellow in flavor; would be great in a salade nicoise, and it's wonderful straight out of the can. Ingredients listed are tuna, olive oil, and salt.  The label indicates 1.5 servings per can at 160 calories, 11g fat, 370mg sodium,  14g protein and 0 carbs, fiber, and sugar per serving.  It's a simple matter to drain the oil away since it's a solid piece of tuna.  It's a product of Portugal, distributed by Italy.  This is the best mail-order price I've found anywhere; you can easily pay double for it from other purveyors.  Very highly recommended.

review/text: This canned tuna is wonderful. I haven't bought canned tuna packed in oil of any kind in years. I was recently in Molinari's Deli in S.F. and the owner tossed me a can of this stuff and said I'd like it. He was wrong, I love it. It's rich and smooth and not "tinny" at all. If drained well, there is very little olive oil on the tuna, and what there is, is high quality. It's splendid on Salad Nicoise or just plain with a little lemon juice, salt, and fresh ground pepper. I've given it as gifts, and it has been recieved very well.

review/text: My dogs are incredibly healthy with this food. The first time I purchased Innova, I set a bowl of it next to the IAMS they had been eating since birth (they were 2 and 4 years old at the time).  They refused to eat the IAMS.  They were overweight and have slimmed down to a healthy weight on the Reduced Fat food and I don't have to worry about their nutrition at all. Innova has everything they need. They have lots of energy, bright eyes and healthy, shiny coats.  The cost seems to be initially higher but they eat less so it is not that much more than other premium foods. I will never feed them anything else.

review/text: Let me say that I don't like hot tea as a rule. Most of it tastes like hot water to me. I love coffee and a good strong beer. I also love this tea. It tastes of clove and orange and a dash of cinnamon. The tea is top quality and the price is right. I have paid a bunch more for tea that I couldn't taste. It is like a Holiday tea that you can have all year. It is widely available and priced to enjoy on a daily basis. It has become a nightly habit for me. Put a little Stevia in it and you have a little treat with no guilt or problems. This is the first hot tea that I have purchased consistently that my wife dosen't even like! Hey, men! If you think all hot tea is for girls and little old ladies, give this one a go. It won't blow your head off, but I think you will like it. Hey, ladies, keep that Christmas spirit all the year with this inexpensive tea. And, I love the fact that it is made right here in the good ole USA! What could be more American than something good, practical, affordable, and just plain nice? Love it!!

review/text: I've haven't purchased Constant Comment for years because I got on a green tea kick.  However, when my spouse decided to switch from drinking soda to iced tea (and then complained about my green tea selection), I remembered how much I had enjoyed Constant Comment.<br /><br />Constant Comment was my mother's favorite tea, and is a black tea blend with a hint of orange & spice.  Drinking it hot & iced brings back old childhood memories, and tastes just like I remembered.  It has a good, robust flavor that isn't harsh.<br /><br />Constant Comment makes a great iced tea because the strength of the black tea & the spice will hold up to the watering down from the ice.  Enjoy!

Packets are foil sealed and each cup consistently comes out with a nice cinnamon orange flavor.  It not only cuts the cold Colorado wind on a snowy day, it also tastes equally good iced in the summer time.  I don't know many people who haven't tried it.  It is just so mellow and soothing.  This is the only tea my teen daughter likes to drink when she is sick.  I think the cinnamon has a calming effect on her tummy.  It's not too spicy like some cinnamon teas.  Very nice blend of citrus and spice.

They come in fun shapes; I consider the packaging to be more eco-friendly than that of the aforementioned fruit strips; the Fruit Bites come in pouches, which means I'll be allowed to send them to school with my son as birthday treats, if he wants.  Plus, my son LOVES them and currently wishes he could have them in his lunch box every day.  He's only tried apple so far, but is excited about trying the other flavors.  Again, thank you, Annie's!

I highly recommend this for anyone who is watching their sodium or has to eat a low sodium diet.

It did lend a nice background note of that distinctly roasted nori taste that I love with making maki.

review/summary: Just like the old country
review/text: My mother said to me that she really missed the nights when she would sit at night with my father (when he was alive) in Puerto Rico and drink this Lemon Grass Tea.  She stated that could not find it anywhere.  I of course went straight to my old and reliable friend, Amazon.  I ordered her a box to make sure that it was the same one she remembered.  It arrived promptly and it totally surprised her.  That night she made herself a cup and called me half crying that it was not only the exact same tea but that she was reminiscing about my father.  She thank me and I thank Amazon.  I will be ordering some more for her...........

review/summary: Not recommended
review/text: The fudge melts easily, too easily, but unfortunately that doesn't equate to good tasting chocolate fudge, if that's even a proper description of the mild flavored chocolate outer coating. The graham cracker cookie has a very weak graham cracker flavor. The cookie is made of crumbs and isn't very crunchy. Freezing them doesn't help much either. Lots of sugar (9g per 3 cookies) and lots of fat (7g, or 1/2 tablespoon per 3 cookies). I ate them, they are still cookies :), but I won't buy them again.

review/summary: Not what I thought they'd be
review/text: I really made a mistake ordering these, but in my defense, I didn't notice anything in the description to give me a clue that these are really chocolate covered cookies, not regular graham crackers.  But I thought, well, at least maybe I'll get some antioxidant value from the chocolate; but no, come to find out it uses "Dutch" alkali processed chocolate, so no redeeming value there.  They actually don't even taste as good as regular graham crackers.  I guess I'll have to stow them away until the next food drive.  I'm sure if someone is hungry enough, they'll probably get eaten.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Not a very good flavor, and what it has is weak.  It reminds me of coffee from a vending machine.  Not very well balanced and lacking depth.  It was surprising because the beans smelled so good upon opening the bag.  Weavers is a much better medium roast decaf.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041QESW0">Weaver's Coffee and Tea Decaf House Blend, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: Perpetually Delicious - Tazo Makes The Best!
review/text: For me, when the days get colder nothing is as rewarding as a simple cup of hot tea. And for it's claimed immunity benefits, a basic green tea is a common pick for maintaining a healthy natural balance during the flu season. From previous experiences in tasting the Tazo brand, both of the bottled and boxed products, they have proven to be unsurpassed for quality and flavor. Once I've tried their teas they immediately became my drink of choice. <p>The Zen Green Tea Blend is a wonderful one that has only a few ingredients with no artificial anything. And thankfully, doesn't boast the addition of fortified vitamins in some senseless amount. It truly is an enlightening blend of green tea, spearmint, lemongrass and lemon verbena. Thus making it versatile refreshment for anytime of the day, whether it's right after meals or between meals, or just before bedtime. Generally light and mild tasting, but that will depend upon how long you steep it and if you add a sweetener of some form.<p>Interesting too, are the amusing comments and remarks that appear on the packaging. Reading through this as you drink your tea makes it a distinctive experience. I never seen tea so clever! I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person's outlook on life and affect his or her well being? I think it just could be the great taste and aroma and probably the reassuring thought of doing your health a favor.<br />Try a couple of their teas - they are sure to please!<br />And Tazo Zen Green Tea makes a good choice.

review/summary: Hardly notice the lemongrass - taste great
review/text: I was a little afraid to get this because of it having Lemongrass, Lemongrass as such a bad taste but I gave it a try and I really enjoy this tea.  As the other reviews gave 5 stars I too give it my highest rating.  I have mine with a little bit of honey in it and it is SOOO GOOD!  So try it plain and try it with honey either way you are sure to be surprised at the great taste.
