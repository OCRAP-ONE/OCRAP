review/text: I saw that 1 star rating and thought "there's no way the folks at Buffalo Bills could produce a beef stick rated one out of five." I bought them because of that one star and I was right, its a 5 star snack just like everything else they sell. It is much better than any common Slim Jim or Jack Links beef stick.

review/summary: Here's  the beef!
review/text: You won't be saying "Where's the beef?" when you taste these yummy Honey Stung Ole' Smokies beef sticks. When you check the package, the first ingredient listed is beef - a welcome and necessary ingredient in a good beef stick. The honey adds a subtle sweetness to the meat. My coworkers get excited when I bring in Ole' Smokies to share with everyone. No matter how often I order them, they always seem to disappear quickly.

review/summary: Really great tasting soda and with no HF corn syrup
review/text: Jones makes some great sodas. I had stopped drinking soda for several years, but trying a Jones grape soda got me drinking it again (only theirs). The strwaberry lime makes me feel like a kid. It's very sweet and reminds me of the old "Fun Dips" in the candy store. The root beer is great too.<br /><br />To the "non-kosher" soda seeker: maybe they told you no because you were effectively asking them to change the way they MAKE the soda. Whether it is certfied or not, their soda IS non-kosher, so you're asking them to change their production to make one case for one weirdo in the entire North American continent. Go figure that they said no. You can't really just ask them to put pig blood in one case to make it non-kosher, now can you? But I invite you to do it yourself at home. If they even actually have it certified as non-kosher as you claim, I am sure it is such a low cost that it wouldn't even amount to a penny per case. You should find some real things to worry about.<br /><br />I happen to appreciate food labelling since I am allergic to dairy and have a family member allergic to gluten. You should respect other people's health and religious concerns, but more so stop acting like a whiner.

review/summary: Great soda
review/text: Pretty much all the Jones sodas are great, but the strawberry lime are my favorite. A nearly unique flavor as far as I've found, and just a great taste. I've also found that the glass bottled soda tastes better than the cans (which are much easier to find) but that could just be purely psychosomatic.<br /><br />Also, since it bears saying: if it bothers you that a rabbi was vaguely involved in the making of this soda (and that the makers of the soda would not prepare a special jew-free batch for you), you should really keep that to yourself. As a heads up, there were probably women, black people and - quite possibly - gay people who contributed in some way too, so if any of those are problems for you, please stay in your hole for the foreseeable future rather than leaving reviews. I would also note that since these cost about $1.25-$2.00/bottle if you buy them at a store, at the current price this 24 pack this is listed for the "rabbi overhead" is not a large factor in the price here.

review/summary: not available in non-kosher
review/text: If you are looking for a refreshing non-kosher soda pop, look elsewhere. Jones soda only comes in kosher, which means that the consumer is paying slightly extra to cover the rabbinical fees involved in the certification procedure.<br /><br />Most consumers do not want kosher certified products, and do not even realize when they are purchasing kosher certified products.<br />Jones soda should sell a non-kosher version of this product, for a reduced fee, for people who are not Jewish.<br /><br />I emailed Jones soda asking if it's possible to place a special order for a case of non-kosher Jones soda.<br />They replied with a smart-alec one word answer, "No".<br />This was a smart-alec response to my email because I asked one or two other questions in the email which were not "yes" or "no" questions.<br />For example, I also asked how much Jones soda spends per year for the kosher certification, and how much of this fee is passed on to the consumer.<br /><br />In other words, based on my experience, I'd say that if you email Jones soda with questions about the kosher certification issue, expect a smart-alec response.

review/text: I purchased this coffee collection for my husband's birthday. So far, we've made 4 of the flavors and have concluded that they all seem to taste almost the same. They have a coconut flavor that seems to be predominant, except for one of the "chocolate" coffees, which wasn't very good at all. I went to Walmart last week and noticed they had individual packaged flavored coffees for about the same price but for more oz of coffee. We bought one of their chocolate flavors just to try. MUCH better than Arbuckle's chocolate. We will continue trying the different flavors left in the Arbuckle's Pastry Shoppe until they are gone, but won't be buying it again.

review/summary: Baking
review/text: I used this item for the first time when I adapted a brownie recipe.  I used unsweetened Baker's chocolate and approx 1/3 cup of this sweetener.  I did adapt the recipe for the loss of the "lift" provided by granulated sugar and the brownies turned out great.  Pretty dense, more fudgy than cake-like, but  certainly full of rich, dark chocolate flavor.  I think next time I would use a bit more of the sweetener, perhaps 1/2 cup...which is not alot since a traditional brownie recipe calls for 2 cups of granulated sugar.  Also, as a Hypoglycemic, I did not suffer from the usual afteraffects of eating a traditional brownie.  Therefore, I will certainly order more of this sweetener.

The Blue Agave was posted at a lower price in the store and I wanted to give it try.<br /><br />After trying it, I found that I was still tasting and smelling agave the day after I used it and the following 24 hours as my body excreted the agave much like garlic is excreted. It was the strangest sensation to smell and taste it so strongly the day after using it. I can only guess they process it similar to alcohol which is also excreted from the human body. Beware of this side effect if you use it as a syrup alternative.

It is truly the difference between a good product and an outstanding one. I ran out of Valrhona in the middle of making cupcakes for a wedding shower and rushed back to the gourmet shop for some more, they were out of it and sold me a "comparable Dutch processed" cocoa. It was NOT even close to being a good substitute for the Valrhona.  I will not run out of it again.  If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and get some!

I don't recommend buying so much if you don't have a cool, dry place to store it, which we do.<br />We also go through it surprisingly fast despite the fact our main use is just a sprinkling on our espressos. I have made brownies and hot chocolate with it and the results were to-die-for.

review/text: As a comparison, I have tried Hershey's Premium, Pernogetti, and Valrhona cocoa.<br /><br />This used to be the only cocoa I knew of, and in comparison has a foul smell that makes one recoil.<br />The Pernogetti is very nice, with fruity undertones.<br />A great recipe can overcome mediocre ingredients, but this cocoa makes the best recipes World-class.

review/text: I like a good PB&J sandwich as much as the next guy, but I hate all the effort that goes into making them.  I have to open a jar of Peanut butter, undo that little tie on the bag holding the bread, and then spread the peanut butter on the bread- MANUALLY!  I always get the kind of peanut butter which already has jelly mixed in, but it's still just WAY too much effort.  Now with Gaem Grub I can just open ONE container and I'm ready to eat!  The best part is that the container itself is non-toxic, so I don't even HAVE to open it!  I can just gnaw right through it and suck out the grub without even having to take one of my hands off the XBox controller!

But with a little practice you can pour it down your throat good, without taking much time away from your gaming or getting your controller greasy.  Taste is very good, lots of peanuts and stuff too, a little like trail mix, but tastes much better.  It's doesn't taste that unhealthy.

review/summary: Very Spicy Orange Spice tea
review/text: I bought this tea because I had previously tried an orange spice tea I got in a supermarket.  I thought the loose tea would be a higher quality tea.  I'm no expert but this tea is definitely a higher quality than the flavored teas I have gotten from supermarket tea bags.  It smells wonderful and makes very good hot or iced tea.  I was a little surprised at the strength of the spice flavor.  This is why I only rated it 3 stars.  I was expecting more orange and less spice.  I am enjoying it but next time I may try a different orange spice loose tea to find one with a milder spice flavor.  I may even experiment with mixing it with a milder tea.  If you are looking for a tea with a strong cinnamon, peppery spice flavor, this tea is for you.

review/text: I only drink loose leaf teas, and I was pleased with the quantity of this product. Problem is that I really don't love the taste, and I am drinking it every morning because there is so much of it! It is a strong tea that needs to be infused briefly (in my opinion). If you prefer a slightly bitter flavor, you will like this tea. My tastes gravitate to black teas with light flavoring such as mango, peach, etc. or green teas. Again, my palate doesn't welcome oolongs or rooibos either, so I may be too much of a light-weight to make an accurate evaluation of this tea. It's strong and it's plentiful. I haven't tossed it, but I sure am bored with it.

review/summary: Tastes like quality regular pasta, but more fiber and less "sleepiness" after
review/text: I've been using Dreamfields pasta for about a year and a half now. It's become a kitchen staple for us. I bought it to help keep my sugar under control while still enjoying pasta dishes. My husband, a very finicky eater, didn't even notice it was high-fiber (well, until he got a bit gassy later). Tastewise, this is just as good as regular, quality pasta. (And not gritty like whole wheat ones can be.)<br /><br />A very nice product, and a boon to those watching their sugar numbers. I'll add that I don't get the super-sleepiness after eating this pasta that I used to eating regular pasta (you know, that post-carb napping syndrome).<br /><br />I've used the penne, the linguine, the elbow (for mac'n'cheese) and the lasagna (for veggie and regular lasagne casseroles). Great. All of them.<br /><br />Thumbs up flavorwise.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it seems pricey for pasta, but buying in bulk with no shipping fees helps until my local stores carry it.

In my opinon, it is best prepared al dente ( but, I would say that of all boxed pasta ). Of the Dreamfield pastas, the linguine is probably my favorite and is what I eat the most of. It only takes a couple minutes longer to cook than the spaghetti, but I prefer the thickness. Taste wise all the Dreamfield pastas are excellent.<br /><br />This is a must if you want or requir a low-glucemic or low-carb pasta.

review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

Because it's manufactured differently and has more fiber, it's a pasta a diabetic can have guilt free.  My whole family loves it and I couldn't say that about the many wheat and wheatblend pastas on the market today.  I am now buying this by the case at Amazon.  Price is comparible to our grocery store at $2.49 a pkg.  It's about 2.60 for Amazon, but it's delivered free so it makes up for the price difference.  I love every shape they make so far.

The tree did not come and when I called to ask for a refund (after two weeks of calling someone picked up the day before Christmas) they said they would but then they did not refund me the full amount. They were apologetic but trying to get in touch with them and was a NIGHTMARE and i had no gift for my husband on Christmas. VERY UNRELIABLE

review/summary: Cheap container, not as claimed
review/text: I am very disappointed about the product, I received a juniper tree newly planted into a CHEAP clay/ceramic pot; it had a crack when received and it is DEFINITELY not a Japanese pot as claimed!  My wife, who purchased this tree for me, should have read the reviews carefully before purchase.  When I read them, I found it weird that NONE of the good reviews (except for the negative comment) referred to [ASIN:B000M646KM LOU'S BONSAI NURSERY JUNIPER BONSAI TREE IN JAPANESE POT], they all were praising LOUS for different items and reasons????

review/summary: So pleased
review/text: I was so worried about what to use for table decoration at a very special dinner,  when I found Juniper Bonsai's on your site.  Having no idea how to care for bonsai's and emailed the store first. I not only received a speedy answer but a phone call as well.  I ordered 10 trees, they arrived well packed for travel and are beautiful. There was a note to call and tell them how my trees arrived, what great customer service.  I would recommend this company for their wonderful products and fantastic customer support. My Guests loved their centerpieces and competition for them was fierce.  I will be ordering more for the holidays!

review/text: I received my Juniper Bonsai Tree starting with the great care in packaging. My tree arrived in perfect condition although was not planted in the pot they described, but a ceramic one. Also it did not come with fertilizer pellets. It did however come with a personal touch, directions on the care of the tree, and a phone # to call as soon as I got my package, and he told me to call if any problems. The tree also came with a guarantee to replace it should there ever be issues with it. Lou was very helpful when I called, and gave me great advice.<br />  Thanks for a great purchase!

review/text: Before purchasing anything from Lous bonsai, check out the reviews on the Internet, not the ones he writes but the legitimate ones. They're horrible. He promises one thing and delivers another, then offers to replace it, either never does or, as he did in our case, sends one as bad as the first. Terrible merchant. I wouldn't buy dog food from this guy.

review/summary: The First Thing to Notice ...
review/text: ... is the incredible price discrepancy for allspice on amazon, from this offering of a whole pound for $5.95 (plus $7.50 shipping) to a typical 1.5 ounce jar for $15.96! That discrepancy exists in the real-world markets of most cities also; allspice from an Indian or Caribbean specialty store will cost a fraction of what you'd pay in a 'gringo' supermarket. There may be some subtle grades of quality in allspice berries, and certainly freshness has to be considered, but freshness can hardly be guaranteed when you're shopping on-line, no more for the expensive than for the cheap product.<br /><br />Allspice powder loses its potency very quickly. A 1.5 ounce jar of the powder would be suitable only for those who know they'll use it up in a couple of weeks max. Obviously a whole pound of allspice berries is orders of magnitude for many home chefs also. Know thyself! At this price, it's worth cultivating a taste for the stuff!<br /><br />Allspice is the berry of a shrub, Pimenta dioica, a kind of myrtle. The berries look a lot like peppercorns but have a very different flavor. The shrub seems to have originated in the Caribbean, and accordingly allspice is a major ingredient in the spice melange of Caribbean cookery, especially Jamaican, included in virtually all barbeque sauces. It's also used generously in some "Middle Eastern" cuisines. Oddly, it's become a dessert spice in parts of Europe, an ingredient in "pumpkin pie" spice-mixes. In Sweden, allspice is associated with pork and veal; it's an essential spice in Swedish meatballs. Commercial sausage-makers in Scandinavia and Germany normally use lots of allspice in their higher-quality sausages.<br /><br />You can pound the berries easily enough in a mortar, but the simplest thing is to have a plain 'dedicated' pepper-grinder filled with allspice berries near your stove. One grinder for black pepper, one for cardamom, and one for allspice. Good to go!

review/summary: Fava Beans. Hmmmm.
review/text: Nearby I have a Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and I enjoy shopping there because they have some very unusual foods imported from all over the world, especially England. So, anyway, I was looking over the selections in the international isle and making a few guesses on what certain things might be like. One was Ziyad Premium Foule Mudammas Small Fava Beans in a 15.5-ounce can. Now what might these be, I wondered? I had no idea, but I've always liked beans and the picture on the front of the cans looked good. Into the shopping cart a can went.<br /><br />Fava beans. Hmmmm. I guess it's some type of mediterranean thing. So, I heated up a half can to go with some Buffalo Wings chicken I was having. Well, a quarter of the contents in the can was liquid, not beans. And I didn't care for the taste of the liquid. The beans were somewhat stiff and chewy, The closest thing I might compare them to would be chick peas, but they were darker, perhaps stained so by the liquid. Did they taste good? No, not particularly. Was I glad I had tried them? Well, at least now I know what they are. It was educational. Maybe I could somehow hide them as ingredients in a stew. Would I buy them again? Not likely.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Awesome for cats with stomatitis
review/text: One of my two cats has stomatitis, which basically means her gums are chronically inflamed. This makes it hard for her to eat mushy cat foods (pate' style), because they get stuck to her teeth and end up irritating her gums more. This food is not pate'-style, it's little shreds of chicken with chunks of stuff that I guess are supposed to be scrambled eggs?  This looks exactly like 'Puka Puka Luau,' but with added egg pieces, and ~20 calories less per can (according to the nutrition info that Petropics sent me). Also, high in protein, low in carbs, and made by a company that prides itself on making "people-grade" cat foods! Sure, it's expensive, but if you can find a good deal somewhere online (sometimes Amazon has it on sale for a few days at a time, as do other home-delivery sites), it might not be so bad?

review/summary: My Cats Have Their Snooty Days
review/text: I have 5 cats. Four of them are indoors with me and one is a feral child who lives outside. He is SOOO feral that he still hisses at me when I put his food out and this is 8 years later.<br /><br />But, the hight point of my Kitty's Day is "wet food feeding time" at 5:00 PM each day. At about 4:30, the wee beasties start to gravitate to the room where I happen to be and sit expectantly. One kitty, Gabriella, always sleeps in the bottom of the linen closet, so I always laugh as I hear the linen closet door "thap" shut because I know Gabby is on her way to supper. At 5:00, we go to the feeding area and the fun begins. They are given six small cans of food in various varieties for din din. Tiki Cat, Pro Plan and Fancy Feast head the list; however, with an eye toward conservatism, they also get a can of Friskies in the mix.<br /><br />Sometimes, they just have SNOOTY DAYS. I will give them a mix of their usual fare and, for some reason, no one is happy and no one eats much. (We all KNOW the REAL answer to this: they are not REALLY hungry. Some days I get home very late, or leave them for a couple of days with dry food. Believe me, they EAT any and all wet food when I return home, when those situations occur!) Be that as it may, wet food is the best part of their day, so I try. I had seen TIKI CAT on Amazon multiple times, but my cats are not big Fish eaters, so it didn't seem worth it because it seemed that Fish was what Tiki used. Then some variety of Tiki Cat with chicken became available for a "gold price," and I decided to try it. They really liked it, so I had to see if there was more "not fish."<br /><br />While looking, I found the CHICKEN WITH EGG and decided to get it to offer up as a delicacy on Snooty days. Most of the time I do not have to wheedle, but occasionally I do and that is what THIS is for. It is a bit pricey, but when the kids are having an off day, I give them this in their rotation of foods and it is always eaten in its entirety.<br /><br />So, my guys say that your guys should be given a chance at this. If you want to serve it as a regular, I am certain your kitties will be pleased. If you save it for special occasions, I think they will be overjoyed. So, my guys say "We LOVE it" and ask nicely that you buy it for your kittys. Thank you say:<br />Gariella, Trinity, Wisdom and Mercy, plus "Yellow kitty" the feral cat...who grumps that he is gets it only OCCASIONALLY! I hope it does as well in your family as it has in mine!

There's something special here. Come on, fess up." I thought this sausage allowed for such, especially in some French provencial dishes.

review/summary: Stale flavored chorizo.
review/text: I was expecting to be a lot of flavor from this Spanish chorizo. It is too bland to compliment my dish. Perhaps because it is too dry and appears stale. Not worth your dollar.

review/summary: Outstanding Coffee
review/text: This is one of the finest coffees that I have tried.  It has a distinctly European taste...lighter than many of the North American coffees which are more and more frequently (over)roasted to the "Pacific Northwest" standard.  I have purchased both the beans and the ground coffee.  I prefer the ground version, because the manufacturer's grind is absolutely perfect (for my Cuisinart machine, at least).  The whole beans are great, but the results were not as pleasing (still fantastic though - but use a good burr grinder and make sure you grind it fine enough).  When using the pre-ground beans, you can use almost half the amount you may be used to when brewing "Charbucks."

review/summary: Sweet Heat
review/text: Caramel popcorn is caramel popcorn BUT chipotle caramel is a whole new and exciting flavor. I love the combination of the sweet and heat! Caramel with a zing... what a perfect relationship! The added roasted almonds offer an additional layer of texture, crunch and flavor.

review/summary: OMG, this is a heavenly snack.
review/text: Just tried this and it's my new favorite indulgence. The smoky chipotle flavor gives a rich subtle heat, the caramel is just the right sweetness (not sickenly sweet like other brands), and the crisp fresh crunch of the almonds all together make this snack a gourmet experience.  Totally no guilt with the little calories per package too. 479 takes snacking to a new level!
