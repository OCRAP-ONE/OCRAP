review/text: I love the texture of this more than the Quaker brand.  I cooked it and then in the last few minutes added cinnamon, chopped pecans, raisins and chopped dried apricots, and honey.  It was so yummy.  I made more than I could eat (this stuff is filling!) and so I brought it into work the next day...  same texture and flavor.  It kept very well over night.

review/summary: Happy I found this here on Amazon
review/text: My co-worker turned me onto Steel Cut Oatmeal and then I introduced it to my family.  Although I can find it in my local grocery store, it is at least twice the price.  My most recent order here on Amazon I paid an average of $2.14 a box using Subscribe and Save and an additional discount that was being offered.  Can't beat that deal and it keeps my cupboards stocked.<br /><br />For those that don't know what steel cut oatmeal is, I suggest trying it locally before buying in bulk. It is not your "usual" oatmeal. It is thicker, chewy and much more filing. A little definitely goes a long way! Additionally there are some wonderful overnight cooking recipes out there worth trying too.

review/summary: Great Tea, Amazing Value
review/text: This has to be one of the best bargains on green tea ever.  No, it's not a high-end gourmet tea - but it's not intended to be.  What it IS, is a terrific everyday green tea.  Mellow, slightly earthy, and very pleasant on the palate.  Second brewing yields a good cup, as well.  As with every Davidson' tea I've ordered, the quality of the leaves was wonderful, with very little dust, or stems.  It's obvious that they care about their product, and it shows. The origin is not stated, but who cares?  The tea is just fine.<br /><br />EDIT: I recently received my third order of this tea, and this batch was, quite simply, awful. The bag was mis-labeled, and is not green tea.  As we immediately store tea in sealed containers when it arrives, I do not have the original packaging, and can't return it (thank heavens it was inexpensive).  I have had great luck with Davidson's in the past, and assume that this was a fluke mistake, but, BE CAREFUL TO CHECK THE CONTENTS!

review/summary: This isn't gunpowder green tea
review/text: I like tea, in fact I like it a lot. I've had some good gunpowder green tea in the past from adagio as well as Twinnings and it is a beautiful thing. You put what look like little BBs of green tea into your cup or teapot, add the water, and you can see the tea practically explode into nearly full size leaves of tea (hence the name).<br /><br />Davidson's tea disappoints. The tea leaves really don't expand much which tells me they weren't really rolled the way gunpowder green tea is supposed to be. This tea also lacks flavor (at least compared to the other gunpowder green teas I've tried). I used the same amount to brew the same cup of tea I've been enjoying with Twinnigs and frankly the Davidson's version tasted more like hot water than green tea. This may be because the leaves aren't as compacted as a proper gunpowder green tea so the same tablespoon of tea now has less actual mass of tea leaves, it could be because this tea has a lower quality tea leaf in it, heck it could be because this is an old batch of tea for all I know.<br /><br />The point of this review is to say that this tea was a complete waste of money. I am sorry to say I paid for an entire pound of it. I will try it once or twice more, but if the results remain the same I will likely have to throw out the rest of the bag and that would just make me sad because it would mean that I've wasted both money and tea.<br /><br />I have added a photo of the actual tea I received (compare it to that in the original product photos and you'll see a huge difference). Mine is the one that does not look like it is magically hanging in the air and defying gravity.<br /><br />TL;DR version: Don't buy this tea. It isn't really gunpowder green tea and is not worth your money.

review/summary: It's Okay Gunpowder Green...
review/text: Perhaps I received a "bad" batch, because I found this tea to have a significant amount of dirt and debris.  I found sand-like grit, black and slightly metallic-looking  flecks (not in anyway related to the tea) and so far, one piece of some sort of fuzz-like fiber and some other cork-like debris.  I did not expect this.  As for the taste, it's okay; not our favorite gunpowder green, but for the price, the taste was acceptable.  Although, we felt it's a little too smokey, bitter and not enough "grassy".  I think this would be a good tea mixed with other things, such as mint.  A little of this goes a long way.  I'm not sure if I'd order this brand again, perhaps one more try sometime in the future.  Hope this helps!

review/summary: Excellent deal; very good tea
review/text: I'm not a connoisseur of fine teas.  But, I do enjoy my tea, and gunpowder green has been a favorite of mine.  A big problem, though, is trying to find it.  There is a tea store near by that is very expensive.  If you buy 2 oz or more, it's $4.00 an oz.  Too expensive.  I finally found a couple of health food stores where it ranges in price from about 70 to 85 cents an oz, but it is such a hassle to drive there; and too many times they're out.  I've found it on-line, but the shipping costs haven't made it such a good deal.<br /><br />Well, with the "subscription" purchase, this is a great deal.  It's cheaper than anywhere I've found it, at $10.20 a pound or less than 64 cents an oz.  And I love that 48 hrs after placing the order, the post office delivered it to my house.<br /><br />So, the big test, then, is how is the tea?  Well, like I said, I'm not a connoisseur, but I do enjoy Davidson's Gunpowder Green.  It's as good as any that I've bought.  Since the stores where I have been buying it are anywhere from 10 to 25 miles away, and not even near anywhere I normally go, I can say that I have found my new source for tea.  I would recommend it if you're looking for a great deal on a very good tea.

Yes, it is very smoky and somewhat oily; a very powerful tea.

The first pound was pretty good, and was what one expects from "gunpowder" tea... each leaf was tightly rolled into a ball as it is suppose to be. The second pound that I received does not look like gunpowder tea at all. Simply hard little blobs of nearly flavorless tea. NOT the same quality as the first pound. This all sounds like tea-snobbery, I know. But when buying loose tea, one should be able to expect consistency. I am going to cancel my subscription.

review/summary: Not a good gunpowder green.  Buy the Green Boxed Gunpowder Instead!
review/text: So I had just finished my third 1KG box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X65FC">China Green Tea Special Gunpowder 1 Kilo (1000grams or 35.27 Oz) Guaranteed Authenticity</a> in the last year and decided to see if this Davidson's was any better.  To my dismay, it's not, but it sure costs a lot more!  After four brews with the Davidson's, I'm very dissatisfied.<br /><br />First off, the color of the gunpowder pellets are no different between samples, but the Davidson's uses bigger pellets, meaning bigger, older fan leaves.  The Temple of Heaven (ToH) gunpowder green uses smaller leaves, so when you brew there appear to be many more leaves because there are.  The Davidson's often has several leaves and their attached stem rolled up into a single pellet.  The Davidson's also has significantly more dirt, dust, and loose stems in the package.  In fact, it looks like I got the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />****  Your Quality Control Is Terrible, Davidson!  ****<br /><br />The idea that it is organic should have some impact on the flavor, but the Davidson's is more bitter, and the tea is orange/yellow after 3 minutes of brewing in RO filtered water heated to 170-180F in a French press.  The ToH tea is a greenish yellow, and has a better flavor with less bitterness.<br /><br />Overall, I am very unhappy with my Davidson's purchase.  The ToH gunpowder green is better quality for less than half the price!!!<br /><br />When compared to the other gunpowder green tea options available, Davidson's Gunpowder Green Tea is a 2 star gunpowder green tea for flavor that loses a star for poor pricing and very poor quality control.

review/summary: Ruins the reputation of gunpowder teas
review/text: I'm a student who regularly drinks tea my father brings back from China. Gunpowder (tie guan yin) tea has been one of my favorites, particularly for its light, aromatic flavor.<br /><br />I bought a bag of Davidson's after finishing the gunpowder tea from China, impressed by its low price - as comparatively, it does indeed have a great price.<br /><br />While the signature brisk top note of the tea is detectable, it is quickly washed out by a tannic, bitter aftertaste that some reviewers called "earthy." In my palate's opinion, that "earthiness" is NOT a mark of quality. And though it's of equal degree, the bitterness of this tea does not contain the nuanced richness of dark-roast coffee that makes the latter pleasurable.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea only if you are buying primarily for price - me, I just want something caffeinated that's not coffee - or if you enjoy the dull bitterness of 7/11 coffee.

review/text: I was hoping that it would taste at least as good as the lowest cost brand in the super market. I was disappointed. It has a earthy (dirt) after taste. The only way I could drink it is to use very little.

review/summary: Okay tea
review/text: I bought this tea, thinking it was a great value, but I discovered it's weaker than more expensive teas. I have to use more tea to get the taste of more expensive teas. Therefore, it's not as cheap as I thought and costs close to the same as expensive teas because I have to use more tea to make a pot. It's an okay tea, but not the deal I was hoping for.

review/summary: Genuine finely chopped green over dehydrated tea this time around.
review/text: My first batch of Davidson Gunpowder green tea looked like the original images posted in this listing.  They were rolled tea leaves, but not as tightly as competitors.  Put them in water and the leaves would unfurl and reveal nice complete long leaves.  The taste was good.  For the price I thought it was great.  However the green tea I received around a month ago arrived and they didn't bother trying to roll the tea leaves at all, they simply diced up the leaves into small pieces and completely removed all moisture from the leaves to the point that they are so dry you can rub them easily between your fingers and the leaves crumble to a fine dust. There is nothing gun powder about this tea at all anymore.  Davidson needs to get this under control.  It wasn't worth the hassle of sending back so I am stuck with a pound of this barely palatable tea.  I've purchased lots of Davidson teas over the last year and had been extremely happy with all of them with the exception of this latest batch of Gunpowder green tea.  They should either bring back the Gunpowder that we expect and paid for or simply stop selling this inferior stuff that barely passes for tea.

review/summary: just good cheap green tea
review/text: I love this tea, at $11 a pound delivered, it's a bargain. I can afford to make it good and strong, and usually do 3 brewings from a single pot (custom I learned in West Africa) I also take a cue from my Peace Corps stay in Senegal, where they add mint to the pot (tho I avoid the traditional sugar) As far as I can tell this "gunpowder" green is the same stuff they used in Africa. so the nostalgia factor is a big part of the experience, especially late at night during Ramadan.

review/summary: Medium Quality Tea, Decent Value, Goes A Long Way
review/text: This is a medium quality tea at best, at a decent price.  Tea from Chinese tea specialty houses such as Tenren is far better, but costs approximately four times as much.  Twinings Gunpower Green (which I haven't tasted) is selling for a higher price than the Davidson, and Twinings tea, in my experience, is not high quality tea.  It has better reviews than this tea as well.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Gunpowder used to be rolled by hand into the little gunpowder pellets, but today almost all gunpowder is made on a machine.  Because it is rolled into the pellets, you may want to use a little less in your measure for the strength of tea you prefer.  In other words, because it is compressed, there is more tea per teaspoonful, and you may find the tea stronger than you expected.  I do like a strong cup of tea, and the slightly smoky quality of this tea is pleasant when brewed on the strong side.<br /><br />Similarly, a strong cup of gunpowder probably has a higher caffeine level than a comparable cup of other green tea.  This is anecdotal, partially based on the compressed nature of the tea and partially based on many mornings of research.<br /><br />Historical Note: the tea that was dumped into the Boston harbor by the patriots in 1773 was probably gunpowder tea.<br /><br />A suggestion: a pound of this tea will last you a very long time, and will be a bit stale when you are done.  Suggestion:  put half of more in the freezer and you will have fresher tea when the first half of the bag is done.  I have had my bag about six months and wish I had done that!<br /><br />Tiger

review/summary: Smokey, Good Flavor, and best of all CHEAP
review/text: I'll be the first to admit I'm no tea connoisseur. I'm a college student who likes drinking 3-4 cups of tea a tea, usually green tea. I'm used to buying in tea bags but over the last 6 months I've been buying from Teavana and Kungaloosh, which in the end got a bit expensive. So I decided to give this tea a try based on the positive reviews here.<br /><br />First off, let me point out that this is a LOT of tea for the price. I couldn't even believe it when the package arrived. It doesn't fit into one of my Teavana airtight containers, I had to put the rest in a small tupperware container. So you get incredible value. On top of that, you get TWO infusions, and the great flavor is still there on the second infusion.<br /><br />Next, let me address the quality: It's definitely got a smokey taste. You're gonna see particles floating around. It's not the cleanest tea in the world. But, it's green tea! Every green tea I've tasted has tasted similar to this. It's got a strong taste, a bit bitter, but a clean aftertaste unlike some tea bags. So I'll definitely come back and get another bag, you know, whenever this huge order runs out. Probably in 3 or 4 months.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great bargain for a good tea.

review/summary: Great value for some good tea!!
review/text: The bag I received was a very good batch! You can tell it was very fresh, and it makes some darn good tea. The leaves smell slightly sweet but mostly grassy. It brews in a light-greenish tint, which is a good sign of its quality. No 'other particles' in the bag, just leaves as expected. All-in-all, a great value for the 9$ I paid for it.<br /><br />This isn't AMAZING tea, but it is definitely worth 10 or 12 bucks as a simple everyday tea that is great for you.

review/text: I may not be the tea connoisseur that some of my fellow reviewers are, yet be that as it may, I find this a fantastic green tea. It's got a mild, mineral flavor with a distinct herbaceous headiness while remaining characteristically "green". I like to brew mine extra strong to emphasize bitter notes. Davidson's packaging is fantastic: opaque outer paper and a moisture-resistant inner liner helps preserve the tea over time.<br /><br />And thanks to Amazon's Subscription program, I get this tea delivered monthly. I've even had to double my order I go through so much!

review/text: Hello,<br /><br />I bought this tea on a whim after reading about "Gunpowder" green tea on another site.  I was intrigued by the description and the name and thought I would see if Amazon carried it.  The minute it came in I was immediately impressed with the quality of the bag, Davidson's bags are resealable and keep the tea fresh for a long time.  I brewed my first kettle and immediately knew I would continue bying both this tea and this brand.  This tea is very flavorful and works well both hot and cold.<br /><br />I have purchased Davisdon's tea multiple times since the original purchase and have alsways been impresses with the quality.  Highly recommend this brand and this style.<br /><br />Mac S.

review/text: This is an unbelievable deal. For the same price as the mystery cube o' leaves you find at Asian grocers or internet vendors, you get a full pound of Organic leaves. The Gunpowder Green has a hint of citrus, a hint of nuttiness, but most importantly, it tastes clean. You don't have to worry about undoing the health benefits of green tea with heavy metals or other pollutants in non-organic products. The 16 Oz. bag lasted me over two months with several strong cups per day. I highly recommend this tea.

review/summary: A lot of dirt
review/text: This is not a great green tea. It contains a lot of dirt / powder that goes through the tea ball and makes the cup look like a suspension rather than an infusion. The taste is weak so one has to use a lot of this tea, which results in an over-caffeinated beverage. Finally, even the color of the tea itself is on the yellow side rather than green. Not a satisfactory purchase!

Both were a good price for a pound of organic tea and moreso, to my happy surprise, the quality of the tea is superb.  Not the best that money can buy but far, far better than I expected in this price range.  Both teas have leaves that are nicely dried, with care, mostly whole (as opposed to all broken up), and the Gunpowder especially has a lovely luster to it.  Well done, Davidson's!

review/summary: Wonderful flavor and aroma, beautiful unfurling
review/text: I cannot believe how much I enjoy this green tea. I typically despise green tea because the only way I have ever had it before was through a plastic bottle made by some large company or in tea bags, also from a large company. It was always a disappointment. However, the flavor in this tea is wonderful. I actually felt something in my stomach while I was drinking this, it seemed to calm it a bit because I was hungry. Maybe it was the placebo effect because I have read so much about green tea and I want it to do something good for me, but overall despite the supposed health benefits it was actually just good to drink with some honey.<br /><br />Sadly I don't have proper honey, just highly filtered and processed honey, but it still helped mellow the tea out just a little bit, which it needed because I steeped way too much the first time I tried it. That is in fact my only complaint, that I don't know what I'm doing, so it's going to take some trial and error to determine the amounts that I enjoy the most. I used a full tablespoon, which when you see the leaves unfurl you begin to realize is way more than necessary, and then you drink it! It was very strong, but still excellent.

review/summary: Great for smoothies!
review/text: I recently started drinking loose tea from a local chain, and I really like it. I tend to really enjoy the straight unsweetened slightly bitter green teas of the stronger varieties, and I've had a gunpowder tea before that I really enjoyed. However, I wanted to try a less expensive variety, as I felt guilty when I used a five or ten dollar an ounce tea as the liquid base of a smoothie. And who knows - I just might get lucky and it'll be great tea. This is not a great tea. It's a little too strong, bitter, unsubtle, and the only word I can think of to describe the taste is "dusty". These qualities make it the perfect green tea base for a fruit smoothie! The tea flavor really comes through, unlike the finer teas. Yum.

review/text: This is my first bag of this tea (got it about a month ago). I brew it with hot-not-boiling water (bring to boil; let sit a couple of minutes before using); three teaspoons of dry tea in a regular-size ceramic teapot. I drink it hot and w/o sugar. My impressions so far, real quick:<br /><br />Good:<br />- It is undoubtedly tea.<br />- It's inexpensive.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Tastes like mouldy cardboard.<br /><br />Questionable:<br />- Is it really green? It doesn't look very green, and, when brewed, it results in a light-brown liquid that is kind of like a weak regular tea.<br /><br />Bottomline: I don't think I will reorder; two stars.<br /><br />11/18/2011: I did reorder, so let's  bump up the starrage. I just don't think of it as tea. More like a generic drink. To make it more palatable, I drink it hot and add orange peel to it.

review/text: I tasted many teas and read dozens of reviews and product descriptions before I settled on this tea. Most product descriptions don't tell the truth.<br /><br />Pros: I was pleasantly surprised at the taste of this tea. DON'T OVER BREW or it will be bitter! JUST 2 minutes is perfect. I can get three pots out of this tea but I let the last pot sit at least 10 minutes. I've ordered a second time and will order this again. This is now my daily tea.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />Cons: I read that if you gently press the little balls of rolled "Gunpowder" tea, they should give and be pliable. This is the sign of fresh tea. This tea crumbles, a sure sign of older tea, stored who-knows-how-long. I would like to get a fresh shipment but I also like the reasonable price of this old tea. I guess that is the trade-off. If someone knows where I can get fresher "Gunpowder" tea at a good price, please let me know.

review/text: I drink about a quart of green tea every day, so the cost can really rise if I were to purchase a nice Chinese tea.  I purchased this tea primarily for its price.  I brewed it as I usually do, 180 degrees and 1 tsp of tea to 8 oz of water, and wow do these leaves really expand.  I usually leave the leaves in the bottom of my water bottle or glass, but with this tea you end up with 50% of your glass occupied by the leaves.  You really have to use a diffuser or pot.  The brewed tea is quite cloudy which is a little disappointing.  The taste is not particularly strong or very herby, but it is not unpleasant either.  For the price, this tea is tough to beat, but it is definitely a quantity over quality tea.

review/summary: It's great tea
review/text: If you want to drink a green tea, gunpowder is the one I consider with the best flavor.  The value here is great, and the tea perfect.  I'd suggest you not brew it for longer than 3 minutes and do not use boiling water, and the taste will be perfect.  Water at about 180 appears to be best, hotter or longer times will just make the tea bitter.  Enjoy.

review/text: This isn't tea of a super high quality, but it's superior to anything that you'll find in a teabag (and much cheaper, also).  For the price, you really do get a large quantity of tea.  I've had this for a month now, and I probably drink this particular tea maybe 4 times a week, and I still really haven't made too much of a dent on the bag.<br /><br />The flavor's robust and 'smokey', it's not very delicate or fragrant,  but still tasty nonetheless.

review/text: For the price, this is a great tea for me to get my morning going. I usually get 3 brews from one serving. I like my green tea fairly strong, so I use more than the recommended 1 tsp leaves per 8 oz of water. Don't over-infuse because (as you probably know if you're ordering bulk green tea), it'll become bitter.<br /><br />I use this tea with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q3L9PA">Aladdin Tea 12-Ounce Infuser Mug, Blue</a>, a great product for keeping yourself in reach of hot tea all day long.

review/text: The more I drink of this tea the more I like it.  It compares with teas twice it price. (On the first order.)<br /><br />I am on my second order of this tea, the flavor is just as good but I seems to have come from the bottom of the barrel.  Instead of the Gunpowder Tea I was expecting, it is more a powder like it has been crushed and none of the leaves are whole.  Though this does not impact the flavor it does make cleaning out the tea ball a lot harder.

review/summary: Incredible tea for the price
review/text: Echoing what many of the other reviewers have written, this is an eminently drinkable tea and a great bargain as well.<br /><br />I normally gravitate to more peculiar teas (lapsang souchong is by far my favorite) but I developed a taste for gunpowder green tea after trying it at a friend's apartment.  Most tea shops will sell "pearls" of this tea for upwards of $9.00/oz and so I was skeptical when I saw a pound of this tea for such a cheap price.<br /><br />This tea is everything that a gunpoweder green tea should be: a bit dry, a bit earthy, and not too acidic.  It tends to brew a bit strong, so I usually brew 2 cups out of 1 & 1/2 teaspoons of this tea which makes it a perfect, if not too fancy, everyday tea.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the leaves are absolutely huge (uncut) when they unfurl which makes cleaning them out of a tea infuser to be an absolute snap.  One major drawback of other loose teas is the small leaves which necessitate disassembling the infusing and/or rinsing the filter a few times to clear them out.  The leaves left behind from this blend can be easily, and neatly, removed by hand.  Awesome all around!

review/summary: Great, high quality green tea at an affordable price... and YUMMY!
review/text: This tea is great! Nowhere else can you get one POUND of high quality tea for $12 shipped to your door. I used to pay $30 for a sub-par product, but no more!<br /><br />You know it's a fresh, high quality tea when it takes 3-6 days for a fresh made batch to start to stink in the fridge. I used to drink Lipton every day, and it takes between 1 and 2 weeks for Lipton (a lower quality tea) to 'go bad' in the fridge. If you know anything about tea, you will know that the more 'processed' and less 'natural' it is, the longer it stays fresh. Davidson's starts to smell anywhere between 3-6 days for me.<br /><br />Highly recommended, you'll love it!

review/summary: Best I've seen
review/text: I have been a green tea drinker for many years.  I love gunpowder because you get the whole leaf and not bits and pieces.  This is high quality tea.  I I read a review saying this tea was bitter; I completely disagree.  Normally you get the bitterness when you steep it too long or when you squeeze out the leaves after steeping.  I have done both with this tea and still get no bitterness.  I also use less of this tea than normal.  The gunpowder expands so much you only need a large pinch per glass.<br /><br />I've paid much more at health food stores and Asian markets, but haven't come across anything that can beat this stuff.  Proceed with confidence.  I bet you'll give it 5 stars, too.

review/summary: not just for deli -- use to make POT ROAST (really!!!)
review/text: First off, these are great on sandwiches or in salads, or on pizza.<br /><br />But, thanks to Myron (google "amazing beef" for the original recipe), we can also make an extraordinarily fine pot roast with them.  Sounds disgusting, right?  I know -- but we tried it once with misgivings and have since made it countless times with total delight.  Unbelievable, but true.<br /><br />Here's my adaptation of Myron's recipe:<br /><br />1  Scrape and then cut into four long spears each of two huge Idaho baking potatoes (or substitute potatoes of your choice, enough for four servings).<br /><br />2  Scrape and leave whole 6-8 large fresh carrots (frozen will not make a good substitute, neither will "baby" carrots).<br /><br />3  Peel and leave whole 4 small sweet onions (but leave just a little on the root, to hold them together during cooking -- can also substitute onions of your choice, enough for 4 servings, but best to leave whole if possible).<br /><br />4  Take a small chunk of raw beef (if you're watching your calories, try about 1.5-2 pounds of a top sirloin roast; otherwise any pot-roast-suitable cut will be fine) and remove from wrappings.<br /><br />5  Layer vegetables on the bottom of a 5, 6 or 7 quart crock-pot, and put meat on top (be sure top can still cover with a proper seal).<br /><br />6  Upend over all of it the contents of a jar of these wonderful pepperoncini WITH THE JUICE, cover, and set on low for 10-12 or high for at least 6 hours (or start on high and then switch to low).  DO NOT REMOVE THE COVER before done.  It doesn't matter if it cooks too long; just be sure it's at least 6 hours on high or almost 10 on low).<br /><br />VOILA -- an extraordinarily fine pot roast, suitable for company.  Can leave on keep-warm setting for literally 24 hours thereafter and serve seconds the next night without having to reheat.  Or even firsts -- the whole thing actually tastes better the second day.<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE USE FOR LEFTOVERS (from Myron):  Slice cold beef (I warm it up briefly in the microwave with the peppers, so that they're steaming hot, then drain so as not to make the bread too soggy);serve on high-quality crusty bread, topped with fresh sliced tomatoes and then the cooked peppers.  My favorite sandwich ever!!<br /><br />These pepperoncini are fabulous; we keep jars in the pantry so as to have them available at a moment's notice.  You may find you use them far more often than expected and are very glad to have them!!<br /><br />P.S.  Use the remaining broth from the pot roast as the cooking water for whole-wheat couscous or brown rice, and add the peppers -- divine.

review/summary: Not quite like the real thing
review/text: The Diet Fountain Mist was certainly a good effort, but it's not like anything currently out there on the market.  If you are expecting a "Diet Mountain Dew" taste, you need to adjust your taste buds.  If you buy the kroger or publix brand of a carbonated drink product, it's not going to taste like the real thing either. Let's take peanut butter for example - store brand or Jiffy, you shouldn't notice that much of a difference.  But in a drink - specifically a diet carbonated drink, it's going to be different.  If it did taste the same, I'm sure there'd be a lawsuit waiting.<br /><br />That being said - I don't mind the flavor.  I'm almost all the way through the first bottle now, and am tolerating it.  I like Diet Sun Drop and Diet Mountain Dew, but this is like neither.  It's not for lack of trying, but it's just not all that great.  The only reason - and I mean only - reason I would purchase a second bottle, is for the cost vs. name brand.  It's such a great deal in comparison to name brand drinks, that I can save tons of money if I get used to this.  But even while having this, I still consume the real thing - for a treat.  I just can't switch over fully.  But at $1.75 for a 2 liter of the real thing, this product will suffice for an interim drink.

review/summary: Don't "Dew" It!!!
review/text: This syrup is horrendous!!!  It tastes NOTHING like Diet Mountain Dew, or any other beverage you might be willing to drink.  I love Diet Mountain Dew, but I can't stand the taste/smell of this.  Do not buy unless you want to poor it down the drain....and then I would feel sorry for the drain!

review/summary: Opinion:  Sweet Kerosene Flavor
review/text: Sodastream Diet Fountain Mist flavor smells like over-sweetened kerosene based cleaning fluid and although I've never tasted cleaning fluid, this is what I believe it would taste like.<br /><br />I like, and know what the real Diet Mountain Dew tastes like and that Sodastream is representing it (on the label) to be comparable to... but the Diet Fountain Mist flavor doesn't even remotely come close to that!<br /><br />This is one flavor that will be permanently added to my "avoid at any cost" list.

review/summary: Kinda chalky, Go with Happy Melts
review/text: I was super excited to see these at Safeway for only $3. I have seen them at other places for as much as $4.50 and the competitor, Happy Melts Yogurt Melts, on sale for $5. I have to say, go with the Happy Melts version. The Gerber ones lack the flavor and texture of the Happy Melts version and are actually kind of chalky and bland. Happy Melts are all organic and are smaller, which is better for your baby and for you. I prefer the strawberry flavor but the wildberry is also quite good. I think the way they melt in your mouth is quite similar to astronaut ice cream.

review/summary: BackCountry organic coffee is incredible
review/text: TRY THIS COFFEE! You won't believe it. BackCountry coffee is not only organic and free trade, but even more important, the best coffee my family and friends have tasted. We buy it for gifts, and people are consistently amazed and seek it out when they come to the Methow Valley, where it is roasted. The decaf is so rich and dark that I hardly know it is decaf. BackCountry Coffee Roasters Organic "No Trace" Decaf, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)The bags are also larger than most coffee bags, and you get 33% more than many other coffees for the same price- try it and you will never go back! carole

review/summary: I was so hopeful
review/text: I read the reviews and was so hopeful. Im sorry but this coffee was nasty from the first wiff. Smelled like old, stale canned coffee. Tasted like the worst coffee at Dennys that you would have to force yourself to drink to be polite. Maybe I got a bad batch but unfortunately I have 32 oz of this unreturnable product.

review/summary: Best and Freshest
review/text: BackCountry "No Trace" decaf is just the right roast with a wonderful aroma and satisfying flavor! I have searched a long time for an organic, fair trade decaf coffee that is water processed- which at the same time tastes full bodied and has that rich oily dark roast freshness. No Trace is the top of the list! I am so glad to have found this small business roaster. They care about service and ship the same day they roast so your beans arrive as soon as the next day! I believe I started drinking Starbucks 30 years ago when there was only the one store in Pike Place Market in Seattle... and have been drinking it every since. However, BackCountry coffee flavor far exceeds Starbucks and doesn't have the bitterness of Starbucks nor that acid aftertaste. What a gem of a roast and fine selection of beans! They have achieved the perfect balance and smoothness that a coffee lover really appreciates! Thanks BackCountry!

review/summary: Favorite Decaf!
review/text: After giving up caffiene it was tough to find a coffee I really loved again. I wanted to avoid the chemicals of other decaf processes. This is a good medium-dark full bodied roast. I typically grind fresh and make in a french press.
