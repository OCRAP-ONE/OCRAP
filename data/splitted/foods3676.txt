review/summary: Yummy,yummy and worth the price
review/text: I am the grandma who is constantly dieting and I have a toddler granddaughter who literally hates to eat. This product helps both of us! It is a very healthy no sugar added, fat free snack. I eat the veggies one piece at a time. They are crunchy and literally melt in  my mouth. I am amazed at how good they are. My granddaughter also likes them. She is a picky eater and she also eats one piece at a time. Now I know she is getting nutrition instead of eating junk food. Yes, they are expensive, but you aren't going to be sitting around eating these by the spoonful like you would regular cooked veggies. I have only eaten them so far as a snack, but I am looking for ways to include them in my salads. These  snacks are also good for my grandson who is just learning to eat regular food. They are small enough and dissolve in the mouth and I won't worry about him choking (I always feed him under supervision!) These snacks are worth a try.

review/summary: JUST FOOD, blessed by a dragonfly and a ladybug [a "Holistic" Review]
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 9:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>This video features JUST VEGGIES [from the Just Tomatoes brand of dried fruits and vegetables], showing the product "close up and personal."  Included in this review are several other Amazon products which for me are related to the dried veggies [among them a couple food and health books on my KINDLE].  I've listed these below [with hyperlinks to Amazon product pages].<br /><br />It could probably go without saying that the dragonfly and ladybug shown in the video were not purchased from Amazon! They just happened to cross my path in such a way as to become video stars.<br /><br />The dragonfly was found lifeless but perfectly preserved.  Of course it did not "come with" my Kindle, as my slip of the tongue in the video may have implied. The ladybug somehow found its way from my country kitchen onto the top of the container of JUST VEGGIES after I had broken the seal and opened the tub.  I didn't notice the  ladybug until I was showing the product in the video.<br /><br />According to my holistic doctor and my personal viewpoint [and studies of books by several medical professionals] the severe magnesium deficiency and soybean intolerance I unfortunately have is aggravated [if not caused] by food alterations and additives, especially soybean products.  Due to this, I've been forced into the dreaded and difficult task of searching for foods free of chemically synthesized or genetically altered intrusions.<br /><br />This painful and frightening situation has been blessedly eased by Amazon's variety of products suiting alternate tastes and needs. Some of these products are helping me slowly regain health and flavor in my life by working around what I've observed and read about an increasing preponderance of synthesized additives and soybean GMOs which are impregnating more and more foods in the marketplace... with some of them listed under insane misnomers like "natural flavors" as discovered by people who have serious soy allergies [genetically modified organisms don't seem precisely natural to me].<br /><br />The cherished blessing in this forced change in shopping, cooking, and eating is that food I'm preparing now is beginning again to taste like JUST FOOD, making my stomach growl like it hasn't done for a few decades!<br /><br />As for my uses so far of the Just Veggies, it is a fantastic, flavor lush, light luxury snack.  It also tastes great reconstituted and warmed in the microwave with water, coconut oil, cooked diced potatoes, fresh cilantro, and chopped green onions.  I like Just Veggies best [the use seems most efficient] combined into a bowl of rice, quinoa, or noodles for added color, flavor, and nutritive value.  I'm attempting to stretch the dried veggies by thinking of them like Just Roasted Garlic, more as a spice instead of a main dish.<br /><br />Here's to natural flavor which comes from the food itself, or from spices or integrity enhancers added by an old fashioned cook,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />Here's the promised list of books and products [regarding "Just Veggies"; I purchased the 4 oz 4 pk, but might try the 8 oz 2 pk size on this page next time] purchased on Amazon which are related directly or indirectly to this review:<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGCD2C">Just Tomatoes Just Roasted Garlic, 1-Pound Bag</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAT6NG">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar</a><br />3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz (237 ml) Spray</a><br />4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E62HXQ">Magnesium Chloride Flakes 2.2 lb (35.27 oz) Flakes</a> [The Zechstein web site says they can't recommend making your own brine water from the flakes, but after studying the trace residuals which come out of the breakdown of the originally mined brine water, I've formed an intuitive opinion that there might be an advantage for me to sometimes using this reconstituted liquid form from the Zechstein flakes.  I use it in cooking and cleaning.]<br />5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLBES">Pacific Salt Coarse Sea Salt, 2.2 Pound Bags (Pack of 4)</a> Himalayan and other brands are good options, too.]<br />6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/034549458X">The Magnesium Miracle</a><br />7. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)</a><br />[My reviews of the above and related products each give their own details and slants, which can enhance what I've said here and in this video.]

review/summary: Decent sub for Dental Diet
review/text: My cats mourned the day I could no longer find Dental Diet. My vet said my cats teeth were in great shape and she mainly ate dental diet. I bought Science Diet Oral Care and they hate it. Money down the drain. Royal Canin's brand they really like. I haven't noticed the same great results with their teeth and breath but it's the best I can give them. They do like it but after a few weeks they stop eating it and get bored so I have to hold off then reintroduce it. Friskies pissed off me and my cats by discontinuing a product that really worked.

review/summary: Fixes one problem, creates new ones
review/text: I used to buy the Friskies dental diet for my four year old feline, who had severe gingivitis, resulting in terrible breath and tooth decay. The Friskie's, for being a cheap brand, actually did a pretty good job of improving this condition, since she refuses to let me brush. However, they took this food off the market. The remaining 2 options are this food and Hill's.<br /><br />Finding this online with the free shipping and the cheaper price sealed the deal for me, as they don't usually have it in the store, and her oral condition was deteriorating again. I had been feeding her a hairball and healthy weight formula just because it was what my other cat ate in the meantime, and was happy to have a new dental food.<br /><br />After slowly switching her over, I realized this food really isn't as good as it seems. It mildly improved her teeth, but her breath is still awful and I can see tartar (compared to the improvement I saw from the Friskie's). She now has started coughing up hairballs almost every other day, and she is gaining weight rapidly, even though I feed her less than a cup a day. She also acts hungry all the time. I checked the amount of fat in this food, and it is almost double the healthy weight formula. So I can feed her a normal amount and she will continue to get fatter (been on it for about 3 months, and has gained at least 2 pounds) or I can starve her so she maintains a normal weight. I recommend checking the nutrition or even trying the Hill's if your cat has severe gum/tooth disease, weight issues, or hairball problems. The other reviewers gave it favorable ratings, however, so maybe if your cat has mild problems it will work for you.

review/summary: Three days so far--cat vomit free!
review/text: I was at wits end when I stumbled across this cat food. For the past couple years I've been feeding my indoor hand-me-down cat of indeterminate age canned food, since she would vomit whenever she ate dry food.<br /><br />Lately she started vomiting part of the time even with the canned food. In addition, at the annual pet check-up two months ago, the vet commented that she had some fairly bad plaque build-up on her teeth, which he said was probably caused by her soft food diet. He recommended adding some water to her dry food in order to prevent the vomiting. It didn't work.<br /><br />A desperate google search on "cat vomit" turned up the Royal Canin oral sensitive option. Several cat owners reported that feeding this dry food eliminated vomiting. Though I couldn't think of a reason that it would actually work I decided to try a bag. That was several days ago, and I am very pleased to report that we're going on day 3 "cat vomit free."<br /><br />Maybe I'll actually be able to get that new carpet....<br /><br />At the cat's next check-up I'll be able to report on any change in the vet's description of her oral condition, but that might not be until next year.<br />--------------------<br />Edit: it has now been close to two months that we have been using this cat food. The cat only vomited one day so far, rather than daily, and she produced two hairballs and then stopped. She has also started behaving kittenish again--racing around the house, knocking over things and running away, and clamoring to be petted. She can be a bit of nuisance, but I'll take a kittenish cat every day of the year over finding wet messes all over my house. We will keep buying this cat food--I don't know why it works, but it does.

We had gotten two kittens also, so he wanted to eat their kitty food.. (his weight was already a problem so this wasn't a good idea..) We googled and found good reviews on Royal Canin Oral Sensitive, so we figured why noy try it... Living in Alaska everything cost more so a 3 pound bag was all we could get and it was almost 20 bucks for that... I found it in a 6 pound bag om Amazon for 22 and some change.. YAY!!!  and free shipping (I LOVE Amazon's free shipping!!!!!) so I will be buying from Amazon often... because ALL three will only eat the Royal Canin now...

review/text: Because the pieces are much larger than the Special 33 for Sensitive Stomachs, my one cat who used to inhale his dry food instead of chewing it, actually has to chew this up into pieces, which seems to have solved his propensity for purging on my carpet. I have both this and the Special 33 out and find both Burmese nosh out of both bowls. Having it delivered to my door by Amazon sure beats going to Petsmart and lugging it from my garage, up four flights of steps.

review/summary: My cat throws up now more than ever
review/text: Since I bought this, my cat went from throwing up once every couple of weeks to almost every day.  I think because the pellets are larger and hard to bite, he's more prone to swallowing them whole, which is hard on his stomach.  I suspect this because the vomit comes out in large, undigested chunks.  What a waste of money.

review/summary: Did slow down the vomiting
review/text: When I switched my very senior cat to this, he went from throwing up every day to only every once in a while. However, it is hard to get him to maintain a healthy weight on it. I think the method of slowing down vomiting was the larger kibble, so it takes him longer to eat it- so I may try to find a food with a larger kibble and less fat to keep him at a healthy weight and vomiting less. Otherwise I was happy that this product worked as advertised.

review/text: My cat had some serious dental work done a few months ago.  The vet sent us home with some high quality food but my cat wasn't too thrilled with it.  I looked at other reviews and decided to try this stuff.  To my surprise my cat seemed to enjoy it right away. Similar to the vet food, the kibbles are larger than normal food so it helps to "brush" his teeth. I still leave a little of the vet food out but he only nibbles - he always eats all the RC.  An added bonus is that his habit of puking up his old food on the carpet once or twice a week has pretty much vanished! He's happy and I'm happy!

Very large kernels, great for not only eating "straight up", but also with a lot of nice surface area for coatings like caramel.  Popped in a "movie theatre" style popcorn machine at my office with the solid coconut oil popcorn oil and some salt, and it's like something straight out of the stores.<br />Kernels are not quite as tender as smaller popcorn, but it is certainly not "tough", especially when coated with a caramel crunch.

review/text: Very disappointed in the new product.  The old crackers were awesome tasting, this new recipe tastes bad.  The worst thing is that they are using the old product picture so that is misleading!  The new product comes in a box and the crackers don't even remotely resemble what you thought you were ordering.  False advertising if you ask me!

review/summary: All natural, great taste, great price!
review/text: Most of the time I make my own pasta sauce, but on busy nights it's great to open a jar of ready-made sauce and have dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes.  We've tried all the jarred pasta sauces out there, and this Francesco Rinaldi sauce is my favorite.  It has a rich tomato flavor, seasoned with basil and garlic.  It's thick enough to stick to pasta, and doesn't have any bitter or metallic flavor like some brands have.<br /><br />I especially like that the ingredients are simple and it doesn't contain preservatives.  Ingredients on the bottle say: tomato paste, diced tomatoes, sugar, soybean oil, salt, extra virgin olive oil, dried onions, basil, spices, garlic.<br /><br />The generic term "spices" might mean that it contains MSG, but maybe not. The website claims their products are all-natural.  It also has 480 mg of salt per 1/2 cup serving, which is a lot.<br /><br />Each jar is 45 ounces, which is plenty for our large family.  I paid $10.40 for four jars, after a 15% discount for Subscribe and Save (and free shipping), so this is a much better deal than Ragu or Prego at the grocery store.

review/text: I, for the most part do my own pasta sauces.  Now and then when pressed for time and energy I will use a jarred sauce as a base, seasoned appropriate to the occasion.  This product is a much higher cut than the shelved sauces sold at supermarkets.  Italian shops being an exception in some cases.  The price is a bargain!  I have not used their other sauces and speak only for this.

review/summary: At least as good as Ragu, and a real bargain
review/text: This us not the most flavorful spaghetti sauce although it seems at least as good to me as the case lots of Ragu that I've been buying from Amazon. If you want the top of the line in terms of flavor, then you're also going to be paying top of the line prices--at least twice what this sauce costs. And what really distinguishes this sauce is its low price. It's a terrific bargain.<br /><br />I don't actually try to get a complete spaghetti sauce when I buy these products, I just want to find a good base to which I can add other ingredients. And this serves very well in that role. It is an excellent base. To this, I typically add: pitted black olives, canned mushroom pieces, saut&eacute;ed garlic and onion, strained diced tomstoes for body (I prefer the fire-roasted ones), and either sliced Polish sausage or saut&eacute;ed ground beef. Throw the whole concoction into a slow cooker for five hours, and it's pretty good.<br /><br />These are just suggestions. The beauty of sauces like this is that you can add whatever in your pantry seems suitable for a spaghetti sauce. As I said, it's a great base. Anything too flavorful might just get in the way, and it would just cost too much besides.

review/text: i am neither italian nor a chef, but this stuff tastes excellent.  maybe somewhere in the description it should be noted it also contains lotsa onions, which makes it even better than i might have expected.  i did add some of the pasta water, since i supplemented with with sauted in olive oil multi colored peppers which i always keep in freezer.  the price is also great for the size and thru s&s it will conveniently come to my door with no hassle.  i will enjoy on a regular basis.  thanks for making it available. as a matter of fact, i just received the item today and couldn't wait to use.  it's fragrantly simmering right now, finishing up the tortelloni also received today. also added some meatballs.  a little unusual maybe, but who cares.  it's got all the elements i like.  just wanted to add that it is not uncommon to add some sugar or carrot to combat the acidity of tomatoes.

review/summary: Just the right amount of heat
review/text: A unique bar. If it weren't ungrammatical, I would say it is one very unique bar. Dark chocolate (54%), dried cranberries, chipotle powder and vanilla make for an intense, hot, spicy, fruity, sweet, tangy, fragrant chocolate with hits of chewy cranberry in a well tempered base. The more I ate this the more I liked it.<br /><br />Jersey Devil's bar is on the thin side, which appealed to me, and it's scored into 20 little rectangles. When something has an AQ (addiction quotient) this high, anything that slows you down as you scarf it up is to be appreciated.<br /><br />If you love a little heat with your dark chocolate, this one is for you.<br /><br />To find out more about other new chocolates, see chocolate ratings, the site.

review/summary: Way too good!
review/text: This combination sounds unlikely: chocolate, chili, and dried cranberry. You'll just have to trust me for it, the mix works and works beautifully. Chocolate flavor comes through dark and rich, cranberry tang brightens it with almost a citrus note, and the chili tingle follows a moment later leaving a warm afterglow. If you've never had Mexican mol&eacute; sauce, it might sound improbable. The chili mix-in goes back to the Aztec origins of chocolate, however, and succeeds as brilliantly now as it ever did.<br /><br />If you find it, give it a shot. I'll be coming back for more.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

review/summary: Thai Tea mix Pantainorasingh
review/text: taste like the thai tea at thai restaurants, but only if you make the tea concentrated enough--you can't skimp here!  The mix is made of actual tea leaves but precut, and some herbs and spices that give it the unique taste of thai tea.  color certainly comes from dye (FD & C Yellow No. 6)-- I would say that is a commonality with most thai teas.

review/summary: Tastes just like Thai restaurants.. just avoid using as much as they advise!
review/text: I love this tea. It tastes just like restaurants make when you add sweetened condensed milk (also easier to stir into iced tea than sugar). My only caution is that this stuff stains VERY easily. I used an iced tea maker with a bucket-style coffee filter to brew my tea and spilled a little bit on the counter while I was working and I had giant orange spots where the tea landed within a couple minutes.<br /><br />Also, the bag tells you to use 4 Tbsp per cup of water- that means if you are making a gallon of tea you need to add about 4 cups if you follow the bag! This didn't sound right to me, and I do tend to like my tea strong. I decided to add 1/2c. of the tea per quart  of water and it still turned out pretty strong.

review/summary: just like the restuarant tea
review/text: My husband and I love it. We just received it yesterday and are on our second pitcher. No more stops at the neigborhoor Thai restaurant just to get the tea. Just a couple of suggestions to for the home Thai tea maker: first use half and half instead of milk. It makes the tea nice and creamy. Yum. Also, you don't need the muslin strainer for the tea. I suggest that you go to your nearest Coffee Bean and get the "Ingenuitea" tea strainer by Adagio. The strainer at the bottom of the cup will strain the crushed tea leaves with little mess. If you want to know what it looks like just search "Ingenuitea" on Amazon. Good drinking.

review/text: This doesn't taste like the Thai Iced Tea I get at restaurants.  Maybe it's all the yellow food coloring that throws things off for me.  I really feel like there is too much dye in this tea - to the point that I didn't use the other three bags.  That just can't be good for you.

review/summary: Cheaper with shipping, but not as good as the other brand
review/text: I decided to try this brand because it was cheaper as a bulk amount with shipping than Por Kwan. Also, I wanted to at least try it and see how it compared. Unfortunately, it's completely different than the other brand and I don't particularly like it. I have a ton of this stuff now and I'm on the fence about wasting it and getting what I want or just sticking it out. Some might enjoy this flavor more, but I feel like the other brand is more like what I fell in love with in restaurants. It has totally different ingredients as well, and includes lemongrass, which I assume is where that extra kick comes in.

review/text: This brand of Thai tea was recommended to me by the proprietor of a wonderful Thai restaurant where we love to eat in Omaha, NE.  After asking several times when we were in town, he finally broke down and told me where to get this brand in Omaha.  Then I was delighted to find it on Amazon (because I was going to try to get my relatives to send it).  What a lifesaver.  Follow the directions on the bag for Thai tea just like the restaurant serves.  I love it!

review/summary: Good flavor, but level of heat is very inconsistent.
review/text: For those who don't know, there is a big difference in the flavor of New Mexico chile powder & regular chile powder. I'm talking huge. If you are a fan of Mexican food, pick some up next time you are cooking, you will be amazed at the difference.<br /><br />I normally purchase my New Mexico chile powder at a local Mexican market and have been very happy with what I have received there. The only problem I have run into is low stock, requiring multiple trips in order to stock up. It was Amazon to the rescue! offering a 12 pack of New Mexico chile powder for a reasonable price & eliminating my trips across town.<br /><br />The flavor of this chile powder is good, but the heat from pack to pack is inconsistent. I ordered the mild, looking more for flavor than heat. The first pack I opened was on par with what I have always used, but the second & third packs have been very hot. I now have to test the chile powder's heat before adding it to the dish to ensure I don't end up with something that is too hot for most guests to enjoy.<br /><br />If Amazon offers a different brand the next time I need to order, I may give it a try. But if not I think I'm back to my local Mexican market for this item.

With other brands I have tried, while they have been very flavorful, it was difficult to unwrap them without playing tug of war with the wrapping. These are wrapped in powdered parchment and then an outer wrapper, easy to remove and pop in your mouth. And the Amazon 5-pack price cannot be beat. I paid over twice this price in a local health food store. Stock up - they have a long shelf life!

review/summary: Great gum
review/text: This gum's flavor is more akin to orange, or basically a sweet citrus taste.  I chew a piece when I work out or play any type of sport, and it pastes at least 40 minutes to keep my mouth feeling refreshed.  Granted, the taste is obviously not as intense after the first 10 minutes or so.  A few added bonus is that unlike some other gum like Extra, the consistency of this gum doesn't degrade down to a nasty mush when your mouth's temperature gets very high.  In addition, even when the fruity taste is mostly gone, there is no weird or bitter taste either.<br /><br />Lastly, I'm not sure if vitamin b6 and b12 in this gum actually does anything, but for those who swear by these 2 vitamins for energy boost, they can't hurt.

In fact, it's actually used in cancer centers as it's been proven to actually fight some types of cancer and prevent free radicals in addition to also being shown as a metabolism booster in study after study.

review/text: I ordered this matcha hoping it would be of the same quality are the $12 matcha I usually purchase from a local Asian market. I was very dissapointed. This is culinary grade matcha. It doesn't dissolve well and the color of the tea is dark, very different from the bright green matcha I am used to. The flavour is somewhat bitter and flat, at least in comparison to any good drinking-grade matcha I've tried. I'm sure this is a fine option if you intend only to cook with it or make sweetened iced tea, but if you intend to consume it as a hot tea, I would advise you to select a different product of better quality.

review/summary: Indistinct. Not Up To Hype On Label.
review/text: I've been trying out a few blended red California wines which I find at a nearby Fresh and Easy Store and a few of them have been exceptional bargains. They're totally unpretentious wines, of course, but some have been exceptionally good values, in my opinion. So, I was back for trying another. There it was up on the top shelf and boldly proclaimed as "The Big Red Monster," California Red Wine 2010. The bottle presented  a lot of hype about how good it tasted and how bold it was, but it didn't show any information about the grape varieties used in the brewing of the wine. Well, I should have known better than to buy. It just doesn't live up to the hype. It's not a bad wine at all. I'd say it compares favorably with many California reds that cost about five to six dollars a bottle. It tastes a little young, and is not really distinct in any way. Other much better reds are available for the same price.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I used this mousse with approx. 1/3 cup of pumpkin and unsweetened So Delicious coconut milk (50 calories/cup) to make a wonderful pumpkin dessert (also added a good 1.5 tsp cinnamon and a dash of pumpkin spice to the mix). Result was fantastic! Light and delicate flavor praised by guests. I then tried this out with a high quality cocoa powder and non-dairy milk to make a chocolate variation. (I prefer adding my own cocoa powder to many desserts to intensify the chocolate flavors and also lessen the cloying sweetness of mass produced mixes) Again, results were wonderful. I will definitely keep this on hand for entertaining. While the plain vanilla flavor is fine on its own, I think that what makes this product truly great is its versatility. It can be assembled very easily and is an elegant and delicious way to end any meal. I would definitely recommend this brand.

Although I am not a fan of flax, it DOES provide a delicious nutty flavor when I use the right amount (like 2-4 tbs in a recipe).  It's also nutritious and contains omegas, so that's another reason why I love using it.  I think it tastes great in recipes using peanut butter, maple or chocolate.

review/text: I bought these for a "candy bar" for a holiday party.  They were a great hit!  I would purchase again.  The sprinkles on the outside are salty and the sweet salty is excellent.

review/summary: Lovely Coffee from these Pods
review/text: I love chocolate coffee but I hate the sticky sweet of adding syrup.  These are great because they have lots of chocolate aroma and flavor but also lots of great coffee flavor comes through.

review/summary: Plastic Taste
review/text: Normally love this product and was excited about the individual packaging, HOWEVER, the cookies had a funny plastic-like taste to them.  Wondering if the plastic in the packaging off-gassed into the product.  Blek.

review/summary: Typical sub-par Hershey chocolate
review/text: I can not understand why people think Hershey's chocolate is so great.  It's waxy, salty tasting and has a texture like sandpaper.  Pure garbage.  Ship this stuff overseas and it'll sit on shelves with the other chocolate laughing at it for being the poor chocolate child made from ratty scraps.  I've been to Hershey, PA and think that town is lucky they came around when we didn't have the ability to go out and buy a good chocolate bar elsewhere.  Awful, awful chocolate.

review/summary: Wonderful chocolate
review/text: Definitely something to have around the house - quick bite to sate that craving (one or two folks, don't indulge too much) but even a single piece will make you smile!<br /><br />Wonderful taste - if you buy them, share them with those you love! :)

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: We spent the day in Chicago shopping and stopped at the Hershey's store. Picked up a bag of these to try. Got home, tasted them and found out they were fantastic. I wish they would have been giving samples of these in the store; as I would have picked up more bags than one. Can't find them in the local stores. LOVE THESE!!!

review/summary: An alternative to gluten type pasta
review/text: a great alternative to gluten. beaware that although it says Quinoa, it does contain corn....so if you are sensitive to corn, then it's not a good choice.<br /><br />When cooked, it holds shape...does not get mushy.  it does have a different texture than regular pasta. it's worth a try to see if it works for you.
