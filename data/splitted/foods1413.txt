review/summary: Great for sensitive stomachs
review/text: I have been using this food for over 4 years.  After researching a number of foods and experimenting with dozens, I found that the less is more approach worked well for my dog.  The ingredients are great and this food has rated TOPs in the Whole Dog Journal list for an equal amount of time.  The barley seems to be a much better choice than rice for my dog.  He loves the taste and I can even use this kibble for treats.  I do add water and occasionally supplement with ground vegtables.  My dog didn't do well on raw.  This lower fat, moderate protein combination is the best.  I am pleased that it is being offered on Amazon.com.

review/summary: Super tasty Mochi available in the US!
review/text: Mochi is a rice cake made out of sweet rice, which is very sticky rice. Eden's Mochi is made of sprouted brown rice, which is famous for its health benefit. The ingredients for this super tasty mochi is only sweet brown rice. It's fairly expensive, but it's pretty expensive anyways if you buy white mochi that is not too healthy but okay. It comes with the benefit of brown rice, such as Thiamin B1, Niacin B3, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Zinc, Iron, and Manganese. Very easy to make this super food by just put a cake on a sheet of aluminum foil in the oven toaster and bake it at 425F for about 5~7 minutes. When you see it's puffed up, then it's done! Take it out, wrap it with a sheet of Nori (seaweed sheet), and use soy sauce or Liquid Amino as the dipping sauce. It makes fast breakfast that is super nutritious! You could eat this super delicious Mochi with cinnamon & sugar, which makes it very healthy and tasty desert. I buy this using Amazon's subscription program and never let it run out in our household.

review/summary: oishii!!!
review/text: This was my first time trying mochi and I loved it. I decided to try brown rice mochi because its fairly healthier than typical mochi, but I was worried that it wouldn't be as good. I was wrong, this mochi has a nice "nutty" or "toasted" flavor. The texture is excellent, when you bake or fry  mochi it becomes chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I tried the mochi baked which was very good, I made mochi crust pizza- I almost liked it better than regular pizza and I attempted to make zanzai, however I think that you need white mochi for that recipe because the brown rice mochi didn't hold up as well. Regardless of that this is an excellent product, and I highly recommend it to those who like mochi and those who have not tried it.

review/summary: As good as fresh mochi!
review/text: I love mochi but it's really a long, difficult process to make it from scratch.  I usually buy brown rice mochi in the refrigerated section and it's very good.  However, this doesn't need to be refrigerated so it can be stored in a cupboard until you want to use it.  It says it must be refrigerated after opening but I never have any left over!  It cooks up quickly to a puffy, chewy neutral sort of nutty flavor and you can dip it in jam or maple syrup as a desert, or dip it in salsa or guacamole or other dips for something more savory.  They suggest on the carton to try grating it like cheese over vegetables which I will definitely try.  This is truly a guilt free treat!  It doesn't get much healthier than brown rice and this is a delicious way to enjoy it.

review/text: It's not easy to make Mochi at home from scratch. Mochi is a great substitute if you are trying to get away from sugary sweets. As others have mentioned it is a quick and easy breakfast wrapped in a sheet of Nori......very satisfying. As I age, I seem to be getting lazier, but do not want to sacrifice quality in my life. This is a simple to prepare food.....sushi too.

review/text: This is an exquisite thick, sweet, aged balsamic vinegar. When I traveled to Rome this spring, I was hoping to buy aged balsamic vinegar.  Actually, considering the exchange rate, the price through Amazon is better than buying in Italy.<br /><br />Given its sophisticated taste, you need just a little to make a huge difference in the taste of whatever food you decide to pamper.  If you have only experienced watery supermarket balsamic vinegar, you will be in for a wonderful treat with Fattoria Estense.

It does not have the thick sweet quality of the Gran Riserva.  The Gran Riserva you could easily serve on ice cream - this, no.

review/text: I never even use balsamic vinegar in my daily food repetoire, but I tried a sample of this at Sur la Table and oh boy. This was unbelievably good.  It can certainly be used by itself as a salad dressing, sans oil, for a low cal but delicious alternative.  The flavor is thick, sweet and sour, but the sourness isn't harsh. You could literally sip it straight.  I flinched a little at the price (they sell it for $29 at Sur La Table) but I bought it because it's that good.<br /><br />I'd like to know how much lead it has though.

review/text: I have yet to try this product personally, because it is not currently available at our supermarket. But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/summary: No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts
review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.

review/text: Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a "sweet" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/summary: Fab, as long as you understand what's in them!
review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

review/summary: Good enough!
review/text: For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

review/text: I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!

review/text: Good cookies. They're made with Splenda. I guess that makes them sugarfree. They certainly don't taste like they are. I despise the taste of fake sweetners, but the folks at this company did a great job. The cookies are very yummy! I only gave it four stars, because I prefer soft  and chewy oatmeal cookies.

review/summary: wonderful alternative
review/text: My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/summary: Big Chocolate Taste
review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/summary: This stuff is Amazing!
review/text: I bought Sambal Ulek Chili Paste looking for a Chili paste that was Gluten, Soy, Milk and Corn Free, which it is.  YEA! These seasonings mixed together with Apple Cider Vinegar are just AMAZING in taste.  I have used this Chili Paste 3 times now in 3 of my recipes that required Chili Paste.  WOW! What a Wonderful Taste it brings to Vegetables or a Main Dish.  AND it's really easy to make the paste by adding Apple Cider Vinegar and letting it set in the refrigerator for one hour before using.  I sold on this product, and will continue to buy for right now, because there is NOT another product out there that I can use at this time.  Most Chili paste, even if they are Gluten free, they are NOT Corn Free or Soy Free.  So, even know this is a very pricey product this chili paste is AMAZING in TASTE and deserves 5 STARS, so that's why I am continuing to buy this product.  Another really nice thing about Sambal Ulek Chili Paste, every time I buy despite the price 25% goes to selected charities to help children without homes.  That's really cool!  So, in some ways, I'm helping whenever I buy this product and it's a worthy cause.  So for right now, I will overlook the price, which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.  Maybe if enough of us buy Sambal Ulek Chili Paste the price will go down.  But in the meantime, I will suffer the cost, because one (1) the Taste is Marveous and two (2) 25% goes to helping children that need it.  Thanks Sambel Ulek for making a wonderful tangy Chili Paste that I can cook with and thank you for caring about the homeless children!!!!

review/summary: Best price I could find
review/text: Amazon had the cheapest price I could find on a per-ounce basis.  I checked other online retailers and bricks-and-mortar stores including the warehouse clubs like Costco.  Most places came in at around $0.28/ounce while the Amazon price works out to $0.20/ounce.  That may not sound like much till you realize Amazon is almost 30% cheaper.  In this case, you save almost $28!  I was really surprised.  The prime shipping made it a slam-dunk.  Having eaten two boxes, I can confirm this is the real thing and not some dated/generic thing.  The only downside is that the box is bigger than the standard grocery-store size and you get 14 of them.  But for $28, I can deal with that.

review/summary: Beware peanut allergy
review/text: I love ThinkThin bars, but just a warning here. There's no clear marking on this flavor to indicate that it contains peanuts. The last ingredient in the fine print is peanut flour and it sent my son into a tailspin. I'm a very careful consumer on that front and ultimately, I should have known, but their other non-peanut butter flavors are just fine. So heads up.

review/summary: Great tasting for a health food bar...
review/text: I typically get the brownie crunch flavor, but happened to grab one of these white chocolate chip bars by accident.  It was a good accident.  These are really good.  I actually think I like them better than the brownie crunch. I usually don't like anything white chocolate because it's overly sweet, but this isn't.  I typically buy my bars at whole foods, but they are quite expensive.  I may start buying them on amazon.  Only downside is that you can't pick and choose what you'd like in a box on amazon.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The ingredients seem pretty good as well.  Nothing screams to me as a scary lab created chemical.  It's got a good amount of fiber, lots of protein and no added sugar or fake sugar (a big pet peeve of mine). It tastes very good in comparison to some other "healthy protein bars" out there that taste like chalk and smell like feet.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />It does have more calories and carbs than I would like to see in this size bar. 240 calories & a whopping 27 grams of carbs.

review/summary: The best flavor of all of them
review/text: The White Chocolate is the most moist and best tasting flavor (in mine and my husbands opinion at least) and I will only be ordering this flavor for now on.  I have Celiac Disease and I'm a Type 1 diabetic and also a model and a Las vegas Showgirl so I have to eat healthy, stay fit and look great and these bars are the best for helping at least me, do just that.  They are Gluten free which is the best thing and absolutely balanced.  My husband who is a very picky doctor who likes these over his past favorite Zone bars.  Thank you Think products for making these bars!

review/summary: Pretty decent tasting low-carb bar with good nutritional profile
review/text: I'm a big fan of nutrition bars as a convenient snack or meal substitute in a pinch and this bar is delicious! This was my first thinkThin bar and I found it interesting for a few reasons. The bar is enrobed by a thin layer of what looks like white chocolate. The bar itself is chewy, soft and possesses a cake-like texture which I enjoyed. It had the right amount of sweetness for me and the flavor profile is quite simple and straightforward; nothing spicy or tricky. The only thing I disliked about the bar was the slightly synthetic-tasting white chocolate flavor, but it was not so terrible that I wouldn't eat it again. I would definitely be interested in trying out the other flavors when I get a chance.

review/summary: Celiacs/Gluten Free buyers beware!!
review/text: Purchased approximately 24 of these bars in different flavors (the chocolate fudge being my personal favorite, though the brownie crunch is also tasty).  The texture is a bit chewy but the flavor is good...for a protein bar.  Not necessarily on par with the average sugar-filled candy bar of course.  The carb/sugar/protein content is on par with most higher end Gluten Free protein bars I've discovered (including Quest Bars and NoGii).<br /><br />All things considered - flavor, consistency, and quality, I'd likely give these 4 stars.  The issue, however, is that after eating about 6 bars with no issues, I began having gluten reactions to the next three I attempted to eat.  Needless to say, no matter how much protein you consume, your workouts are not going to go well if you're horribly sick.<br /><br />I have written to the company to complain, but cannot afford to take this risk, especially with other comparable bars available.  I caution anyone with Celiac Disease to try these at your own risk, they say GLUTEN FREE on the label, but something was not or a batch became contaminated.  I've been a diagnosed Celiac for over 10 years and I (unfortunately) know the reaction all too well and this bar sparked it.<br /><br />Although I wanted to support this bar for it's high protein content and GF label, I will not buy Think Thin bars again for this reason.  I've moved to Quest Protein Bars for now as I've never had any gluten or allergic reactions to those (and they tend to taste better if you like an almond/caramel type flavor) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00418OR56">Quest Bar 2.12 oz. Low Carb, Gluten Free, High Fiber Protein Bars (Box of 12 Bars)</a> - though you'd likely want to buy these from the actual site as they are much cheaper there.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you have no food allergies or specific dietary constraints, these might work for you...good luck!

review/text: I think if you need a gluten free diet this bar is for you.  But if you can eat wheat, I prefer Zone Bars (Mint) better.  I bought these after all of the good reviews but when I ate it-it didn't taste like white chocolate at all and the texture is a little gross (sorry).  It also is good for fighting hunger, but so are Zone Bars so I think I will stick with them.

review/text: The one thing I do not like is the chemical aftertaste I get. But, I know this is what all bars of this type taste like this. I like the variety of flavors these bars come in and the convenience. The high protein makes it a good snack to tide me over until I can eat a meal. But it takes me 45 minutes to eat an entire bar because it is so sweet. I think I will stick to more natural snacks. I would buy these again though if they were on sale. I do appreciate the many products out there for people like me with celiac.

review/summary: Good, but by locally, if possible
review/text: ThinkThin are the best-tasting of the low-carb and gluten-free protein bars, in my opinion. They are now available at many more stores than when I ordered a box from Amazon awhile ago. And they are much cheaper at every store I've been to than the online price. At even Whole Foods, I typically pay $1.69 per bar, and get a slight discount for buying an entire box. Once you add shipping to Amazon's prices, they are more expensive online. Also, keep in mind the season when ordering them. All of the coatings had melted and were stuck to the packaging, then fell off in pieces when opened, due to having melted during shipment. But if you can get them locally, give them a try. There are many flavors to choose from, though most stores seem to only carry a few.<br /><br />Those people who claim they are awful tasting probably haven't tried other protein bars that are low-carb and gluten-free, and expect them to taste like candy bars or high-sugar bars that may be more tasty, but are also full of ingredients that render them nutritionally useless.

I ordered them along with a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006W20AFA">Quest Bar 100% Natural Chocolate Peanut Butter</a>, and find I prefer the taste (though it's still not that strong) and texture (very chewy) of the Quest bars.  Also, the Quest bars have 150 calories, 45 calories from fat, and 17 grams of fiber to the Think Thin bars' 240 calories, 80 calories from fat, and 1 gram of fiber.  I find the two bars equally filling - and the Quest bars' all natural ingredients are also more appealing.<br /><br />No more Think Thin bars.  It's the Quest bars I'm reordering - in several different flavors.

You feel full for at least three hours after eating one, so they work very well as a diet aid.<br /><br />The Atkins bars are very delicious too, and easier to find here. But, they are not as high in protein and don't keep you full as long as these Think Thin bars do.

review/summary: Favorite Gluten Free Protien Bar I've  Found to Date
review/text: I've found protein supplementing a necessity having a diet of pretty much only veggies and fruit [and candy]. I devastated when I found out that I needed to go gluten free because it pretty much cut out any protein bar I could stand eating every day.<br /><br />Then I found these.<br /><br />These taste great and have the protein I need. Their texture is a bit chewy, but still in the range of a yummy bar. I guess I just miss having a crunch in my diet [note: they're crunch bars are great, but they have a little too much fiber for my digestive system]. I've got to say, these certainly don't taste like white chocolate, but they are delicious. I think the branding in this company just decided to call this bar white chocolate, because thinkthin has another chocolate flavor and this one has a more complex flavor symphony working for it that would deter from the title of simply chocolate.<br /><br />I do wish they had a little more nutritional value in them, but I shouldn't ask for too much when flavor is more of my concern in a protein bar. They've got a little calcium and iron, so I'm happy. Especially when I compare their 230 calories to my old bar of 320 that had the same amount of protein [and a lot more nutritional content].<br /><br />These are also quite affordable when you buy the case [compared to the other gluten-free bars.]. I've been eating a least one a day and slowly over the past 10 months I've watched my lanky muscles grow into what they should be as a daily biker and intense artist who's apt to throw their whole body in their work.
