review/text: My 5 month old LOVES these mixtures. Great job ELLAS I promised I would never feed him something that I wouldn't eat myself. They ALL taste good. I would eat any of them if I was so inclined to eat a pureed meal. They are easy to pack & throw in the diaper back/suit case for travel. I had no worry about them leaking (like a small plastic tupperware). The price is right, shipping was quick, and they store really well in the pantry in the ready made box. Happy Baby = Happy Mommy

review/summary: My Toddler Vegetable Snob is a BIG Fan!
review/text: These little pouches are great for toddlers who refuse to eat their vegetables in the conventional way. My son started getting picky around 18 months and I was on the verge of desperation when I found these at BRU. (They are also carried at a certain big box store that has a bulls eye logo.) Yes, they are marketed for babies, and are almost two bucks a pop, but my son ALWAYS finishes these pouches, which is more than I can say for most things he eats, and I feel much better knowing he ingested something green! Yay for Ella's kitchen! Oh. and I also recommend the pumpkin version. Super yummy!

review/text: I have an 11 month and 3.5 year old. These pouches make for a great yummy snack. My kids love to eat them right out of the pouch. My older child eats her whole veggies and also these pouches. My baby, is not a huge veggie fan like my eldest.. she loves these however. When I cook for the baby if I don't hide the veggies well, she will reject the meal. So, when I can't get my baby to eat the organic veggies I have made or when I need a quick snack while shopping or out and about, Ella's takes great care of us! Def a must have. Oh, I just give my baby the whole tube and she sucks it all out.. great for the baby who had always refused me feeding her.

Yeah it is kind of expensive but if your child loves it then I would buy it for the child. They do go on sale too. If you have WIC ( Women , Infant and Children) You can buy these from Target Because only Target carry these here. I am not sure if Amazon accepts WIC.  Over all a great product I would recommend it.

review/summary: I thought granulated was not powder
review/text: I was hoping for true granulated garlic and not pulverized powder.  Well I was a bit disappointed when I received this powder.  The reason I wanted true granules is that they retain the garlic flvor much longer than powder.  In the year or so that it will take me to use this, i think the flavor will be gone - unlike true granulated garlic which holds the flavor much longer.  Fool me once -- but don't get fooled again.

review/text: I bought the 2-pack of this product as I love to use garlic but hate peeling the stuff, so I use garlic powder extensively in my cooking. I bought this product thinking, wow this will last a long time and since it's Durkee it must be good !<br /><br />This product is so salty that it ruined a whole pot of all-beef chili that I just made which is a terrible waste of time and money.<br /><br />I have used garlic powder for years and because I need to restrict my salt intake, I have avoided garlic salt for those same years which is easy to do when the product is properly marked.<br /><br />Since lots of people like garlic salt, I don't know why Durkee didn't just market this product as garlic salt which trust me, it is.  And salty garlic salt at that.<br /><br />If you're a garlic lover like me, avoid this product like the plague.

I like high fiber foods (gives my poop chute a workout) and this is a good source of fiber! I also like the fact that it's relatively easy to make and cooking equipment consists of only a small stove pot that is easily washable so you dont have to spend longer cleaning dishes. It is also low calorie and 1/2 cup is 100 calories! When I first dumped it into my stove pan it made an embarrassing 'glump' sound (soylent green) and looked and sort of smelled like dog food, but I ate it and it was delicious!<br /><br />*and to the above reviewer it would help if you actually deleted your review, rewrote it (copy/paste)and gave it the appropriate star number so people arent mislead. Alot of times people dont read the reviews and its only fair to the product makers.

review/summary: Goat Milk Avoids Bovine Caso-morphin-7 Health Problems
review/text: Whether you like goat milk or cow milk is a matter of taste (I somewhat prefer cow milk in a carton over  goat milk made by adding water to  this powder).<br /><br /> However, there is a strong reason for preferring goat milk. Namely that it appears healthier for you and your children. This is that goat milk in the human study does not produce bovine caso-morphin-7 (BCM-7). This  peptide is produced by digestion of all of the cow milk available in the US. It is not produced by goat milk (or human milk).<br /><br /> There are a number of conditions for which bovine casomorphin-7  seems to play a role, including atherosclerosis (and hence heart disease and strokes), Type 1 diabetes, schizophrenia, autism, milk intolerance (not due to lactose intolerance) and sudden infant death syndrome.<br /><br /> The source for the above information is Woodford's recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603581022">Devil in the Milk: Illness, Health and the Politics of A1 and A2 Milk</a>.  Amazon lets you read significant fractions by searching with the keywords for what interests you, although I suggest buying the book and reading the full evidence.<br /><br /> While the milk of not all cows produce BCM-7 when digested, in the US milk free from these problems can not be bought(such milk can be bought in New Zealand and Australia). Thus, for those that wish to protect themselves and their children, the alternatives are to avoid cow milk (substituting something else, such as breast milk for babies), or use goat milk. Fortunately, calcium or other nutrients in milk can be obtained from foods other than milk. If we wish to consume milk, goat milk is the most available alternative for most outside of New Zealand and Australia.<br /><br /> However, goat milk is available in only a few stores, and these may not be near you. In these cases, a powdered goat milk, or a canned goat milk may be the healthy alternative. Powdered is cheaper than canned. If you do not anticipate using large amounts, having it in these 4 ounce packages will reduce the risk of the powder going bad before being used.

review/summary: LOVE this goat's milk - GREAT in coffee . . .
review/text: I am gluten-intolerant.  When I travel, I sometimes have a hard time finding a good, gluten-free protein source.  The individual packets pack and travel easily.  If you enjoy the flavor of goat's milk, you will love the convenience of the powered version.<br /><br />I especially love to use Meyenburg Powered Goat's Milk in my coffee instead of artificial creamers.  It is healthy, rich and delicious.<br /><br />Tip:  The milk may clump a bit when you add it to coffee or water.  Use a wire wisk to mix it and it will be fine . . . OR if you really want to make it easy,  try using a battery-operated frother -- put a little coffee in a mug, add powder, whip it. (Bodum makes a frother as does Aerolatte Moo).  Be sure to leave LOTS of room in the mug when you froth -- it makes a latte-like froth that grows as you whip it.  After frothing, add the rest of your coffee.  HEAVEN!

review/summary: Packaging make things easy
review/text: I really love the goat milk powders from Meyenberg. Their website said these are healthier and non-BGH contaminated. It does not have all that strong flavor of goat cheese. The individual packaging really make things easy. Now I can just use one pack without worrying how to keep the rest in the can. However, the description of the product is very confusing.<br /><br />"Pack of twelve, 4-ounce each (total of 36 ounces)"<br /><br />Come on, people, I am not sure if I am smarter than a 5th grader, but a simple math like that? That's not even 5th grade. Besides, the Chinese make a small durable device called the "calculator", which is also available on amazon.com.

review/summary: Affordable goat milk!
review/text: I love to feed my kids with goat milk. But to buy it fresh from the farm is so expensive, so this is a great substitute. I started my kids on this when I stopped nursing and they've loved it ever since. They eat it in their cereal and drink it straight from the cup. I think goat's milk is the next best thing to breast milk!

review/summary: For Vanilla lovers
review/text: My husband actually did not like this flavor, but he isn't that big into Vanilla.  However, my in-laws raved!  They may actually buy a Senseo based on trying ours.  They didn't want to drink all of our coffee, but we said go ahead since my husband didn't like it.  They must have had 3 cups each of this coffee, it was like they couldn't get enough.  I suggest that you actually try any Senseo flavor by buying one pack at the store first to see if you like the flavor.  If you do, come back to Amazon and order in bulk to save you money.  $3.84 at Walmart for a package of 10 pods = .38 each.  Here it is only .25 a cup of coffee at the current price.

review/summary: If you own a senseo machine you HAVE TO USE THESE PODS!
review/text: I have owned and used a Senseo home brew machine now for over 6 months. By far this system witht the senseo pods, makes the best cup of coffee that I have ever had at home. I find myself hording the genuine pods for myself and special guests. My Other guests are served turkish ground Starbucks coffee in an adaptor.<br /><br />The difference between the genuine pods and the others is the amount of froth that is generateed and the smoothness of the coffee.  to date, all of the other brands that I have tried (Java pods and Maxwell house) leave less than a 1/2" of froth and an after taste/sour note.<br /><br />I like these pods as they impart a lovely vanilla note that is slightly nutty. The froth is about 3/4" thick.  Typically I use 2 pods and create the large amount of coffee. 2 vanilla bistro pods have the stregth of 2 mild regular pods. This makes for a lovely middle of the day coffee but does not have the needed early morning kick/strength.

review/text: I absolutely love my Senseo, but the thing I had always been waiting for was options beyond Mild, Medium and Dark Roast coffee. Every now and then I need a different kick from my coffee and until now it wasn't a possibility.<br /><br />The Vanilla Bistro variety doesn't necessarily provide a kick, but its vanilla flavor does provide an occasional welcome switch from the monotony of black coffee. Of the three new varieties of flavored coffee for the Senseo this is my second favorite behind the Irish Cream.

review/text: I love my Senseo, and I am thrilled to have flavor options for it.  Personally I am not much for flavored coffee, and I prefer the dark roast, and that is what I drink myself most of the time.  One of my favorite things about the Senseo is how easy it is to make everyone a different cup of coffee.  The decaf folks can have decaf, the regular can have regular.  Now the ones who like flavor can have flavor.  I will definitely always have the flavored Senseo Pods in stock in our home so that we have them to offer guests.  They love it.<br /><br />I like this vanilla over others I have tasted because the vanilla flavor is not overwhelming and it doesn't make the coffee seem too sweet.  Overall I am pleased.

review/summary: Decent for a pre-ground coffee
review/text: Now keep in mind that I'm kind of a coffee snob, but I rarely have time to grind and press my own coffee.  I use the Senseo pods simply for convenience sake.  And since they have different flavors, I figured I'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now Senseo coffee in general tends to be better than most any store pre-ground, canned, or mass produced brand, like Folgers or Maxwell House.  But that's not saying a whole lot.  I find these to be kind of bitter, but the one saving grace is that I like the frothy finish.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the inconsistency.  When I initially wrote this review, I was drinking my first package that came in a four-pack.  It actually tasted kind of fresh, and I liked it.  However, the next two packages were quite stale.  I have now tried a different brand of coffee pod which really blows this one out of the water.<br /><br />One to help make better coffee with your Senseo coffee maker:  Don't brew as soon as the red light stops flashing.  Let it warm up a few more minutes before you hit the brew button.<br /><br />Also, there are some pretty good pods out there, and they are not expensive.  You can even get fair trade and organic blends along with single origin coffees.  Shop around.  The Senseo brand pods are about the worst pods I've tried, but since they are better than Folgiers, I give them two stars.

review/text: Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee Pods are extremely hard to find in our area...therefore I love that I can get them from Amazon...3 to 5 days after ordering!  And I save money by having a standard order that ships as often as I want them to come!  Love the coffee...love Amazon!

review/summary: Flavorless French Vanilla
review/text: The only taste you will get from these pods are faint vanilla.  You need two pods to make a cup of coffee and even with the two pods it does not taste like coffee.  It tastes like watered down coffee with a fake vanilla flavoring.

review/summary: Senseo pod review
review/text: I bought a 4 pack of the Senseo Paris French Vanilla Caramel Bistro pods. They were pretty weak, and so could not make more than a 4 oz cup of coffee, which I actually stopped filling after 3 oz or so. It was ok, just very weak. Probably will not buy again.

review/text: I started drinking the French Vanilla coffee awhile back, once to twice a day, but then my local Wal-Mart stopped selling it!  I was furious, but luckily found it on Amazon.  This is the ONLY coffee I will drink, and combined with some Splenda and sugar free french vanilla creamer, it is OH SO YUMMY!

review/text: We were looking for our Senseo Rio coffee pads when we came across the senseo Paris. At first we didnt like the taste too much but after a little while we got used to it. Now we order the coffee on a regular bases and like it very much. But if I ever find my german Rio again - I switch back..... For now were happy!

review/summary: Not the best pod!
review/text: I was disappointed by this pod. The coffee is weak.  No real zing to it.  If you like rich, full bodied coffee flavour in your coffee this is not for you.  The vanilla flavour in it is okay but just not enough coffee for me.  I'm sticking to my dark roast pods.

review/text: I prefer flavored coffees and this one has been quite good.  The flavor is just enough - not too oppressive and not too mild.  I have also tried the Vienna and Kilarny and have enjoyed those too.  In comparison to the Maxwell House Hazelnut, these are superior.  The Maxwell House Hazelnut was almost devoid of flavor and quite weak, even though it was well before its expiry date and I had just opened the package.  I like this well enough to make sure I keep it stocked in my kitchen.

review/text: Douwe Egberts coffee is one of the best I've ever tasted, and this Paris Bistro Vanilla flavor coffee pod for the Senseo is absolutely flavorful!  I don't know what that other reviewer was tasting when she said it was flat - perhaps Maxwell House?  This is definitely NOT flat, and has a great roasted flavor.

review/text: I would definitely recommend these coffee pods.  Senseo pods are very easy to use and they make quick, fabulous coffee.  They are especially useful to me because I live alone so making a whole pot of coffee is generally a waste.  With the vanilla pods, you can have flavored coffee with the same convenience and quality.  In my opinion, they are delicious.

review/text: I have shared all three Senseo flavored coffees with several people at work. Everyone loves the smell of the coffees but many of us would prefer a stronger coffee flavor.<br /><br />Overall, it is nice to be able to offer a choice of flavors to people visiting my office and the convenience can't be beat. My personal favorite is still the dark roast.

review/summary: HORRIBLE I WANT MY MONEY BACK
review/text: I purchased these pods on Amazon because they were a good deal and a dollar cheaper than in my grocwery store and now I know why.  When I open the package I noticed that the Senseo watermark was very faint and hardly visable.  When I made the coffee, it took me 3X the pods to make a decent cup of coffee. What's the point of making pod coffee if you have to stand there all day to make a good cup.  I am back to buying pods at the local store now.

review/summary: Good Coffee, But Not Available
review/text: I understand that it is not Amazon's fault about the Senseo Coffee Pod unavailability. This will probably be my last Senseo Paris French Vanilla Subscribe and Save purchase.  In fact, this is probably my last purchase of anything with the Philips-Senseo brand name.  My Senseo is now making coffee that tastes and smells "Burnt." The vinegar solution helped but the "burnt" smell is back. However, this is definitely not my last purchase from Amazon. Quite the contrary, I have my eye on a Hamilton Beach Single-Serve Stainless Steel Coffee Maker where I can start grinding my own coffee beans again. I got away from that with my Senseo and I apologize to the people who know what they are really doing to make a fine cup of coffee. I'm returning to good taste, and good coffee, after a long lazy spell.
