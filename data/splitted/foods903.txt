review/summary: My diabetic dog LOVES these cookies!
review/text: I have been purchasing diabetic cookies from The Old Dog Cookie Company for my 13 year old rhodesian/doberman for the last 6 years.  She was diagnosed with diabetes 7 years ago and has to take 2 shots of insulin a day.  I was so thrilled to find a treat for her that is homemade of natural products for diabetic dogs,  as there is nothing else like it out there!  (And even if there was, I would never stop buying from them as they are the nicest, kindest people I've ever met - by phone as I live in California and they're in Maine!).  Oh and by the way my dog Princess LOVES them!!  P.S., I buy the 5lb bulk as I have a large dog and they last longer.

review/summary: Melts in your mouth
review/text: I remember these wafers as a young girl and haven't found any other sugar creme wafer to compare. Other sugar wafers have a harder, thicker wafer that almost scratches the roof of your mouth. These have a very thin wafer that is simply holding the melt in your mouth creme filling together. One bite and you are hooked, you eat the whole pack! They stay crispy and fresh because they are packaged with 3 packs inside each box. They are a great snack by themselves or served with sherbet or crumbled on ice cream for a dessert.

review/summary: Wonderful Wafers
review/text: .<br /><br />My wife has been a fan of wafer cookies for many years.  Recently I bought her a box of wafers from a different brand.  I hoped to  surprise her.<br /><br />My wife accepted the other cookies but explained they were not the ones she had when she was young. A disappointment for me, but she did enjoy the cookies. I wondered if  the cookies she had as a child existed anymore.  Then I encountered Biscos.<br /><br />These cookies taste good and make a pleasant snack. I enjoyed them myself, but in limited servings.<br /><br />These wafers are 140 calories a serving, according to the rating website I found. The serving size is 8 cookies - I limit myself to 4.<br />At four cookies I get 70 calories 11g of carbs, 7g of sugar and 12 mg of sodium.<br />So from a nutrition point of view, 4 of these cookies are best I have found.<br /><br />I highly recommend Biscos Sugar Wafers. They are a nice treat.

There's nothing that I can't think of that I can't find on Amazon and their prices are always competitive at the very least and often times, cheaper than when found on other merchant sights. As for the product. Nabisco stopped making these Biscos some time ago and due to an increased demand, they began making them again. Amazon was the ONLY place I could find them.

review/text: I have been looking for fruit snacks that are free of dyes. I saw these and thought they would be a possible remedy. I couldn't believe that for 16.25, I only got one box and the contents were 5 little packets. For a toddler even though he's worth it, it would be a great expense just for a snack. If my math is right, each little packet cost 3.25. That to me is outrageous unless I'm missing something. I can't complain about the taste or anything else. I won't be buying them again. I will look somewhere else....

review/text: With 200 mg of caffeine per can this stuff is like liquid energy. I consider myself fairly resistant to the effects of caffeine, but I definitely notice an extra spring in my step after knocking back one of these. But it's not a jittery buzz, which I like. Not all of the flavors are a big win, I prefer the green tea varieties to the carbonated soda-like ones. But I enjoy them all and I would buy again. As for the claim that it actually burns calories I have no idea. I haven't used this as a workout supplement, just as an afternoon pick-me-up alternative to coffee.

review/summary: These Will Get You Moving - Highly Recommended
review/text: Celsius Calorie Burner Drinks are every bit (or more so) as energizing as any of the other energy drinks (Monster, AMP, etc), but they have the added benefit of also being good tasting! This "Variety Pack" contains several flavors, but the Sparkling Cola is my favorite as it has a crisp ginger taste that I really like and makes it very refreshing, especially when served very cold. The other flavors are: Green Tea Peach Mango (good), Green Tea Raspberry Acai (not my favorite), Sparkling Orange (very good), Sparkling Wild Berry (good), and Sparkling Ginger Ale (very good).<br /><br />While I can't really confirm that these actually burns 100 Calories just by drinking a whole can, it certainly would not surprise me since this does pack a serious kick. I now drink a can of this about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.<br /><br />A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking "too much" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my teenage son tried one before his workout and got "jittery". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the cans are made of very thin aluminum and are prone to ripping if you crush them, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, these are a very good tasting energy drinks that really do get you moving!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Pretty good, fairly priced
review/text: My regular energy drink is RockStar, which I feel gives a great deal of energy. The downside to it is alot of bloating though, along with enough sugar to literally rot your teeth right out of your mouth if you drink it regularly.<br /><br />I saw this variety pack of Celsius on sale here at Amazon and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Some flavors are better than others, so the variety pack is the way to go so that you can decide which ones you like or don't like.<br /><br />Green Tea Peach mango was pretty good and I don't even like teas in general, so that was surprising to me.<br /><br />Green Tea Raspberry Acai was yummy. Tasted like a good tea with a touch of sweet berry taste.<br /><br />Sparkling Orange tasted sort of like a diet orange soda. It felt/tasted like it had a tad of carbonation too, even though none of these are really carbonated.<br /><br />Sparkling Wildberry was pretty good too. Sort of a not too sweet berry flavor.<br /><br />Sparkling Cola was so-so. Sort of like drinking a semi-flat, not so sweet soda. Not terrible, but not my pick of the litter either. reminded me a little of the one sip taste I had of Red Bull.<br /><br />Sparkling Ginger Ale was pretty good. Again, sort of like drinking a semi-flat version, but still good.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I seemed to notice different amounts of energy with the different flavors, too. I don't know if that was "all in my head" or not.<br /><br />The cans are smaller than RockStar or Monster cans, but they do give a little bit of energy. I do not feel as bloated when I drink Celsius, that's for sure. As for the calorie burning claim, I can't say as I believe in that. I think that the only way it could burn 100 calories is simply by you having the extra energy to be slightly more active and therefore burn an extra 100 calories as opposed to not drinking it and not having the energy to get up and do something. I do not beieve at all that if you drink Celsius, then sit on your butt it will magically burn 100 calories. I don't think any product can do that.<br /><br />Overall, I do recommend these, especially for the cost savings as compared to buying RockStar etc. The flavors are pretty good and the energy level was pretty satisfactory. I have tried alot of energy drinks and this is one that I can say I did feel an energy boost with. There was no crash later in the day either, which is great.

review/summary: This Works!
review/text: If you don't know what flavor to get just get this. It will last you a month. This is different that your avergage spike and crash energy drink. Sure Red Bull is fun and gets you wired, but it's loaded with sugar! Ailments of America is from all the sugar we consume. Celsius has no sugar, that's what I like. It tastes better than any diet make-your-eyeball-bleed or get-massive-migraine aspartame loaded drinks (I hate the taste of diet drinks by the way). NO crash. The energy is sustainable and pleasant for the whole day. But if you do load up on other caffeine products it might make you jittery.<br /><br />I would recommend dieters stick with one product at a time. This does help you go a longer and it also helps you take your fitness more seriously. At first you may drink it and feel the need to clean your home. Then you may feel like you should work out until you can't do anymore. Instead of doing that I would recommend pushing your weights to be heavier and increase your speed on your miles. You will enjoy the results.<br /><br />Oh and if you enjoy a pizza or spicey food once in a while, this can take place of your soda knowing that you are actually helping your metabolism. My friends have told me my face looks thinner like I've lost 10 lbs. I've drank this for less than a month.

review/summary: Energy boosting assistance for your workouts
review/text: Celsius is a product that I've been using faithfully for 15 months to assist me in my fitness goals.  It is a great product, but it's not a miracle product.  It won't make you leaner, faster, stronger, better looking, slimmer or anything else you're not already or likely to be in the future! However if you keep a realistic approach to all supplements, you'll more than likely see benefits over the longterm with this one.<br /><br />Benefits:<br />+No calories.<br />+Has green tea in it, which is thought to have metabolism boosting benefits.<br />+Energy boost that lasts through a hard, 2 hr workout without side effects such as nervousness or jittery feeling.<br />+Loaded with B vitamins for energy, which also support your immune system.<br /><br />The taste on all Celsius products is not the same.  Some are carbonated and for me, those are awful!  I like the non-carbonated Acai Berry flavored Celsius, with Strawberry Kiwi flavor coming in second and Raspberry third.  I've tried others, but keep coming back to these flavors as they are palatable.  None are overly sweet, but most have some sort of aftertaste which is sometimes bitter to me.  I drink them as cold as I can stand, as quickly as I can.  Frankly, taste isn't why I keep drinking it - it's the energy boost I get from the product.<br /><br />Celsius gives me an energy boost for my workout that is unmatched by other products I use by Monster.  I work out with weights 3-4 times a week and cardio 4-5 times, for total workouts lasting 45-90 minutes depending, but always at high intensity.  I eat a small breakfast high in protein and low in carbs, then drink Celsius on the way to the gym.<br /><br />It gets me through the workout with energy to spare, but I feel no side effects from it other than it's a diuretic - the green tea does it - and thus I'm urinating (fortunately the bathroom is close) frequently for the first 30 minutes of my workout. Not something I'll be drinking prior to running a 5K!<br /><br />It does have caffeine in it and it's recommended you limit intake of all energy drinks because of this, and do not combine them with other caffeinated drinks.  I always have a cup of coffee with my breakfast and then drink this, but notice no problems in doing so.  If you do what works for your body, you're on the right track.<br /><br />The bottom line... to reap benefits from this product you must also incorporate a healthy diet and exercise program. I've lost weight and gotten leaner over time, and while I wouldn't say Celsius did it, it was a 'fitness parter' in my journey and I'll keep using it.<br /><br />5/3/2011 NOTE: this pack is a 'variety' pack, not like the photo shown.  I was disappointed to have ordered 3 packs (looking at the photo instead of fully reading the description...) and to receive the mixed pack.  I really don't enjoy the 'sparkling' varieties of Celsius and have found my favorite to be Acai Berry.  I'll suck it up and deal with my mistake, but just be aware the photo is of the Acai Berry pack - not the variety.

review/summary: Good drink for a beginner
review/text: Last few months I've added some extra weight. I've decided to start visiting gym more often and with that, I wanted to have that extra something to help me burn calories faster and exercise more. As somebody who's into sports since 5 yo, I fairly well know how things work, so I checked several websites for supplements.<br /><br />I had some bad experiences with caffeine-based supplements, so I tried to steer away from them, but it's hard to find anything decent without caffeine inside. So, I opted to try Celsius, and here's what happened:<br /><br />Fit Strider (alpine skiing machine) - 30 mins daily, every day<br /><br />Day 1 - 5 mph average speed, 2.5 miles distance, ~280 calories (Peak speed 5.5 mph)<br />Day 2 - 5.5 mph avg, 2.80 miles, ~295 calories (Peak speed around 6 mph)<br />Day 3 - ~6.0 mph avg, 3.1 miles, ~320 calories (Peak speed 6.5-6.7 mph)<br />Day 4 - ~7.0 mph avg, 3.6 miles, ~340 calories (Peak speed approx. 8 mph)<br />Day 5 - rest<br />Day 6 - forced rest (long, tiring day @ work - simply didn't have time to exercise)<br />Day 7 - ~7.0 mph avg, 3.7 miles, ~350 calories  (Peak speed 10.5 mph for a short period) &lt;-today, June 1st, 2011<br /><br />Maybe it works, maybe it's just my body slowly waking up, but I like Celsius. I recommend it if you're as me - overweight, sleepy, stressed out at work (I work on a cruise ship - 6 months per contract, no days off).<br /><br />Drink it 10-20 mins before exercise (depends on metabolism really, but 15 mins average sounds correct. Try and see for yourself, that's the best), DO NOT drink it on completely empty stomach! I did that mistake and I was jittery for a few hours - I guess caffeine did it's number on me. If you're caffeine resistant maybe you will have different result, but I really didn't like the feeling so I learned my lesson - eat something hour or two before exercise (something light and HEALTHY!) and then drink thins thing.<br /><br />DO NOT skip your meals, folks. Starving yourself won't help you and Celsius will hit you like a hammer, so you will just suffer. Eat more often, but less food. Trust me, it works.<br /><br />For now, I'm counting on losing some of my 250 lbs and going under 220. It will take time, but I just ordered 2 more cases of Celsius so I'm good to go. Combine it with a good diet, regular exercise, some protein (casein works very good while you sleep and it comes handy as a meal replacement if you're hungry late in the evening like me) and that's about it. Grab a few boxes of quality protein bars to have in your pocket/purse and you will be shipshape in no time :)<br /><br />Good luck y'all!

review/summary: tasts like juice..no post-drink crash
review/text: I have been very pleased with this drink after reading reviews about it on some fitness magazines and amazon. Since I don't drink coffee in the morning, I was in search of a drink to give the me caffeine I needed in the morning.<br /><br />The taste and the variety of the tastes are great. I particularly like orange and cola.<br />I have noticed this drink actually improves my mood<br />No post drink crash I experience with RockStar and other energy drinks<br />No calories<br />No aspartame<br />The energy is sustained throughout the day.<br /><br />I take half a can in the morning and then another half around 4 pm ( I do go to the gym around 1pm however i consume another pre-workout drink for that).<br /><br />Try different flavors. Happy Celsius drinking :)

review/summary: Just WOW!!!
review/text: So, i received my first order today of celcius and let me tell you. It WORKS. I 5,8 and are 200lbs. I have been at home doing computer work for almost a year without going out. So i wasn't getting any work out. So i bought a treadmill and been running 1 week of running at 4.0 speed and do only 15 mins. That's all i can do before getting tired. Today i drank my first celsius and after 10 mins felt the energy. I got on the treadmill and jogged and ran at the speed of 6.2 and ran for straight 15 mins without getting tired at all!. I would walk, jog and run and did that for 2.3 hours straight!!! What a difference. After that i still wanted to do regular exercise like stretching and weight lifting and still now, 4 hours later i feel alot of energy on me. It's not the shaky energy feeling you get from other energy drinks like monster. And the drink tastes good. I don't feel any crashing like monster or other energy drinks give and you don't get shaky or anything. You're calmed but are alert. I suggest you get this if you're trying to lose weight or simply want an energy boost without all those calories and sugar those others drinks give.

review/summary: worst energy drink i've tried
review/text: I don't know if it's just me, but this is the worst energy drink I've ever tried - it did nothing for me at all!  Granted, I love coffee and energy drinks so I may have a bit of a tolerance, but even my fiance who never drinks coffee and hates all red bull-type drinks drank a whole can and did not feel any boost at all.  It seems like it works for some ppl, but my experience was extremely disappointing.  On the positive side, the drinks taste good so at least it wasn't a complete waste of money (just a really expensive can of soda. . . )

review/text: Our Jackabee (Russell/Beagle mix)seemed to love the taste of this food more than the "regular over-the-counter" food from the store.  In fact, he couldn't wait to eat it.  He probably would have eaten more if we allowed him to gorge himself on it.  There were no adverse reactions to the switch. You just have to slowly wean your dog off the cheap stuff, otherwise, you dog could experience loose stools.

review/summary: Not up to the hype, caused bloody stools in my puppy
review/text: I purchased this food upon recommendation from my vet. They told me that they had previously used the Holistic brand but it had merged with this company & they did not have experience with Eagle Pack but that they thought it was the same. I slowly added the food to my puppy's old food over the next week and she seemed to like it just fine. Well, she started having a lot of loose stools, many of which were completely liquid and even bloody for the next couple of weeks. I decided to try another food and everything completely resolved. I have since tried a couple of puppy foods equal in quality/price/reputation with no problems. Her stools are completely better, now soft but formed (like they should be!) with no sign of blood whatsoever. She has not had any gastrointestinal problems on numerous different kinds of treats either. She has been fine on 3 puppy foods, a dozen different kinds of treats...you do the math.<br /><br />I have been trying to figure out what the problem may have been from the ingredient list and my concern is the "triple animal proteins" combining chicken, pork and fish meals. This is just an invitation for food intolerance because there are more potential allergens. I think the pork is the problem. I know she tolerates chicken & chicken meal fine, not sure about fish but I've seen that frequently in other foods while I have yet to find another quality food that contains pork meal. Pig does not seem akin to a domestic dog's "natural" diet anyway. If they got rid of the pork, I might consider trying it again but until then I'd recommend you try another food for your puppy. I think (hope) they are generally a good company and I do see that some people's dogs have been fine on this brand, but I'm not sure this is the safest food for baby animals. I will NOT be purchasing this again & I will be contacting my vet recommending that they no longer carry it in their store. There are so many better, safer options out there. If you care about your puppy's health and happiness, save her weeks of misery and buy something else!

review/summary: A Molten Mess
review/text: I suppose I shouldn't have ordered these during the summer, but I did.  Since they were not to be shipped for several weeks, I assumed (yes I know) that shipping during August would be taken into consideration by the seller.  It wasn't.  While there was a little cushioning material around the box, there was no insulation at all and no markings on the outside of the box that it should be protected from heat.  Since the Mozart Balls are loose in the box, they melted into a variety of non-spheriodal shapes and the box itself was saturated with cocoa butter that was originally part of the candy.  Removing the foil is akin to untying badly knotted string that has been soaked in water and then dried.  The taste reminds me of Moon Pies.  Maybe in the winter months these are worth while, but I will stick to Reber in the future (each ball in an individual compartment and shipped with cooling packs in the summer).  Thank goodness these weren't a gift!

review/summary: Oh Yum!
review/text: I haven't ever tried these cookies before and  just picked them up as a lark, because after all, what woman on the verge of PMS could resist the lure of chocolate, marshmallow and more chocolate in the form of a cake like 'cookie' on the bottom.  Oh geez, I'm darn lucky I don't have any in the house at the moment...but wait!  I can order them without even leaving the room and be indulging in them in a matter of a day or so.<br /><br />This perfection of a confection consists of a cakey/cookie on the bottom, topped with a nice smooth, soft marshmallow and then drenched with a lovely, lush milk chocolatey candy. These are rather large cookies and  even the most  chocolate deprived of us should be happy with a serving of maybe 2 of them. Unfortunately a real serving is only one...but not to despair; at 120 calories per cookie you won't be doing that much damage if you go crazy and have 2!<br /><br />Okay so by reading the other review I found that they are good frozen, but let me tell you I think they are wonderful if you put them in the microwave for a second or two and  try them with the 'mallow getting a bit oozie!  It's like a s'more but better since you don't have to build a pesky fire or even find a twig so you could roast the marshmallow!<br /><br />I do suggest that if you don't finish the package in one sitting, that you put the leftovers in a Ziploc baggie so they stay fresh. The un-re-sealable packaging is my only complaint with this product.<br />I dare you to try these and to be able to stop at just one!

review/summary: Decadent Nabisco Pinwheel Chocolate Marshmallow Cookies
review/text: My mother used to buy these cookies for us kids when we were little (back in the early 60's).  She would pack a few of them in our school lunch boxes for dessert.  They were sooo delicious back then...I just remember being so excited when I would open my lunch box and find them in there!!!  They are certainly what I consider "Comfort Dessert".  I agree with one of the other reviews...the cookie part is soft and (pseudo) cake-like, the marshmallow is soft and wonderful, and the delicious chocolate they are wrapped in just melts in your mouth.  Wow!  How can something so simple taste so good?  I buy these quite often and I've gotta tell you...I cannot stop at one or two (honest).  Nothing like having a couple with a glass of cold milk after dinner, after work, or for a bed time snack.  They are worth every penny.  I also agree with one of the other reviews...sometimes I too pop one in the microwave for just about 3 seconds (don't over microwave and watch them every second or you'll have a puddle).  The marshmallow barely oozes and it just tastes so good.  Give them a try and you will not regret it.  Hope Nabisco never stops making these.  They are my all time favorite!!

review/summary: Pinwheels taste like powdered milk
review/text: The last time I tried Nabisco Pinwheels was after my favorite store closed and I could no longer buy Mallomars (a great choc/marshmallow cookie). Found the Nabisco Pinwheel enormous and fluffy but many of the shells were already broken and I thought the filling had an off flavor like powdered milk(which I detest). Since then I have discovered Dare brand-pure chocolate Whippet cookies that are also sold on Amazon. They are imported from Canada and they are my new favorite choc/marshmallow cookie with pure choc shell and a tasty marshmallow center on top of a quality base cookie or bisquit as the Canadians call it. It's a premium cookie with none of the tricks used by American bakeries these days to fill the cookie with air or other cost cutting measures. It harkens back to the cookies we remembered from our childhoods in the 50's and 60's and the recipe hasn't changed. If you get the craving, I heartily recommend these Dare Choc Marshmallow whippet cookies. Like the original Mallomars they are a tried and true classic full of the chocolate marshmallow goodness you remembered from childhood.

review/text: I have never been a huge fan of the sorts of rice (white) you can easily get here in the States. But the Lotus Foods rices have broadened my culinary horizons, prompting me to incorporate rice into many dishes where I would have found a substitute for the rice in the past. I find the pink rice in particular works very well in many dishes, especially curries, that I perviously pared white rice. It takes the dishes up to a whole new, and much better, level.

review/summary: Mildly fruity, wonderful aroma, smell this oil from the open bottle!!
review/text: I like some variety in my olive oils. No, never any other quality than extra vergine, THAT is a MUST ( => do you know how much olive oil must be included by US law in so-called "Pure Olive Oil"?? Huh? Dare to guess? It is 25% - yes, I am not kidding you, 25% olive oil must be included in that blend sold under the name "pure olive oil" in the USA. The 75% other oils in that bottle or tin they don't need to tell you what they are and where those are from...)<br /><br />So, extra vergine only, no compromise - but within that world there are so many various aromas, different tastes available. You can have mild oils from Liguria or Tuscanny, or real fruity ones from the south (called Fruttato). Or those in the middle, which I am calling mildly fruity.<br /><br />This one is a perfect example for that category. It comes from the Abruzzi, a mountain region near the adriatic coast of Italy, made by a very small company. Actually a family business rather than a company. I have just tasted the fresh new harvest of Nov 2010, which is available right now. Wonderful! When you open the bottle first, take the time to smell the oil from the open bottle! Do it! Please, try that! It is like a good wine, it will introduce itself with a note.<br /><br />I am loving this oil from the first beginning when I first smelled it. So fresh, but not sharp! Not tangy, but still fruity enough to leave an impression! (If an oil is too mild you don't taste anything!)<br /><br />This oil is perfect for a fresh salad, or for a drizzle over a finished dish, or mix it with mashed potatoes for a new twist! Or try on toasted bread!<br /><br />Yes, really, toasted bread! Take a fresh raw (not from a jar!) clove of garlic, peel it and rub the clove against the crusty bread. The crust of the toasted bread will work as a grater actually, the clove will disappear in your hands. Then pour this oil over the bread, and enjoy! This freshness, this aroma!<br /><br />Oh, and it is also very healthy, it works like a flu shot, but without the dangerous side effects, and it doesn't hurt at all!

review/summary: Unfortunate...
review/text: I had extremely high hopes for Giants BBQ Sunflower Seeds. Every sunflower seed on the market has very little sugar, if any at all. David, Bigs, Jimbeam, Fritolay, and Spitz are the 5 you will find pretty much anywhere. Giants was one seed I had never heard of or tasted, and so I decided to give it a go, and ordered a box. They are very smokey which is 1/2 the test of a good bbq seed. The second half is sweetness, of which there is none to speak of in these seeds. They are very salty, and after one 5oz bag, your tongue is done. Between a bag of Spitz or Giants, i'll take the Spitz every time. Giants have no resealable bag, are very salty, and lack sweetness on any level. Spitz has a resealable back, are much cheaper, have a milder smoke flavor with a pinch of sweet, and the perfect amount of salt. If you have never heard of giants sunflower seeds and are looking to try it, I'd stray away. They are a smokier version of a mainstream David seed but with a little more salt.<br /><br />For an alternative to the common 5, and 6 if you count Giants, there are 2 more companies you can try out. They are Interstate B8, and Zotes. They come in plastic cylindrical jars, and definately don't appear to be mass produced. After I pawn of the remaining 10bags of Giants, I will give Interstate b8s bbq a try. There is one review of them on their website that says they are sweet and smokey, the perfect bbq sunflower seed. I'll be the judge of that!

review/summary: Outstanding product!
review/text: I've been reading about White Lily flour for years, but was never able to give it a try.  Let me tell you, the biscuits and pancakes in my house have taken a giant turn for the better.  Low protein flour is just unavailable in normal supermarkets up north and it really does make a difference in the final product.  The self-rising option is great, and eliminates any mistakes in measuring baking powder.  Add a little baking soda for your buttermilk biscuits and watch them rise to new heights.  Why, I had to put lead weights on them after baking to keep them from floating away.

review/summary: ROHS packaging & food safety
review/text: This raw organic cacao powder came in one of those electronics static bags you'd normaly see a chipset or hard drive with a recycle symbol 7 & 11-PET, ALU, PE. I was told it was "food-safe" by the seller and that "nestl&eacute; uses the exact packaging."I don't see how ROHS (the restricted use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment) can be food safe. I cannot return it for a full refund as there is a restocking fee and shipping charge so I'm writing this review.<br />  At the least, common sense should tell you that organic powderd foods should not be in contact with impregnated aluminum plastics--especially when it's stamped on the bag itself stating (ROHS compliance) "that it contains the minimum acceptable levels of hazardous substances such as cadmium, mercury, and lead." This is no joke. Industry cares not about your health and therefore uses recycled materials containing these hazardous metals. A packaging containing acceptable levels of hazardous materials for a landfill is not food safe!!

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: Like the other 1-star buyer, this powder was shipped to me in a ULINE static shield bag which indicates that it is "ROHS Compliant." ROHS compliancy means that certain metals are banned from being used in packaging, but not necessarily lead! There is no indication this bag was not used previously for electronics, there is no origin marking anywhere on the bag and there is no nutrition label. There also is no "organic" label on the bag aside from a shoddily printed sticker that says "Organic Herbal Essence". Because of all of this I can not be sure this product is not adulterated, let alone organic. I will not purchase this product again from this seller and suggest that other buyers beware. The product itself may be fine, but why take a chance (especially if you are looking for what is supposed to be an 'organic' product free of contaminants)?<br /><br />UPDATE 4/12/12:<br />I complained about the improper packaging and submitted photo evidence of the static shield bags to both the seller and Amazon. Originally the seller claimed the product was shipped in food-grade ULINE bags, but after I sent photo evidence to the contrary I heard nothing further from the seller. Amazon granted me a full refund today. If you do order this product, I recommend you double-check that the packaging is safe before opening it!

I'm going to look around and get some opinions on others, but I will probably come back to this one because the price is great, and it DOES make things chocolatey. . . just not like I'm used to.

review/text: I was not sure what to expect with cacao versus processed cocoa. The first thing I made I put to much powder in, alot to much...lol. The second thing I made...yup, to much again. My kids and I are loving this stuff. They are much more willing to drink homemade raw almond and rice milk with a bit of cacao and honey in it. And...so exciting...my 12 year old drank her green smoothie this morning with no fuss at all. She told me that if I would let her drink chocolate almond milk, she could handle raw vegan, but she had to have milk to drink that she enjoyed. This is definitely a new pantry staple, and the fact that it is nutritious just sweetens the decision.

review/summary: Hard to believe that this cacao powder is raw
review/text: Raw cacao is bitter, there is absolutely nothing bitter about this stuff.  I have to wonder if the lack of bitterness means that it has been alkalized.  I'm also not to thrilled about their packaging.<br /><br />Edit: I just bought some alkalized (i.e. Dutched) cocoa to compare the taste.  The two products have very very similar tastes.  The Saaqin caccao is not raw, it is a very highly processed cocoa.

review/text: Aside from the fact that this product is so reasonably priced and that the delivery was very prompt (about 4 days before the estimated delivery date), it has a really nice flavor for being "raw". I had tried one other brand before and it was quite bitter tasting. This cacao tastes fresh, and when mixed with a fruit, walnut and greek yogurt salad for dinner as well as with a hefty morning smoothie (loaded with raw, organic hemp powder and kefir, etc.),it lends a really delicious chocolate flavor. I use 2 tablespoons with the smoothie and 1 tablespoon with the fruit 'n nut salad. It is recommended that you get at least 3 tablespoons a day of the cacao to maximize its benefits.

review/summary: GREAT DOG FOOD, GREAT PRICE!
review/text: At first I tried this because of the price and free shipping. I had never heard of it before.  My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great! The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others get this mixed with their Bil-Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients. Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed... Every time I have fed my dogs any brand of straight canned dog food, with the exception of Science Diet, they had diarrhea. Not with this one. Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00.The only fault I could find, in my opinion, is that the product has lamb.  I won't eat lamb and have never before bought any dog food with lamb or veal in it. I do not like the way the animals are treated and lambs are sweet, baby cuddly things. It makes me sad.  Unfortunately, this company uses lamb in most everything for some reason.  I have never seen this before in a dog food  product. They might have one or two items with lamb, but not most all. They do have the chicken and rice without lamb. Regardless, at this time , I plan on ordering this dog food monthly for my dogs as they love it so much and other than lamb, I am impressed with the ingredients.

review/summary: Suspecting change in formula, but still good product
review/text: I've been purchasing this product, as well as the grain free salmon for a few years now by the case. I have 6 special-needs' rescued Greyhounds and although they all require a different 'diet' because of their problems, I keep this on hand in these two grain free 'flavors' as an occasional 'add in' to the fresh-food diets I prepare for them on a daily basis. I have relied on this to get me through their 'picky-eater' times, their 'on-medications-that-taste/smell-funny-and-I-don't-wanna-eat-Mom" times, their upset tummy times, their 'post-surgery-feeling-icky" times as well as when I don't plan right or run out of something. This grain free product comes in very handy and I like that it is pretty close to 'natural' ingredients. Frankly, there is another brand I would prefer but I simply cannot afford it.<br /><br />I've been more than happy with this product because it is grain free. I cook fresh, whole grains for my 'kids' in their daily diets so to find grain free canned food to keep on hand for 'in a pinch', I like this. ok, so I loved it until the last 6 cases I had delivered. For years, this canned product was almost solid in the can. I needed a spoon to dig it out and I loved the way I had to actually mash it into the rest of their food. The last 6 cases (both flavors: 3 of the salmon and 3 of the ALS) seem to have a change in the recipe. I open the can and can literally POUR it into their bowls. There might be one larger blob of 'food', but for the most part, it is like a healthy soup. I purposely do not purchase the other Canidae canned foods that contain broth because I can make them all kinds of much healthier 'broth' on my own. I don't know if these last 6 cases are this way because they sat in a warehouse for a long time and the food actually broke down or what. To those in the 'know' that may sound dumb but I have no idea why this product would change so drastically and I have to admit I'm disappointed greatly. While this is something I can afford, my disappointment is now to the level where I'm back to considering the more expensive product I wanted all along. I'll just buy less of it, less frequently. Too bad. I really liked this one for quite a while, as did my 'kids'.

I love the fact that they don't have to be refrigerated, so are easy to toss in the diaper bag, use when we're out and about, etc. I wish they didn't have any sugar in addition to what naturally occurs in milk and fruit, but they're still better than pudding (that's why I didn't rate them 5 stars). I'm so happy to see them available on Subscribe & Save because our local grocery store charges $3.49/four-pack and we go through a four-pack every week. The only thing I wish they'd make is a variety pack so that I didn't have to get six four-packs of all the same flavor. Oh, and I hope Amazon will start carrying the pear flavor, too. (Can someone explain to me why the peach is 25 cents cheaper per four-pack than the banana?)

review/text: I purchased this dressing because I love the sesame dressing you get at Japanese restaurants. It caught my attention because it was only 50 calories per 2 TBSP. serving. I usually avoid any type of low-cal dressing because they are loaded with sugar and taste just awful. But there was nothing on the bottle promoting it as a "low-cal" dressing so I thought I'd give it a try. OMG, it is absolutely delicious. Not too sweet, tangy, flavorful and yes, low in calories. I not only use it for salads, but splash it on stir fries and grilled salmon. Unfortunately after I finished it, I couldn't remember where I'd purchased it. After many futile calls to stores where I usually shop...I even tried contacting the manufacturer but they couldn't help me find a retailer (there was a language barrier). Quite by accident I happend upon it at World Market while visiting California and purchased the 6 bottles they had in stock. I live in Nevada and don't have a World Market near me so I was so thrilled to find it on Amazon. I'll have to buy it by the case. My entire family loves it. Try the Citrus dressing as well, very good!!

review/summary: Sugar Free?? NOT SO MUCH
review/text: I ordered these for my diabetic mother becasue the product description lists the candy as being sugar free. Well, she received them today and both sugar and corn syrup are listed as ingredients.  I am assuming that Amazon needs to update the product description and this is not actually a problem on the part of Asher (who by the way make great candy!)

review/summary: Vanilla Paste is terrific
review/text: Based on recommendation from King Arthur Flour (KAF), I bought the vanilla bean paste. It came in quickly. I tried it and came to several conclusions. First, the flavor is outstanding..rich vanilla flavor. As described at KAF, the paste contained small vanillla bean specks which were visible in the lighter colored preps I made, like French Vanilla ice cream. It gave the preparations a special touch. One caution. If used in a thin batter, the specks will sink to the bottom. I learned this when I made Creme Brulee. The vanilla flavor was great, but at the bottom of the ramekin were all the bean specks. Use the paste in recipes where the specks will stay suspended and not sink.

review/summary: Great vanilla, convenient size
review/text: Nielsen-Massey is my favorite vanilla extract, of the four or five I've sampled, and this is probably the most affordable way to buy this stuff on-line. If you're regularly making recipes that call for a tablespoon of vanilla at a time, you can't go wrong here.

review/summary: Sugar added
review/text: I bought both this product and the LorAnn Extreact to compare, as they were both comparable prices.  Unfortunately they were not comparable in product.  The Nielsen-Massey had no flavor to speak of.  The LorAnn was very aromatic.  Also, I was very disappointed that this product had sugar in it.

review/text: This is the first time I have purchased this particular brand of vanilla and I normally would not purchase such a large bottle, but I found that the flavor is just wonderful. I'm glad I bought it because I like to bake and the size of this bottle will keep me busy for a while

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: I purchased a bottle of the Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla about a year ago through Amazon and noticed how the vanilla enhanced<br />the flavors of whatever I used it in. Cookies had a richer flavor as well as pancakes and other baked goods. When I ran out I purchased<br />a couple of smaller bottles of vanilla at my local market, but the flavor just wasn't as intense.  So, I recently purchased another<br />bottle of Nielsen-Massey and am very satisfied again with this product.  Keep in mind this is "pure" vanilla as opposed to "imitation"

review/summary: FLAVOR-filled :)
review/text: Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla is BY FAR the best vanilla I've ever used in my baking--and I've used a lot of vanilla from numerous companies over five decades of baking.  There have been store-brands, spice company brands, the famous vanilla sold door-to-door years back, and even vanilla brought home from a foreign country.<br />When I opened this bottle of vamilla, the aroma was fresh and fabulous.  Then I tasted the "old" cakes and cookies I've baked umpteen times.  I could have sworn they were new recipes, and my guests responded likewise.<br />I proudly recommend Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla for your use.  Buy the 32-ounce bottle, because you're going love baking with it :)

review/summary: Exactly as promised, and excellent follow-up from the merchant
review/text: I received this item with several other items - it was carefully packed in an individual, padded box within the larger parcel Amazon delivered.  While I prefer vanilla bean paste as a general rule, extract is much more economical and this is fairly good quality product with a standard alcohol base.  The value is hard to beat.

review/summary: None Better
review/text: Stop what is going on and bring out the baking materials because a cake is on the way and it will be the best cake ever as long as Nielsen-Massey Vanilla is one of the ingredients.  I have used almost every type of real vanilla over the years and none is better than this one.  The taste fits my needs perfectly and those who eat the end result agree.  Even though cheap imitation vanilla is readily available at a low cost per unit and other real vanilla is also readily available this one is the absolute best.  I thought that the 32 ounce size would be too much and it might not get used before expiring but I was just plain wrong.  It will be gone long before its expiration and all the consumers in this house will say thank you.  There is nothing quite as pleasant as having one of the church ladies or a guest extolling the goodness of a pound cake made with Nielsen's.  I know the vanilla is just an insignificant part of the total product but it is the one element that adds so much to the flavor and goodness.

review/text: I used to find smaller glass bottles of this same product at retailers like Marshall's and TJ Maxx. Good vanilla is expensive, and if you use it a lot this is a great deal. Just figure out how much it would cost to buy a 'quart' of real vanilla at a grocery store!

review/summary: Not up to expectations
review/text: I bought the vanilla bean extract but I was very disappointed to find that it has a stronger alcoholic flavour to it than the actual vanilla flavour. The extract was also not as thick as the other extracts I have used. I have not tried the vanilla bean paste of this brand and maybe that is of a better quality than the extract.

review/summary: A Passion for Vanilla
review/text: Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar "Bourbon Islands," Mexico and Indonesia. I find the flavor was truly superior to normal vanilla extract. While you don't want to use vanilla beans in everything (too expensive!), you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream.<br /><br />Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes. The list goes on and on. There are so many uses for vanilla. Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean. Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America.<br /><br />Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet. The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution. It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract.<br /><br />You can use the vanilla beans, rinse and dry them, so they last longer. After drying, you can store them again in the glass tube or in their own plastic bag for reuse.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Weak Vanilla Flavor
review/text: After researching brands of vanilla bean paste, I decided to go with this one as it consistently has the best reviews. However, I'm not happy with this product at all. The vanilla taste just isn't there. It's great for adding the vanilla bean "look" to my recipes, but I found that even if I use a lot, I still can't achieve a good level of vanilla flavor. I used about 1/3 of the bottle for a frosting recipe but it still didn't have the vanilla flavor I was seeking. I had to add vanilla extract for that.<br /><br />I thought it would be thicker and have more vanilla beans in it, but it's about the consistency of maple syrup. It shouldn't be called a paste, as it really isn't. Pastes are very thick and don't run. I won't be buying this again.
