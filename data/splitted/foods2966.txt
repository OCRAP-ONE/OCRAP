review/summary: just cannot live without it
review/text: when I ran low and could not find it at any store in the region, found it out of stock at most online stores I searched, in desperation I would take the empty jar and inhale its fragrance to try to scratch that vegemite itch. Sad.<br /><br />I'd already used my finger to scrape out as much goodness as possible, and not being able to find another supplier was really tragic. I almost cried a couple of times. Honestly. I even tried to pretend Marmite was the same and it just isn't and was almost crying again for missing the real thing so bad.<br /><br />Thank goodness Amazon sells it even if it's quadruple the price it should be. When you're desperate for it I guess you pay the price for what keeps that rose on your cheek, lol.

review/summary: an aquired taste but well worth the effort
review/text: Vegemite is not for everyone...it is an aquired taste and not everyone will make the effort...which is good since that means there is more for those of us who love this stuff and are addicted to its salty flavor on toast or by itself. I like eating Vegemite along with a grilled plantain for both the sweet and salty flavors...great with shrimp crackers as well.

review/text: I assumed vegemite was something else (and even more disgusting). But yes, it does have the reputation for "tasting funny", at least outside Aussie.<br /><br />It's good to know that all Aussies stuck in the 48 contiguous states (still don't know what that means) can buy this bizarre grocery straight from Amazon.com.<br /><br />I'm sure it will enhance the taste of the fried kangaroo, the roasted wombat or the boiled bunyip your Aussie mate will take home from his hunt around the campfire.<br /><br />Just don't expect to find this in Brooklyn.

review/summary: 'Twas love at first bite
review/text: After being curious about Marmite and Vegemite for decades, I finally got up the nerve this January to try them both.  The Marmite arrived first and, while I enjoy it, immediately got pushed to the back of the cupboard upon the arrival of the Vegemite.  Oh, sweet mystery of life -- at last, I've found you!  Talk about being born in the wrong hemisphere.  Like several other American converts who've commented, I have to really watch myself with it, or else I'd be layering it on quite thick (or eating too much straight from the jar).  My husband tried it against my advice by dipping his finger into the jar (gah!), and I wasn't surprised when he made a stink-face.<br /><br />If it weren't for all the sodium-induced edema (oh to be young again...), I'd eat several tablespoonsful a day.  After 6 months, I somehow got my finicky husband to try it again, this time made properly on toast.  Yep, I converted him, too.  While my usual is on buttered multi-grain toast, I also love Vegemite in grilled cheese as well as topped with avocado (on either toast or toasted bagels).  Amazing.<br /><br />Am I the only one who gets antsy if I haven't had Vegemite for a few days?

review/summary: I cried a little when I ran out.
review/text: One of my friends in Australia wanted to send me some vegemite, but sadly it would not make it through customs.  Being an American, my first instinct was to find it on the web - as I was just so curious about the salty spread.  When my first bottle bought on Amazon arrived on my doorstep, I was eager to dip into it as soon as possible.  I grabbed my crackers and butter, and with the first bite...  I thought that I would never taste again.  The bottle went back into the pantry, to sit there and collect dust.  Vegemite was less of a delicious spread and more of a joke for my roommates beginning with, "Hey!  Come try this!"<br /><br />As I am also a college student, I inevitably ran out of food and was forced to stare at the unassuming yellow jar in my cabinet.  I figured I'd try it again, and with a bit of butter on a piece of toast, and I found that I had now developed a liking towards the flavor.  I then proceeded to put vegemite in, or on, everything that I possibly could.  So, to everyone who is interested in trying vegemite, please understand that it is an acquired taste.  Especially if you're American, and have not had the opportunity to taste similar products in the past.

review/summary: American Vegemite junkie for 27 years!!!
review/text: I went hunting for academic jobs in Australia in 1985.  This was right after American media saturation with Men at Work's "Land Down Under".  So, after going through customs in Sydney I was a bit hungry.  I saw a little food stand and one of the things on the menu list was Vegemite Sandwich.  So, I thought, "Why Not?".  I was kind of surprised by the first bite.  I like salty foods, and by the time I finished the sandwich I was hooked.  I brought 4 large size jars back with me.  When I finished the third jar back at home, I tried to find a supply.  A guy who knew a guy hooked me up with some boutique in New York that was owned by Olivia Newton John and that sold Vegemite.  I was saved!  Several years later, I moved to Dayton, OH and across from the main gate of Wright-Patterson AFB in downtown Fairborn, there was a little British specialty shop that actually stocked Vegemite.  That kept me supplied through most of the early 90s.  By the time that the internet had caught on you could go on line and find people (mostly in Australia) who would ship it to you.  Now, having the convenience of ordering it from Amazon a jar is only 2 days away.  Thanks, Amazon!<br /><br />If you don't like salty you probably won't like Vegemite sandwiches, however, making a sandwich is only one use for Vegemite.  I've been cooking with the stuff since about 1990.  One of my favorites is scrambled eggs, with tomato cubes and a tsp of Vegemite.  Used this way, the Vegemite becomes much less concentrated than it does on toast and doesn't add much more salt than you probably would normally put on eggs.  However, what it does add is an incredible flavor boost.  Another of my favorites is Vegemite spaghetti.  Melt 1/4 stick of butter (or whatever you're substituting) in a pan and add a tsp of Vegemite and about 1/8 cup of the spaghetti boiling water.  Throw the freshly boiled spaghetti into the pan and saute on low heat for about 2 min.  Just before turning off the heat, throw in about 1/4 cup Kraft Parmesan/Romano Cheese.  Mix well and then serve.  Those quantities treat about enough spaghetti for two.<br /><br />Actually, Vegemite is no more salty than, say, a bullion cube.  So, after you understand what Vegemite tastes like (other than salty), you will immediately see why you can substitute a tsp of Vegemite anywhere you might use a bullion cube.<br /><br />Try it, you will probably like it!

review/summary: MOST delicious - Could NOT live without!
review/text: My local store carries a good foreign food selection, but only the 150g Jar of Vegemite...<br />Last time I was in Australia, I made sure I packed a few BIG jars and a few squeeze tubes to bring home... After SEVERAL flights carrying the stuff (and remaining quite unexploded) and having already arrived at my home airport; the goons at the 'ignorant' security administration wanted to confiscate my Vegemite!<br />After arguing for quite a while, I told them that regardless of what they thought it was, I was clearly NOT leaving without it... and they better get lots of toast because I would be around for a while...<br />I left with my Vegemite stash intact... I'm glad this large size is now readily available for purchase! The best part is not having to deal with braindead Airport security! :)

review/summary: delicious, as always
review/text: The first time I got this from Amazon, it came with an expiry date of like 6 months ... Since I am the only one at home that eats it I was not going to finish it all.  Anyways, it took my a few more months but I did and it was still in good conditions.<br />This time, the expiry date was actually for a couple of years so that was a good start.  I cannot seem to find Vegemite in many places so when I found it on Amazon I was really happy.<br />About the product, really not much to say.  It is one of those things that either you love it, or you hate it.<br /><br />But get some bread, butter, cheese and avocado.  Do whatever combination you can think of (with vegemite of course) and it will be delicious!

Everyone except 86 yr old Gr'ma, who spread it on a cracker, ate it, and proclaimed it "not too tasty but edible".  I think that about sums it up.

My complaint is about the price of this product in particular, 99$. Who in the right mind would pay 99$ for this! There better be gold shavings, ambrosia, and ground Rhino horns in this 99$ jar of Vegemite. To top it off, there is a deal to get four 150g jars of Vegemite for $38 on Amazon from the same seller of the same exact product and brand. Hmm. . . 600g for 38$, 1800g for 115$ or 400g for 99$? Seriously though, what the heck is with this pricing Kraft?<br /><br />I may be wrong for assuming this, but the other reviews I have read for this product are for Vegemite in general, which does deserve 4~5 stars. This particular product however deserves a 1 and for good reasons.

review/text: If you are looking for an "introductory" cheese to the world of exta-sharp cheddars, this is a good starting point. Quebec is indeed extra-sharp, not just sharp. It has a fairly "straight" taste, that is, not a lot of complexity, just straight sharpness with a slightly buttery undertaste.<br /><br />That said, if you're a more experienced cheese aficionado, but still new to extra-sharp cheddars, you may, after starting here, want to move on to more complex cheeses such as seaside cheddars.

review/summary: So much better than expensive prescription food made from corn.
review/text: My cat developed bladder stones several years ago. She has surgery to remove them and then my vet (that I love and greatly respect) told me that she would need to be a on a prescription food to raise the Ph of her urine for the rest of her life to prevent it from happening again. All of the available and very expensive prescription foods contained corn in the top ingredients and I did not want to feed my carnivore pet a diet that was corn based. I did a lot of research and finally stumbled upon this product. I now feed my cat a high quality meat based dry food along with a tablespoon of high quality wet food and a sprinkle of this powder twice a day. She is getting food that is healthy for her and designed for a carnivore AND has been bladder stone free for almost 4 years. I made my vet a believer in this natural remedy!

review/text: I was first introduced to Sahale pecan/cranberry snacks at a friend's home.  Later I purchased the product for my own home.  Since then, there has been NO turning back.  Those pecans become absolutely addictive and the cranberries add such a nice nutritive flavor to the whole product!  Certainly worth a try - and I do not think you will be disappointed.

review/text: I bought a 4.0 oz. pkg. of Sahale Snacks Nut Blend "Valdosta Pecans" on 04/01/2011. (This is no April Fools Joke either. :)) WOW! What a fabulous Snack!  And I've certainly eaten my fair share of them. None like this one!! The ingredients are a perfect blend and flavor. The Pecans are very crunchy and the cranberries are....well the perfect mate. If you like pecans & cranberries you should love this snack nut blend. Its obvious that 'Josh & Edmond" know a great snack when they eat one. I wish I could get an unending supply....a recipe would work. :-) Great Job, Guys!!! Hopefully these will be in stock soon.<br />You'll never know if you like them if you don't try them. Go ahead and treat yourself!

review/summary: I don't get the hype
review/text: I bought this product because of the raving reviews. I have to confess that I find nothing spectacular about these olives. In fact, they are regular, canned olives that bear no resemblance to fresh fleshy olives. They are not mushy but have lost almost all crispness due to the liquid in which they are marinated/canned. Maybe I was spoiled by the past year I lived in Italy, but my idea of good olives is olives that still taste like olives after being cured. These olives don't taste much like anything. Not horrible, but easily forgettable and definitely not worth the price.

review/summary: Best olives on the planet
review/text: My great-grandmother introduced me to green ripe olives about 55 years ago.  She used to process her own and they were wonderful.  They are very, very hard to find.  This is especially true in the rural area where we live.  The closest place I can find them is 35 miles from here and they don't always have them in stock.  So, I rely on my good friends at Amazon to ship these fabulous, mild, buttery olives right to my door.  I have friends who are self-proclaimed olive-haters and even some of them like these olives.  I've tried several brands over many years when I could find them and I must say that Santa Barbara Olive Co.'s are the best I've ever had (except maybe for my great-grandmother's).

review/text: I was searching for olives to use in a tapenade recipe and saw these at the grocery store, but they cost quite a bit more there. After reading several reviews I decided to try them and ordered the case but thought "what the heck will I do with all these olives if we don't like them?" Not a problem! These turned out to be some of the best olives I've ever purchased and we've eaten almost the whole case now . . . not only were they great in the tapenade, they made a delicious green olive sauce for pasta and also were tasty just out of the can. They are not as salty as some other olives we've tried, either - we'll definitely be ordering more of these!

review/summary: If you want REAL raclette cheese, this is it
review/text: Once, we walked into a Swiss Raclettestube in Zermatt. The overpowering odor of melting Raclette cheese caused one of our party to double over and have to be carried out. Sadly, no raclette for us that evening. Whimp! And Raclette in nearby Germany is served with butterkaese, a non-smelly alternative that just doesn't do it.<br /><br />Raclette is a traditional Swiss meal of cheese toasted originally by the fire and now, in a rather effete fashion in a raclette maker, a grill with a toaster underneath where you can put the cheese to melt in individual pans. The traditional things to serve with raclette are small boiled potatoes, gerkhins, and grilled sausages. These sausages, you grill on top of the raclette maker (and hence you see the attraction to the Germans. Wurst with everything.)<br /><br />This cheese is the real thing, smelly, tangy and great with potatoes or just on rye bread. It will put hair on your chest.

review/summary: Not Quite Like Others
review/text: I bought this a few days ago  and it came in a timely manner in a sealed airtight bag. I have had several cups of it so far and it's different from every other cup of orange tea I've ever had. It's darker in color when brewed. It seems like the tea is average on fruit. It seems sparse, but somehow a piece has ended up in every cup. There is not much emphasis on the orange or spice. It doesn't taste like anything from Bigelow or Stash. It is unlike any store brand I've tried. The flavor of the orange and spices is muted, while some more of the flavor of the tea itself comes through. That could be the difference I note.<br /><br />I think the tea is good, but it isn't what I expected. I have divided it into three one-quart Mason Jars with some left over in the original bag.<br /><br />The flavor isn't bad or off, it's just different. For the price, just under $20, I would buy this again.<br /><br />Also, in the jars I have noticed something quite odd. I cannot explain this, but on the top edge of the jar where the seal meets the jar, oil has been at this location on all the jars when I opened them from storage in a pantry. The oil smells like the tea and spices. I find this highly unusual.<br /><br />UPDATE: I still really enjoy this tea and would recommend it to others. After my initial shock in the difference in flavor, I think the flavor is great. It tastes more complex hot than warm or cold. I would definitely buy this again.

Delicious! I'd give it five stars if it were organic.

review/summary: Moist and Tangy!!
review/text: These apricots arrived fresh.  They are typical California apricots, perhaps a bit on the tangier side.  If you are familiar with Mariani or Sunmaid California apricots, these beat those hands-down.  They were moist, chewy, and tasty.  I have eaten a TON of California apricots in my life and I guess I'm a bit of an "apricot snob" now.  I eat them plain, chop them up into salads, use them to make sauces, cookies, and cakes.  A Turkish or Mediterranean apricot tends to be much sweeter and more bland than a California and often lack any kind of tart flavor.  A high-quality California apricot will be packed with flavor and have just the right balance of sweetness and tartness, and tend slightly more to the tart side than the sweet side... but these are a bit TOO heavy on the tart, indicating they were either picked too soon, or the soil in which they are growing is not rich enough.  This makes these apricots perfect for cooking with!  Of course, if you prefer your apricots more sour than most people, then these will be a perfect out-of-the-bag snack too.  But, since this is my personal review, I feel they are great, just a little TOO tart for my picky tastes, so I probably wont buy them again.

review/text: ICV K1V-1116<br />Saccharomyces cerevisiae<br /><br />Origin<br />Selected by the Institut coop&eacute;ratif du vin in Montpellier among numerous killer strains isolated and studied by Pierre Barre at INRA, the K1V-1116 strain was the first competitive factor yeast to go into commercial production and has become one of the most widely used active dried wine yeasts in the world.<br /><br />Oenological properties and applications<br />The K1V-1116 strain is a rapid starter with a constant and complete fermentation between 10� and 35�C (50� and 95�F), capable of surviving a number of difficult conditions, such as low nutrient musts and high levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) or sugar. Wines fermented with the K1V-1116 have very low volatile acidity, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and foam production.<br /><br />The K1V-1116 strain tends to express the freshness of white grape varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc and Seyval. The natural fresh fruit aromas are retained longer than with other standard yeast strains. Fruit wines and wines made from concentrates poor in nutrient balance benefit from the capacity of K1V-1116 to adapt to difficult fermentation conditions. Restarts stuck fermentations.<br /><br />Highly recommended for dry whites, aged reds, and late harvest wines.

review/summary: Delicious and fresh...
review/text: Wiley Wallaby licorice is the best!  It is more expensive than 'regular' licorice brands, but it is worth the price (the price is not bad when product is purchased in a pack of 8). Australian licorice is much softer and fresher than regular licorice.  I have trouble finding this brand in regular grocery stores, so often place order through Amazon.

review/summary: Best licorice out there!!
review/text: My husband got me hooked on australian licorice when he brought home some that Target was selling one day.  We went through the 2 big bags in under 3 days, I'm embarrassed to admit!  When Target stopped selling that type (and the new one they carry leaves much to be desired), I started looking around for a new one.  Tried one from Costco that tasted like plastic, and a couple from small shops in the area.  Then I heard Wegman's was carrying a brand and thought I'd give it a whirl.  It was this brand, Wiley Wallaby's red, that I purchased, and we've loved it ever since!  I was completely bummed the other day to see that the spot on the racks where these yummy red snacks sat was taken over by some gourmet chocolates, and I'm really hoping it's not for good.  These are absolutely delicious, hands down the best aussie licorice (which, FYI, is the real deal unlike the Americanized Twizzlers), and hopefully it's not a sign of end given that it's not available here, either.  Would be a crying shame to not have such a sweet treat available in the states!!

review/text: This is REAL licorice. Both the red & black are equally delicious, but flavor & texture completely different of each other.  Flavor is smooth & distinctive while pleasurable to taste. No aftertaste or bitterness. Texture is soft & chewy of which you don't want to stop eating! This is how I remember licorice tasted when I was a child, and now my children crave this. ENJOY!

When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as "MADE IN CHINA". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!<br />One Star is much too high a rating. I had to throw out all the Dogswell products I purchased, Shame on Amazon for selling without disclosing the source!

review/summary: BEWARE - MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I am so appalled at this finding as my dog has been taking these treats for 8 years, now this explains to me why my dog became so ill back in October 2011 and still no diagnosis as doctors kept pumping me for money and told me all tests were negative. I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like "THREE DOG BAKERY" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label "MADE IN CHINA" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it. Thanks again for the reviews and concerns of the caring people out there.

review/summary: Dogswell chicken and apple, banana, sweet potato treats
review/text: I've purchased the 3 types of treats thru Subscribe and Save.  They are no longer supplied by Amazon and I am not surprised. You can still obtain them from other vendors on Amazon.  Be aware they look nothing like the product pictured. The quality has deteriorated and is now poor at best. The apple treats are now nickel sized pieces of apple(more like little sponges)and the chicken strip around the apple is nearly black in color. It is beyond hard. Whats with this?  The ingredients state this is supposed to be chicken breast!  BEWARE-THESE TREATS ARE MADE IN CHINA!!  I cringe to think what may have been substituted.<br /><br />There was no notice by Amazon that these came from China-known for manufacturing deadly dog products.  I would never have purchased them. I suggest you don't either.  My dog no longer eats them.  I have nearly $100 of product.  I can't with a good conscience donate these to the animal shelter or even toss them out for the crows. Inquire as to the country of origin before you buy - "distributed by" doesn't count.  There are many other safe and healthy treats available and they proudly state 'made in America'!

I spent several thousand dollars on vet care and testing.  It never dawned on me it could have been these chews -- I just realized that they were made in China and the brand is listed as one of those implicated according to this month's Whole Dog Journal.  Amazon should stop selling These until the manufacturer stops using their China plant.

review/summary: MADE IN CHINA!!!
review/text: I bought these for my Dalmatian for the first time about a month ago. He LOVED them...so much that even though I only gave him the recommended amount per day for his weight class he STOPPED EATING HIS FOOD.<br /><br />I went in to Petco and spoke with a customer service rep who told me a couple of people had come in with similar experiences. He said he was personally curious about it and did some research online and pulled up some reviews (which we looked up together while I was in the store) of people with the same issue. We discovered Dogswell now makes this product in China. Whether or not that automatically makes it unsafe I don't know but given the other reviews and the sign from my own dog I am no longer willing to risk it. Do some research - google "Dogswell made in china" and decide for yourself.

review/text: On occasion, my daughter and son-in-law will go away and leave their Shitsu (Dodger) with us for a few days visit.  When that happens he seems to come with all the material things that help make him happy.  That includes a large jar of assorted treats. Sometimes I'd wonder why they're called treats because he often doesn't get excited by any of the many varieties that jar contains.  I mentioned this to my daughter and she referred me to this product. We ordered it (from Amazon) on his last visit and I was amazed at how quickly he accepted and consumed them when offered. Unlike others which he might shun or sometimes take and may not actually eat, the Happy Hips treats were always eaten right away. Both Dodger and I rate this product as a "buy now".

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these.  I knew my dog liked sweet potatoes and because I've been buying Dogswell Happy Hips brand treats for years I thought we'd give it a try.  Here's the skinny:<br /><br />They are smaller than the other treats.  This is because they are pieces of dried sweet potato with chicken wrapped around them!  This makes them a bit chewy and thus should work well to aid in the daily cleansing of your dog's teeth.  There is no unpleasant odor, nor is there an oily or greasy residue.  They are the same high quality treats we've become accustomed to buying from Dogswell.  Our dog LOVES them and we'll be buying them again in the future as they are a nice change from the "meat" jerky varieties she has been eating for years.  Next time we'll try apple!

review/text: For them, they just like how they taste.  For me, I like the fact that they have the glucosamine added to them, and that they are just very basic food, chicken and sweet potato.  I would have given this 5 stars if it was made in the US.  I'll probably always, now, be somewhat suspicious of any pet foods or snacks that are made in any part in China.  My older dog is very creaky and arthritic, and so far we haven't found anything that helps ease her pain, so I can't attest to the healing properties of the glucosamine/chondroitin in these snacks, but I figure it can't hurt to feed her foods that contain them.

He is also a picky eater when it comes to treats and he takes these every time.

review/summary: Our Dog Loves These Treats
review/text: Our vet told us to switch our dog to a treat that contained ingredients he hadn't had on a regular basis because we're working to determine what is producing an itchy allergic reaction.  So far it looks like he may be allergic to chicken and maybe corn, neither is in this treat.  Amazon has a better price on this than any other place that carries them. The only problem we have is now the dog tends to "guard" the hall chest where we keep the treats and gaze hopefully at anyone walking through.  :-)<br /><br />Our dog has been getting them for about a month.  While puppy-sitting, I also gave the same treat to my Mom's dog and my brother's dog.  They both went nuts for the treat too.  I'll admit that's not exactly a discriminating audience (they aren't finicky dogs) but it seems to be quite popular.

review/summary: Items were spoiled/faulty
review/text: The initial shipment of treats were spoiled - the sweet potato was moldy inside the bag. Requested replacement and they were the same. Obviously these have been stored somewhere unsuitable and they were ruined. Have given up trying to convey this to Amazon as they obviously don't get it...

review/summary: Breakfast for Stella
review/text: Stella starts her day with chicken and banana treats or chicken and apple.  My little rescue dog loves her treat and waits patiently for it every morning.  I can only tell you that it must be tasty because she is both happy and satisfied ... A wonderful way to start her day. This is a great product and I recimmend it!

review/summary: Zeus LOVES these !!!
review/text: Our 150 lb, 8 year old bullmastiff absolutely loves these.  When he hears us say "happy hips" his ears perk up and he follows us everywhere.  The infusion of glucosamine was just ingenious for a snack that apparently tastes so great!  We're on a monthly subscription so we don't run out!

review/summary: Unhappy hips! supplied by AMAZON
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141OWXU">Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality Sweet Potato Chew Treats for All Dogs, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>A year ago these treats were perfect and my pooch loved them, "just what the doctor ordered". HOWEVER, the recent shipments have been of inferior quality, poor quality. The product is dried-up and as far as my dog is concerned, unacceptable. She refuses to eat the treats and walks away from them. While the expiration date is in 2012 the product has to be tossed, it is anything but fresh.<br /><br />What illuminates this even more is that the local pet store is now stocking these treats. At the pet store, the products look and are soft and well managed and loved by the pooch. Clearly the treats from the AMAZON vendor is without quality and may have been rejects.<br /><br />While the cost in the pet store is much higher, it is well worth it.  Proves that you get what you pay for. If  it is 'Happy Hips' that your dog likes go the pet store or perhaps AMAZON will find a quality supplier.
