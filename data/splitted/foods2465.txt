review/summary: The best protein snack
review/text: I am vegan and just came across this product not too long ago. It is the BEST snack. I've tried different flavors and I tend to like the Texas BBQ ones the best. The texture is just like meat and its healthier for you.

review/summary: Surprising
review/text: And it's a good surprise!  I was cautious, expecting either something with no resemblance to meat, or something so rubbery as to be inedible.  Sure, the texture is not EXACTLY like real jerky, it's a bit liquidy for that.  But for a vegan product, outstanding!  It's chewy without being rubbery, far juicier than real jerky(which is a good thing), and tastes spot on.  Granted, the Texas BBQ doesn't taste the way I'd thought it would(I was expecting a tomato-y BBQ sauce flavor), but it's very good, with just the right amount of smoke.  I can't wait to try more flavors!

review/summary: Yummy - even for non-vegetarians!
review/text: I've been a vegetarian for 10 years (all of my 20s) and absolutely love it!  Lately I've been really looking for good healthy protein sources that I actually like to eat, and these Primal Strips are excellent!  These things scare me because they are so realistically meat-like.<br />I've tried 3 flavors of them so far, and there was only 1 that I thought wasn't great.  It was completely edible, but the texture was just not as good as the others.  I think it was the Teriyaki that I didn't like so much, but I really liked the Texas Barbecue and the Hickory Smoked flavors.<br /><br />These are excellent low-calorie, low-fat, convenient, tasty snacks with high amounts of protein.  You can take them anywhere, keep them in your desk at work or in your purse!<br /><br />The only complaint I have about these is that I wish there were versions with lower sodium.  To me, as someone who loves a good salty snack, but knows that too much salt is not good and tries to avoid it, these taste too salty.  And 300+ mg of sodium per strip seems high.<br /><br />But in the end I am overlooking the sodium and am purchasing these in bulk now!  I just bought the Thai Peanut flavor because I love spicy foods, and I love Thai food!  I'll update this review with my thoughts on this flavor after I receive them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the Thai Peanut flavor and LOVE them!  They have a great chewy texture, good flavor, and a good amount of spice.  All for only 74 calories each, but 10g protein!  I definitely recommend these!

review/summary: OMG!!!!
review/text: I just wanted to say that I picked up my first single serving of Primal Spirit Texas BBQ Meatless Vegan Jerky today at my local Home Economist while searching for Gluten Free products (I'm new at this so its an adventure everytime I go into the store!).<br /><br />Now, I am going to say that I am 100% Carnivore!! And I am a absoulte jerky fanatic as I've had it made out of Beef, Deer, Rabbit, Fish, Bison, Buffalo, and even Turkey Jerky!<br /><br />But I can honestly say, this was fantastic! It had a nice stringy texture, like actual meat. Was flavored nicely, a little mosit, and it left me wanting more!<br /><br />I'm glad I bought only one as I think I could have eaten several :)<br /><br />Also, love the fact its only 81 Calories, with 1g of Fat but still has 10g's of Protein!!

review/summary: A Vegan must have
review/text: I have bought two boxes of these now and love them.  My first box came from a local health food store and the second came from Amazon.  Yum Yum.  As a Vegan I never heard of these, but I have seen them on the shelf at my local health food store.  So one day I bought two packs.  I loved them.  Went back and bought the rest of the box.  That store could not get them in fast enough so I bought from Amazon.  I really like them.  The lime flavor is the one that I have tried.  I will try the other flavors soon.

review/text: My husband loves these.  They are pretty good.  They are moist so they are not like "real" jerky in that sense but otherwise the texture is very similar.  I wish they had a variety that wasn't so sweet but I definitely recommend trying some before getting an entire package - luckily I got to try each of them, which are all good.

review/summary: Really good!
review/text: I ordered the hickory smoked soy jerky, and was very impressed. It had some type of sauce on it that surprised me (don't know if this is typical of all flavors), but was delicious. I have in the last few months purchased the Vegan Dreams variety pack...a drier, thinner and chewier product, but not necessarily less tasty. The sauciness on my Primal hickory smoked might lend itself to heating it up for different vegan meals, as it is more juicy. I look forward to trying the other varieties.<br />I just tried the Texas Bar-b-que, and I really like this flavor as well. This version seems to be a bit less "saucy", but just as moist and delicious. It does have a "stringy" texture to it that makes dental floss a must! In the search for a good veggie jerky, I am leaning towards the Primal line.

review/text: I bought this product by accident one morning at a local deli, and I was very surprised when I first ate it.  Granted, you can easily tell (and I was scared because I was expecting beef jerky when I first bit it) that it is not meat.  But, as an alternative, it is very tasty, and I did end up buying it again.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (10g protein, 3g fat, 8g carbs.). The Hickory Smoked variety is very flavorful with a little bit of a spicy kick. The texture is somewhat firm, which I enjoy, but it often gets stuck between my teeth so I always need to have some dental floss handy. I would say that of all the varieties of Primal Strips, this is currently my favorite.

review/summary: Mesquite Lime is my favorite!
review/text: I've tried all flavors of Primal Spirit Vegan Jerky and the Mesquite Lime is my personal favorite, but it depends on your taste. If you're a fan of limes as I am, you'll love this flavor. Its a bit tart. It is also a very tender texture as compared with the others. The Hot and Spicy flavor is my second favorite. It has the toughest texture which is closest to regular jerky and is the only one made from mostly mushrooms. It is a bit spicy if you never eat spicy foods!

review/summary: Seriously Delish!
review/text: WOW! This product is simply delicious. Nice texture, almost like shredded beef(better than beef jerky in my opinion) and the spices for this flavor is just right! A combination of smokey, salty and sweet. The only problem I have with it is trying to stop eating it! I know it is packed with protein, low in fat and only 81 calories, but the carb content (11 grams per serving)seems pretty high for just one strip. Just have to watch my consumption :oD Although, I have replaced a meal with two primal strips and lost about 5 pounds this week. All in all, this is an exceptional meat alternative snack.

review/text: This is a pretty good snack food.  I don't miss meat, but i do miss the seasonings put on it.  This is very tasty and has a nice texture.  A packet is 4 servings, and 100 calories per serving, pretty much equal protein and carbs, so it's a high protein food for most people.<br /><br />Problems: the inner packaging isn't that easy to deal with, a knife is needed to cut it open.  So not a great on-the-go food.  Also, there is not a lot of volume for the 400 calories, so it's not a good food if you are watching your weight.

review/summary: Cornbread Mix is Excellent
review/text: My sister sent me one package of this Martha White "Sweet Yellow Cornbread and Muffin Mix". I did not cook it for several months but finally got around to it. I found the mix to be easy to prepare and the results were very good. I was concerned that the results might be too smooth (for the lack of a better description). Actually, the results are porous. This is good since it allows for the mix to absorb butter or syrup, etc easily. I cooked the single package (7 ounce) in a 5x9 inch pan. This worked out good and the end result was a loaf about 1-1/2 inches high. The bottom was beginning to brown and should not have been cooked longer. I ended up cooking the mix 20 minutes and the results were perfect. I did not eat all of the mix the first day. The next day I cut the cornbread into one inch squares. Then, I put butter on the squares and warmed them about 18 seconds in the microwave. I enjoyed them with cheese on the side and put a bit of syrup on the squares of cornbread. It was really a treat and tasted more like a desert than just a serving of cornbread. Also, I did not use regular sweet milk. I use undiluted Carnation Evaporated Milk. I wondered how this might work (since I did not dilute the milk) but found it to work very well. I recommend this product.<br /><br />Next time I'll cook two packages at one time and I plan to use a 9x9 inch pan to keep the end results being about 1-1/2 inches thick. This way the bottom will not get too brown (in my off-hand opinion since I have not tried this yet).

review/text: I enjoy Fettucine. I've tried most of the major brands, and some are pretty good as far as flavor and consistency, but DeCecco is the best, especially if you prefer your pasta 'al dente,' or slightly firm. Cooked this way the noodles really shine, with a even consistency and delicious flavor.<br /><br />You do need to make sure that you stir the pasta as it cooks as the noodles tend to stick together for the first 5 minutes or so in the boiling water. I find that adding a tablespoon of olive oil helps out immensely.<br /><br />These go really well with homemade Alfredo sauce, as well as simply garlic, olive oil, and your favorite vegetables tossed together.

review/summary: best instant
review/text: First let me say my personal taste is for light roast coffee. Starbucks and other dark roast coffee just taste burn to me.<br />I always buy a new instant when I see it hoping to find one that is palatable. I will drink Taster's Choice if there is nothing else to drink. Like all instant it has a funny solvent or chemical taste to me.<br />Tchibo has actual hints of a nutty complex coffee taste and NO chemical taste. I did a blind taste test for my wife which is a game we often enjoy playing and she liked the Tchibo better too.<br />Properly brewed fresh roast Kona is still better. But this is good for camping and the emergency pantry. Not just tolerable. I've also found that a small amount of water soluble fiber (the sort that mix to a clear liquid) added to the instant improves the flavor. I suspect some of the undesirable flavors bind to it in the hot cup.

review/summary: very best tomato paste, very little waste
review/text: I always keep a few tubes of this Mutti Tomato paste in my pantry. The flavor is a very fresh tasting robust tomato taste; it helps thicken and adds wonderful flavor to my soups and sauces.<br /><br />The label has lots of useful information, including -<br /><br />* ingredients: Italian tomatoes, salt.<br />* the recommendation refrigerate after opening and discard the unused portion after 20 days.<br />* a serving size is 2T and a 4.5oz tube has approximately 7 servings.<br />* processed using a dehydration method that results in 28% dry extract of the tomatoes<br />* certified as using environmentally friendly cultivation methods<br /><br />If it could be stored longer than 20 days (like ketchup) I would give it a fifth star but I often either store it longer than the recommended date and worry about food safety or I wind up throwing out the unused portion which is not particularly cost effective.<br /><br />Still, a far superior taste than any canned paste I have tried so I'll continue to buy and enjoy it.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is just absolutely fantastic tea!  The mint flavor is so pure and refreshing and there is not much sugar in the drink.  It's also completely USDA Organic, QAI Organic,Halal, and Kosher & Pareve - this is a drink that is truly good for you.  For one 12oz bottle there are 60 calories, 5mg sodium, 0 fat, 15g carbs, 14g sugar, and 0g protein.  Numi also donates 1% of net profits to benefit social, environmental & sustainable causes.  I highly recommend this, along with the rest of Numi's Puerh line of bottled teas.

review/summary: Great! Except for shipping...
review/text: I absolutely LOVE international delight creamers, so to get the single-serve packages that last for months and months was an absolute MUST for me.  I have no problems with the product and I think that the price is great, however my major issue was with the product upon arrival.<br /><br />When I received my product, the bottom of the box was partially soaked through, due to some handling issues, or poor packaging, I assume.  Several of the packages were open and had spilled all over the box and other creamers.  Since it was such a small problem, I saw no point in returning it, but it was a real pain having to go through each creamer and clean them of the stickiness.  This is the only reason why I can't give it a full 5/5 stars.  Other than that, great product!

review/summary: Not best option
review/text: There's nothing wrong with the product itself. I've been using the French Vanilla creamer for some time now and am very happy with it. However, this bulk option may not be the best approach. It comes as one big box full of the individual creamers and during transit several had burst. The result is that you have to wash each individual creamer to remove the sticky residue. I found 4 damaged ones (not a huge loss among 288) but every creamer was sticky. I think I'll go with the multi-packs next time rather than bulk. Be warned.

review/summary: Great Coffee Creamer
review/text: I really like this liquid creamer. I have had no problems with them spilling open in the carton. They are packed loosely in the box, but then placed into another box for shipping. These single count creamers makes it better for me because I don't have to worry about refrigeration only to keep the box in a cool area. I like the fact that this creamer has milk and cream in the ingredients rather than non dairy products as some of the other creamers have. This is my favorite flavor, but ID makes many very good flavors.

review/summary: It's just OK
review/text: The product listing is a little strange - there's no 12 anything (12 count sounds like 12 items). What you will actually receive is six 16 oz packages. Maybe the 12 refers to servings, if you made two meals out of one pouch at one cup per serving.<br /><br />The chili itself is just OK, it's very soupy, heavy on the tomato base, with just a hint of spice. I wouldn't exactly break this out to serve to guests, but for my intended purposes of packing it along on the Trans-Siberian, it will do just fine. The package can be ripped open, so no need for scissors or a knife. I think that after I have used up this order, I will be unlikely to re-purchase. It's not that it's bad, it's just not that good - but it will make a nice break from cup-o-noodles.

Oneday, I just gave it a shot in Amazon and amazingly they had it (and they still do as of this writing).  I pretty much use this seasoning on everything from grilling to baking and it goes well with any kind of meat, poulty or sea food.  If you like it spicy, try this; you will love it.  It is not terribly hot, mild but loaded with good spicy flavor.

review/text: I have used Sylvia's Secret Seasoning for years. I originally wanted a good blend of herbs and spices WITHOUT salt so I did not have to keep 6 or 7 spice jars around. Sylvia's Seasoning provides just that and is great on meats, vegetables, soups, stews, casseroles, etc. I disregard the recipe's instructions for a specific item and add the equivalent of Sylvia's. I have never been disappointed. It is especially good for spaghetti and really brings flavor to slow cooked foods. I have given jars of this seasoning to friends and family and all just love it. Thanks! Large quantity purchase is good for gifts!

review/summary: Very good product!
review/text: I have started to add turmeric root powder to my diet for its anti-inflammatory properties. I wanted to increase the quantity and needed to find a bulk supplier. The Indus Organic Turmeric powder has exceeded my expectations. It is more aromatic than what I had been using and it feels like it is more effective, but that may be my imagination.<br /><br />Suggested uses:<br />- Added to my vegetarian, organic protein drink, it actually improves the flavor! It tasted good before adding the turmeric, I did not expect the flavor to improve. I add one teaspoon of turmeric powder to my protein drink that uses a fruit juice base. I use a Whole Foods organic fruit juice blend of pineapple, orange and banana. The protein powders are from Vibrant Health: Pure Green Protein (vanilla flavor), Green Vibrance and Rainbow Vibrance.<br /><br />- Added to soups. I have tried this with various lentil soups and a chunky tomato soup. All very successful improvements in flavor, in addition to getting the health benefits. The brand of soup I prefer is Amy's.<br /><br />The product is packaged well and arrived when promised. I will be a regular customer!

Not only is it good for you(like a lot of other extra virgin olive oils), I look for one that is cold press (uses no heat in their process).  Heat cuases chemical changes to the oil.  Cold press olive oils can still create some natural heat in its process, and cause some change to the oil, but my understanding is that Bariani is  specially careful to not create any heat in their cold press process.

review/summary: This makes that margarita that you have been looking for!
review/text: If you have ever had one of those "to die for" margaritas when out, then this is probably what was used.  This is one of the very best mixes I have tasted.  And being from Texas, I have drank some margaritas!  You can't go wrong with this mix, just buy it!  You'll see.

review/summary: Disappointed with OVERPRICE of product
review/text: I was so exicted about this product when I found it on line and bought it with my new Coffee maker, then over the next weekend saw the EXACT same product in Bed, Bath and Beyond for $20 cheaper.  And when mine came in it was missing the Hot Chocolate.  I have never been disappointed in AMAZON before, but I really will look at my purchases MUCH more in the future.

review/summary: Way Too Expensive
review/text: I have just bought at BJ's a box of 80 K-cups (Green Mountain 100% Colombian dark roast extra bold)for $37 (that is 46.25 cents per cup). I found it similarly priced at Sam's. Do the math and compare. The moral of this comparison is that not everything is cheaper at Amazon specially when Amazon is only the middle man, so to speak.

review/text: I thought this was a poor assortment as I was looking for coffee, not tea or hot chocolate.  Perhaps I should have read the details a little closer.  However, this assortment is way over priced.  You can get 4 boxes of 24 count K Cups from Green Mountain for $45.00 +/-.  Perhaps it is a good assortment to get started but I was disappointed in the mix.

review/text: This coffee is un-drinkable. I am so upset that I just spend $50 on all of these coffee cups and I have to actually throw them out! I am not a coffee snob my any means. But I am able to detect a disgusting plastic and stale aftertaste. I am so disappointed! After taking my first sip, I looked at the expiration date on all of the cups. They expired either 10 days ago or are about to expire next week. What a waste!

review/text: I'm sorry I didn't say so sooner. I love my Keurig coffee maker that I received as a gift. We don't use it on a daily basis only because my husband likes to have a pot. Set in his ways I guess, but with only the two of us I do understand his view, with that said - when we have company come over - that's when this is put to good use. I loved all the varieties in the box. Sincerely, Kelly M

review/text: I bought a Keurig for the Holidays and I love it.  When I read that it only came with a handful of K-cups, I searched this variety pack up and I wasn't disappointed.  It comes with a great sampling of coffees.  The only downside was that I thought it came with a few to many decaf K-cups however, as it turned out, I had some relatives over that only drink decaf.  If you're new to Keurig and K-cups, this is a great starter kit.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Great delivery time, yet....
review/text: A trip with my partner to Rehoboth gave me my first experience using a Keurig coffee maker, which prompted my purchasing a machine upon my arrival home. While I was pleased with the selection of the coffees and teas offered in this set, and was impressed with the promptness of the delivery, I was disappointed that, after ordering this set, I was able to find the same item at a local retailer for less money.<br /><br />This comes as a surprise to me, as Amazon usually has the best prices anywhere. I hope to have a better experience in the future. While Amazon Prime was very convenient for speedy free delivery, I could not cancel the order when I found it cheaper; I had ordered it on Saturday night and by ten o'clock on Sunday morning, I could not cancel the order.<br /><br />I rely on Amazon for great selection and the best prices; I will not be doing so again for coffee.

review/summary: Price issues aside, a nice variety
review/text: Got this pack with my new Cuisinart.  Seems like a good variety of different brands of coffees and teas.  So far have like most things, but some things to note:<br /><br />There's only one type of decaf coffee.  So if you're a big decaf drinker, you may not like this pack.<br /><br />Most of the coffees aren't "extra bold" so taste a little weak to me on the 8 oz setting.  If you like your coffee strong, use the 6 oz setting on your machine if it's not "extra bold".<br /><br />Tea is good, but also not as strong as I like it.<br /><br />Hot chocolate is just ok.  Be sure to rinse out your machine after you use it.

review/text: When something is called a "flavored" variety pack, wouldn't you think it contained all flavored coffee?  It doesn't.  I should have read the description of what's actually contained in this variety pack more closely.  There are very few flavored coffee Kcups.  The whole thing is almost all a variety of different non-flavored coffee.  What a disappointment.
