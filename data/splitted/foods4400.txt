review/summary: Jelly Belly Flops
review/text: I like the Jelly Belly beans.  They are fat free and made from natural ingredients.  The flops may be odd-shaped, but they taste the same as the perfectly-shaped Jelly Bellies.  If you want more variety, you need to order at least two bags. They will send you one bag with more variety.  You never know what flavors you will receive, but I enjoy eating any flavor.  So for the price, it's a good deal.  If you are particular about a certain flavor, spend more for the regular bags.  They are worth it.

review/text: We like most of the jelly belly flavors, so I didn't think I would be taking a big risk in ordering these even if we got only a few different beans--as I read in other reviews. Wow! Were we surprised at the great mix! Just one of our three bags had at least 27 different flavors (then I stopped counting), with no particular color predominating. The other bags also appear to contain a wide variety. I don't know if we just got lucky, or if the factory has started including more different flavors in the belly flops bags, but this was a great deal for us and I will definitely be ordering again.

review/summary: I love Jelly Belly jelly beans and these were cheaper than the "perfect" ones.
review/text: It was great to get jelly belly beans in the form of "flops" because I saved money by getting the ones that were a little misshaped or didn't have the jelly belly imprint on them.  The only drawback is that you never know what flavors you will get.  So if you luck out and get your favorites in the bag, you'll really enjoy them.  I happened to get a bag mostly full of the red cherry ones, and I'm not a real fan of that, so I can't give this a full 5 stars in my review.  But if I had gotten a bag with more of my favorites in them, I would definitely be raving about this product.

review/text: I had been to the Jelly Belly store and knew of flops. I was excited they finally offered them on-line. From what I figured, you get a bag of what was the high season a few months ago, expect red flavors a few months after valentine's day, oranges & yellows after the fall. My on-line order of 4 bags showed 2 of same mix. They are what they say, flops but tasty. My staff of 25 didnt complain of the colors or flavors when they received them as gifts. They commented on their true flavor and the cute misshapes. I feel if you want a particular flavor, buy the smaller bags at the store, which is way more pricey by the pound and you get what you want. I appreciate Jelly Belly for offering their flops on-line.

review/text: I put a jar of Belly Flops on my kitchen counter instead of my regular Jelly Bellies. Everyone who pulled out misshapen ones wanted to know if they were Jelly Bellies because of their shapes. It was fun watching the light go on when I informed them that they were Belly Flops! They're disappearing faster than usual because there are so many different flavors to try!<br />They did seem just a little bit stale, hence my 4 star rating. Perhaps they should be offered 4 times a year with flavors and colors to match the season? Then they wouldn't have a chance to get stale!

review/summary: Great product @ Great PRICE  :)
review/text: WOW - For the price and the TASTE - these little no namers are EXCELLENT!  They taste just like Jelly Bellys - which they should, the poor little guys are just not perfect .... So we keep to reap the rewards of having them cost less!  Yeah me!  I love this idea - to bad more candy companies don't do this...It would drive sales to there sites too!  You should take your contest and such, marketing - to "YOU TUBE"  If you do.... Don't forget I told you so!!!!  People need to also understand how you make jelly bellys and READ YOUR WEBSITE, before ordering the flops and hodge podge mixes so they will know why they sometimes get alot of the same colors in the mixes!

review/summary: Satisfied with the Flops
review/text: I ordered the promotion of buy three 2 lb bags of the flops, get 1 free and was kinds worried about the other reviews I had read, but love Jelly Belly so I thought what the heck. I received my order and had 1 bag that was mostly dark colors and 1 that was mostly reds and greens, but the other 2 were a pretty good variety. My kids and I are not extremely picky about what flavors we get, so I will most likely order again. ;)

They had a buy two bags of flops and get two free special and they had a case price. I understand if the online specials aren't as good as getting them right from the source, but some sort of bulk discount would be nice. Aside from that the Flops are so yummy and so much fun.

review/summary: The joy from a JellyBelly.
review/text: I found this site after calling the JellyBelly company. I then ordered, JellyBelly flops, my entire family was looking forward, to the arrival, of the mysterious JellyBelly flops. When they arrived the entire family,<br />watched as we opened the box, we all went ahh........! They looked great,<br />so we opened one package, and we all set down, and tried to discover all the wonderful flavors. We all fell in love with the JellyBelly flops at that very moment. Now we never let our stock get low. We re-order all the time. The price is great. It makes my whole family smile, when the box arrives, with all the wonderful flavors packed inside. We all know that we will soon be lavising in  own little, JellyBelly heaven. Thank you so much, for the joy you have brought my family. It is amazing how a little tiny piece of sweetness can bring so much joy.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Diana Proesch<br />Rockville, Indiana

review/summary: Poor quality control
review/text: Belly Flops are supposed to be misshapen Jelly Bellys, but just as good, as they come from exactly the same production line as "perfect" Jelly Bellies.  The quality of the flops doesn't seem to be an issue, just the quality of the assortment.  The manufacturer doesn't seem, in my opinion, to put much effort in creating a good assortment of flavors, they just bag whatever flops are produced at the time.  My two bags of mostly root beer and coffee had only about 200 beans of another flavor.  I don't like root beer at all, and only slightly like coffee, so about a pound of each bag went in the trash.  This means I paid about $16/pound for what I actually ate.  Sometimes you get what you pay for, not what's advertised.  What I'd really like to see is Jelly Belly offer quantities of Jelly Bellies and/or Belly Flops in single flavors you could pick.  I'd place my order for 5 pounds of licorice now.  James salt water taffy does this, why not Jelly belly?

There are some freakishly huge jellybelly monsters in there though: five or six ugly mutants all fused into a sugar bomb you can barely get in your mouth, or weird distorted oddball shapes. Some of the colors also seem...not right.<br /><br />Once you start chewing you can't tell any of this of course, which is why this is such a good bargain.

review/summary: Worth the Money
review/text: As a fan of Jelly Belly jelly beans, I went to their Web site to order the 50-flavors box. However, with the only option of $8 shipping (making my order total over $20), I bitterly decided against it. Then, I saw a link on the site to Belly Flops. They were only $8 (instead of $15), and the shipping was half that of the first item I looked at.<br /><br />I was somewhat worried that because the Belly Flops ordering page stated that if you buy more than one bag, you're guaranteed to get a variety of flavors. Did this mean that since I was ordering one bag that I would get only half the flavors... or less?<br /><br />When the package arrived, I opened it to find a huge bag of many-varied jelly beans, all pleasantly distorted in shape. I had paid less than $15 for a bag I haven't been able to finish yet! (It's been weeks since the bag arrived.) I've very pleased with the purchase.

review/summary: Better The First Time
review/text: We have ordered Belly Flops two times now (1 bag then a 2 bag order). The first bag was great and had lots of different flavors!! The second order of 2 bags had like 4 or 5 flavors in both of them. The whole bag!! We were so disappointed because we sent one to family in France and had to tell them, sorry that there were only 4 flavors. We are a little hesitant to order again.

review/summary: Worth Every Cent
review/text: I have a colleague who is hooked on jelly bellies.  He keeps them in a jar on his desk and offers them to students. Periodically I buy him some to make sure the jar is filled.  I was delighted to discover the jelly bellies at a significantly reduced price because they are "flops."  They taste as good and they're even a conversation piece.  I don't know how often the sale is on, but it certainly was an excellent buy!

review/text: My husband loves jelly bellies, and I enjoy them from time to time.  I ordered 2 bags for a great deal and loved all of them!  One bag was all dark ones and the other was all bright colors!  I opened both bags and mixed them in a big jar.  My husband and I are constantly walking by grabbing handfuls and commenting on what we got.  Will definately buy more!!!!

review/text: We bought these directly at the Jelly Belly factory in Fairfield, CA.  The tour was a lot of fun and the Flops are definitely worth it.  I like not knowing what I may eat next, but I do hope that there are no Bertie Bott's flops mixed in...

review/text: Love those Belly Flops!  Unfortunately, one of my last 2 bags was 40-50% Cafe Latte.  Not a very good mix; and certainly not appreciated by my kids or wife (who doesn't drink coffee).  The 2nd bag had a better variety and my kids and their friends wolfed them down.  You roll the dice, you take your chances...

review/summary: bellyflops are no flop
review/text: We love to get the belly flops - our teenagers take them to parties and are greatly entertained having everyone try different flavors.  Everyone has a favorite flavor and we eventually find someone who likes the ones others didn't, so few go to waste.  We buy enough that there is always an amazing mix even if a few bags are not quite the mix we like...

review/text: Ya pop one in your mouth & enjoy.... that's the whole reason for these little guys to exist, so who's to say they're flops? I disagree wholeheartedly; they are PERFECT!!! My mouth doesn't care what they look like 'cause every single, beautiful gem is just as yummy as their so-called perfect lil' brothers & sisters! The adventure of discovery enhances each reach into the bag. Just let your tongue reveal whatever flavor happens to come up. After all, life's a gamble so let this be a pleasurable roll of the snack food dice!

review/summary: I LOVED THEM
review/text: I am a first time buyer of Jelly Flops, which arrived shortly after I ordered them; great variety, lots of Pears, which I didn't think I liked (saved them until I'd had eaten all the others), then went back and ate them all -- they were pretty good.  I wanted to order more, but after reading reviews, I'm afraid I might get lots of 1-2 flavors and not enough of my favs.

review/text: I ordered 3 bags so I could get a good assortment.  WRONG All 3 bags were the same, sticked together like a brick.  No joke! it took 1 1/2 weeks to reach me.  Grandchildren were upset since they didn't get theirs.  They were too sticky and messy.  Spent almost $30 on this.  Will not order in the hot months again.  But my son loved them. LOL sticked together, sticky and all.  What can I say he loves Jelly Bellies anyway he can get them.  Unless it's butter popcorn and coffee flavorers. All in all I was disappointed in the quality of the goods when I received them.

review/summary: Flip for flops
review/text: I ordered two bags of the flops.  I agree with some of the other posters in saying the variety isn't that great.  One bag had mostly dark colored beans....cappuccino, chocolate pudding, and some kind of grape-ish one.  However, I was extremely excited to see that there were some smoothie blends included since those aren't that easy to find.  I also liked how they had some sassy sours.  I would say, from the two bags, 75% were the three flavors I mentioned above, but the other 25% were a good variety.Plus, all beans were extremely fresh, which was a huge bonus.

review/summary: Not what we expected
review/text: We received a 2 pound bag and 80% was chocolate pudding beans,10% was coffee and Very few other flavors. I expected more of a variey since jelly belly's has HUNDREDS of flavors. Unfortunatly our family does not care for chocolate pudding or coffee flavored beans, so this was a waste of time and money for us. I don't think we will be ordering this again.
