review/summary: The "Green Pearl" of Tea.
review/text: Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the "green pearl" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself "home of silk and tea" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name "gunpowder" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.

review/text: The Potato & Spinach is one of my favorites from Patak's.  (I also love the Vegetable Korma and the Butter Chicken.)  I found these at the local grocery store & decided to give them a try, since they're easy to store a few extras at work without needing to take extra freezer space in the lunchroom.  I love the flavor and the spice, and the meal is nicely filling.  I clear the shelf when the store has these on sale.

review/text: What can I say? They're pretzels. Crunchy, tasty, lightly salted. I don't treat myself often, but football season is here and I'm already sick of trying to make an apple last an entire game. Just didn't cut it. I needed something crunchier and less healthy to really enjoy the games.<br /><br />Got a whole case of these babies so it is a good thing they are tasty and really fresh. Think I may have enough to feed the entire Super Bowl stadium and then some...<br /><br />Good value, good product, excellent packaging both for shipping and for the product itself.

review/text: I'm trying to save money with alp few subscribe and save deals on amazon and I thought I'd give these a whirl and make my own smaller packs for toddler snacks on the road. Theyre the oerfect size for my guy- he enjoys them daily. They're my favorite because I like to dip food in other food and these waffle-type pretzels offer a ton of surface area for my dipping needs.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, a pretzel is a pretzel- but these are good. Oh! And 20 to a serving size! That's a nice little snack!

review/summary: SNYDERS OF HANOVER PRETZEL SNAPS, 10-OUNCE BAGS(PACK OF 12)
review/text: A great tasting pretzel by Snyder's of Hanover of Pennsylvania and very easy between 2 people on a movie night finishing a bag throughout several hours. I got a couple of cases(Pack Of 12) shipped free to my home from Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for a rate of $16.99/per case *24 bags total*. They were very fresh, NOT SALTY like many pretzels are, and perfect mouth popping tic-tac-toe looking size pieces. Highly recommended pretzel for lovers of such product, on a diet, and great bargain if available at price I paid seeing that normally they would cost you according to price on bag @ $2.49/per X 12 = $29.88 full price!!! Bargain hunt like I do and enjoy your pretzels with family and friends during movie nights, sporting events, by yourself, etc..

review/text: This was a quick and easy way to make cupcakes, which would be great for beginning bakers. Just pour water into the container, shake it up and pour into the muffin tin.  I really liked not having to clean up more dishes and the cupcakes were very tasty.<br /><br />However, I felt like a lot of batter was still in the jug and was wasted. I tried to put a spatula in there and made a big mess. I would have liked to have had the confetti in a separate package (perhaps on the lid). We're trying to avoid artificial food coloring and I would have probably left that out.<br /><br />I gave this product three stars because I feel the pros and cons were equal to each other.

review/text: This tea has lots of flavors.  I first started loving Chai tea about 8 years ago.  I have tried many of the boxed liquid teas and I do like them.  I have preferred the brand Einstein bagles uses, but since I have a Starbucks close by, have grown to like the one they use as well.  My favorite is the "masala" tea made my a local Indian restaurant.  This most closely approximates that.  I am still trying to replicate it, but for now, this is the best I can do.  I really like this tea.<br /><br />As a bonus, if I forget to empty the basket when I leave work, when I get in the next day, the whole area smells great!

I looked high and low in standard and gourmet grocery stores, Asian markets and health-food stores but nothing worked as well as this rice. You can find lots of good recipes online, but the best way to make sticky rice with mango is with full-fat coconut milk in a traditional Thai rice steamer (which Amazon sells as well).

review/text: My two dogs USED TO LOVE these treats. Just the right size - not giant (and therefore affordable) but they still took a while for them to chew through. These WERE their favorite treats. And they were healthy and good for their teeth and gums.<br />But having received a recent re-order, I am now editing my own review and downgrading from five stars to one. THEY HAVE CHANGED THESE TREATS. They are NOT WRAPPED IN CHICKEN anymore. They have some kind of PAINT on them instead of chicken. It doesn't even smell like chicken. This is so disappointing. If you are re-ordering these thinking you'll get the old wonderful Chewritos - you won't. Change is significant enough that I recommend NOT ORDERING. It's misleading labeling. It's NOT a chicken wrap. It is a rawhide wrap that has been dipped in some kind of chemical/yeast/smoke flavor coating.

When I went to re-order, I read the review about the treats now being "basted" with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird, because my order was the same. That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched. We are both VERY disappointed -- not at Amazon, but at the manufacturer for changing their product

review/text: Retracted my ringing endorsement of the product from 6 months ago.  Like other reviewers, I just now experienced Beefeaters (the manufacturers) switch from an excellent product to one that is subpar at best. Even more insulting is the dramatic increase in price $5.99 to $8.99-$10.99 per pack) for this terrible product. My pug will no longer touch these "duck wraps", the product name is false advertising at best. Previously these rawhides were wrapped with dried duck.  Now they are spray painted orange and smell funny.  I have nothing against the online sellers of this product.  However these sellers should contact Beefeaters and voice concern about losing so many loyal buyers.  And the buyers?  Well all of us should contact Beefeaters customer service and voice your disappointment regarding the duck wrap product change. Fingers crossed we can get back to the excellent duck wraps of the past for our beloved dogs!

I contacted Beefeaters and they have not responded. This company is advertising falsely and making a huge profit on this garbage!! Save your money and start looking for a new product.

They are definietly a favorite and keep them occupied for extended periods of time.  The only down side is they leave little crumbs on the floor...although, Sami always goes back and cleans up after herself!

review/summary: Not Raw Almond Butter
review/text: If the government says you can lie, then it's okay to lie? California almonds are not raw except for a few loopholes, so why is this company saying these are raw when they're not? Because the USDA says they can!<br />Trader Joe's uses the same "legal lie" about their almonds and almond butters but that doesn't make it right.<br />Artisana, the manufacturer says the process of making the butter only reaches 115 degrees but they leave out the part about the almonds are already partially cooked.<br />You can buy truly raw almond butter from unpasteurized organic almonds but this isn't it. "California almonds" is the giveaway.<br />Google unpasteurized raw almond butter if you want the real thing.

review/text: I think the negative reviews are a little harsh. This company is not alone in labeling their almonds raw even though they are most likely pasteurized. Is it right. I agree no, but when it comes to almond butter no matter what your choices are going to be either organic or not. So at least you know they are being grown healthier than the alternative.<br /><br />ALL almonds in the United States are pasteurized. You can go to health food/ co-oop store and most likely find imported raw almonds ( my store has some from Italy), but if you go to Whole Foods they are also going to try and sell you "raw" almonds that are not truly raw. Everyone seems to be in on the mislabeling.<br /><br />Anyway...google it and get educated if your interested.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great tasting organic almond butter at decent price you won't be disappointed with this one. As I scanned the negative reviews I don't think I remember them commenting that the taste wasn't great.<br /><br />For what's it's worth I tried Vitamixing my imported truly raw almonds to make my own almond butter, but still doesn't taste as good as this.

review/summary: Great taste! ( pasteurized? )
review/text: After reading the bad reviews I decided to investigate about pasteurization of Almonds in California..and here is what I found<br />Are Your Almonds Pasteurized?<br /><br />Recently there has been much confusion in the popular press regarding the requirement of "pasteurization" of Almonds.  We are asked over and over if our Almonds are "pasteurized".<br /><br />The answer to this is very complex, and we will be updating information about Un Pasteurized Almonds on a weekly basis.  If you want to read and stay current on the legal issues surrounding this topic, then please click here /unpasteurized.htm<br /><br />Important News About Our Shippable Almond Crop !<br /><br />D&S Ranches, an Orchard Grower in the San Joaquin Valley of California, has an Important Announcement to make regarding Pasteurization of our Naturally Grown California Almonds!  After the Almond Board Rule went into effect we began to extensively research the Best, most Non-Intrusive methods available to reduce bacteria on the skin of the nut without affecting the nut meat itself.<br /><br />The Good News:<br /><br />The Good news is that we have found a process that does just that !  This method was developed for the Spices Food Group where any alteration or destruction of the interior of the nut or spice kernel would destroy the delicate value of the item. As it turns out we were able to get this technology approved for application on our Selma California Grown Nut Crop!<br /><br />  How It Works:<br /><br />  The process is very expensive and requires the latest in production technology. It is centered on Water Based Botanical Principles. We call this process H20-UN-Pasteurization.  The almonds are held in a chamber that draws down the air to a vacuum, so all the air born bacteria and pathogens are removed from the chamber, then a computer controlled mist of sterile distilled water dry stream is injected in to the chamber. This steam is computer controlled and balanced against the known weight of each nut. As the small amount of Steam condenses on the skin of the nut it transfers only minimal heat energy just to the surface it contacts! The nut meat is never heated internally!<br /><br />  After the dry steam injection, a 4 to 6 second process, the chamber is then evacuated again causing the condensed purified water to evaporate from the skin of the nut. Next the chamber is brought back to normal conditions with HEPA Filtered Air.<br /><br />  This process preserves the internal natural balance of enzymes, amino acids, proteins, and most importantly it preserves the natural living nature of the nut! You can sprout these Almonds !<br /><br />  We are sure you will be very satisified with this process, and as far as we know we are the only Ranch Direct Almond Grower in the San Joaquian Valley of California that is using this expensive, and time consuming process, so that we may bring you the very finest in US Graded Fancy #1 California Almonds !<br /><br />Please beware of other processes:<br /><br />We are concerned that there are a good number of other processes out there that are very inferior and some are outright dangerous! The most common is simple autoclave sterilization and this is, essentially, just cooking the nut. After and autoclave process, the nut is no longer living, it is dead, and all the valuable nutrients of the nut have been cooked and destroyed. Unfortunately the Almond Board, under presser from the Big Almonds Handlers, Processors and Growers are calling and labeling, in the stores,  these nuts as RAW !  They ARE NOT RAW!  They are COOKED !<br /><br />Other processes are using PPO (Propylene Oxide Gas). You should never, every under any circumstances eat nuts exposed to PPO Gas.  PPO is a known carcinogen (causes cancer).  It is toxic and poisonous!.. The European Union (EU) has prohibited the use of PPO Gas on any Human Food Product.  The USDA and the FDA still allow it. Inquire with your store if their nuts have been exposed to PPO !  Make sure you know! This is serious business.<br />I will add link to this article<br />[...]

review/text: I have to admit, I was a bit leary to spend 15.86 on a 16 oz jar of raw almond butter, but I am so pleased that I did. This Artisana 100% raw organic almond butter is delicous! It is very dense and packed with flavor. A serving size is 2 TBSP and there are 14 servings per jar. That provides 187 calories, 16g fat, 6 carbs, 4g fiber, and 7 g protein. I usually try to just have 1 tbsp as a serving though its so good, thats hard to do. I've tasted a lot of almond butter over the years and have even made my own in the vitamix (which is a pain to clean up) and this is the best tasting yet. Highly recommend.

If you are looking for a truly raw product - this is not what you want to buy.  Maranatha makes a raw almond butter that is tasty.  BUT if you don't care about about whether it is made from raw almonds or not (like me), buy Artisana - the taste of their product is out of this world!

review/text: I was really glad to receive this case of cans of black beans from Amazon, because the cold winter is starting out here in the desert, especially over night, and I thought it would be great to have some warm black beans for lunch at work.<br /><br />So far this warm year I have been eating for lunch cold <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZU7QQ">Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> mixed with Mori-Nu Silken Extra Firm Tofu, 24 pack and other stuff at hand, but the cold nights and days make me want something warm instead.<br /><br />When I lived in Guatemala back a quarter century ago, we had black beans and tortilla, hand made, so this sounded really nice. As soon as the case came, I got out a can at night to simmer with diced onion, garlic and a few cumin seeds, to warm to work the next day.<br /><br />Round midnight, I got up to check the beans, still warming,and smelling great. I decided to try half a spoonful to see if they were all right. They smelled way too fresh. One half spoonful led to another, and soon the whole pot was gone.<br /><br />They were THAT good!<br /><br />So anyway, next day I had the usual garbanzo and tofu salad, with fresh lemon juice, and will go now to see if I get some black beans ready for lunch tomorrow!<br /><br />They really are great: good texture, very fresh, and the taste very fresh. After using this brand name for so long, I can trust its uniformity, with no surprises from batch to batch, all of the highest quality. I know some people might say, dude, it's black beans, bake your own, dried from a bag! But the freshness of these apparently never dried beans is something "to die for!" or rather, to live for . . .<br /><br />Great beans. Won't let you down. Will fill you up!<br /><br />And good for you too in every kind of way. Soul food as well as food for the body.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: I have nothing but praise for Eden. They were one of the first organic food companies, and they've maintained their integrity in the face of a massive influx of "corporate organic" brands to the market.<br /><br />But they use kombu as a flavor enhancer in their beans and soy milks. And, while this really is a traditional Japanese method, it also means there will be naturally occurring MSG in the product. If, like me, you are very sensitive to MSG, it is likely you will have a bad reaction to these beans.

(I find canned beans often have strange smells - but not these)<br /><br />These black beans are whole and are great for making hispanic dishes using whole beans. In a hurry, I eat them just out of the can, no heating or preparation required - though perhaps this is not for everyone!  They are also great for making your own refried beans, chili, southwestern salad, or other black bean dishes.<br /><br />These beans are the next best thing to cooking your own - maybe even better, since there's no work involved!

review/summary: Foundational--make your own refried style easily
review/text: My husband and I grew up in Mexico so black beans are a staple. Usually I cook the turtle beans, but so nice to sometimes just open a can. These need flavor help, but are a good foundation. Sometimes I just add a can to my brown rice in the last few minutes of cooking time.<br /><br />Or make a 'refried' version by heating them up, putting into a food processor where I have already processed serrano and a bit of onion then back into pan. Can also add tomatos, whatever you like. Most of the organic canned refried beans on the market that we have tried leave much be be desired (except Bearitos black which have become almost impossible to find)so this just takes a few minutes. Serve with rice or spread on tortillas with fresh salsa.<br /><br />You could also add cilantro to the beans on top although I wouldn't heat it as will will enzymes in the cilantro. Bty, cilantro is excellent for chelating heavy metals and so good to add in everything. Much high nutritionally than parsley, which we also use a lot of. Organic, of course.

Their policy is "no returns," but since this arrived as damaged as it did I have to hope they'll fix it. By the way, the box it was shipped in looked fine... the cans within it (shrink wrapped in plastic with an Amazon "ready to ship" sticker) did not. So, the damage clearly happened before they were even boxed up rather than during shipping. The same goes for another case of canned goods I received today and I'm expecting another case tomorrow... hopefully that 1 out of 3 will be usable. These cans should have been checked prior to being boxed up for shipping, though, and that is Amazon's fault.

I use these all the time in my chili recipes along with their kidney beans and I have never been disappointed. These are also one of the only canned beans I have found that are low in salt, a paltry 15 mg, if I remember correctly.

review/text: I love black beans.  Eden's are saltless so you can enjoy them as is or add whatever you like.  Personally I like to add a little hot sauce to spice them up.  That way I get great taste but not a huge load of salt... Even reduced salt canned beans have enough to weaken bean's natural health benefits.  Another great thing about Eden's beans are the cans themselves which are lined with BPA free plastic.<br /><br />I get a case auto-shipped every month.

review/summary: Not black turtle beans
review/text: I have always loved black turtle beans and eat them often. I was happy to learn of Eden Organic and the no-BPA can. As others reported, the shipment arrived very badly dented. Wasn't thrilled with that, but okay. Stuff happens. The real disappointment came when I opened the first can. I actually thought I had opened a can of kidney beans by mistake.<br /><br />These are not traditional black turtle beans. I don't know what kind of bean they are, but if you are looking for the traditional black turtle bean, this is not it. And it's not just the reddish brown color that gives these away - even the taste is unlike traditional black beans.<br /><br />They don't taste bad, just more along the lines of a kidney bean taste instead of a black bean. I know there are other types of black beans and maybe this is one of those. But the can says black turtle beans and those they certainly are not.

In addition to the health benefits of BPA free can linings, you definitely get your money's worth with Eden beans, compared to some other organic brands which have BPA in the can linings, way too much water and fewer beans per can.<br /><br />I bought the unsalted ones because they were on sale but actually prefer the salted ones.  It seems I have to add way too much salt when I use these, but other than that they are cooked just right and as mentioned, the can is FULL of beans.

Often I see that people are complaining that Eden doesn't offer a wide enough variety of canned foods. It could be larger and as their customer base grows, I'm sure it will be. Meanwhile your imagination is the limit. For example I make the most awesome brownies with these beans. Yes, black bean brownies! No one in my family knows how I make them and they request them all of the time. I take them to family functions and no one is the wiser. Do a net search for a black bean brownies and use Eden's and other natural/organic products. You'll be amazed.

review/summary: Maybe I got a bad batch, but YUCK!
review/text: We usually cook our own dry beans, but sometimes you need something quick.  So, I always keep a few cans of beans on hand. We usually buy Westbrae Natural Vegetarian Organic Brand Beans at our local Co-Op, but I bought a can of this to try since it was on sale.<br /><br />The first impression was not great, but then odd bitter aftertaste and an earthy "dirt" sort of taste made us pause.  And then the texture - it was all wrong- there was something other than beans in our can, like roots or something... it was gross enough that I could only eat a few bites of mine.  My husband stopped at bite one. What a waste of money!<br /><br />I wanted to give this one star - but my husband said to give the company the benefit of the doubt - maybe not all cans are as bad as the one we bought. Either way, I'm not buying their beans again!

review/summary: Beans good dented cans bad
review/text: I love love love Eden's products. I use so many I can't keep track. I am vegan, I consume A LOT of beans. They are 2.49 a can in store so when I came across this deal, which figured out to be 1.57 a can I thought woohoo! Well...I knew it was too good to be true. I also knew as picky as I am when I choose canned goods, checking each one carefully for dents, I was taking a risk ordering them online. That proved to be true. Out of the 24 (black and garbanzo) 18 were dented! That is crazy. They had a dent near either the top seam or bottom. Amazon was great, since item is not returnable they refunded my money within 24 hours. It killed me to get rid of those dented cans....I mean truly made me cringe but I couldn't take risk, I have 3 kids to think about. So...I give amazon's shipping dept. 1 star. They should check before shipping and then pack with cardboard dividers. They are not realizing how much money and good food they are wasting by sending out dented canned goods. As far as product, well 5 stars of course. I highly recommend Eden's. Delicious and bpa free and HEALTHY!

review/text: I LOVE black beans. It was nice to find them in a BPA free can, so that I don't have to spend hours soaking beans myself if I don't want industrial toxins in my beans. I have only one complaint. When you go to dump the beans out, the first half dumps out nicely. The second half of the can is so compacted in there, you have to go in there with a fork and dig around, which ends up mashing more than a few of the beans. EVERY CAN is like this. Out of TWO cases. I'd rather they just all dump out like other brands, even if it means I get a few less beans in each can. I have bought a few cases of different Eden organic foods, and it seems like only the black beans get smashed in the bottom of the can like this. What a shame.

review/summary: Not pure Papaya Juice
review/text: I bought this at Whole Foods without carefully reading the deceptive label. It is 100% juice but not 100% Papaya juice. It is 100% juice: Papaya AND Apple.<br /><br />100% pure Papaya juice is recommended for people with health problems that produce too much phlegm. This isn't it.

review/summary: That's a spicy!
review/text: If you've tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper, you CAN'T compare these to those!  These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat, but oompletely enjoyable.  You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices.  Great stuff.
