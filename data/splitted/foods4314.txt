review/summary: Takes Very Little and I Wasn't Impressed
review/text: I've become addicted to Argan Oil. A few drops tames any frizz my hair usually gets on a humid day. I found a 3-ounce bottle at a local discount store a year ago and have never seen the brand again. I think it's been discontinued.<br /><br />I tried out Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy's Ultra Shea Nourishing Oil thinking it would be comparable. It's really not.<br /><br />Ultra Shea Oil requires a tiny amount. My first time using it, there really are no directions. It simply says to massage into your hair. I used four drops, the same as I'd been using for the Argan Oil, and that left my hair looking oily. I finally got down to two drops and find that's the perfect amount. I do put it into wet hair, you can also use it on dry hair apparently, but I massage between my hands and then into the ends of my hair first and then work it into the rest after a shower and let my hair curl however it wants.<br /><br />The smell is a mix of coconut and almond, really pleasant. I love that aspect. But, the overall quality is just not as good as Argan Oil, so I'm going to have to find some Argan Oil that's as good as the bottle I've used up.

review/summary: Greasy and over powering smell
review/text: I had the chance to try this out (I'm a guy), and my impressions are on par with what others have said. This product for me anyways leaves my hair feeling greasy and I don't like perfume smells and this one has a very strong scent. I've given this to my wife to try as well if she is interested, if not this will be trashed.<br /><br />It would have been great if there were some real directions on the package but the only steps were "massage into hair." Maybe I did it wrong, I don't know, but I don't like this at all and will not be using it for myself.

review/summary: Threw it Out!
review/text: I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers on this product. When I read them, I thought "well, maybe they're just using too much". My hair tends toward dryness, so I thought I'd give this a try, despite the comments of others. I thought surely I could just use a tiny amount and apply it evenly to smooth out my dry ends.<br />So here was my experience; I washed and dried my hair. I put a pea sized amount in my palm and rubbed my hands together to spread it. I then lightly patted my hands over my hair, mostly from about ears down (my hair is shoulder length). I washed the excess off my hands. I combed the oil through my hair and it looked slightly greasy. I then bent forward with head upside down and combed through from nape forward. I combed a lot to spread the oil. It still looked a little greasy. So I waited about a half hour and combed through it again. Still the same amount of slight greasy look, there was Zero absorption of the oil into my hair. It just lays on top.<br />I am used to using moroccan oil for my hair, so I thought this would be similar. No dice! The product I like is the brown bottle with the blue label by Moroccanoil. That product soaks in beautifully and leaves no greasy feel.<br />As far as the smell that others complained about, I did not find it to be too strong or offensive. I thought it was kindof nice. But that is the only redeeming quality to me. I think someone with ethnic hair might really like this product, so that's why I threw in an extra star rather than just giving one.<br />I really think it should say somewhere on the bottle that it works best with ethnic hair!

review/summary: I Like it but......
review/text: For years I have had a patch of scaly skin close to the hair line above my forehead that refused to go away.  When I received this Clear Scalp Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil I applied a few drops to that place and then massaged into my scalp.  Within hours of using, the scaly patch and itching was gone and has not reappeared this morning.  For clearing up that problem, I really like the product.<br />However, the non greasy claims are just not accurate.  My hair looked shiny and soft and really good for about 2 hours.  Then I noticed my hair had begun to droop and looked somewhat oily.  When I got up this morning my hair was just plain oily and really needed a good washing.  I've never had a problem with oily hair before now and don't want to deal with oily hair in the future so I won't be using this product.

review/summary: Use mineral oil and add other natural items - you can make your own
review/text: I don't have that much hair on my head, but my wife does.  She wasn't that impressed.  Mineral oil is cheap, and if you watch your sales you can get all sorts of natural oils and 'treatments' at Whole Foods and other places.  So, you can make your own.<br /><br />We've been making our own 'potions' to protect our kids' hair from lice (tea tree oil is good).  If you do your homework from natural and homeopathic websites, you can make your own treatments for a variety of problems.<br /><br />Save your money and pass on this one.

review/summary: Too Heavy, Overly Scented
review/text: For some years now I've suffered with an exceedingly dry scalp, which I normally treat with coconut oil as I have very fine hair. I think that this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a> is perhaps not intended for my hair type, however, as the package indicates that it is for "relaxed and natural hair."  There are no directions for use other than "1. Cleanse  2. Smooth  3. Soothe  4. Seal."  Sorry to say, I have no idea what is meant by "sealing" my hair and normally wash, condition and comb.<br /><br />At any rate, I did give this a quick try.  With a first ingredient of mineral oil it is very heavy and hard to wash out. (I had the dickens of a time and had to resort to dish liquid!)  I also found the scent almost overpowering.  Do note that no ingredients are listed on the container or packaging.  You'll have to refer to the product page for that information.<br /><br />Your call.<br /><br />UPDATE:  My teenage granddaughter spent most of the month of August with Grandma.  Her hair is much coarser than mine, naturally curly and definitely stressed - dyed, straightened, blow dried regularly.  She absolutely LOVED this hair oil and the other two products (conditioners) she test drove for me and they did a stupendous job on her hair, leaving it soft & manageable while taming the frizzies.  Highly recommended for damaged hair!  Accordingly, I've upped the stars by one.

review/summary: Smells AWESOME, but mostly mineral oil (!!) and scents.
review/text: I have thin, fine hair so this is totally not for me. Plus, it's really just MINERAL OIL and a dash of things to make it smell good and sound good for your hair. For folks with hair like mine, this just weighs your hair down and makes it look greasy! NOT SHINY!! Greasy! Like I have not washed my hair for a week! Yuck. I have a friend, however, that has thick, full hair and they like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a> because it makes their hair seem less dry and coarse. We both LOVE the scent, over the top love, too! Fabulous scent. I'd love to know the ratios of how much mineral oil and how much actual shea etc.<br /><br />If you have thin, fine hair, I think you should avoid this product. If you have thick, coarse hair, I think you might want to MIX this with something you are already happy with, if your current product doesn't have a scent to it.

review/summary: Needs better directions
review/text: I would say that overall this product needs better label and directions on it's use on the actual product. After looking it over for about 10 minutes I didn't see one direction on how to use this oil. I marked it down from five to four stars to the lack of directions.<br /><br />I marked it down further from four to three stars after I did test it on my hair when it was dry and it left it looking greasy and when I tried to curl my hair later the effect of the product left my hair hard to style. The product itself says it can be used on wet or dry hair but with my hair I don't need a lot of oil on it and even using the smidgen of oil that I did I just didn't like the results.<br /><br />I finally after some trial and error figured out the best way to use this product.  After washing and shampooing I used the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy to oil my scalp. After massaging this into my scalp for about ten minutes I promptly took out a blow dryer and dried my hair while brushing it with a soft bristle brush. After about 20 minutes of this with my hair completely dry my hair was transformed into shiny straight hair that looked like it had been through a deep conditioning treatment. I usually only get results like this after going to my hair dresser and three plus hours and about $100 later my hair is done.<br /><br />I know other reviewers thought the product was misleading but before obtaining this I looked up the product and found that it was meant for "ethnic hair".<br /><br />I would strongly recommend using this only as a oil for ethnic hair. Also I would recommend only using this on wet hair and after going through your usual shampoo and condition regime with your hair.

review/summary: Great for the beach/Changed from 3 to 1 star
review/text: This is a very heavy oil product that should only be used by people that either have really dry kinky hair or really dry thick hair.<br /><br />I brought it to the beach this week and I loved the fact for this price point I could saturate my hair, cover it and not get the drying effect I usually feel from  being at the beach all day.  It is an excellent product for this type of use.<br /><br />This product has a very inexpensive price point (4.00 vs 8.00 for Organix hydrating Macadamia oil which I usually use)<br />This can only be used on very thick dry hair.<br />Great for beach use<br />Do not use on scalp.<br />And lastly I agree with the many comments that say they should have instructions on how to use.  That would clear up a lot of confusion.<br />Bottom line... Good value for your hair IF you have the proper hair type.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have used this numerous times at the beach and decided to use it to condition my hair after washing (after the beach)  Goodness dont put this on your hair dry or wet.  It is so oily that no matter what your hair type (frizzy or afro , it will just weigh it down)  After this I really wouldnt recommend this to anyone.

I used a small bit on the ends of my hair to smooth and control fly-away hair, and it worked wonderfully.

review/summary: Works ok
review/text: My favorite part about this product is the smell.  It's summery and smells like coconut and vanilla.  I used about a quarter sized amount on my scalp and rubbed in it and I think that may have been a little too much.  The thing is that there are basically no instructions.  It doesn't say how much to use or when is the best time to use it or even if it's a leave in product.  The only thing it says is "massage into scalp and hair" and you have to lift the label to even find that.  Maybe they think that everyone would just know what to do and how much to use, but I think the product could benefit from some instructions.

review/summary: moisturizes the scalp and hair
review/text: Quick review here... the oil does what it says: it moisturizes the scalp and hair. If you're like me and have very dry skin, get dandruff, and stay itchy then this product is for you. If not, I think it would just make your hair more oily. So, I don't recommend this for people with naturally oily hair. But, like I said, if you have dry (or damaged) hair or a dry scalp, then this product really works.

review/summary: Not a fan at all.
review/text: About my hair: Naturally pin straight, long, has neven been color treated or treated in any way.  It has always been very healthy.  I rarely use a blow dryer.  I have not used a flat iron since college.  I check box "white/non-hispanic" on official forms.<br /><br />I love this product line, or specifically the shampoo and conditioner that is also part of the "Ultra Shea" line.  I use it daily and rave to everyone about it.<br /><br />However, as someone who is struggling to regain control of my hair after the hormonal shifts of having a baby - I did not like this particular product.  I can not figure out who could use it and not look crazy greasy after about 2 minutes.<br /><br />Like others have said - it is mineral oil/fragrance and a half dozen other oils.  I don't mind the fragrance. I wanted to believe it would provide "light non-greasy nourishment to scalp & hair" but for me, there was no way!  No matter how little I used I still looked gross after applying it.  Applied to wet hair it kept my roots from ever looking dry and applying to dry hair made my roots/scalp look like I hadn't showered in days.  No winning, no way I would purchase.<br /><br />I think you could use straight olive oil for the same level of nourishment.

review/summary: Provides good relief
review/text: I have pretty bad dandruff. I have tried pretty much every shampoo out there (even using prescription shampoo from my dr. at one point)  Now I use Head and Shoulders regularly and it seems to work OK.  I was excited to try this product b/c you can apply it to wet or dry hair.  The first time I used it on my wet hair immediately after getting out of the shower. It felt nice and light on my scalp and dried out nicely in my hair, leaving no real noticeable residue or greasy look to my scalp.  Then I decided to try it on my dry hair.  It went in nicely again, and I used the same amount I did when applying it to wet hair.  It didn't absorb as well and did leave my hair a bit greasy looking-not like "eww, she needs a shower" greasy, but more like "oh, you haven't washed your hair in 2 days greasy".  Overall, it feels good on the scalp and does seem to alleviate the visible flakes.  I would say don't use it on dry hair, though, make it part of your just out of the shower routine for best results.

review/summary: May Not be Best Choice for Sensitive Skin
review/text: I love the bottle-closes with a screwing motion like the average bottle of school glue.<br /><br />To be clear, this is product is "dressed up" mineral oil. The last time I used mineral oil for my hair, the bottle got knocked over beneath my sink. So, I can appreciate a bottle of oil that closes.<br /><br />Though nicely fragrant, this is consistent with what I am seeing from other products in this line.  The "junky" ingredients are listed first (being most abundant). The decent ingredients are listed last (in small quantities).<br /><br />So, I use this nice smelling mineral oil sparingly. If you're into using mineral oil (without additives) on your hair and are not concerned about the fragrance and the fancy packaging, straight mineral oil is much cheaper.<br /><br />Update:Had to downgrade my review due to allergic reaction after using multiple products from same line. This is one of the products used, although sparingly.

review/summary: CLEAR Scalp & Hair Oil
review/text: I have shoulder-length permed hair. I found that this product didn't do much for frizz, but it does make my hair pleasantly shiny. Only a small amount of oil is needed. My favorite aspect of this product is the applicator tip. You can apply the oil directly to your scalp without having to get your hands oily. While some other reviews complained about the smell, I really didn't notice the scent. I didn't find it unpleasant or too strong. While it's convenient to be able to use this on wet or dry hair, I'd prefer a product that was more effective on frizz. I usually use oil sheen for frizz, shine, and moisture.

review/summary: Just not for my hair . . . at all!
review/text: I requested this after trying the shampoo and conditioner lines which I'd been moderately pleased with.  I thought--and hoped this might follow suit.  I have very fine, dry flyaway hair that is a pain to control.  I often use some form of anti frizz or hair product to tame it smooth.<br /><br />That said, I used this for the first time getting ready for a wedding.  I figured a little smoothing and shine wouldn't be too bad.  I used a tiny amount of it, but the results were still awful.  My hair looked like I'd slimed it--hanging in wet looking clumps.  I had to grab an emergency shower prior to the wedding and really scrub to get the product out completely.<br /><br />It's possible I used this product wrong, or that it just isn't intended for my type of hair--but there's nothing on the container that states how to use this product, or that it's meant for a particular hair-type.  Some clear labeling and instructions would be extremely helpful.

review/summary: Wonderful for dry hair!
review/text: Great conditioner for dry hair!<br /><br />I've used Ojan & other hair treatment oils. This is one of the best! Gives my hair a nice shine, without feeling heavy or overly oily!<br /><br />I used after a wash & regular conditioner that wasn't doing anything much for my hair. This is as good, if not better than Ojan palm-based oil, which I love, but is just too expensive to use all the time.<br /><br />If you have dry hair that needs a deep treatment on a regular basis, give this a try & I think you'll be as happy as I am!<br /><br />M hair is VERY dry, and although I like it shiny, I also don't like it bogged down & too flat. Works very well, and seems to absorb even better with heat (I used an iron once & a blow dryer another time.) My hair soaks it up too much, I feel, if used on dry hair, but everyone's hair is different!<br /><br />Makes my hair stronger & very easy to back-comb out, flip over & wear.<br /><br />I don't like to wear a high-maintenance hairstyle, but used with a flat iron, I can make it straight if I wan, curl if with the flat iron (My hair can get VERY curly, like an African American's hair, if it's too dry), and I can keep the curl if I want, as it's not too heavy & I back comb it, then let it dry,but it doesn't feel oily or bogged down.<br /><br />I'll likely be buying this on a regular basis, as it's far more affordable than Ojan.<br /><br />I've used straight palm oil as a treatment by its self, but it is too heavy.<br /><br />The mix of oils is a VERY nice mix, so it's not too heavy for use a few times a week. I've made my own plant oil mixes, which can be expensive when buying the oils separately, AND the oils often need to be refrigerator to keep them from going bad. This is already mixed, so you don't have to experiment, which can be too heavy or too light, can leave some oily residue too, until you get the right mix!<br /><br />Great for dry scalp too, and the smell is a LOT nicer than many "salon" products that are generally full of harsh chemicals, and can cause itching.<br /><br />A wonderful, natural way to treat your hair regularly. I may want to still use the red palm oil maybe once or twice a month to get my hair to settle down, but I may not need to, as this seems to work great all by itself!<br /><br />VERY nice to find a reasonably-priced, nicely mixed oil treatment that I can use on a regular basis without breaking the bank.<br /><br />I had some friends try it & it works on all kinds of dry hair & even hair that's oily & VERY curly, or even straight. Makes all the hair we tried it on manageable & my friends loved it too! (Young & old)<br /><br />This will be a regular for me, as long as it remains reasonably priced, I'll be using this all the time! Leaves body in your hair too!<br /><br />Give this a try, no matter what kind of hair you have!

review/summary: overall a nice "help"
review/text: I tend to have oily hair, but a dry scalp. This product, though through the description says it doesn't make head/hair feel greasy, for me, it does. Maybe it's because my hair does tend to be oily - or so I'm told - but it has helped my scalp. Though, some days, it has actually made my scalp feel drier it seems. That, or my scalp was so dry, that it absorbed the solution and then dried out again.<br /><br />However, a little bit goes LOOOOONG way. I've not used this everyday religiously, but I've used it often enough, and it goes a LONG way. I have the biggest head (anatomically speaking) out of most people I know, and it really doesn't take tons to cover my head. I do notice, though, that it seems to help with the overall health/healthy look of my hair. My hair is also pretty short (and curly,) and it helps me to be able to style it some with just using the product itself. Even when it has been absorbed by scalp and hair, people have commented how healthy my hair looks - and if they are closer friends or family - they will run their hands through my hair (to feel the curl) and be astonished with the soft feel of my hair itself. :)<br /><br />If someone asked me if it was worth it...I'd say that overall, yes.<br />I'm not raving about it, but it really isn't a super amazing, must-have, I would bend over backwards to have this product kind of item. I would say that one should know their hair type/know about their hair really well before getting this product. I mean, it wouldn't hurt to get it just for overall health purposes, but I guess for me, I wouldn't just go out and buy this unless I really thought I'd need it, i.e. I'd probably look into it more before purchasing it consistently, or in a large quantity.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: My family has dry scalp in some form and we all used this and really liked it. In the past we've used other oils like Philosphy (expensive but I like it) and Alberto (inexpensive but not very moisturizing). This has a great smell, like the beach or coconut and I used less than I did of others (and it costs less). Plus I appreciate the applictor tip, which the Philosophy doesn't have. Didn't leave my hair greasy but it did moisturize and it calmed and moisturized the scalp. Great price to value. Especially good in the summer for scalp sunburn.

review/summary: Another effective, good product.
review/text: I love the mild scent and silky feel of this product.  I have short, dry hair and live in the southern California desert.  I spend a lot of time outside and under the hot desert sun.  This product has made a difference; my lackluster, spiky-looking short hair (it isn't supposed to be spiky) is tamed, shiny and smooth without my spending a lot of time with gels and a curling iron.  It's a nice product to use and it does as it promises.  I'm sure I'll be buying this product in the future.

review/text: My favorite thing about this product is it's wonderful scent!  LOVE it!  I don't much care for how greasy, but I've noticed when I use less it isn't too bad.  I've not been using it the full seven days yet to be able to tell how much of a difference it makes but so far I think I like it.  My son has a severe dandruff/itchy scalp problem and he is trying it out.  So far there is a small noticeable difference.  Going to give it a few more days of trial for him and will post an update to say how that goes.

review/summary: Smooth & Tangle Free
review/text: I was skeptical about this product since I have tried most of them and they all just leave my hair looking and feeling oily no matter how little I use. However with this one I applied a dime size, rubbed both hands together, and applied to my damp but brushed out hair (just the back length) and after it dried it was only smooth and shiny and not oily! This is very comparable to and the price is a lot less than my favorite Bain de Terre Recovery Complex Anti-Frizz Silky Shine Serum. Also, not that it is any big deal but I just LOVE the beachy smell this one has! :)<br /><br />Highly Recommend

review/summary: Scalp and hair therapy in thin, dry, and damaged hair
review/text: I have very dry hair/scalp with thin hair.  Lately the itching from my dry scalp is driving me nuts, so I decided to give the Clear scalp and hear therapy a try.<br /><br />Pros<br />- It takes away the dryness/itching, although for only a short period of time.<br />- it softens my hair<br />- the bottle is easy to use and easy to apply.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- This treatment can only be used for a short amount of time because it weights down my hair.  I can only really use this product in e house as it makes my hair so greasy.<br />- the results are not long lasting<br /><br />Overall this product is decent, but not the write type for my hair.  This product is probably best for those with thick hair, dry hair.

review/summary: Slightly oily, but keeps dry hair from cracking and frizzing
review/text: When I opened this product, I noticed the label indicated it was for "ethnic hair". I do not have hair that would be described as such, but I do have very curly/frizzy, thick dark hair. It can get pretty dry with certain weather changes.<br /><br />I normally use CHI products for my scalp, and they work pretty well. This product is less for the scalp and more for the hair itself. It really did the job of keeping my hair shiny without looking or feeling greasy! It goes on cleanly and evenly and stays working throughout the day.

review/text: As I said in the title, the best part of this hair oil is the soft hair I get after using it.  You only need a little -- less than a pea-sized drop (any more than that will make my hair look and feel dirty and oily).  I love how the oil immediately soaks into my hair.  As long as I don't use too much, this hair oil is great.

review/summary: NOW I LOVE IT!
review/text: UPDATE AFTER 2+ MONTHS: Have been using this shea nourishing oil for months now and have learned to apply only 1 drop at a time -- AND I LOVE IT NOW!  It makes my hair appear super healthy.  The sheen is mellow and deep.  The fragrance is not overpowering in this tiny amount.  And what a buy -- it looks like it's going to last forever. And it makes my hair so healthy, I'm allowing my hair to grow to my waist for the first time in my life!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have found that if I use a single drop of this oil on my hair it imparts a nice sheen. But two drops makes my hair look oily. Three drops makes my hair look greasy. Four drops and I have to wash again immediately. So it's a difficult product to use. I don't like the fragrance. It is too heavy for me. I have fine, limp, straight hair, which may contribute to the difficulty. But it is my impression that this would be a challenging product for almost any hair type.

review/summary: Not bad but not great either
review/text: I am a big fan of Ojon hair cream, and Josie Maran argan oil for my hair.  These products are definitely not inexpensive, so I was excited to try the Clear Scalp & Hair Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil.  I have to say that while this is not expensive, it also isn't as good as what I've been using.  I have very thin hair and not much of it, so I try to use products that will not only take care of my hair and scalp, but also that will "plump" or at least give the appearance of thickness.  Good job on my first requirement, not so good on my second.  I have used the Clear Scalp & Hair Shampoo and like it, but because I found it a bit drying, I thought using the Clear Scalp & Hair Oil after the shampoo might be a good combination.  I am happy with the way the this product nourishes my hair after shampooing, but it feels a lot "greasier" than anything else I've tried.  I like the buttery coconut scent and my hair looked shiny after using this treatment, but it really felt like my sparse amount of hair was being "weighed down," which turned out to be the opposite of plumping it up.  Using the Clear Scalp & Hair Oil on my hair when it is dry is a disaster.  Even a small amount plastered my hair down to my scalp which was not in any way attractive.  I want healthy hair, but I also want my hair to look as good as possible.<br />  I would recommend the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Oil as a "treatment" only, not as a leave-in product.  I will use the product on a day on which I'm not leaving the house, and don't care how my hair looks.  Then I can wash my hair the next day to lose the heaviness and greasy feel.  Perhaps this product would work better on thick or curly hair, but if you have thinning or fine hair, this is probably not a product you want to use on a regular basis.

review/summary: Prefer other brands of hair oil
review/text: First, there were no instructions whatsoever for this product.  I've used hair oils quite often, but I also know that each brand/formula is different.  I just wanted a little guidance on the quantity to use or when is best to put it on (dry hair or wet hair).  I didn't want to have my hair look greasy, so I did have to wait until I would have the time to rewash my hair in case I used the product and was unhappy with the result.<br /><br />I have used it probably about 4 or 5 times and have tried different amounts and putting on when my hair is wet and when my hair is dry.  It smells good.  The results were just okay, nothing spectacular.  I will definitely be sticking with my favored Moraccanoil brand of oil.  This isn't a terrible option for a cheaper product, though.  It just didn't work as well as my favorite.

review/summary: Lots of oils make your hair greasy
review/text: My wife picked this moisturizing hair oil up for herself, but I found that using it also helped correct my dry scalp/hair issues.  However, the product also makes your hair very greasy - in fact, because I tend to use too much, my wife suggested I use it at night, rather than during the day.  This is not Moroccan oil after all.<br /><br />The oil has the odor of suntan lotion (probably the shea butter), which is something I do not like - I am a bit too conservative to use overly perfumed hair products.  Unfortunately, there are no directions and I had to determine what amount to use through trial and error; at first, I put too much in and my hair looked like I had dumped salad oil on it - very greasy.  If you use a little bit, which will vary with the amount of hair you have, your hair won't look too greasy.  Unfortunately, this might defeat the purpose - a tiny bit won't moisturize either your scalp or your hair.<br /><br />The packaging is a bit tricky - I had to peel the back label off to see the ingredient list, which was comprised of several oils.  If the thought of dumping oil in your hair does not sound appealing, then steer clear of this stuff.  The first two ingredients include mineral oil and coconut oil - that may explain why it smells like suntan lotion.  There are lesser amounts of other oils including: palm oil, wheat germ oil, sweet almond oil, sunflower seed oil, soybean oil, and Moroccan ironwood oil.<br /><br />Now that summer is here, keeping my scalp and hair moisturized requires some effort.  Unfortunately, I do not like having greasy hair, so I have had to seek out other hair care options.

review/text: I have a super dry scalp so I was interested in trying the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea. As others have said it does have a nice scent, but it is very thick and oily. I applied just a little and my scalp does feel some relief. I am also trying it at the ends of my hair which are quite dry. After applying my hair did not appear greasy or oily so I was glad about that.<br />This product does work well if used sparingly. I will update this review in a couple of weeks with long term results!

review/summary: The perfect nutrient and stylish aid for dry curly hair
review/text: I got this oil for my daughter's hair, which is dry, long and curly. Well, she got it from me, but unlike me, she hates spending an hour blowdrying her hair to make it silky, something I'm sure will change once she hits puberty, but for now, she wears two braids, and her hair gets tangled frequently. The Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil, is perfect for our kind of hair, and after smelling it, I decided to try it on my own hair, and loved it.<br /><br />The little bottle comes with a tip drop dispenser, which one can graduate depending of the amount of oil needed. I think it hints to the use of only a few drops at a time, so I recommend simply starting with three or five drops, rubbing hands together including fingertips, then massaging the scalp and hair with both hands until all the oil is absorbed by the hair, then stylish it. The smell lingers, but it's not overwhelming. The best effect of the oil is how well it nourishes the hair and scalp, which one can start to experience instantly, and confirmed after a few days of use. It also leaves the hair shiny and manageable. I'm  using it mostly during those days I don't want to stylish my hair and I wear a ponytail, or a single braid. This is one of the best hair products I encountered in a long time, a sure buy from now on.

review/summary: Just mineral oil
review/text: I don't have a dry scalp but I do have long hair. The ends are dry so I use this oil on the ends. I've put it on both wet and dry hair. It blends well, does not feel sticky nor seem to weigh my hair down. It doesn't seem to attract dust. It also makes my finger skin nice.<br /><br />Like all oils, it makes the hair shinier, but not softer. The only product I've used that actually softens is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EWF33W">Redken All Soft Conditioner for Dry/Brittle Hair, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)</a>. I used the discontinued type and have not tried the current product.<br /><br />Assuming that the ingredients on the back of the bottle are listed by percentage volume with the largest part first, I was surprised to see the first ingredient is mineral oil. The five other oils that the Amazon description cites are at the end of the list which, if my assumption is correct, means they are in very small amounts.<br /><br />Most other hair treatments such as conditioners, de-frizzers, moisturizers, arcan oil... list a version of dimethecone as their first ingredient. It makes the surface slippery and seals in moisture but doesn't add any (you will find it in hand creams too). I don't know whether dimethicone or mineral oil is more expensive so I can't say "save your money and use mineral oil (or mayonnaise or olive oil)." I did not see any difference on my hair between this oil and other conditions that I've used on my hair.

review/summary: Shine Shine Shine...let it shine
review/text: As mentioned in my review of the sister product to the shampoo you really don't need to follow up with this oil, however my girfriend has a dry patch at her hair line so we used both the shampoo and the nourishing hair oil.<br /><br />First let me say I like the design and color of the bottle (shampoo included). When you are dealing with hair you need a sleek size to manage in your hands due to the wetness or soapy-ness, rounded bigger bottles tend to slip and slide. Anyway, I used the Nourishing Scalp oil, the first time before my wash and the next time after. Each time I must say the hair instantly felt smoother, as the day went on I could tell the hair was quenching it's thirst.<br /><br />The hair oil doesn't make the hair overly shiney or oily, but it does nourish and keep dry scalp at bay with minimal sheen. (a dab will do). The scent is a mild fresh one and some of the formulated ingredients include, a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm.<br /><br />I personally don't use any hair products on my Sisterlocks outside of shampoo and conditioner, my hair enjoy it own oils, but for those of you who use hair oils I would not shy away from this one, you might find exactly what you need.<br /><br />Complimentary samples was provided by Amazon Vine for the purpose of this review.<br />Missy

This oil is very soothing and gives my hair the sheen and nourishment it needs without weighing my hair down or clogging up my follicles. The nozzle is perfect for getting directly into the scalp and makes it simple if you have braids and can't get into the hair this is perfect to reach those hard to reach areas. The smell is divine not like some of the other oils made to treat dry itchy scalp.<br /><br />The Formulated Moisture Lock System with Nutrium gives your hair a blend of natural oils that will keep your hair from breaking. This oil has helped with my dry scalp and this seems to have just the right combination of ingredients to benefit your scalp and provide a healthy foundation to help your hair flourish! The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Shampoo and Conditioner is a great combination of treatment for hair that is dry and brittle.

review/summary: Clear Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil
review/text: I've been experimenting recently with leave in conditioners, detanglers, and hair serums that have various oil blends, like argan oil blends.<br /><br />So, I was curious about trying this new product from Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil.  This product does have several hair oils including mineral, coconut, palm,sweet almond oil, sunflower, soybean, argan oil and shea butter.<br /><br />Just like cooking oils, some are good for you, some are not, but any kind of oil is going to be oily.<br /><br />My suggestion is to pour a few drops of the oil into the palm of your hands, and rub your hands together before running them through your hair, because if you are going to go right for your scalp, yes it's going to make your hair look greasy, oily.<br /><br />I have very thick long hair, so the amount you might want to use may be different, but I started with about a nickel size, and ran it through my hair, starting on the ends first, then applied the rest to my scalp, and ran my brush through my hair to spread the scalp and hair oil evenly.  You can always add more if you find you need to.  You may not need to.  It's always easier to start with less and add as needed.<br /><br />It left my hair feeling soft.  I don't use hair conditioner anymore in the shower since I have been using these kinds of products.<br /><br />Next time I think I would use alittle less of this for my hair.  I also think that if smell is really an issue for you, using less of this product will not make the smell as intense, at least until you get used to it, to see if you really like the scent.<br /><br />I smell everything before I buy it, because if I don't like the scent of something Iam not going to use it.<br /><br />The scent of this scalp and hair oil, it reminds me of pina coladas, or suntan oil, which I think is an appropriate scent for this type of product.<br /><br />The bottle is 3 ounces, which I think makes this type of product last for a very long time, since you probably won't need to use alot of it each time you use it.

review/text: ..because the directions indicate "Massage into scalp and hair" How much...in wet hair or dry hair, BOTH??? This is so much like tanning oil from my beachy youth. It's too easy to use too much and have and oily mess with the tropical fragrance hanging on for dear life. So use it sparingly on your SCALP, massage it in THEN comb and/or brush your hair to distribute it because a teeny bit does go a very long way. IF you opt to put this directly on your hair, be prepared for your hair to have a residue like a glossing oil. Figuring out where this fits in with styling aids and hot tools beyond the hair dryer is an issue OR I may be rocking wash & wear hair more often.<br /><br />This is Step3: Soothe ...in this Ultra Shea line<br /><br />UPDATE: The nozzle compared to pumps many serums have, provides more control of the amount of product used. I started putting my hair in ponytail when I get home in the evenings, applying a few drops to my ends, braiding it and tucking the ends inward close to the scalp. The ends get some extra tender loving care.

review/summary: Great product for the price.
review/text: Previously the only oil I have used on my hair - by personal choice and the recommendation of my stylist - was Moroccan Oil. Though my hair is very fine, it is also a bit damaged from being colored and tends to be a bit dry. That said, if I do not wash it at least every couple of days it can get very greasy. It's a pain, to say the least :) If you are curious as to what it looks like, I suggest that you look at the pictures on my public blog - [...]. I color my hair platinum blonde but *I do not bleach it*. The roots are dyed every 4-6 weeks, though I do try to keep the dye off the ends as it helps them stay somewhat healthy. I would say that I straighten my hair about 2-3 times a week at once and almost never use a blow dryer.<br /><br />I feel that this is important information because of the other reviews that have been posted for this product. The type of hair one has is of utmost importance when considering this product. If your hair is not at all chemically treated or dry of its own accord, I'm not certain you would need to use an oil at all, but even if your hair tends toward greasiness - especially when not washed - this oil still may work for you.<br /><br />First, it does have *a* smell, and while different from that of Moroccan Oil I did not find it to be any stronger or less pleasant or to last any longer than that of Moroccan Oil. Also, the dispenser is *way* better! It's always bugged me that Moroccan Oil comes in a regular little pouring bottle, as one has to be very careful not to pour too much. The little nozzle-type dispenser on CLEAR is far superior when it comes to controlling the amount that you pour into your hand.<br /><br />I used this oil on damp hair and dry hair. I didn't see much of a difference in how it worked based on how wet or dry my hair was, but I will say this - be careful when using it with other products/using it with a straightener. I used it on my dry hair, not thinking I would be straightening my hair that day...well, I changed my mind and did straighten my hair a little while later. In doing so I used my usual thermal protection spray (CHI 44 Iron Guard) and after spraying that on and using my straightener even the driest (dry as in least healthy) parts of my hair started feeling greasy :-/<br /><br />Finally, I have to say that price-point wise you are truly getting a bargain with this product. 3 oz for $5.56 here on Amazon, vs. Moroccan Oil costing $12-13 for .85 oz or about $40 for 3.4 oz on this site. I would say that I still slightly prefer my Moroccan Oil but as I can't always afford to spend so much on a teeny tiny bottle of the stuff, CLEAR is a great secondary option for me.

review/text: Overall, I am very happy with Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Scalp and Hair Oil.  It smells amazing - like summer.  It has a nice vanilla, coconut scent.  Just take a small amount on your hands and run through your hair and massge it into the roots.  Be careful not to use to much or it may make your hair oily looking.  Overall, it is a very competitive price compared to similar product on the market.  Overall, it is a great product and if you haven't tried it, you should.

review/summary: I liked it.
review/text: Lately I have been suffering from dry scalp. So when this product was offered, I thought that I would give it a try. After all, I had nothing to lose. What I found was a product that I liked. First, I love the easy to use applicator. Once open, you can part your hair and apply the oil to your scalp, not your hair. After applying a small amount, which was super easy with this applicator, to those areas on my scalp that felt a little dry and itchy, I simply massaged my scalp and styled my hair. Secondly, I didn't find it to be too greasy, but maybe that was because I was placing the product directly to the scalp and not to the hair itself. Third, I didn't mind the smell. Unlike some who have reviewed this product, I didn't find it too overwhelming (it is tropical smelling), but again I was only placing a small amount on the scalp. Finally, I found the product to be affordable and comparable, especially when compared to other hair oils. Overall, I thought this product did exactly what it said it would...it provides nourishment to dry itchy hair. I give it a 4.

review/summary: Smells Wonderful
review/text: This is hard product to review, but will give my best shot. 1. It smells fantastic. A good whiff had me imagining a beach, pina coladas, and cabana boys. 2. It's not too thick, not too thin. Seems to spread throughout the hair pretty well. 3. One downside is anytime you touch your hair for a few hours after, you get oil on your fingers. It doesn't appear to stain clothes and towels, however. 4. Do not think you can get away with not using hair gel with it. You'll have to use your usual styling products to get your look.

review/summary: Definitely Locks in Moisture
review/text: So far this is the best hair oil treatment I've used.  The oil comes out of the bottle easily, you don't spill half of it on your hand as with other oils.  And the smell is a pleasant one.  It moisturizes thoroughly.  So thoroughly that even though I wash and condition my hair every day this treatment has given my hair the "wet" look for several days.  Which actually is stylish in its own right.  So that is a warning, when you used this be prepared for the wet look.  But in the end it is very beneficial and I'm pleased with it.

review/summary: No Difference Noticed
review/text: I have lots of these products - I'm a big fan of Kenra Platinum Silkening Gloss, Moroccanoil and BioSilk (love the strawberry smell). I feel like Moroccanoil darkens my blonde hair, Biosilk leaves it greasy, and the Kenra Silkening Gloss is not always easy to find. That said, it works great for my brunette 7 year old, but she complains that her scalp is itchy (dry) now that we've entered the dry, heavy swim season. As a cycling commuter, I wash my hair a lot, which drys my scalp. Neither Biosilk or the Kenra product work very well on dry hair. So, this seemed a good fit.<br /><br />It comes in a small bottle with a nozzle. Are you supposed to drizzle it on your scalp? I found this really awkward at first. It works though, and it is a very runny consistency. So, I appreciated the nozzle the first time the bottle tipped over and nothing spilled.<br /><br />I think the idea is that after a few days of use, your scalp should be nourished and your hair less dry. I have not found this to be true after playing with the amount I have added. Adding it to my wet hair has done nothing. I have very, very thick hair - and quite frankly I am not sure how well a job at getting to my scalp I have done. It does seem to have helped my daughter. I have added it to her hair only dry. It has not left either of our hair greasy. I notice no added shine even combing it through.<br /><br />I looked at the other reviews, and people commented on the smell. I cannot smell it. Neither can she. Perhaps I am not adding enough. However, I have been adding about a walnut size amount (way more than the pea size the other products require). Keep in mind we are outside A LOT and our hair is being washed quite a bit, so I think that explains a lot of greasy vs. not greasy variables people report. At this rate, it won't last long.<br /><br />Bottom line: Maybe it takes a long time to work, but I am not going to recommend this one based on our very average at best results. I tend to have sensitive skin and have had no reaction to this at all. I will keep using it until it is gone and update if my opinion changes.

review/summary: Don't "Do" It
review/text: Before using this hair oil or serum I was confused.  The name of this product refers to the "scalp," but anyone using hair oils or serums knows you don't put that stuff anywhere near your scalp.  That's where you're hair is healthiest but also the first hair that gets oily.  Additionally, I see it's for natural and relaxed hair.  I don't understand how it can be good for both.  Relaxed hair is usually very delicate and/or damaged, and natural hair is usually less so.  Another problem, I received a bottle with a label covering any product details without any directions how to apply or what it's for.  Do I use this as a treatment or a serum?<br /><br />Looking over the list of ingredients, which I had to look up on the internet, a major red flag jumped out at me - the first ingredient is mineral oil!  That's something most people would not want to put anywhere near their hair.  More importantly, "ultra shea" is shown on the label but you only find it listed as the seventh ingredient.  Avid label readers know the further down on the list of ingredients, the less of that substance is in the product.<br /><br />This product is a blend of various oils:  mineral, coconut, palm, shea, wheat germ, sweet almond, sunflower seed, soybean and argan.  So I would strongly advise applying very, very little of this to your hair, and mostly to damaged sections (bottom half).  I caution anyone who doesn't have very dry hair that this is not for them.<br /><br />Onto the packaging.  It's cheap and downright awful.  This bottle reminds me of the developer container you get w/ box hair color which is destined for the garbage after one use.  Product junkies prefer something esthetically pleasing in their packaging, and there's absolutely zero here.  Also, as others have mentioned, the fragrance is unappealing.  Do NOT like it.  I have fine hair so this stuff just weighed it down.  If you have fine hair, my recommendation might be to use this as a pre-shampoo or overnight treatment (you might want to protect your pillowcase) that you can shampoo out in the morning.  Will update in this regard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I do like this stuff as a treatment for my ends.  It does a nice job of smoothing them and makes them feel less dry.  So I'll nudge up my rating to three stars.  (Still not loving the fragrance.)<br /><br />CAUTION!  I'm taking one star off this.  Last night this stuff fell off my dresser and broke open, leaving oil all over my parkay floor.  Only confirmed my comments about the EXTREMELY cheap packaging.  When does a plastic bottle break upon dropping?  For a hot minute I thought about salvaging the remainder of product but instead just tossed it.  Whatever you do, don't drop this stuff unless you want a dangerously slippery floor!  Could only imagine the serious situation something like this could present for an older person with osteoporosis.  Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy:  a lawsuit could certainly be in your future!

I only gave it 3 stars, because it's not fair for me to give it a positive OR a negative rating.<br /><br />The Vine program strictly states I can't pass this product on to anyone else. If I could, I would have given it to someone that could have given it a true review.<br /><br />The only possible help I can be is to state that.....<br /><br />-This is for ETHNIC hair. If I had known I wouldn't have requested it.<br /><br />-The directions aren't great, in my opinion. It simply says to rub into scalp and hair. For those who use ethnic products, this may be clear enough. (???) I didn't know how long to leave it in before washing out. (Is it supposed to be washed out?)

review/summary: Deep conditioning
review/text: I used this product a couple of times and am not thrilled with it. I don't see it as something to use every time you shampoo, just when your hair is dry and needs deep conditioning. I have short, fine hair with natural curl, and I found that this product weighed my hair down. It might be more suitable for someone with long, thick hair. The second time I used it, I wound up shampooing my hair lightly afterward to get rid of the sticky texture. As other reviewers have noted, there were no instructions with this product, so I'm not sure how it is to be used -- before shampooing, after shampooing, after conditioning and so forth. I have been pleased with the Clear Scalp & Hair shampoo and conditioner, but this one doesn't work for me.

review/summary: Okay as a Preconditioner
review/text: This oil smells heavily of coconut.  Not unpleasant but a bit off.  It is a combination of mineral oil and other assorted oils.  The package came with no directions which was annoying.  I am growing out my hair and the ends have gotten quite dry.  I rubbed a small amount on my palsm and rubbed through the drier areas of my hair.  It did not enhance the shine at all, actually made it look like it was a few days off first freshness. It did feel better though, smoother and softer.  I have been using it as a preconditioner.  That is I put some on about an hour before I shampoo, applying it to the dryest sections.<br /><br />It would probably work well with very dry hair or on hair damaged by harsh chemical treatments, ie, perms or color.  However with the glut of all natural products on the market today, I can't think of any compelling reason to use a product where the main ingredient is mineral oil.

review/summary: Greasy, Stiff Could not get it out of my hair fast enough!
review/text: Terrible.<br /><br />Where to begin First a list of ingredients:Mineral OIL, hyrogenated coconut OIL, hyrogenerated styrene/butadiene copolymer, palm OIL, fragrance, BHT, SHEA BUTTER, trticum vulare (wheat)germ OIL, sweet almond OIL, sunflower seed OIL, soybean OIL, argania spinosa kernal OIL, & last but not least aloe leaf juice.<br /><br />There is NO possible way this product is going to "Provides light, non-greasy nourishment to scalp & hair" Yet that is exactly what is says on the bottle.<br /><br />Second the instructions for use are "hip" but vague: 1. Cleanse 2. Smooth. 3. SOOTH 4. Seal.<br /><br />I went online for further clarification and found nothing but a spectacular ad campaign with a beautiful model and her  amazing hair. So I decided to experiment I figured my first use would be the same way one would use V05 hair oil (a great product, by the way.) I would wash my hair, forgo conditioner, rub in the oil and rinse. If this was too light then I would on my second application wash, rub in oil and leave it in.<br /><br />I never got to the second experiment.<br /><br />After only washing my hair, applying a dose of no more than a teaspoon (seriously a little goes a long way.) and then giving my hair a rinse and patted my hair out with a towel. One and a half hours later (my hair is fairly thick & goes to the middle of my back.) My hair was dry BUT appeared, matted & greasy to the eye as well as to the touch. I looked like I had laquered my head! I could not wash my hair fast enough. Oddly upon my second hair-washing my hair had achieved a pleasant level of softness, shine and a visible improvement in my split ends. But at a very gross price.<br /><br />V05 is by far a less troublesome and superior product. I believe I'll stick with that and avoid this one and I can not recommend this product as nothing more than a great lubricant for perhaps sliding a tight ring off a swollen finger.

review/text: When I got the product I didn't see any instructions, there is a pull up tab and it says massage into hair and scalp..huh?<br />Well for how long do I leave it and how much do I use.<br /><br />My hair is rather a disaster right now. I get bronchitis bad about 2 times a year and end up in the hospital on high steroids, then I loose about 1/4 of my over hair a few months later. This just started a few years ago, first It went totally curly and I have straight hair, had that for a year, then some fell out...the curls and straight came back my normal. This time is really bad, it is frizzy and slight wave to it. Nothing helps it, I have fine thin hair all my life now it looks like a ton of hair but horrid.<br /><br />So I cannot give a true review on a product not for me. I called the number on the bottle which is wrong you get MCI tele network. So I found the website and no number there but video's and sure enough this is for Ethnic hair not caucasian hair<br />like mine. There should be clear information on who the product is for.

review/summary: Well... it smells ok? Perfumed mineral oil, in a cute bottle.
review/text: I have dry colored hair, I use quite a few different products for softening and shine and thought this might be a nice and very inexpensive option compared to my 10x the price typical products. I was wrong.<br /><br />The description states: Formulated with Nutrium 10 Moisture Lock system, a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm, the treatment provides light, non-greasy nourishment to the scalp and hair. Notice the lack of mentioning the main ingredient, mineral oil? I have very sensitive skin and using anything with mineral oil causes me major breakouts, no way would I use something like that on my hair and scalp (since it would inevitably get on my face). I did want to be fair and test it though so I used a tiny tiny amount on the ends of my hair... it left my hair extremely greasy looking and feeling even with just a little drop.<br /><br />I'm considering using it as a hand and/or foot moisturizer and seeing how it works for that, and once the bottle is empty I'll soak it and scrub it and then use it for my usual hair syrums since the bottle really is cute and I love how easy it is to dispense just the right amount of product. For the couple dollars it might be a good by for a skin moisturizer and the container ;)

review/summary: Weighted down my hair
review/text: I really wanted to love this product but I couldn't. First off, it came with no directions. At the back it said:<br />"1. Cleanse 2. Smooth 3. Soothe 4. Seal"<br />Does Seal mean put a hairblower over it? I had no idea.<br /><br />I have curly damaged hair which I always blow dry straight. My hair is very thin, and my scalp is normal/dry. The main ingredient of this product is Mineral Oil. Mineral Oil is cheap to make, and its not that good for your hair. This product has "Shea" in it, but there is more Mineral oil than Shea oil in this product.<br /><br />Putting it on dry hair made my hair very greasy. My hair is thinning so I found the hair product weighted down my hair. I thought maybe I was using the product wrong so I cut down the oil from my usual drops to about 1 to 2 drops and instead of dry hair, I only applied it on wet hair. This made my hair shinier, and cut down significantly on weighing it down.<br /><br />My solution for this product was to use it on my ends only after showering (just a few drops) to have it as a "protection barrier" for when I blow dry it straight since ends are more prone to breakage.<br /><br />For reference, my hair is type 3A, but I never leave it curly, I always blow dry it straight.<br /><br />Reading the reviews, I believe this product is intended for and works best on hairs type 3C, 4A, 4B, and 4C.

review/summary: I'd buy it just for the smell
review/text: I love the way this product smells! So I could see how it spreads and absorbs into the skin, I put some on my arms (which are dry, old-lady arms). I kept catching myself sniffing my arms, this stuff smells so good. Yeah, I know that's weird! But I'd buy it just for the smell. It's wonderful.<br /><br />This is just what it says: an oil. It doesn't take very much. I have short, very fine curly hair, and at first I put on too much. (Most of it absorbed, but I was left with an oily spot. Next time I'll know.) After about ten minutes, I could definitely feel a change&mdash;almost a coolness to my skin as it was absorbed.<br /><br />I found the best way to use this oil on my own hair is to rub a few drops between my palms and then rub my hands lightly all over my curls. The oil lends a nice sheen to my hair. Too much, though, will weigh down very fine hair. I expect that for someone with the kind of hair I've always dreamed of having (thick, black, long, Oriental hair), this hair oil would be absolutely incredible!<br /><br />The little tip is good for squirting a little directly onto your scalp, which I did in an area that tends to be a little itchy. It helped. I don't know that I'd want to share this with another person, however. (Tell them to get their own.)<br /><br />I think I might try an overnight intensive treatment by first washing my hair, applying and smoothing plenty of oil into my scalp, then sleeping with my head wrapped in a towel or light heat cap until morning. Before I went out anywhere, I'd lightly shampoo my hair and then fluff it out with my fingers and let it dry normally. A person with thicker hair probably wouldn't have to do this.

review/summary: Leaves hair oily and greasy looking.
review/text: I give myself a Keratin Straightening Treatment to relax my naturally curly thick hair every 3 to 4 months.  One product I routinely use to car and style my hair is products with Argan oils.  I currently use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QG6P9G">Agadir Argan Oil Spray Treatment</a> prior to blow drying and after styling my hair to give some added nourishment and shine.  After reading the ingredients and description to the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil I thought my hair and scalp would benefit from the over processing of chemical straightening and flat ironing.  Boy was I wrong.  I gave it at least the 7 days as stated, but all I noticed was an oily residue left in my hair.  It does not glide on easily and  evenly throughout your hair.  Even though I am accustomed to using a mist bottle with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QG6P9G">Agadir Argan Oil Spray Treatment</a>, I have tried other serum shine oils and have had better effects than this brand!<br /><br />The only positive comment I can say is that it does leave a nice scent on your hair.

review/summary: Affordable and just the right thing!
review/text: I am 50 year old and still have the same thick curly hair I did when I was 13.  I have been looking for the right mix of care products. Just last month I switched to three products:<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner,<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil,<br /><br />My hair is dryer now that I am older and the shampoo really does the trick of cleaning without destroying my hair, it cleanses completely to remove product build-up. The conditioner allows me to much more easily run a brush through my hair. Without flattening my hair it reduces the dryness that flat ironing can do and reduces breakage.  It really does lock in moisture and provide long lasting nourishment.  The Therapy works best on wet hair, it gives deep, non-greasy nourishment to my hair and lends a healthy looking shine.  I can wash, condition and therapy my hair Monday. Tuesday I can wet my hair put the therapy in and it looks brand new.<br /><br />The real test was going to my salon and my stylist of 8 years noticed the difference in softness. I love the blend of shea, vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm. It really works for me. I did find the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair.<br /><br />KEEPER!

review/summary: Not a substitute for argan oil
review/text: I have fine, slightly wavy hair that is prone to frizziness, especially in the very humid conditions that are prevalent in my city.  In the past, I have used argan oil after showering and before blow-drying to take away the frizz without weighing down my hair or making it look greasy.  Argan oil is quite expensive, though, so I decided to try this Clear Scalp Hair Oil as a less expensive alternative.  Bad decision.  The Clear Scalp oil does have a nice, not overpowering tropical scent, and it was easy to apply to my hair.  However, even a very small amount of the oil left my hair limp and greasy looking.  I had to take another shower, and I had to wash my hair twice with shampoo in order to get all the oil out.  This product might work for women with very coarse hair or perhaps very curly hair, but it doesn't work for me.  I'm thinking it might make a nice furniture oil, though, since it has that lovely scent.

review/summary: Gorgeous, Glossy, Glamorous Tresses!
review/text: I got this sample a little over a week ago, and I have to admit at first I was unimpressed.  It looked like a very small bottle of olive oil. My daughter even asked me why cooking oil was in the bathroom, assuming that I was making some sort of homemade beauty product. She's mistaking me for my mother, who thinks all the best beauty products are made in the kitchen. I'm the one who thinks the kitchen is best for making food.<br /><br />I had just about decided that this little bottle of oil wasn't for me, until I came in last night. Our pool is wonderful, but the chemicals are murder on my hair. After washing and using my usual conditioner, my hair resembled some sort of witch's broom instead of straight hair down my back. With a tiny bit of hope, I picked up the bottle and decided to give it a try.  I put three tiny drops on my palm, rubbed my hands together, and began applying it to my hair from the frizzy bottoms on up.<br /><br />My bottle had no directions, which is the sole reason why I gave it four stars instead of five. The product is terrific, but I guessing how to use it isn't. The name of the product says "Scalp & Hair Oil," and I only applied it to my hair, because my scalp makes enough oil on its own. Guesstimating, I used 80% of the product on my hair from the shoulders down, since that's the part that's damaged and dry. I then styled my hair as usual.<br /><br />Wow! What a difference! My hair looks healthy, unfrizzy and perfect all the way down!  That tiny amount of product made the abused part of my hair looks glossy, and as if it had no split ends or damage at all! It didn't look oily or messy at all, which was my fear when the family was calling it "cooking oil." In the interest of making a total disclaimer, I do not use heat on my hair at all; no blow dryer, no straightener, nothing. My hair is naturally straight, and I think that blow dryers hurt very long hair, so I always air dry it. The damage to the bottom half of my hair came from a misguided effort to put in highlights, when the stylist took a phone call and left the chemicals on for far, far longer than necessary. I looked rather like a skunk when the chemicals were finally rinsed off. I've been cutting off the damage as my hair grows, but it takes time.<br /><br />Happiness abounds! I don't have skunky, scruffy, damaged hair, and I don't have an oily mess, either. The package dispenses the product by the drop, so this should last me a very long time, even if I use it daily. No matter - I am impressed enough with the results that I'd go out and buy some right away! (Hmm. I should buy some for my mother and let her see how much better it is to use than kitchen products! :-)  )

review/summary: Smells nice, very oily
review/text: Although I don't have long flowing hair, I do have dry hair, and I was pretty darn excited about trying this scalp therapy because I love coconut oil, shea butter, and some of the other ingredients. Upon application, my first thought was "Wow! This smells AMAZING!" and was even more excited. Unfortunately, after that, it felt like I dumped a tub or vegetable oil on my head. I expected it to be a little slick, but I've used coconut oil before and did not notice it being this oily. The mineral oil must be a very large portion of the ingredients because that is basically all it feels like.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the condition on my hair and scalp did not improve. Overall, the product smells very good, but looks and feels greasy. I wouldn't bother with it.

review/summary: Light
review/text: I like this product. I just cut my hair, and I have a teeny, weeny afro (TWA). Since I co-wash my hair daily (some people don't), I put this on my scalp using the tip. I drag it across my scalp in different places while I apply light pressure on the bottle. That way only a little bit at a time comes out of the bottle.<br /><br />Even if you're not black, or don't have "ethnic" hair, you can use this too, You can use it directly on your scalp the night before you wash it. That allows the oils time to sink into your scalp. OR, you can apply it to the ends of your hair to help prevent split ends. I taught my (Caucasian) roommate this in college. Use it on the ends or use it on your scalp the night before.<br /><br />I do find the oil to be light, but that a little bit goes a long way. I don't use it in the mornings, since, although I have a short haircut, I'm not looking for my hair to be oily - just moisturized.

review/summary: Just okay.
review/text: I've used this a few times now to make sure I got it right and have to say it's just okay.  My hair is very short and dry so using an oil after I shampoo and condition is a must.  This one left my hair a bit flat and got greasy faster than what I usually use.  One drop is all you need if your hair is short let me tell you otherwise you'll have a grease pit on top of your mellon.  The fragrance is okay, nothing special and not dreadfully gross.  Not my fav but I'd use it anywho.  It might be better to use this after going to the ocean since the salt and sand can really do a number on your hair.  That's my two cents.

review/summary: Very Oily Product Good For Dry Hair & Scalps
review/text: The advertising for this product, CLEAR Scalp & Hair Therapy Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil is somewhat misleading as far as I am concerned. It is frankly more of an oil that ends up on your hair and scalp leaving a greasy feel. It is very hard to remove from your hair once you get it rubbed in. I am positive though that I used too much at the first. I had to shampoo several times before I was able to remove most of it. In fact I used the CLEAR Shampoo for removal of this oil.<br /><br />If a person had a very dry scalp I can understand why they might want to use this oil. It could perhaps leave the scalp less dry, however in my case my scalp is not that dry and thus I just don't think I need to use this product. The claim that this product leaves a non-greasy nourishment to one's scalp is not necessarily true in my case.<br /><br />There is also the claim this product provides light non-greasy nourishment to the hair and this might be true for someone with very dry hair and scalp. I do not fall in that category and my hair had the feel of being heavily laced with oil.<br /><br />I think the product may be useful for some consumers while others may experience the same results I did. You won't know until you test the product. I would suggest using a very small amount during you first test and then go from there. This is an oil based product and I don't know how else to describe it. Good for some people and not so good for others.

review/summary: 50/50 Coin Toss - Multiple Uses and How to be the BEST LIAR! *WINK*
review/text: Tried it on my hair, big mistake, even when I used very, very little - my hair looked like it had been slamed dunked into an oil pit! But Read On:<br /><br />* If you have a sore spot - use a cotton swab and dab it in the area of your head after your shower and towel dry (if you use a blow dryer, wait until after you blow dry then dab the sore area - it works almost like Tea Tree Oil)<br /><br />* Works great on my cat who has a tiny sore spot (it comes and goes), used a cotton swab behind her ear and after two days it was gone and she's one happy camper and never once had to scratch either<br /><br />* If your hair has split ends or frizzy ends, wait until your have showered and towel dried first, then with a itsey weensy dab of this rub into your hands and then work on the ends of your hair - it really works. ONLY at the ends of the hair, not the whole head.<br /><br />* Soothes those razor burns after shaving (even for men too!) - OUCH! Just a little dab will do ya!<br /><br />---------<br /><br />Want to be the greatest liar? SHHHHHH! Have a nice tan or turned into a Lobster - (whether for real to sprayed on) ... use some of this on some strands of your hair, after you had set your hair, then tussel it up with some SEA SALT added to it - but SHHH, be sure you wear Beach Bum outfit (you liar you and don't forget the Sun block! ;) .... for that added effect and smell!)  Just remember, if you hang out at the bars, just go to the RIGHT one!  (But of course, that's our little secret here - don't tell anyone or everyone else will be doing it! HAHAHAHAHA! Let the other guys and gals turn green with envy! :-D ...)<br /><br />--------<br /><br />Bad News - if you happened to wind up in a dilemma such as I did, with a head that looked like it had been slammed into an oil pit. GOOD NEWS - just add a cup of regular vinegar to rinse it off while in the shower (close eyes and/or keep head down and keep eyes closed), then add a warm unopened can of beer (no specific brand - a cheap one will do); pour on your hair (if your hair is very long, use the large can of beer), let it soak for 3 mins (short) to 5 mins (long) while you take a shower then rinse it out ... there you go, you've got your hair back and it's nice and soft like a baby's hair, but do not shampoo or use conditioner or treat afterwards until the next day. What Vinegar does - it strips all the oil out. What beer does, it restores the Ph balance into the hair; but it only lasts up to about 16 to 24 hours (longer time frame if dry hair, shorter span if oily). At least you have your hair back!<br /><br />]]]^}

review/summary: Great scent!  Coconutty.
review/text: Here are my impressions:<br /><br />There really we not many directions with this, or indications of who this product would be best suited for and what the uses are.  I was thinking this would be like my "liquid silk" that I use when I want to flat iron my hair to be smooth and straight... something to take out the frizziness of my normally fine wavy/curly Caucasian hair.  And that could be true, it can also be used for dry scalp too.<br /><br />The main ingredient is Mineral oil, followed by all the other stuff that are what makes it smell nice.  But you could probably just buy mineral oil and get the same effect without the nice scent.<br /><br />I would probably use this more in the winter than the summer in the future.  My hair gets oily if I sweat but my scalp gets dandruff in the winter so I think that would be the more optimal time to use it.  However it is worth noting that a tiny amount (3 drops) rubbed between my palms then smoothed on my hair worked WAY better at taming frizz than my expensive frizz control sprays- but again... I think straight mineral oil might have the same effect too at a smaller price... Although the smell is certainly great.  I am a sucker for that coconut smell.

review/summary: Another misleading product from this line
review/text: With the increased popularity of argon and coconut oils being used by women of all ethnicities, I mistakenly thought this product would be appropriate for my hair.  I use argon oil now, and it really helps to calm frizz and flyaways for my colored (and overly dry) hair.<br /><br />I have thick, coarse, wavy hair that is color treated.  I have used hot oils, and leave in oils, for years, without having any problems.  But this product seems to be intended mostly for ethnic hair.  No where on the product does it say this, but the advertisement has an ethnic model, and other products in the line are clearly not intended for Caucasian hair.<br /><br />Since there are NO directions on this product, I would imagine I would use it the same way I use my argon oil, but that results is limp, greasy looking hair, even when using the product sparingly.  And the ingredients certainly leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Perhaps a woman with ethnic hair would know immediately that this product was intended for her, but with very little information provided in the description and even less on the packaging, I think a lot of women are tricked into thinking this is an appropriate product for their hair type, and it really is not.  I think this product needs an overhaul with more clarification in it's advertising, description, and packaging.

review/text: Let me start by saying that, unlike many other reviewers, I have absolutely no idea what kind of oil is good or bad for hair.  I have, however, always used and liked coconut oil products and, when I saw that listed as one of the ingredients (along with shea butter), I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />I was also interested in this product more for my dry ends rather than for my scalp.<br /><br />Now, I've read many of the other reviews where they refer to this as an "ethnic" hair product.  I read the product description and all the information on the product itself, and don't see that anywhere.  But, since it seems to be an issue, I am mixed race with very long, fine, wavy hair.  I use no "ethnic" hair products and never have.<br /><br />On to the product:<br />I decided to use a very small drop of the product strictly on the ends of my hair.  The drop was smaller than a dime.  I rubbed it onto my hands and then into my hair.<br /><br />The smell was not unpleasant and didn't linger very long in my hair.<br /><br />The oil was very greasy.  It coated my hands unpleasantly and left an unpleasant sheen in my hair.  I didn't like the way that it looked so, although the instructions didn't say to do so, I brushed it in.  That made it a bit better, however my hair still looked greasy and heavy.<br /><br />The plain fact is that, like anyone else, I like my hair to look clean. Instead of imparting a healthy shine, this product made my hair look greasy and unwashed.<br /><br />Simply put, I will not be using it again.

review/summary: Mineral oil as a hair care product
review/text: I take the tasks of reviewing a product very seriously. I try to be as fair to the manufacturer as possible. I consider that although every product is not for but may be for someone else.  This is the first product that I can't imagine anyone benefiting from. I have ethnic relaxed hair.  My hair is long as it reaches pass my bra strap snaps in the back.  I also put a rinse (semi-permanent color) in my hair.  Initially, I was excited that would find a product that I could use as a hot oil treatment as well as daily maintenance for those in need of a touch-up dry scalp days. This product failed to meet my expectations in every way.  My hair felt oily and weighted down.  After using it as a hot oil treatment, I washed my hair; but because of the oil I had to use extra shampoo and my hair still felt greasy. I had to wash my hair 5 times to get the oil out.  After being frustrated and gravely disappointed, I read the ingredients. MINERAL OIL!  Are you kidding me? Mineral oil is not good for hair. It attracts dirt and clogs your pores / scalp. It does not matter what else is in the product if the first ingredient is mineral oil. I think I'm going to use it as body oil in the winter. If that becomes a problem then I will be using the remaining product as a WD40 substitute. I truly can not recommend this product.  I wish to warn other consumers to use restraint.  There are so many products on the market that are better choices for hair care.

Since both of these attempts were on dry hair and the oil says it can be used on dry or wet, I decided to try it after washing my hair.  Again, my hair ended up greasy.

review/summary: Smells like suntan lotion, low on shea
review/text: While this product calls itself "Ultra Shea" and also notes "with shea butter" on the front label, shea is actually the 7th ingredient, after Mineral Oil (#1), Hydrogenated Coconut Oil (hence the suntan lotion smell), Hydrogenated Styrene/Butadiene Copolymer, Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) oil, and BHT (preservative). So if you're expecting some yummy natural product from the "ultra shea" reference, you'll be disappointed. In this case "ultra" either means "a little bit" or "mostly petrochemical products but also."<br /><br />(Notably, the ingredients aren't immediately visible on the bottle--you have to remove the peel-off label to expose them.)<br /><br />But I'm not opposed to synthetic beauty products, so aside from the misleading packaging, I gave it a whirl. It's a pretty standard hair oil: greasy and thick, which is good for heavy damage or use on ends. I'd probably avoid using it on my scalp except as a deep treatment to be shampooed out, because the oil is quite heavy.<br /><br />But the scent is a deal-breaker for me. It's a *heavy* coconut smell that doesn't readily dissipate and leaves you smelling like you should be on a carnival cruise ship. (I love a light coconut scent, especially tempered with citrus  or mint; but this smells like you're all buttered up in a deck chair swilling a pina colada.)<br /><br />I do like the bottle, which has an elmer's glue type lid that lets you dispense a few drops at a time, and seems to be pretty leak-resistant.

review/summary: Misnamed and Confusing to Use - 2 1/2 Stars
review/text: Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty seemed like a good option as I keep my hair a bit longer and it does tend to be dry at the ends and occasionally at the scalp.<br /><br />Pros - It works well on the dry ends and if it were marketed as a product this way then I'd probably give it 4 stars.<br /><br />Cons - It has LOTS of oil content (starting with mineral oil) and arrived with no directions on how much to use, when to use, how often to use, etc.<br />When applied to the scalp in a small quantity the hair gets an oily appearance and sheen. Since that area of my hair is normally fine, just dry once in a while, that appearance wasn't needed. If you have VERY DRY hair then you might want to apply it there. I used the product twice in one week and my hair then looked greasy.  Cutting back to once a week and applying it to the dry hair in a small quantity worked better and it looks as though it might be just as effective if only used every 10 days.

This is mostly mineral oil with a little fragrance and maybe some other oils added. I put two drops on my palms and rubbed it just on the ends of my hair. Result: greasy hair.  I can't imagine what a mess you'd have if you rubbed this into your scalp.<br /><br />This may sound a little weird, please don't judge me. When my dog was in my face...."whaddya got there? what is is? is it good to eat?".....I put a few drops in my hands and rubbed it on her fur. She looked pretty greasy for a while but it had soaked in by the next day. At least she smelled sort of nice for a while.<br /><br />If you have the sort of hair that can stand up to an oil change this might work for you. For ordinary hair ,I don't think so much.

review/summary: Leave Hair Very Oily
review/text: With all the natural oils, I thought this would be a great product. Although I am caucasian, my hair is very dry and frizzy. Sometimes oil helps. The dispensing nozzle on this is nice because it allows you to get the product directly on your scalp and not use much. The down side is even if you only use a tiny bit and rinse it out, your hair will be left very oily. I didn't like the greasy hair it left me with at all.

review/summary: Questionably Effective Product
review/text: I have been rushing through this product line and this is the third product I've tested. I'm not sure what they were thinking of when they dreamed up the product. It does not come with directions for usage. I winged it and liberally applied it to my dry scalp. My hair was pretty oily and I massaged some more into my scalp, wrapped my hair under a shower cap, and put on a heat cap on the medium setting for 30 minutes to allow the product to absorb. I followed all of this with a shampoo.<br />The end result was an oily mess. My hair was droopy and still slick looking. I shampooed twice and finally got this goop out after using a clarifying shampoo followed up by a warm and then cold rinse. My scalp wasn't dry but it didn't feel any different from when I started.<br />The main product listed first in the ingredients was mineral oil. Mineral oil is greasy. My advice is avoid this product.

review/summary: Oil that smells nice
review/text: I have to say this is a bewildering product.  When do I apply it?  During a shower? Afterwards?  There are no instructions, so I simply tried many ways of using it before writing this review.<br /><br />Using it in the shower, this makes my hair too oily to dry and style properly.  (What would be the point of washing the product out?  And, anyway, I tried, and found it took at least two shampooings!  Which defeats the purpose of "nourishing my scalp.")  Using before bedtime results in oily pillows.  Before brushing my hair in the mornings is a bit better, but then my hair looks oily and flat.<br /><br />Probably the most worrisome effect associated with "Clear Scalp" would be (get ready for "Eewwww")...bigger dandruff flakes.  That's right, my scalp felt nice, and I got less flakes--but they are much, much bigger in diameter since I started using this product.<br /><br />As another reviewer here says, it is basically mineral oil with fragrance.

review/summary: Great product for frizzy hair....
review/text: OK, so I had no illusions that this product was somehow organic & chemical free considering that it's made by Unilever (owner of Alberto Culver, Helene Curtis, Faberge', etc.) and costs less than 5 bucks. That being said, I had great results with this product. I used it as a "hot oil" treatment, and also to tame flyaways after shampooing (a few drops will do for this purpose).There are NO instructions about how to use the product, however. Having worked in the beauty field, I didn't have an issue with this. It's a light oil (yes, it's mineral oil....that's what less expensive hair products like this are made of) but there are also some fairly "nutritious" oils added in too. My wavy 'post hypothyroid' hair likes this product, even though I believe it's more intended for ethnic hair. If you have a dry, itchy scalp or dry, frizzy flyaway hair this product can help as long as it's used properly. Think of it like the old fashioned VO5 (brilliantine) in a bottle, rather than trying to use it like a conditioner. I also use an Argan oil hair product, and this product is very similar, yet at 1/4th the cost.<br /><br />The scent is "just right" a lightly fruity fragrance, which I prefer over flowery perfume-y scents most common in hair care products. If you can keep your expectations in alignment with reality, this product is...after all, less than $5 per bottle...I feel that you'll be satisfied. If not, you will be disappointed. If you need a totally organic product that does something similar, I'd opt for pure coconut oil instead (with essential oil added for fragrance if need be). Mineral oil can cause acne in individuals prone to it, so I'd keep this oil off your face (especially around the hairline where blemishes can develop) if that is the case. You can also wash your face after applying if you happen to spill.<br /><br />If your hair is parched (oil dry), brittle, dull (no shine), or heat damaged this product is for you. Otherwise, I can see this oil as being too heavy for more normal hair types.

review/summary: "Ultra Shea" = Mineral Oil
review/text: I will echo other reviewers in asking why advertise a product as "Ultra Shea" when the first ingredient is mineral oil and shea comes several ingredients after.<br /><br />I tried it, but as another reviewer said, I didn't know quite what to do with it. There weren't instructions. I read a bit but geez, I don't have time to research this item. It only made my hair limp, and it was hard to wash out. Surely that would dry my scalp more than at baseline.<br /><br />All in all, I distrust products that advertise "shea" but contain primarily mineral oil.<br /><br />And my mother's method for keeping her girls' locks strong and shiny still works for me: Apply warm olive oil to scalp and wrap in a towel for a few hours.

review/summary: CLEAR-ly the Best
review/text: The summer season is a challenge for dry hair and an itchy scalp. The sun, wind, pool chlorine, and daily drying heat from the weather as well as hair dryers and irons can wreak havoc on even normal hair. Finding the right product that doesn't require a lot of effort is another challenge. Thankfully, CLEAR SCALP AND HAIR has solved both these problems with this hair oil.<br /><br />The price is right for the 3 oz bottle and the applicator tip is easy to use. I like the fact that it can be applied to either wet or dry hair. This is a huge product advantage since merely washing dry hair can cause more drying - by washing away natural hair and follicle oils - thereby increasing the very problem you are trying to solve.<br /><br />After just one application, my 10-year old daughter's hair was beautiful; it was shiny and more lush and silky looking. And this product definitely made it easier for her to style her tangle and frizz-free hair. She reported less scalp irritation and scratchiness. We liked the smell; the shea butter is a favorite ingredient in both our hair and body creams. The recommended 7-day application program used up this bottle, but left behind way more manageable hair that she can renourish as needed.<br /><br />However, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that while CLEAR isn't greasy looking on the hair, it can leave a residue on bedding and clothing. For that reason, we apply it on dry hair in the morning so that by evening it is completely absorbed while offering a fresh look for the day.<br /><br />If you are unhappy with your current hair oil or are looking for something new, CLEAR may be for you.

review/summary: Surprisingly good for a product reminiscent of the `50's
review/text: For some reason, whenever I end up putting oil on my head, I think of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019GE8ZC">Vitalis Hair Tonic For Men, 7 Ounce</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET7MAW">Brylcreem Hair Groom, Original, 5.5 fl oz (162 ml) (Pack of 3)</a>: grease everything down so not a hair on your head moves and you look like everybody else: neat but wet. Which is not to suggest that using this scalp treatment by Clear Scalp made me look or feel like a greaser or anything. In fact, the oil in this product feels pretty much like any other oil when I put it on my fingers, but when I rubbed it into my scalp, it dissipated quite aggressively. I even had to add a few drops more to cover my entire head after the first application got soaked into my skin and hair so easily. Clear Scalp didn't make my hair sticky and it didn't give it a very "wet" look. It just looks like I might have put some mousse or gel there and tousled my hair a bit. In other words, it seems greasy, but isn't. I have to say, too, that I'd actually been having a bit of dry scalp itchiness when I finally got around to trying this product, and it seems to have helped a lot. The itchiness has been reduced, I like the look of my hair, and this treatment is easy to use and reliably consistent. I was almost sure that any kind of hair or scalp oil would only rate two or three stars at the most, as this is 2012 and oily hair is for Lenny and Squiggy and Elvis impersonators, but this is a solid product. I'm confident in giving it a full five star rating, deservingly so.

review/summary: Greasy Feeling but it is not dry
review/text: This product does make my hair feel less dry and there were no flakes, however, it made my hair greasy and heavy (no fluff it just laid there), I did not use that much, but it just made everything feel greasy and gave my hair a wet (out of the shower look all day).  I stopped using it since it makes my hair greasy feeling and whenever I would touch my hair it made my hands feel wet and was very difficult to get off of my hands.<br /><br />In the end this did make my hair less dry, but gave it a a greasy feeling that I cannot stand, so I had to stop using it, my hair looks terrible when greasy and feels heavy and wet.  I was not happy with this and it was difficult to get out during the next shower (plus if you touch your hair and get it on your hands you have to scrub like crazy to get it off.

review/summary: Smells delicious, and it works, too
review/text: This Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil smells so delicious that I was thinking about eating some. But then I read the ingredients, and it contains things I've never heard of like Hydrogenated styrene, Tocopheryl Acetate, and Helianthus Annuus. So, I don't think I'll actually be tasting this anytime soon. But if someone forced me to consume one of the products in my bathroom, like if I had cursed too much, and needed my mouth cleansing, I'd definitely choose this one.<br /><br />In addition to smelling wonderful (it has a herbal honey kind of smell), you're probably wondering if it works. Yes, it works great. It made my hair and scalp feel nourished and healthy whenever I used it. It made the itchy parts of my hair not itchy anymore, too.<br /><br />The only downsides I could see to this product is that it is a little sticky, and it's easy to overdo it (especially with how good it smells). Even though the cap just lets out a little stream of this wondrous goo, it's very easy to get way too much in one part of your hair. And then it's hard to get it all out, since it's so sticky. But, be careful, start out with small amounts, and you'll be fine.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Smells delicious<br />+Keeps your hair nourished and healthy<br />+Prevents itchiness<br /><br />Cons:<br />-A little sticky

review/text: This "Scalp & Hair Oil" was a huge disappointment for my daughter and son, both having long dry hair that would normally benefit from a "nourishing" product. Sadly, the large amount of mineral oil in it just lays in the hair and makes it look flat and unwashed. There may be benefits from using the other oils, like the shea and argan, but they are out weighed by the negatives of the mineral oil.<br /><br />The only good side that we found was using it on "split ends" as it does seem helpful in reducing the fuzzy appearance, but it needs to be applied carefully and the excess removed quickly.<br /><br />We will not be using this in the future.<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Pretty much a waste of time.
review/text: I wanted to try this product on my son's hair.  He is 5, biracial, and has very dry hair.  I thought something titled "scalp and hair oil" would be perfect.  When I received the product, I went to check the directions only to find there were none.  Not good.  So, I squirted about a dime sized amount into my hand and worked in into his hair.  If was very difficult to work through his hair.  It seemed like some places were a slimy mess and others were completely dry.  Luckily, his hair is REALLY dry and soaked all the oil up after awhile, but it certainly didn't go in non-greasy as it was advertised.  My hands were as greasy as if I had poured vegetable oil on them.  I'm sure people with very dry hair would benefit from this product after long term use, but it is such a mess when you apply it that it really isn't worth it.  I will say, it made my son's hair very shiny!  If you used a very small amount and just lightly ran it through your hair, it would give you shiny, healthy looking hair!

review/summary: An ok product, better for thick dry hair
review/text: I tried this out because I was hoping to find a more affordable competitor to Moroccan Oil, which I love but it costs a LOT of money.  Moroccan Oil uses a mixture of oils with the most prominent being Argon oil. The CLEAR product contains multiple oils like almond oil and shea butter.  I used three to four drops of this product to towel-dried hair, smoothed it through my hair, and then proceeded to dry as normal. My hair is medium to thick with some damage and dryness in the hair that surrounds my face.  While Moroccan Oil seems to be absorbed into the hair and leaves my hair feeling soft, pliable, and more moisturized, this felt heavy on my hair and definitely weighted down.  This product would probably be too heavy for anyone with medium to fine hair.  It would work better for thick coarse hair.  The price is definitely good and this does seem to protect and nourish well.  If you have thick and coarse hair and you don't want to spend a lot of money, this would be worth trying.

On my scalp, the oil looked sticky and greasy.  I specifically used a tiny amount because I was afraid of that but it still looked bad.  On the ends the product was fine.  I felt like it worked ok with my straightener.  I'd still use my beloved argan oil over this.  But this is an acceptable option.

I have severe respiratory issues and I was affected almost immediately causing me to put the package and it's contents in the garage.  It was not an unpleasant fragrance, but not one I can be around, let alone try to use, and for that I am sorry as I wanted to try the product at least once and leave a review of how it was on my very dry scalp.<br /><br />I did open the bottle and saw there was no protective seal.  That should be addressed by the company in future packaging both for leakage issues and for consumer protection.<br /><br />There is no useage information on the bottle except for 1. CLEANSE  2.SMOOTH  3.SOOTHE  4.SEAL  (written exactly like that) on the outside of the peel-up label and on the back it says MASSAGE INTO SCALP AND HAIR.  I think the company can do a little better than that with instructions, especially for a new product on the market.<br /><br />There is an 800 number on the bottle I called twice to talk to customer service to tell them of the packaging as well as my allergic response, but both times I got an MCI operator instead of a Unilever representative. That was rather disconcerting.<br /><br />My personal experience with this product, even without being able to try it, was not a positive one, from the over-powering fragrance to the lack of instructions for use to a non-working phone number.

After using it several times, I felt that my hair was softer and lost that "crispy" feel. I used it on wet hair immediately after shampooing, and again at night after brushing it out. The results are quite good.<br /><br />However, I will say that I sould never use this too close to my scalp, because I feel that it would give my hair a greasy look even on fresh hair.<br /><br />This product is certainly worth trying, because it is very concentrated and lasts a long, long time.

review/summary: Soothing, light fragrance, helps at scalp line but wish they used different carrier oil
review/text: QUICK FYI - This Product Line doesn't say outright that it is for "ETHNIC" Hair but it really is.  if you don't have coarse hair or kinky/frizzy hair, this product may confuse you.  it is meant to heal the scalp after your hair has been worn in Rows, Briads or other protective hairstyles.  You follow?  Some folks with baby fine Northern European Hair had trouble with this just gloppin' it on like it was  Loreal Hot oil Treatment.  It's not!  They could have been more clear but I believe they were trying to be inclsuive to people like me who are neither Black nor 'White" but descend from folks with naturally coarse & wavy/frizzy hair.  That said.....I had to look up the ingredients since my sample didn't come in a box or a with packaging that listed the ingredients; it merely stated that it had some proprietory blend of oils called "Nutrium 10 with Shea Butter".  Now, that's OK but I wasn't pleased to see that the carrier oil which is the oil used to hold all the other oils in blend was Mineral Oil, a petroleum product.  The usual carrier oil for nourishing products for skin and hair is Sweet Almond Oil.  I'm guessing they chose Mineral oil because it's a lighter oil with no scent and some of the other oils in the product might not blend well in Almond oil.  ALso there's the question of the item being liquified and clear at room temp.  Shea Butter is cloudy until it is warmed up to body temp.  So, perhaps they had there reasons.  I'm not a Skin doctor or skin oil forumulator but I do try to avoid Mineral oil when I can. That's the only reason I'm taking off one star.  With that out of the way let me say this, look above at the list of ingredients which are listed in order by weight.  There are some very nourishing and natural oils to be found.  This isn't a perfect product but it's better than many that we are already using.<br /><br />As for the action of the product - it DOES WORK! but here's the deal: Obviously this is intended for very dry hair, coarse hair or naturally curly hair that tends to lock up and need to be put in proterctive styles.  I have very thick, dry hair that has a strong but large S-shaped Wave to it.  I can use some regular products, but I tend to stick to products designed for African-American hair even though my ethnicity is  different than that. If you have normal striaght and fine hair, this oil is not a "hot oil treatment" you use once a week.  rather, it's a scalp healing oil and an intense moisturizing option for hair whose own oils tend to get leached out by cotton pillow cases, dry atmosphere, extreme weather and so forth.  If that's YOU, than you might want to give this very light oil a spin.  BTW, I'm Daverat's WIFE, not Daverat. My hair is worn in it's natural state most of the time, long and wavy  in a protective Pony Tail or Bun but it takes an awful lot of work to keep my scalp & hair from drying out since we live in Los Angeles.  I sleep on a Satin Pillow Case or wear a Satin sleep cap to keep my hair from losing what little natural oil it has.  Many African American & pacific islander women do the same.<br /><br />As for the Clear Scalp Hair Oil istelf, it is very soothing when applied sparingly to irritated part lines or in-between braids or locs.  It also relieves tightness and dryness along the hairline all around your scalp or in areas where hair extensions, weaves, or tied on Buns have left your scalp tender and feeling "pulled upon."  Another area I have used it for soothing purposes is at the base of my hairline at the back of my neck where my own natural but protectively styled routine pony-tail pulls on the hairline.  Just a couple of well placed drops on your fingers and smoothed into those areas will get rid of  the ole "Pony-Tail Pull"  soreness/irritation and help stop breakage before it begins. In addition, I get breakouts of psoriasis sometimes on my scalp around my hairline from dry skin issues and this totally clears that up with added penetrating moisture.  It soothes that dry,  all-over "tight-hat" feeling you get when you've inadvertently washed too much of your own natural scalp oil out.  I find myself dotting this on problem areas before I go to bed and on my part lines, around my forehead and on the back of my head before I put on a satin sleep cap and I wake up feeling much better and having less trouble in those areas.  Women of Color or "ethnic" women (like me) with dry hair often use a satin sleep cap to prevent the loss of natural oils from the cotton pillowcases and the tangles/knots/breaks we can get from our protective braiding rubbing on the natural fiber pillow cases that pil over time.  if you don't use a satin sleep cap, use a satin pillow case and you'll find you get less breakage!<br /><br />FOR REGULAR USE - I like this as a light hairdressing but a very bit little goes a LONG WAY if you have straight hair that is well moisturized.  This is not a Silicone product like your usual <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P9DS4Q">John Frieda Frizz-Ease Extra Strength Serum, 1.69 Ounces</a>! I rub just a little in my palms, maybe 3 drops or so,  and pat down the fly-aways of breakage at my part and it helps them to lay flat.  This product also helps make a ponytail sleek if you lightly rub a couple of drops  through your hair before brushing it out and then styling it.  You can also finish the style with another apre drop or two on the ends of the pony tail.  It seals split ends well.  A final pat of what's left on your palms over your part-line and you're good to go!  This Hair Oil is a great over all treatment when used moderately.  The one advisory I have is this - My hair is naturally light reddish blonde & I find the oil gives it a slightly more golden tone when smoothed on as a hair dressing.  That's not bad, mind you!  I like it!  It's just if you have bleached hair, you might want to go easy with the oil at first.  if you have dark brown to black hair, you likely won't see much of a color change, just a nice sheen and gleam.<br /><br />The fragrance  of this product smells light & refreshing to me.  The  oil is thin but effective.  A small amount goes a long way, so don't over apply it!  As the oil warms in your hand, it spreads very easily so begin by underestimating what you need until you get a feel for the product.  If you have dry spots or or patches with dry, silvery scales from psoriasis that your prescription products haven't cleared up, this can help moisturize those areas until the medication relieves the outbreak.  it actually helps those scales fall off naturally.  With continued use, I have found that it works as a wonderful compliment to the 3 RX products I use from time to time and I use less of them now that I've been buying more of the Clean Scalp products.  That's a real bonues I hadn't expected.  I did eventually buy 2 of the other products just because this one worked so well.<br /><br /> I love this stuff and will buy it.  (have bought more!)  I just wish they had found a forumula that used all natural oils.  I know that Mineral oil is technically a "natural" product but it's not something many doctors recommend any more.  Almond Oil would have been a better choice.  Even so, I am pleased with the product because it delivers on its promises.<br /><br />Review updated July 9, 2012

review/summary: Nice For Summer
review/text: This is a nice hair treatment to use during the summer months when hair is subjected to the hot sun and swimming pools and things that tend to dry out hair. I use it on the ends and it does give my hair a little extra moisturizing and the smell is like summertime as well.<br /><br />I think the oil would be a little too heavy during the winter, but I really like it for the hot summer months and it gives my hair a little extra nourishment, especially on my dry ends. I also use a straightener and it helps with the dryness associated with that as well. A little bit goes a long way though, just a few drops is enough. If you use too much, it makes your hair a little heavy and greasy. I like it for just a little extra conditioning once in a while. It smells good too.

review/summary: Like the smell but it left my hair greasy..had to re-wash :(
review/text: This is not a product I can use.  It left my hair greasy and when I applied it to wet hair, my hair straightener "sizzled" and "popped".  I could not get my hair to dry with blow dryer. So next I tried applying it to dry hair, it was not as bad. I will try the full week, but I am not sure when I should apply it and be able to go out in public.<br /><br />Also, there are no instructions on the bottle as to whether you apply the product to dry or wet hair, etc.  For a first time user I found this difficult, and had to research how to use it.<br /><br />I do like the smell, somewhat like coco butter.
