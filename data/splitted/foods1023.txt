review/summary: Great olives
review/text: These olives are very good and sit in my pantry as a back-up to the kalamata olives I keep in the refrigerator. I used to not be an olive fan, but I love them now in salads and on pizzas. It's nice not having to worry about running out.

Some brands tend to be a little mushy but this one is always crisp and fresh. By buying by the case lot I do not have to worry about running out since I am 10 miles from the nearest grocery store.

review/summary: New version? Not better!
review/text: I bought this item before, when the lids were still green and the mango sauce tasted like mashed up mangoes. When I received this delivery (the pouches have orange lids now) I was very disappointed: the sauce tastes like it has been watered down and citric acid has been added. ... a cheaper version of the old product, I wonder? (I still had a few of the 'older' version (with green lids) and sampled the two versions of mango sauce side by side).

review/summary: Tasty Mango Fruit Squeeze
review/text: We buy these for our kids who are a little bit older but need something to snack on in between school and long swim practices.  The kids love them and they are healthy.  I won't confess to eating the kids snack, but if I were to have eaten them, I would say they taste like the real thing.  Very few ingredients which is a good thing.  We love to stick them in the freezer and by the time the kids drink it is still cold but not frozen.<br /><br />As the pouches are not very large, possibly because they were intended for small children, Our kids go through them pretty quickly so the price adds up.  Plus, nothing beats eating fresh fruit.  Since both Mom and Dad work, this is a pretty healthy alternative to fresh fruit.

review/summary: Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold
review/text: An avid coffee fan, I find Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold to be the single best dark roast coffee I have ever tasted.  Having traveled extensively, I've tried many dark brews from around the world and they  often left quite a bitter after-taste. This particular coffee is so delicious, I no longer purchase coffee from any of the "chain coffee cafes".<br /><br />Treat yourself well.

review/summary: My favorite K-Cup
review/text: If it weren't for this K-Cup variety, I would be unhappy I bought my Keurig.  However now that I have found this Green Mountain Sumatra k-cup I am thrilled with my Keurig purchase.  Green Mountain Sumatra is the only K-cup that provided the flavor, strength, and boldness of the Starbucks Sumatra I used to use in my regular coffeemaker (which as someone else mentioned in some other review is now a large paperweight).  One important note:  after some experimentation, what worked for me is to brew 2 Green Mountain Sumatra k-cups on the small setting into my large mug.  So take that into account when thinking about the cost of using this k-cup and your Keurig.

review/text: I have to admit that I haven't tried every different coffee available for K-Cup machines, but I generally find coffee made with it a little on the weak side - lacking a depth of flavor. This is by far my favorite K-Cup coffee. It has a definite depth and richness of flavor, while not being acidic. It's a very tasty cup.

review/summary: The best of the almond flours
review/text: I have tried several brands of almond flour in the last year, and they are languishing in my freezer. The others are more coarse and good for a non-flour, or non-gluten pie crust, (as in a pie crust that would call for crushed nuts anyway) or something not needing a refined, soft texture, like a granola bar perhaps. But if you want success in your baking, especially for cakes, pancakes, muffins, biscuits,(oh so good and tender!), then this is the almond flour to use.<br /><br />The texture is very fine, so it incorporates well in beaten batters. As it is not as heavy, whatever you are baking will rise higher, be lighter, and have a soft, nice texture, than when using more coarse almond flour. I have used it alone for low carb, or non-wheat baking, and have mixed it with non-gluten, and non-wheat, (but with gluten) flours, with complete success.  Some flours are so strong in taste, they overpower anything else one puts in the batter. The soft flavor allows your other flavors, like sweetener, flavoring, extracts, nuts, or fruits, to be more flavorful, and balanced in the baked goods.<br /><br />what I received was slightly sweet, almost no nutty flavor, without any trace of oxidation or spoiling. I keep a recipe or two worth in my refrigerator, and the bulk of it in my freezer. Depending on what I am making , I may let it come to room temperature, or just use it cold. Your recipe will guide you.<br />To use, just stir gently, measure lightly, and continue with your recipe.<br /><br />The flour costs a bit more, but can be purchased in bulk quantities. See the box for information if you cannot get the size you want on Amazon.<br /><br />I think you will be happy using this flour. This flour is a great answer to low carb, non-wheat, or non-gluten baking!<br />And no, I do not work for the company or Amazon, but am happy to have found such an excellent product for my low carb, non-wheat baking!

review/summary: "Feels" like wheat flour
review/text: This may very well be my Holy Grail wheat flour-replacement product. I've been eating quite a bit of almond meal during the past year and it was (and is) fine for many applications, but that grittiness is in there. This flour, on the other hand, feels so very similar to standard flour, doesn't have a strong almond taste (I kind of miss that, but I won't take off a star because it's good that a taste doesn't overwhelm other ingredients in your recipes), and comes up light and fluffy with a little baking powder.<br /><br />Exceptional. I'm being as conservative as I can be with this flour as it is expensive, but I don't think I could go back to other non-wheat flours or almond meal for, say, pancakes or cookies.

review/summary: Finely ground, no skin, perfect for pastry
review/text: I've just received my order and set about making a batch of french meringue macarons (not macaroons...those are a coconut cookie, macarons are different beasts.) Anyone who has ever attempted macarons knows that they are a fiddly, persnickety pastry on the best of days.  However, this almond flour performed significantly better than the other brands I've tried, and is considerably easier than trying to grind your own.  The macarons didn't come out perfect, but that was my fault for overworking the batter, because I'm more accustomed to a coarser grind.  I subsequently used some to make mexican wedding cookies, which turned out perfectly. Tomorrow I'm using it to make marzipan for petit fours, and I'm sure it will perform brilliantly.<br /><br />This flour blends well, sifts beautifully, hydrates easily, and delivers a lovely natural almond palate free of aftertaste or grit. I will confidently use this product above other brands for pastry from this point forward.

review/summary: Great for SCD diet
review/text: My daughter follows the SCD diet for Crohn's disease.  Introducing baked goods and "breading" makes the diet much more manageable.  I have used it for SCD legal recipes including cookies, bread, almond milk, and breaded chicken.  All turned out very tasty and baked up very well.  It is a very fine powder and works like flour.  This site is the best price I have found.  As a note, I store mine in freezer or refrigerator to preserve freshness for a multi-week period.<br />Word to Amazon:  I agree with another user.  Selling this in 4 or 5 pound quantities would make it a better option for people who rely on this product for good health.  Purchasing 2 pound quantities just does not cut it.

review/text: I love this almond flour. It's not grainy at all when used in baking, it's very fine. Gives baked goods a moist, fluffy consistency when used correctly. It does not have to be used in combination with any other flours but blends well when it is. It's a bit on the expensive side but worth it because when I've tried to make my own almond flour, I can't get the grinder to get the almonds this fine. It has a neutral flavor and is also very versatile. I'm following a low carb woe and I've used this flour to make mashed fauxtatoes by adding sour cream, garlic, salt and cream cheese in a saucepan with water. Incredible!!! I'll be buying this again and again. Amazon has the best price so far for this product as well. In fact, besides the JK website, no one else has it that I'm aware of.

review/summary: Awesome flour!
review/text: I am gluten intolerant and must therefore find alternative flours other than wheat.  I have tried so many flours and flour combinations, but almond flour takes the cake! (Pun intended!)  The JK Gourmet almond flour is ground very fine and does not have a gritty feel in my baked goods.  The foods I bake (e.g. a carrot cake to die for) with JK Gourmet almond flour do not even taste like they are gluten free!  btw, the carrot cake recipe is in The Almond Flour Cookbook which I also bought at Amazon.

review/text: This is really nice almond flour, very fine like it says and doesn't have those dark pieces from the skins like some flours do. I use it to bake macarons and this was great for it both in texture and color. Its a two pack, but I'm sure I'll be buying some more of it soon.

review/summary: Best Almond Flour Available
review/text: I have tried a few other brands of almond flour and almond meal that I purchased at local markets, but they all had a tendency to clump and the texture was coarse.  JK Gourmet Almond Flour is a little more expensive but it is well worth the price.  It has a wonderful flavor that works as a  perfect replacement for white flour for those who are on low carb diets.<br /><br />I've used it in cakes, in a batter for fried fish, to make bread and to create low carb pancakes.  Although you might have to make adjustments to recipes that call for traditional white flour there are plenty of great recipes online that utilize almond flour.

review/summary: Can't type title..eating divine banana almond flour muffins!
review/text: I just got this flour yesterday and I have baked three dozen banana, blueberry and apple muffins. Had flapjacks this morning. Will use it to make chicken fingers this evening.<br /><br />This flour is amazing! No grainy, sandy taste in baked goods. Mixes well, little clumping. The almond taste is not overpowering and actually barely noticeable in my muffins. I am making a second purchase right now. Too bad no subscription delivery option. It's not the cheapest option on Amazon but totally worth it!<br /><br />Also, I got the almond flour cookbook that's suggested. Terrific recipes and a treat for those who enjoy an occasional (LowS/GF) "sugar" coma :)

review/text: Okay, the flour is expensive, but well worth it!  This flour, unlike others, is very finely ground.  I made cookies from this flour for a friend who is diabetic.  I also used this for a relative with celiac's that needs gluten-free treats.  Both were very satisfied with the cookies.  I have not tried other recipes yet, but am eager to.  I would recommend adding a teaspoon or two of xanthan gum to any baking recipes - it worked much better.

review/text: My wife and I bake a lot and are foodies.  One of the more difficult items to bake healthy are cookies.  We used this Almond flour along with  the almond cook book we purchased with it to make very nice  Chocolate chip cookies.  So far we have used this with two recipes from the almond flour cookbook.  We purchased both from amazon.  The chocolate chip chip recipe with this product is outstanding.  We made three or four batches and I now can make  chocolate chip cookies that are outstanding and much more healthy then any you can buy in a store. I say buy this and the recipe book and have some fun.  As my wife and I  cook some more recipes I will add to this review.

review/summary: Difficult to work with
review/text: There is nothing wrong with the way this product tastes, but it is difficult to cook with. I searched recipes on the internet and realized that in order to get recipes specific to this product, you have to buy the book. I tried other recipes that called for almond flour, but nothing turned out right in terms of consistency, although usually the taste was okay. Such failed experiments included cookies, pancakes, and biscuits. They just do not hold together no matter the variety of ways I tried to prepare them based on other cooks recommendations. I even tried a free biscuit recipe from the book's authors (specific to this product) and they also fell apart. Perhaps there are other uses for this flour than baking, but I haven't figured out what to do with what is left. If you are a skilled cook you probably will be fine using this almond flour, but if you are a novice or just adequate in the kitchen, as I am, I would not recommend this product.

review/text: What a gorgeous and delicious sauce that also doesn't have too many calories for its type (180 for the whole container).  Bought it on a whim yesterday to go with pan sauteed chicken breasts.  Wow was it delicious!!<br /><br />I pan seared the chicken in a little olive oil, deglazed with dry white wine,then added the Veloute sauce and simmered.  I really couldn't believe how delicious it made my simple dish.  Just bought a six pack of this stuff and will use in a pinch for company and when I just want to eat delicious chicken with my family.  My husband couldn't believe how good it was.  Adding mushrooms would send this over the top.  It took me 15 minutes to do!

review/text: This is an amazing little product.  It's great alone on meats and veggies, or with added tarragon or other herbs.<br />It is especially lovely to have on hand as a staple when one has no time to make a veloute from scratch...like after working all day.  Equally terrific is the red wine sauce.<br />I truly consider these sauces as my favorite culinary "find" of the year.<br />Please don't stop making them!  It would be a bit easier, if I could find them at Kroger, though the six-pack was very cost effective...usually the shipping costs make them a tad expensive.  still, worth it.

I mean, not even a tiny bit.<br />It took me three times the amount in my GO TO frosting recipe to get much of a flavor at all.<br />The smell of the extract itself isn't really a pleasant smell. It smells like chemicals.<br />I guess what I am saying is I'm not impressed and I wouldn't buy again.

review/summary: Not great, but better than some of the alternatives.
review/text: These aren't the worst things you could put in your mouth, I'm sure, but after being used to Monster M-80, Monster MIXXD, or Rockstar Juiced, they just don't taste like anything special. I think part of the problem is there are just too many juices vying for your taste buds' attention; apple, orange, pear, peach, tangerine, pineapple, and white grape, to be exact. Dropping the orange would be a huge step in the right direction, in my opinion, and maybe even the tangerine and pear.<br /><br />As for the energy "kick," they seem to work fine - about as well as anything else I've consumed. Honestly, it may be more of a placebo effect for me, anyway (caffeine has never kept me from sleeping at night or given me any sort of drastic boost in energy - for all I know, it could just be sipping a cold and fizzy drink that gives me what tiny boost I do notice), so it's hard to tell. But if you're looking for great taste in a natural energy drink, I would recommend trying Guru (probably the best-tasting one I've found), or even the normal Blue Sky Blue Energy drink - neither taste quite as good as the Monsters I mentioned above, but for me, given their more natural ingredients, they taste good enough to justify the switch.

I emailed the company and asked for a refund. A couple weeks later I received a $1 off coupon in the mail. I sent a second email again requesting a refund, and never received a reply. This product is very expensive compared to other pasta sauces and as a result I expected the manufacturer to have a high level of quality control and customer service. It appears they have neither. Moldy/rotten product plus very bad customer service to not send a refund. I will never purchase this product again.

review/text: This cat food has almost completely eliminated the daily throwing up that my cat was doing.  Why spend so much for pet food, you may ask? This is a healthier alternative for carnivores. Most cat foods are filled with grains, which are not very digestible for felines.  Cats are carnivores! they do not naturally eat grains such as rice, wheat, and the other fillers, found even in the expensive brands of dry pet foods. I like that this food is dry, does not smell fishy like wet foods do, and I can "free feed" my cat as we always have.

review/summary: Good product, cats like the duck flavor better
review/text: I have three very active ferals that I tamed as kittens.  They are indoor/outdoor cats and very active.  One of them was throwing up his food a lot and the vet suggested it might be the grain products in the food I was feeding them.  I switched to Wilderness "Duck" flavor and they loved it - and no more sick kitty!  Then I tried this salmon flavor since my cats prefer the salmon treats mostly.  One thing I noticed about the Blue Buffalo "Wilderness" salmon flavor is that it did not have the same pungent smell as the duck flavor "Wilderness" food. So I liked that!  However, the kitties did not attack the salmon variety with the same gusto that they dug into the duck flavor "Wilderness" dry food.  All in all, this is a good dry food that is great if your kitty has a sensitive stomach.  As for my three, they prefer the duck flavor.

review/summary: This food is AMAZING
review/text: I have two cats. One seems to do fine on just about any food, but the other one is, well, fat and crazy for lack of a better term.<br /><br />I noticed that higher quality foods seemed to make his coat and his moods a bit softer. After doing some research and reading every bag of food at the pet store, I decided to give this a try - and I got the salmon specifically because it has more omega 3's in addition to good stuff the other flavors have.<br /><br />ITS BEEN A MIRACLE! My crazy cat is so sweet now. He plays a lot with his brother instead of lying around all day and he snuggles the whole family all of the time. He's a changed cat... the kitten I fell in love with. Also, his coat is much fuller and softer and he has lost weight and gained muscle. He is healthy and happy now. :)<br /><br />BTW, when money was tight, I tried going back to a cheaper food and his old problems came back. He gained a weight, his fur got coarse, and he would full-on attack me about once a week. After changing back to this food AGAIN - he is back to his sweet healthy self.

review/summary: Just Started but My Cats Loved It!
review/text: I have two older cats (10+ years) and one had been throwing up every day which was very worrisome.  I was really afraid one of them was dying, but many comments said the vet had no idea what it was.  While trying to figure out what the problem was I stumbled upon all of the info on how bad most of the big brand dry cats food are and all of the nasty stuff that's in them - including euthanized animals (ew!).  Apparently, the best thing for cats is real meat but I have my cats on a timed feeder which is awesome and they don't hunt me down for every meal.  So, I compromised and switched to one feeding of wet (Friskies) and went looking for a good dry because I just can't commit to being stalked all the time when they want to be fed.  Chicken Soup was pretty highly rated and not as expensive as the very top brands - although I think it's still pretty expensive at $28+ a bag (and it started out as a prime item - that helped).  Anyway, the food is pretty big and "X" shaped which did concern me because my cats were used to much smaller bits.  They did transition to it well and the throwing up stopped immediately - and they rarely throw up at all now.  I would say after a few months they started to lose interest and were leaving a lot in the feeder every day.  I would usually cover the wet with it at dinner and then they would finish it.  Not sure if they are just getting old and it was too tough on their teeth or not, but I switched to the Wilderness Salmon and they gobbled that right down.  It's much smaller little bits so hopefully that's going to help.  It's only been a day so I'll update after a few weeks.

review/summary: 7 cats are rating 7 paws up
review/text: I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in p�t&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.

review/text: Our cat is an indoor/outdoor roamer and even though he eats all the time and has a clean bill of health he has always been very lean. We decided to try this dry food to make sure he was getting the nutrition he needed. He has been much more playful and silly and his coat just gleams. He is still a lean cat but we feel better that he is on a more nutritious food. The only con is the price so we mix it 50/50 with his old food.

The coffee was very good, as is usually the case when I get 100% Colombian coffee. Packaging the coffee in the 9-oz package was also a benefit. It's the right size for maybe two pots of coffee or more, which is what we drink daily in our house.

review/text: I have crohn's disease and put myself into remission the natural way (without medications). I am on a very strict diet (all-natural, organic, gluten-free, vegan, macrobiotic) so these bars were a perfect fit! These are the ONLY bars I like. Luna bars had a lot of excess ingredients and were high in sugar as are most bars. Kashi was okay but not organic and was high in sugar and processed. NOTHING beats the tastes of these bars! I don't agree with the person who gave it one star. The only person who wouldn't like these bars are those who are use to high sugar-processed food diets or aren't use to the taste of macrobiotic foods. I love that these are made with brown rice syrup because it digests slower and gives you long-lasting energy. And 16 grams of protein...WOW!<br /><br />I LOVE MACRO BARS!

review/text: My #1 favorite bar is the Macrobar peanut butter chocolate bar! I have to be gluten free due to my Hashimoto's and I also do not want to eat anything that contains soy protein, which is non-fermented and should not be allowed in any health food product. These bars contain neither, although the chocolate chips do contain soy lecithin. Every ingredient is organic. Even though they get their sweetness from organic brown rice syrup I must admit the amount is not low, at 19 grams. If they would lower the sugar content slightly, use organic agave syrup instead of rice syrup and use sunflower lecithin instead of soy I would consider them perfect, because they do taste great.

review/summary: These taste horrible and have a heavy sticky texture to them.
review/text: I bought these bars because I was looking for a good high protein bar without all the extra junk in it.  Right now I eat Luna Bars for breakfast as wanted something lower in sugar and higher in protein.  These looked like a great buy and, from the glowing reviews, I thought buying a case of them was pretty low risk.<br /><br />Boy was I mistaken.  These bars taste awful.  I eat a lot of natural and organic foods and I have never eaten anything so horrible tasting as these bars.  They have an aftertaste reminiscent of coffee grinds; and have a very heavy sticky texture to them.  They are dry and hard to chew and swallow without getting stuck in your throat.<br /><br />I tried them multiple times hoping that I would like them with time; but I still can't stomach them.  They actually make me feel kind of ill when I eat them.  My husband tried them and so did my son; neither of them could eat more than a bite.  Both of them ended up spitting it out into the trash.<br /><br />I would strongly caution getting a case of these before you try them first.  Given the other glowing reviews of this product, maybe I got a bad batch or something.  But, here I am a tofu and sushi lover, thinking that these vegetarian protein bars are the worst thing ever.<br /><br />My son uses the remaining bars as part of his play food for his kitchen.  The bars are very durable and have withstood many hours of playing; so I guess maybe they have that going for them.

The only problem is that often the pods are too full and my Phillips coffee maker can't handle it and spits water all over the counter.  I then have to shut it off and push the pod down (now it's wet) and turn the coffee maker back on.

review/summary: A more flavorful brew using distilled water with Senseo pod holders
review/text: To get the best flavor from this pod in a Senseo coffee maker: use the double pod holder, then stuff in one of these Melitta pods, and pour a teaspoon of distilled water (we keep a jug of it handy to fill the senseo water resevoir) into the holder on top of the pod. Let it soak in for a few seconds and pour off any excess. The pod will now be wetted and stuck inside the pod holder. Then place into the Senseo and use the double cup setting with a larger cup for a perfect brew. Prewetting the pod in the holder with the distilled water allows the initial steam brew to generate a better and more consistent cup of coffee. For the coffee aficionados out there it is the equivalent to wetting the coffee filter and grounds in a regular coffee pot prior to brewing a full pot of coffee.
