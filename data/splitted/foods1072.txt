review/text: I picked these up at the Seattle Uwajimaya. The chocolate is good, and it tastes a lot like pocky, but there is more chocolate with each piece.<br /><br />The box is crammed full of pieces in a little foil-plastic pack, and the box itself can be sealed close with a clasp to keep them from falling out.<br /><br />Great snack, for when you need that chocolate fix.

review/text: I haven't eaten such delicious chocolate ever since I was a little kid. Though it was the first time I've tried them it brought me memories I didn't even know I had from such young times<br /><br />I seriously recommend these to everyone. They're made of "real" chocolate (a strong milk chocolate taste instead of that soapy stuff some companies dare to call chocolate), but the taste is nicely counterbalanced with the blander and crunchy taste of the cookie<br />Also they may be small but each box comes with a good amount of them, so it's well worth the price

The cookie stalks are absolutely adorable. Oh, and keep the case; it comes in handy later. Trust me. With its little clasp and imaginative packaging, you wouldn't want to discard it anyway.<br /><br />THE MUSHROOMS COMPEL YOU

review/summary: Fun product that also tastes good
review/text: The first comment I hear when I give someone a box of these cookies is "They're really cute!" Then they try one and say "They're really good!". This was also what I said when my girlfriend first surprised me with a box from a local asian market. Since then, I have shared several boxes with friends, family and coworkers. It's as if no one expects that a cute little novelty cookie could also taste good. There is a reasonable amount of cookies in each box ,so you won't mind sharing a few (33 pcs I just counted, 3.13oz box, approx.3serv.). Ordering from this vendor costs me a little more than purchasing from the local market and shipping adds to that, but one pays for convenience. I have used them in several different gift ideas. One might decorate a cake or garnish a dessert with a few. A fun unique treat.

review/text: I go to a US University, and to find out that one of the on-campus stores sold this kind of thing surprised me. I didn't even know what they were when I bought them; the fact that the back said "chocolate" and they were from Japan sold them to me. But when I got back to the dorm room and started eating them, I just couldn't put them down! The chocolate is unlike any chocolate I've had before, and the cracker part is delicious!<br /><br />I had to force myself to stop eating them, they're that good! Now I just hope I can find them at a local store back home, to continue my addiction in peace...

review/summary: Great product, Slightly Melted
review/text: It came within three days, much sooner than I would have expected.<br /><br />The packaging was great, and it came in a box not much bigger than its own, so they're not being wasteful.<br /><br />The chocolate itself was slightly melted, but that may have been due to the heatwave going on recently and the fact that we didn't get to the mailbox until later that night. If your candy/chocolate ever comes melted, make sure to take temperature and time of delivery into account! Better yet, try to pick up your  mail when it is delivered and try not to order chocolate during a heatwave.<br /><br />It was great and tasted fine anyway.<br /><br />Would probably buy from them again.

review/summary: Eh.. Well, it's okay, but why buy it?
review/text: I just don't see the reason why you should buy this when there's a box of Pocky, Stikko, and pretty much any other chocolate-related product sitting right next to it. You've got a couple bucks, why buy this when you could buy something much better with your money?<br />These have the same problem I had with pocky-- Sure, the chocolate part is good, but when you get to the bread(?) it's just bland as heck and out of place. I'd rather just buy a chocolate bar made by the same company, ya'know?<br />And don't misunderstand-- There is absolutely no bread inside the chocolate part of the candy, at least any that matters enough that you can taste it. Why can't they just be split apart and sold as two different candies? That'd how I felt when I ate it. (But then again, the bread(?) part of it isn't all that great in the first place, enough to be sold.)<br />They're cute. That's pretty much it. I just don't see why I'd ever eat these unless someone else bought them and offered them to me. They're not BAD-- But they're just stupid. Stupid in candy design. Unbalanced. It's like buying Lucky Charms and picking out the marshmellows, really. That's what it feels like. And again, I must ask, why do you buy Lucky Charms if you could easily just buy a cereal completely made out of marshmellows?<br />Also, for the cute mushroom aspect-- The mushroom tops are always tipped sideways. That's also a damper when the packaging clearly makes them all look like they're balanced.

If you are vegetarian, read on . . .<br /><br />This product kept coming up in my recommendations here on Amazon so, when I spied it at Global Food, I picked it up.  Being vegetarian, I'm used to checking the ingredients of any new product I try.  I was disappointed to find that these cute 'lil mushroom cookies contain fish oil, so I can't eat them.  Too bad, considering how much everyone seems to like them.  I think it's kind of a bummer that I keep seeing fish oil used in cookies when there are other options that would make a product edible to a greater portion of the population.  I found a similar Korean product from Isong called "Choco Biscuit" which is pretty good and made with vegetable oil (although, unfortunately, it is not available on Amazon).  Who knows if it actually tastes the same, though.  Sigh . . .

review/summary: Positively the VERY BEST!!
review/text: I recently wrote a review for Jolly Time Healthy Pop Popcorn, in which I extolled its healthfulness and taste.  I even gave it a perfect 5-star rating.  However, I decided to give the Jolly Time LIGHT Crispy & White a try, and I am so, so thankful that I did.  It is at least two or three times better (in taste) than the Healthy Pop, yet it has only slightly more calories, and relatively little fat.  The Healthy Pop actually tastes bland, compared to the LIGHT Crispy & White.  As a result, I think I should change my rating for the Healthy Pop to about 3 Stars.  I shall continue to order the LIGHT Crispy & White through Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" system.  This popcorn is as good as can be!  And, as always, Amazon rocks.

review/summary: Not bad.
review/text: As an experienced "chewer", I can say that this "loose leaf" is the real deal. I used to order loose leaf straight from Peru and I was kinda skeptical about this being from Amazon, but it seems to be pretty decent. I give it 4 stars because it seems maybe a wee bit less potent and less numbing, but I have to consider that I used to use the real llipta lime ash with the other leaves I got and only have baking soda right now for drawing out the alkaloids with these leaves. The leaves are a bit smaller than I'm used to, but it works for me. Would order again.

review/summary: Just pour it down the drain
review/text: This is my first review ever after being a customer of Amazon for almost a decade.  I do it to save others from this awful product.  I too was so excited to try this new k-cup. With<br />high hopes I placed it in my trusty Keurig and pressed the button.  This was without a doubt the most vile bitter tasting coffee I have ever had including the stuff they sell by the<br />gallons in gas stations.  At first I could not believe it and brewed another cup as well as a cup of two other brands of k-cups, Starbucks and Green Mountain comparable dark roasts.  I<br />tasted them all black and what a difference.  Even though these are cheaper save your money, do not buy this product.

review/summary: Brooklyn Beans meets with approval of Peet's coffee snob
review/text: I tried this coffee at work, despite my skepticism about K cups, and having come of age in Berkeley and learning at Peet's what a truly great cup of coffee is.  But I can honestly say, aside from a fresh brewed batch of Peet's from the French press, this is the BEST I've had.  It beats by far any other K cup I've tried.  Leave it to Brooklyn Beans, inspired by the new nexus of the foodie world, to perfect coffee in the convenience of a K cup!  Well done!

review/summary: 1st batch bad but customer service came through...
review/text: Our initial box of Brooklyn Bridge Blend K-cups had problems and we were certainly disappointed. As noted here by many reviewers, some of the K-cups seem to "explode" and dump coffee grounds into your cup of joe.  Not good! I contacted their customer service and they were very apologetic and admitted to a quality control problem with some of their early run k-cups.  They quickly sent out a replacement box - and in addition - a second box of Corner Donut Shop. We have had no problems at all with these and I am very pleased with the taste of the Donut Shop blend as it is more bold than the Brooklyn Bridge (which my wife prefers).  We will definitely be ordering more. They acknowledged  the problem and made it right immediately.  Too bad that seems to be the exception to the rule these days in customer service. All in all a great deal on this coffee through Amazon subscribe and save.

review/text: I was compelled to try the Brooklyn Bean Corner Donut Shop variety (having been born in Brooklyn, but live outside of Boston now) and I am glad I did.  I actually like to start my day off with their French Roast or one of their other dark roasts but the Corner Donut Shop is my "go to" variety throughout the day.<br /><br />Not only does the coffee taste great but it is a fun brand.  Someone has been super creative in the naming of the varieties.  "Anybody want a Brooklyn Bridge?" is my favorite line.  I keep most of the varieties in my office as they are a favorite of many.

review/summary: grind too fine?
review/text: This coffee is actually pretty tasty, and I would consider trying other blends from Brooklyn Bean Roastery. However, more often than not, I wind up with coffee grounds in my cup. Sometimes there are so many grounds I have to dump the whole cup. I don't have this problem with other types of K-cups I use, so I wonder if this grind is too fine to use in K-cups.Otherwise, this would be a nice cup of morning coffee.

review/text: I'm always looking for new K-cups, and I read all of the negative reviews for this brand.  What impressed me was that every one of those reviews was answered by a company representative and appropriate compensation was offered to each buyer.  So for that reason, I overlooked the negatives and decided to buy.<br /><br />The coffee arrived at my front door the next day.  So far, I have had  no issues with coffee grounds and breaking K-cups. I'm certainly not a coffee expert, but I can honestly say that I am enjoying the Breakfast Blend--and the price was great.<br /><br />Keep up the good work, and thanks for the great coffee.

review/summary: Nothing like Jet Fuel
review/text: I haven't experienced any of the pod issues, but I'm only three pods into the box. My review is on the flavor of this coffee. The description claim is that it is a "Flavor match to Coffee People Jet Fuel. Tasty, full-bodied, smoky blend." This stuff tastes nothing like Jet Fuel. Even though the "best by" date on the box is 02/13 this stuff tastes old and stale to me. Unfortunately I bought two boxes so I'll muddle through, but then I'll be going back to either Jet Fuel or Black Tiger. If you're a fan of either one of those, fuhgeddabout Fuhgeddaboutit and stick with your fav.

I am not an expert but like everyone else some coffees definitely taste better then others and you can have starbucks and probably dunkin donut as I truly enjoy this one and drink it other times during the day when I feel like a cup.<br />It is a nice blend and tastes delicious no bitter or after taste and I have tried your other blends but also enjoy the decaf when it is later at night.  Served it to friends who live and even used to live in Brooklyn and they agree it is a winner.<br />Keep making this delicious product at an affordable price and you will have a customer for life.

review/summary: WOW - Really good coffee!!
review/text: I have been using Keurig for a couple of years now, and have a tried what I thought was nearly every brand of caffeinated coffee.  After hearing about their facebook page, I tried their sample box.  I was truly amazed that a company that, quite honestly, I had never heard of before made such an amazing brew.  The Brooklyn Bridge blend was really smooth.  The French Roast was full flavored, but my favorite was Fuhgeddboutit.  I'm a fan of strong coffee.  If you need a coffee that will not only taste really really good but wake you up, grab a box of Fuhgeddboutit.  That will kick your @$$!!.  I am truly pleased that I found them, and will continue to drink their coffee regularly!

review/summary: Delicious coffee!
review/text: We are currently enjoying the fuhgeddaboutit dark roast & it's excellent! We're not quite coffee snobs, but we're WELL past Starbucks & corporate coffee. I'm always hesitant to try something other than our favorites from our local roaster here in Kansas City, but this dark blend is just excellent. It's smooth, not bitter, and doesn't require me to add a ton of half & half to get it to my liking. I'm really excited to have found another coffee to indulge in - and while it's not local to ME, per se, it's a small local business and I am ALWAYS happy to support small, family run companies. I'm really anxious to try to the Corner Donut Shop blend next. Yay for java!

review/text: My husband is from Brooklyn, and even though he doesn't live there any more, maintains a somewhat alarming amount of Brooklyn pride, so of course, I had to buy this for him.  We tried the Brooklyn Bridge Blend.<br /><br />Usually, I have to put a lot of sugar in my coffee because I think its too bitter, but this tasted mild, (not weak)  just... a pleasant coffee flavor without being too strong for me and I was able to cut out some sugar, which is always nice.<br /><br />I had one cup with a few grinds floating on top, but I've had that with almost every other brand I've had also, so I'm not concerned.<br /><br />I'd buy this even if it was the same price as other K-Cups, because my husband got such a kick out of the name and label, and of course, we both enjoyed the coffee, but the fact that its cheaper than other brands is great too.

I was looking for reasonable k-cups, but this is not an item I'd purchase again even at a lower price.<br /><br />I was IMPRESSED with Brooklyn Bean Roastery's response!  They sent an order of Cyclone at no cost...and it was a full order not a 6-10 kcup sample!  They followed up to see if I was happy with Cyclone.<br /><br />Cyclone was very good and I'll order more.  The cups have brewed perfectly each time.  I've seen some comments that weren't positive, but the company seems to be working hard and it's worth trying.

The aroma and taste were more reminiscent of vending machine coffee. If you are expecting something similar to Starbucks, Tullys or Green Mountain French Roast this coffee is not for you. Very weak and not full bodied like you would expect from a French Roast, even on the strongest setting on our Keurig machine.

review/summary: Good, but not Dark Magic
review/text: Cyclone is smooth, good tasting coffee, but not very robust. It was suggested to be a substitute for Dark Magic coffee - to my taste, this it is not.  To get the flavor I want, I use 6 ounces max water when making this.  The construction of the kcups does not seem to be up to par.  Coffee grinds are found in the box and sometimes in the bottom of your cup.  The brewing flow sometimes backs up.  Nevertheless, I rated it a 3 because I really like this coffee after dinner.<br /><br />UPDATE June 14<br /><br />Received replacement kcups from Brooklyn Bridge as promised.  They work fine, brewing well, no grounds in coffee.  Because of better brewing?, coffee seems to raste better in this batch.

review/summary: Marginal coffee and poor quality control
review/text: The quality control is poor, the pods arrive with coffee grounds stuck to the outside under the rim and the foil tops are stuck on unevenly and not straight. Clearly not made by the same people who make "real" K-Cups. Beyond that the coffee is marginal at best, it is not strong and has the grainy taste that I normally associate with cheap diner coffee, not a good coffee flavor at all.<br /><br />This goes down as a lesson learned and an example of getting what you pay for. Back to the Big Box store for the Barista Prima Columbia, now that's a decent cup of coffee, I just wish Amazon carried it at a decent price.<br /><br />****UPDATE****<br /><br />The good folks at Brooklyn Bean sent me a replacement box and I thought it was worth an updated review. Initially I had tried the "Fuhgeddaboudit" blend as was not impressed. On their recommendation I tried the Cyclone and it is much more to my taste, I would happily brew it instead of my normal Barista Prima Columbia blend. On the basis of the flavor I would give it 5 stars, but this morning I had a "filter blowout" and wound up with grounds all over the counter, so I knocked a couple of stars off. That's one failure out of about 15 brews, and may be an isolated incident. I'll keep brewing and may well order more and will update my review to reflect any future failures.

review/summary: Happy with purchase
review/text: I was not sure what to expect, given the mixed reviews. I decided to try the Brooklyn Bridge Blend because I do like Green Mountain Nantucket Blend. I am about half way through the box with no no brewing failures in my 2006 B50 Keurig brewer. It is not quite the same flavor as the Nantucket blend (in my opinion), but it is not bad at all. It is a bit stronger, and has a bit of an aftertaste that I associate with stronger roast (like French Roast). I will probably try their Colombian next - but would buy this one again at some point. Still searching for a good replacement for Columbian La Verde though...

review/text: These kcups are not sealed correctly and as a result the fail.  Top seal opens up and sometimes the filter inside shifts and grinds jam up the coffeemaker.  Many of the cups are stale as a result of the poor seal.  I purchased 4 different Brooklyn Bean Roastery flavors and they all had the same issue.<br />Company was contacted and quick to send replacement, unfortunately these also failed and many were stale. Hope they correct their product.

review/summary: Delicious Decaf
review/text: I love coffee.  I drink it all day long.  But sometimes I want decaf, especially in the evening or when I'm not feeling well.  I recently got a Keurig machine so I gave these a try.  The decaf is delicious.  It's smooth, goes well with flavored creamers or half and half, and is strong without the caffeine.  I'm really not sure what everyone is complaining about.  I love the price, and I'm going to order some of the other flavors.  This package was a gift from my boyfriend.  Guess he's a smart guy!

review/summary: Very poor taste for this dark roast
review/text: I've given the "Fuhgeddaboudit" roast a few days to see if I just needed to get used to the flavor, but it still tasted weak with a bit of an ashy aftertaste to me this morning.  I've tried selecting the smallest size on my Keurig, but it still has that weak gas station taste.. now with smaller volume so I can chug it faster.<br /><br />I've gone through 10 of my 36 cups without any of the quality control issues others have talked about.  I just really don't like this roast.  For reference, I tend to enjoy Jet Fuel and Dark Magic roasts... and was hoping for something similar here.  I would give it one star for taste, but added a star because of the creative dispenser structure of the box and the cheaper price.  In this case, I did get what I paid for I guess.

review/summary: Second Worst Coffee I Ever Tasted
review/text: First, the pros:  The label is very nice looking and the packaging is swell.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that is where the praise ends.  If you have ever tried to reuse a k-cup you'll understand what this coffee tastes like.  I did an experiment weighing five different brands of coffee and found all to be 1/2 oz. or more except Brooklyn and it weighed one tenth of an ounce.  That's 1/5 the weight of Dunkin' Donuts, Newman's Own, Millstone and 1/6 the weight of Starbucks.  This is the second time I've ordered coffee from Amazon and found it to be lacking.  Since they won't take returns, (even from prime members) I don't think I'll order any more coffee from Amazon in the future.  The reason I titled this review the second worst coffee was because I got tricked into buying a coffee that was really just instant coffee in a k-cup cartridge.  On second thought that actually was better than this.

review/summary: Great coffee: poor packaging
review/text: I picked up a Kuerig a couple of months ago and began a quest to find a reasonably-priced supply of k-cups to use in the machine. I stumbled upon the Corner Donut Shop item and pre-ordered it before it was ready to ship. It arrived a couple of weeks ago and I have gone through almost my first whole box of 36. Out of those 36, 22 of the cups did not brew correctly and left me with a disappointing cup (or partial cup) of coffee. Most of the failures left grounds floating in the cup which was not good, but some of the cups left grounds all over the inside of the machine and required me to clean up.<br />BUT, of those cups that brewed correctly, WOW! The coffee is great. It has a great flavor that is reminiscent of a donut chain that has great coffee and does not have a bitter after taste like some of the k-cups I have tried.<br />I give the rating a 3 which is the mean of a 5 for taste and a 1 for packaging.<br />I'll wait a few months and see if this product is still being offered and try it again. Who knows, maybe they'll fix the packaging by then?!

review/summary: Nobody in Brooklyn says "Fugeddaboudit" --
review/text: Only the guys in the Soprano crew said it...and we all know where they were from.  Yes, people from Brooklyn are colorful; however we do not necessarily scratch when it itches, we stand upright and don't need to use our knuckles when walking. We are not neanderthals. If you want some of those, go across the river to you-know-where.  Despite the silly name, I tried this coffee and it's excellent.  Really rich, lots of flavor, not bitter, and the fragrance makes you want to rub your cheek against your mug and whisper sweet nothings.<br /><br />The blend makes a great morning coffee, it smells and tastes just the way coffee is supposed to in the morning and makes you wish you were seated at a big farm table with platters of ham and eggs and country biscuits. You can drink it during the day because it's not acidic and you don't get a sour stomach or that overcoffeed taste in the back of your throat.  And it's rich enough to make it the perfect after dinner coffee too. (Add a little bit of condensed milk and it's dessert.)<br /><br />Keurig is not the best coffee maker in the world, but this particular blend works very well in the machine and is now my go-to K-Cup. Keurig's main benefit is that it's fast so there's no standing on one foot and tapping your head against the counter while waiting for the coffee to brew. With Fuhgeddaboudit, there's no sacrifice of flavor for that instant gratification.<br /><br />Some reviewers have had problems with the k-cup itself, but I haven't.  I'm on my third box and not one leaking or grounds-spewing incident has occured.

Many of us who really prefer a good cuppa in the morning (or noon, or night) often buy our own supply now. I really love having a lower cost alternative that gives me the great taste I want. The ones I've tried so far have been delicious and they work perfectly. I've seen a few reviews about faulty cups, but I haven't seen anything of the kind.

From the description, Fuhgeddaboutit sounded like it would be a nice change from previous purchases of Jet Fuel, Fog Chaser, and Black Tiger - all of which are terrific coffees. Very disappointed because this was neither dark or bold. I shared some of the k-cups with coworkers to get their opinion and the most positive response was that it tasted "funky", at least more positive than "tastes like paper".<br /><br />Sorry, this one didn't cut it...

I was like<br />"Oh man... this is not good!!"  I just took a paper towel and skimmed it and they came<br />right out and it hasn't happened since.

We blamed the coffee maker and cleaned it out.  It worked fine until we tried another Booklyn decaf k-cup.  Again grounds were all over the holder, the k-cup was full of water, and the coffee maker was clogged.  There is something seriously wrong with the packaging of Brooklyn k-cups.  I see Amazon won't take them back so I may try to open them all and use them in our drip coffee maker.

review/text: I have made my way though 6 of the k-cups and so far so good.  As far as grounds I have had none.  On the taste of the coffee, it's ok.  They claim flavor match to green mountain breakfast blend....not sure about that as I find it be a little more bitter on the back end.  Is it bad, no its not.  Is it a memorable cup of coffee not really.  Overall I put it in the same class as folders meaning somebody hands you a cup and you will drink it, but probably not ask what it was (good or bad).<br /><br />******Update 4-28-12******<br /><br />After my initial review, I was contacted by Brooklyn Bean Roastery asking if they could send me sample of the other roasts of coffe.  Today FedEx just dropped off 36 k-cups mixed between the different roasts.  Currently, I am drinking the Colombian and find it  to be very good.  Total I have run 15-20 of there k-cups through my Cuisinart with no grounds and no unusually long brew times.  Overall, I will keep my subscription I have change to a different blend than the breakfast blend which I originally ordered.

Today looking at the feedback I would not purchase this Brooklyn Bean Roastery Breakfast Blend Coffee. 2 out of the 1st 4 k-cups I used plugged the machine and NOTHING came out. Also it plugged the k-cup holder needle so the next k-cup of my good coffee was wasted also - nothing came out until I cleaned the needle. Soooooooooo it took 3 k-cups for me to finally get a cup of coffee. I am disappointed because the Brooklyn coffee had so many choices and reasonable prices that I was ready to buy more. NOT NOW......<br />J Fred Madden OHIO<br />Update<br />The Brooklyn sent me a complete replacement of my original order. So far I have tried 3 of the replaced k-cups and they worked like a champ.

review/text: I've read the reviews about it clogging the machine and grounds spilling all over and it's all moot as far as I'm concerned.  I too placed my first cup in my Cuisinart and had the grounds spill all over.  I took out the K cup and found out that it did not puncture a complete hole in the bottom.  The next cup I put in I closed a little more forcefully and it punctured a hole just fine.  I've been enjoying pretty good coffee ever since.  So my friends, just make sure a hole is punctured in the cup.  You can even take it out and check and then put it back in.  No problems with this K cup so stop worrying about it.

review/summary: Good for the price
review/text: I purchased the Columbian flavor of these K-Cups. The coffee was OK, but it involves some work to get it brew correctly. The sides of the cup are not rigid enough for the keurig maker to puncture the bottom of the cup easily. There is a noticeable difference in the thickness of the walls of these K-Cups versus any of the other brands that I have. When I placed the first cup in the machine and pulled the handle down, the machine started brewing, but nothing came out. I realized that the sides of the cup had bent and the bottom was not punched through, so no coffee could come out. Luckily I realized this before too long so I was able to keep the water and grinds from going all over. In order to get the cup to insert properly and puncture the bottom, I have to quickly jam it into the machine. This is a bit of an inconvenience, but these were the least expensive K-Cups I could find.

review/summary: My New Favorite!
review/text: I received a very generous sample pack from Brooklyn Bean. I'm not a strong coffee drinker and prefer this light roast. It's very flavorful and my new favorite! I didn't have any coffee grain explosions as another reviewer mentioned.

review/summary: Brooklyn Bean is a Dream!!!
review/text: I received a sampler pack of Brooklyn bean kcups to try. I was curious about this brand because i never heard of them before but i am always looking for new coffees to try. I first tried the corner donut shop and enjoyed it! I haven't ran into any problems so far with brewing the K cups but we will see once i've had a chance to try the rest. I love the varieties that they have. From the problems that other customers have had, it looks like this is a company that cares about its customers and want to make sure they have full satisfaction with their products. I like the fact that their k cups are very affordable too! Now i am looking forward to trying some of their flavored coffees that i've seen listed. Keep up the good work Brooklyn Bean Roastery and thanks for giving us a little piece of Brooklyn to start my day!!!

review/summary: Not as Strong as other French Roast
review/text: We have been drinking the French Roast from Tully, Green Mountain, and Starbucks. We decided to give the French Roast from Brooklyn Bean Roastery a try. What a dissapointment.<br /><br />First, the taste is extremely weak if we set the brewing to "12". So we have to change it to brew at "8".<br />If we brew it at 12, it taste almost like tea. Actually to get the strength as strong as the other well known competitors we have to set the brew at "6". So basically eventhough the price of these is cheaper, you won't save money as you have to use almost twice as much! We went through the whole box (36 k-cups) and all of them have the same consistency, in order to get a strong blend we have to set the brew at "6" or "8". Compare to Tully, Green Mountain, or Starbucks, with setting to "12" we always get a very strong coffee. After all, French Roast is suppose to be a fairly strong coffee.

review/summary: EXPLOSIVE DEVICE
review/text: THE COFFEE IS EXCELLENT WHEN YOU CAN FIND A K-CUP THAT DOESN'T EXPLODE IN YOUR COFFEEMAKER. ONE OUT OF EVERY 6<br />WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT THROUGH A COMPLETE BREWING CYCLE WITHOUT EXPLODING. AMAZON HAS REFUNDED MY MONEY BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS ITEM UNTIL THE MANUFACTURER HAS RESOLVED THIS ISSUE. I LOVE AMAZON, I LOVE THE COFFEE, BUT I HATE THE PACKAGING.

review/summary: Almost there.....
review/text: I was so close to writing a favorable review, right down to the 2nd to last k-cup from my 36-count pack.  The flavor of the Cyclone is a very rich smooth dark roast that I found most enjoyable.  However, flavor gets trumped by inconvenience and unfortunately it is very inconvenient to clean your Keurig after a K-cup defecates its grinds all over it during the brewing process.  My very last K-cup was the hold out.  I had read all the negative reviews that indicated the same problem and I was happy to not have had the same issue.  But that was over on my last cup as the grinds spilt through the dispenser and filter system and of course into the cup of coffee.  This is the fist brand of K-cup that I have ever had do this.  I enjoyed the coffee but I am disappointed in the design quality.  I have read that the Brooklyn company has corrected the issue in their more recent batches (mine was from a couple months ago) but I will wait to see a lot more positive reviews before purchasing again.<br /><br />**EDIT** 6/27/12<br />Brooklyn Bean Company commented below addressing my concerns.  I sent them an email and they very promptly sent out a replacement box along with a smaller sample box of their different flavors.  Just based on the fact that they were willing to send me the replacement box made me adjust my review to 4 stars.  The company is obviously taking the right steps to ensure a positive customer experience.<br /><br />Looking at the new batch I could not see any visible signs of improvement in the design, however I am over ten cups in and no incident yet.  I have to mention again that the flavor is still very good and the sample pack was a perfect idea because if all the cups function properly I will definitely be purchasing a box of the "Fuhgeddaboudit".  I will finish this review with my final thoughts after all the cups have been used.

review/summary: Jury is still out
review/text: Of course, the price is good but I have found way too many grounds at the bottom of my coffee cup on occasion.  I am not sure if there was a problem with that particular batch or if it is a problem in general with this brand.  I have ordered another 2 boxes and if I have the same trouble with too many grounds in the cup, I will have to cancel my subscription and find another brand.

review/summary: Delicious Coffee - Horrible K-cup manufacture - RESOLVED
review/text: I purchased the Brooklyn Bean Roastery Breakfast Blend Decaf K-cups as I am always looking for a decaf coffee that I enjoy and can just continue to order over and over via auto-ship.  My first attempt to brew a cup of this coffee resulted in a cup full of coffee grounds with little to no coffee, as well as a backflow of the same into the Keurig Brewer; as did my second, third and fourth attempts.  I thoroughly cleaned out the Keurig machine and tried again - same results!  I put in a Green Mountain K-cup and it brewed flawlessly.  When I was ready for another cup of coffee, I tried the Brooklyn Bean Roastery coffee again and this time, I did get a cup of coffee, albeit still with a healthy serving of grounds included.  I strained the coffee and was delighted with the flavor.  It appears that for whatever reason, the filter inside the K-cup breaks and releases grounds during brewing, which of course clogs the delivery port of the brewed coffee and the whole process is back-flooded into the brewer.  I have been able to get a cup of coffee from about 1/4 of the Brooklyn Bean Roastery K-cups that I received in my order.  While I really enjoy the flavor of the Breakfast Blend Decaf from Brooklyn Bean Roastery, I cannot continue to purchase them until the manufacture of the K-cup is resolved.  Hopefully, they will be able to do this soon and post a note on Amazon - perhaps list the K-cups as "New and Improved" or the like, so that we can know the problem has been addressed and fixed.<br /><br />I have received a replacement box of K-cups from BBR and to my pleasure, every k-cup brewed perfectly.  Same great tasting coffee and now... no grounds!  I will definitely be ordering more.  Thank you BBR for the replacement K-cups and for fixing the original problem with the manufacturing process.  My original rating was 2 stars; I have increased it to 4 stars and if the subsequent orders I get from BBR continue to brew properly, I will increase the rating to 5 stars.
