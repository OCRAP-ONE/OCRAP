review/text: I ordered this chap stick looking for something a little more natural that I could feel good about using.  I like that it is certified organic, so I don't feel like I am digesting harmful unnecessary chemicals every time i lick my lips. It has nice mild taste, and goes on really silky.

review/summary: Good and Bad, but more good
review/text: Good: It works wonders on skin. Face doesn't look oily + skin stays soft for longer period.<br /><br />Bad: Smells awfully strong and not too pleasant (actually more like incense stick) so one star less.<br /><br />Again good: That awfully strong smell disappears after first few minutes. (or that is what I think, will have to confirm with my husband on that)

review/summary: It's alright
review/text: It smells nice, and has a thick consistency, but rather than call it a scrub, I'd call it a cleanser ; the particles meant to be scrubbing your face aren't big enough to do much scrubbing; if you want a very,very,very gentle scrub then this may be for you, but for those of you who have used the St.Ives Apricot scrub, and want something more effective then you should look elsewhere. On the plus side, it is partially organic, and natural, and as I mentioned earlier it smells nice. I just saw a review about how it smelled like rotten pineapples, and how it caused a pimple outbreak on the reviewer-I'm guessing it was either expired, or had gone bad so don't let that scare you away from trying it-you might like it. As for me,I need something with bigger particles so maybe I'll just do a homemade scrub with sugar-or better yet, I can add a little sugar to the scrub to make it more effective. Oh, and before I forget, my face did look a little brighter after I used the scrub. It isn't allthat bad, but it's just not what I was looking for in a scrub.

review/summary: Amazing price and very handy at work!
review/text: Like many busy office-bound professionals, I drink a lot of coffee (especially now that there is a Keurig in the office!). I loved coffee before but this has fed my addiction. I often forgot to bring sugar in a container to work, and leaving 5 lbs of sugar there permanently didn't make sense for me. However, Amazon had an amazing deal on these boxes of sugar, and it was too good to pass up. The small packets are easy to store and keep in my desk overhead, and at $2/box for 100, it was a convenient way to keep it handy. Over time, the 5 lb bags will likely be a better value but this one was definitely purchased for convenience. Good to see Amazon offering these "every-day" bulk deals now!

review/summary: Dry and somewhat crumbly
review/text: I am a big fan of Coffaro's Biscotti but this is the first variety that I don't care for. I am not sure what the deal is with these, it might be that they taste so dry and crumbly because they are gluten-free which I must have overlooked when I ordered them. In any case they taste, to put it somewhat neutral, "healthy". As if they have the bare minimum of ingredients and are lacking the one that makes them tasty. Since I have no problems with gluten, I will stay away from these in the future and look for the other Coffaro's that I have come to love...<br /><br />A final note: Coffaro's seemed to have disappeared for a good while and I am glad to see them back. One change I do like is that they seem to have made the inner bags much sturdier. They don't tear easily anymore as the old ones did, so Kudos for that.<br /><br />Overall though, I will go back to my beloved wholesome Coffaro's, even if the bag should still tear when one so much as looks at it :-)

review/text: I picked up a pack locally and couldn't stop eating them.  The lemon is perfectly complemented by the vanilla.  The biscotti is not too sweet, which is perfect for a cup of tea or by itself.  They are dry, but no more dry than any other biscotti, so I think they are perfect in terms of texture.  In terms of the cost, the ingredients are so wholesome, I can understand the price though I have been watching it and waited until the three-pack went on sale.

review/summary: Cold-free for over 2 years!
review/text: My son first bought me a bottle of Goji Juice 2-1/2 years ago for my birthday; the intent was to try to diminish my arthritis pain in my two thumbs. I started drinking about 3 ounces each morning, hoping to notice some reduction of discomfort; unfortunately, that never came. However, I've been cold-free and virtually sick-free ever since. At times, when I've been directly exposed to people coughing, sneezing, and suffering from various ailments, I have experienced the initial signs of a cold, but that's as far as it progresses. Within a day, my health is restored and I'm feeling strong once again.<br />I highly recommend Goji - all it takes is a few sips in the morning to stay healthy and feel great.

I found the website selling the 'original' world's largest gummy bear, and was ready to buy it until I figured I'd check amazon just in case, saved myself over $10 including shipping!<br />My family got it well on time, and even though they live in Texas, had no issues with smush face like some other customers have. They even sent a little finger puppet. My brother loved it, everyone was pleased, would definitely recommend it.

So, I decided to get her one for Christmas.  After reading the reviews, I was a little reluctant to spend $10 on something I thought would end up in the trash.  However, it was a big hit!  Does it taste like the small, high quality gummy bears? No, but, it did have a good texture and a decent taste.

review/summary: Seems okay at first and then BAM! Nasty.
review/text: I've been on the HCG drops diet since 9/24/11 and after the first 500 calorie day I was losing my mind. I don't like drinking plain water but I can't have anything except water, coffee or tea. No diet drinks or sodas since they all contain some variant of fake sugar. The only sweetener we're allowed is stevia. I often like berry flavored "diet" drinks, so I thought this product would give me the sweet fix I needed to get through the program.<br /><br />It's really hard to get the number of drops right. I didn't add enough, and then I added too many. Then I didn't shake it up enough so some sips were LOADED with it and others weren't. I read some reviews about flavor vs. sweet, and I'd have to say that I agree. I feel like this packs a LOT of sweet, but the flavor is missing. I could maybe have dealt with that, but...<br /><br />The aftertaste is awful. It takes a second to hit, and then you feel like our mouth has been coated with fake sweet nastiness. It just sits on the roof of your mouth. You drink another sip, hoping it'll go away, but all you're doing is making it worse.<br /><br />I'm not a diet soda drinker, but I know that those products often have an aftertaste. If you're used to an aftertaste, this one may not bother you so much. Except that your mouth feels like it's covered in plastic or something.<br /><br />I used it once and won't use it again.

review/summary: Favorite Cookie RIght Now
review/text: This is my favorite cookie right now and I am slowly causing all of my friends to become addicted to it too. It is shortbread with a chocolate bar on top of it.<br /><br />That said, let me assure you that it is delicious and it satisfies any chocolate desire I may have. It so good that I have eaten an entire box in one day. One lovely aspect of this cookie is that there is a picture of a little schoolboy on the chocolate segment. The elaborate detail of that image only makes the experience seem more lovely. How could you call something that beuatiful "junk food"? One other detail to note, however, is that the cookies are packaged in two sleeves containing six cookies each. Those who lack willpower, like myself, might find themselves eating 6 cookies in one sitting and racking up 390 calories in the process. This is a lovely cookie and well worth the cost.<br /><br />And to address another reviewer's cookie dilemma, I prefer these cookies at room temperature :-)

review/summary: Awesome cookie!
review/text: Really tasty.  The chocolate is good quality; it melts against the roof of my mouth without feeling grainy or greasy the way chocolate in most commercial baked goods does.  I take a few boxes into the office when I'm feeling generous.  They're always a hit.<br /><br />Recent experiment: I left a plate of these out for my office mates next to a plate of Girl Scout Thin Mints.  These went first.

review/summary: Brittish Jasmine Green Tea is the most aromatic
review/text: I have tried both Chineese and Brittish jasmine teas, and I have found that the Brittish green tea (this brand in particular)is a bit more aromatic than the Chineese counterpart. However, the Brittish version has a bit more after bite than the Chineese, but for those that don't like a good after bite, you can always do what the Britts do, and add cream & sugar (I take mine raw). This tea has an excellent bouquet, and should add to any true tea drinker's enjoyment. For a real kick, try making an ice tea out of it (this is an idea particularly good on those hot summer days).

review/summary: Fabulous Tea - Beware of Quantities
review/text: I love this tea.  Have been ordering it from another source for years.  I always ordered six boxes at a time so I would never run out.  Amazon carries it in a six box case.  I inadvertently ordered six boxes of the six-box case.  So rather than ordering my usual six boxes, I ended up with 36 boxes.  As this comes from a third party vendor, there was no way to return any of the boxes once I realized what had happened.<br />So if you are used to ordering this from another website, be sure you order only what you need.<br />It is a good thing I really like this tea....

With Amazon Prime I didn't have to pay for shipping either. Otherwise it would have cost prohibitive to do so.

review/text: One of, if not the happiest parts of my day is when I rise and shine, grind my coffee beans, prepare my coffee, and feed Sheena, my two-year-old Maltese, and Joey, my ten-year-old Papillon their Dogswell Treats breakfast. Sheena and Joey get so excited, that when I give them each a treat, they grab it, and run like hounds out of Hell. God, I love our little morning Dogswell Treat ritual. If only the rest of the day offered up such moments of shear joy. Maybe Dogswell should consider a line of Peopleswell Treats. I would hand them out to strangers, and the world would be a better place, well at least my little part of the world would be.

review/summary: Durkee Ground Cinnamon is tastier than the Supermarket stuff
review/text: This Durkee Ground Cinnamon has an intense, but not overpowering, flavor that can stand up to a hot bowl of oatmeal or make a slice of raisin bread with a little butter true comfort food.<br /><br />I have purchased the bland famous brand that seems to have taken over all the supermarkets and they charge almost as much for an ounce or two as this 18 oz. container costs. I bought two in this offering,and one went to my sister who actually perfected the art of cinnamon sugar mixing. I no longer use sugar, just sprinkle a half packet of artificial sweetener on after prepping, and it tastes just as good to me.<br /><br />Durkee is a brand I grew up with, and it is a shame it is not more widely distributed these days. The supermarkets offer six versions by McCormack rather than six different brands. Do you also see what is wrong with this picture?<br /><br />Of course with this much cinnamon, you'll have to find lots of other uses for it, and remember that some of its friends are apples, chocolate, rolls and even ice cream.

review/summary: My children love these!!
review/text: We've been buying Horizon individual milks for nearly 4 years. My first daughter has never cared much for dairy products, and refuses to drink plain milk, but she'll slurp these up and ask for more! After looking for a flavored alternative to regular milk, I quickly discovered how much junk is added to the popular brands of flavored milks. There are so many artificial flavors, sugar, and perservatives, why even bother? The Horizon milks are not as sugary, but still have great flavor. The part I adore is that they can be stored out of the refrigerator and chilled before serving. That way, they are incredibly portable, especially for travel. All of their flavors are fantastic, but my kids love the strawberry and vanilla best.

review/text: From a price point of view, AMZN cannot be beaten.<br /><br />Convinience - #1<br /><br />Taste of the product - like other reviews, it's really too sweet.  Even for a guy like me who really enjoys desserts, it was a bit on the sweet side.<br /><br />If you cool it down, it does decrease the sweetness a bit, but still too strong.  Maybe they had to make it this sweet so you don't have to refridge it.  I poked a big hole in it and pour it on ice and let it sit for about 5 min for the ice to melt, then it tasted great when diluted a bit with ice.

I like knowing it is natural and good for her.  I love how portable these are.  You can drink them right off the pantry shelf or the refriderator shelf.  You can't find the strawberry or the plain milk in bulk in any store.  They go regularly for $1.65 a piece in the grocery store. So this is a great price.  The regular ones are great for cooking too...  I am allergic to dairy so I only buy it only for my daughter.  So I keep the regular milk on hand to put in mac and cheese and cooking or baking for us.  I love this product!!!!!  Here on amazon it is a great deal.

CARRAGEENAN: a seaweed derivative used in a wide variety of foods and cosmetics. In its native form, it has not been classified as a carcinogen, but in it's degraded or broken down form it has been classified as a possible human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Joanne Tobacman, M.D., University of Iowa assistant professor of clinical internal medicine, and researcher on carrageenan, said "There seems to be enough evidence associating carrageenan with significant gastrointestinal lesions, including malignancies, to avoid ingesting it." According to Dr. Tobacman, the native carrageenan, after being subjected to stomach acids may be broken down into the degraded form and be a cancer risk. And even if it wasn't, carrageenan cannot be identified as native or degraded on food labels, so there is no way of knowing if you are ingesting carrageenan, the carcinogen or not.

review/summary: GOOD STUFF !
review/text: This is the same boxes sold at Starbuck's and the like.  This is very good and healthy stuff !  Strawberry is my 4 yr old Grandson's favorite drink !  He also likes vanilla and occasionally chocolate.  But this one is hands down his favorite at least 2 per day!  By the case like this is much more affordable than individually.  Cuts the price pretty much in half.

review/summary: He Loves This Product.
review/text: Not too long age we discovered these Horizon Organic Low-Fat Milk cartons. They're just the right size for a serving for our three-year-old toddler boy and he loves them. It didn't take him long to learn how to slurp one down and he just loved the chocolate flavored ones. Well, they come in other flavors too. As such, we picked up several of the strawberry-flavored ones because the store was out of chocolate. Would they work just as well? You guessed it! He slurped it down just as fast as the chocolate. I'm surprised, but he just loves this product!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Great stuff.  Taste fantastic. Hard to find.
review/text: My son only drinks Horizon Strawberry milk, nothing else.  He drinks one, sometimes two a day.  I like that you do not have to refrigerate the milk, so easy to pack in his lunch box for school.  It's s hard to find in the stores, so I order 3 cases a month just to be safe.  It taste like strawberry milkshake with no after taste and it's white not pink.  Best stuff.

review/text: Our 5 year old daughter loves these strawberry milk cartons. The ability to keep them in or out of the refrigerator makes them uniquely healthy and portable. They are a staple in her lunchbox and it is now common for her to grab one whenever we head out the door. Best of all, Amazon's price is the lowest (minus the occasional sale elsewhere) that we have found thus far and you don't even have to leave your home to get a case of them.

review/summary: Solution for anti-milk toddler
review/text: After nursing for about 15 months, my toddler wouldn't drink cow milk, soy milk, chocolate milk, etc... but somehow found the Horizon strawberry milk box fascinating and yummy. A good source of calcium and protein of course, plus very convenient. For kids who like to chew on their straws this one doesn't last very long and often sinks down all the way into the box. I usually toss the straw that comes with the box and use a taller, bendy straw instead.

review/text: My daughter grew up with this strawberry milk. She started drinking it after we stopped formula. Even now, this is the only milk she likes. Excellent product. However, it is difficult to find in the local supermarkets and warehouses (they mostly have the chocolate flavor Horizon), especially in the multicarton package. I wish Costco and BJ's carried this strawberry-flavor Horizon milk.

review/text: More than doubling the retail price is hoggish.  I wish Amazon exercised at least some control over resellers like this who hugely mark up products that can be bought elsewhere on the web, such as from the manufacturer.  I recommend you shop around, both to save more than 50% of the price and in order not to support resellers like this.  By the way, a similar review to this one was just removed from the website.  I guess the reseller doesn't want it to be known how much they mark this product up...

review/summary: Superb tea
review/text: I discovered this tea at a local coffee shop. This is undoubtedly the best tasting mint tea that I can recall drinking. The mint flavor is much stronger than the ordinary peppermint tea that I buy in the supermarket.<br /><br />However this is not peppermint tea, but a combination of mint flavors. The result is amazing.<br /><br />The coffee shop served a huge 16 oz cup of tea. When I finished the first cup, I asked for a refill of hot water, and there still was enough strength left in the tea bag for another great cup of tea.<br /><br />If you like mint tea that is robust, then you will love this tea.<br /><br />Note: The rating on this product has unfairly been lowered by earlier reviews complaining about the price. However, the current price on Amazon of ten dollars plus a dollar for shipping is actually less than the current price with shipping on the Mighty Leaf website.
