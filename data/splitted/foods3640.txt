review/text: It is an excellent product although it didn't taste like blood orange juice to me. It's more like grapefruit juice. Either way, it's good. It was shipped fast and direct.<br />** It would make a good base for a mixed drink!

review/summary: A much-missed taste of Italy
review/text: I recently got back from Milan, where even the airport served the most delicious blood orange juice. This amazing juice is not easy to find in the US, so I was thrilled to discover this Volcano Blood Orange Juice. I can't get enough of it; to me, it's twice as good as "regular" orange juice.

review/summary: Delicious, perfect Eel Sauce!!
review/text: I'm so happy to see this sauce here on Amazon! I'll be buying more from here as soon as my current bottle runs out. This is Unagi Kabayaki sauce just like they use in sushi restaurants to put over unagi and spider rolls - the exact same flavor and consistency. You could say it's similar to a teriyaki sauce, but not really. This is less sweet, stronger flavor, thinner texture, and really its own thing. Delicious!<br /><br />I love using this over broiled salmon and catfish as well, and I highly recommend it for seafood lovers and anyone seeking that sushi-bar amazing flavor at home!

Each tin had one little olive and a couple pieces of carrot.  Plenty of fish fillets but desperately in need of salt.  Be prepared to bring salt to your snacking table.<br /><br />Honestly, why pay the price when you can go to the 99 cent store and buy sardines and mussels for a dollar or two for a dollar?  Will not purchase this product again.

It was imported from Italy.<br />It came in a round can it had sardines, capers, anchovies, tuna, olives,peppers,pearl onions.Packed in Olive oil.<br />with a sweet tomato sauce.The can was yellow with a embossed sun image smiling on the top of can.<br />It was delicious. They stopped importing it because the demand in Italy was so high.<br />I was trying to experience the same again with this product!<br />when I opened the can it was full of liquid and had a very bad fish smell.<br />I rinsed the contents off and added olive oil and a bit a ketchup to recreate the same as the Sole brand.<br />It was similar after I doctored it up I'm going to buy the items separatly and make  my own in the future.

I liked the sourish taste (vinegar?) well enough though I was hoping for something more original.  It's mostly sardines with like a stray piece or two of mussel -- that's it!  At least the veggies are provided in fairly decent portions.  But almost four dollars a can is crazy!

The tin itself is approximately 4.5" tall and 4" in diameter.  There is a nutrition information sticker nearly covering the lid but it is easily removed without leaving any sticky residue.  The mints inside are all loose in one plastic bag so NOT individually wrapped if that is what you are looking for (I would prefer even if it would mean less fit in).  This also means that you lose some of the detail imprinted on the mints since they are all banging up against each other (they aren't quite as pretty as they could be).  Hope that helps if you are considering as it is all information I would have appreciated prior to ordering.

review/text: In the Harmalink and Swier line we have maintained a rooted family name and a sense of extreme pride in family history. Where we come from. What our ancestors did. we Loved hanging out with each other because our family was huge and we grew up living extremely frugally so we absolutely needed each other and everyone had to pull their own weight. We called these little gems Church mints because they were handed out to children by grandparents or portly old grumpy gentlemen at church and you could suck on it for the entire hour if you started eating it right as the pastor started the lecture. Great for long briefings or training sessions. I am a Fire Fighter, Hazardous Materials Response Technician, EMT, and I'm telling you that I love to have these on a long scene that doesn't involve much civilian contact or keeps me up through late to early hours. The nostalgia effect is easily confused with the sugar rush as well ha ha!

The pieces are quite small and are in three shapes.  It's been my experience that shaped dry is preferred for some reason, and the size and shapes of this brand is apparently just exactly what my cats wanted.  There is no strong odor, though it a full bowl is empty by the end of the day, so I don't know if it would smell if uneaten.  I've never had a brand (and I have tried them all from the cheap store brands to the more pricey organic) that was eaten with such gusto.  This will be the brand we continue to buy!

review/text: I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey.

As far as taste, if you're just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla, then this Tazo brand will do it for you. If you're looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste, then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea, Tazo, will disappoint you.  The raw rooibos taste, without these "improvements" such as vanilla, is full-bodied and has its own unique taste.  I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings, Republic of Tea, and Numi.

review/summary: A Tasty Alternative to the 100% Columbian
review/text: With only one exception I'm a serious fan of Eight O'Clock coffee. I usually maintain a supply of the 100% Columbian and the French Vanilla coffees on hand at all times.<br /><br />I also drink my coffee black so that requires the coffee to taste good with no outside help allowed; nothing to kill the taste of bad coffee. Both of these Eight O'Clock coffees perfectly fill the bill in that regard. I consider it a treat to be able to switch between the two and one time will have the Columbian and the next time the French Vanilla.<br /><br />Oh yes, the one exception is their decaf; I've discovered I prefer Melitta's Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated.<br /><br />The French Vanilla is a delightful alternative which I recommend highly; so do yourself a favor and give it a try!

review/summary: Try this coffee if you like Vanilla flavoring
review/text: This is just a delightful coffee.  My husband and I are fans of flavored coffee, particularly vanilla and hazelnut.  Even though this is already ground, there is a distinct vanilla aroma/flavor that lasts and is not overpowering.  A secondary concern is that I drink about five cups a day, so I'm looking for any acidic reaction; there is none.  The coffee strength is medium, perfect for drinking in the morning and all day.  I always keep my coffee, especially ground, in the freezer for freshness.  The expiration date is clearly marked on the bottom of the package; mine are for June 29, 2011, but the four packages will not last that long.  Do the math on the cost; my purchase worked about to about $6.60 per pound, including super saver shipping, which is most reasonable these days.  I recommend this coffee.

review/summary: Really good coffee
review/text: I first ordered this coffee because a friend of mine, who is shall we say "thrifty" to be polite, told me that he buys this coffee whenever it is on sale because it is just the best!  He, despite his thrifty ways, likes the finer things (yes, a definite internal inconsistency).  Anyway, I too prefer to get a good product at a reasonable price (I am not going to say that I am cheap - just someone who does not like to waste money unnecessarily).  Spending $5 for a cup of coffee at Starbucks seems like the biggest waste of money I could ever imagine and I simply won't do it when I can make a cup for pennies at my house, but there has to be a way to get a good product at a reasonable price.  Eight O'Clock coffee is it.  It has a smooth rich flavor and is a good strong coffee.  I think that the French Vanilla is the best - you won't believe how good it smells in the bag before you even brew it.  I just purchased this most recent item of 4 bags of 11 ounce coffee for $12.26 - no shipping cost (Amazon Prime), and it was delivered to my door three days later.  How can you beat that?  Again, having previously been to Jamaica and purchased Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee for pennies, I can't give this 5 stars, but 4 stars for the price is pretty darn good!  If you buy this on sale, I don't think you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Finally, a good vanilla coffee that's AVAILABLE
review/text: I've been keeping track of vanilla coffee brands at my store and on Amazon for several months. For some reason they have been getting harder and harder to find. I started with Maxwell House Vanilla, my store quit carrying it, I changed to Folgers French Vanilla, ditto, Amazon seemed to be out of both brands every time I checked. So, I tried Eight O'clock French Vanilla coffee bought at Kroger. It was $6.99 a bag plus tax but I loved the vanilla flavor even better than the others, it is very smooth. Then I found Eight O'clock French Vanilla on Amazon also available with their subscription service. Now I will be having it delivered every month and it is less than $4 a bag.

I tried the Columbian coffee first, and although I thought it was good, personally I like the French Vanilla coffee better.  It's a wonderful tasting coffee.  I bought 4 bags and gave one to my Son and Daughter-in-Law, since they always use the french vanilla coffee creamer.  They love this coffee also.  We are hooked!<br /><br />P.S.  I saw the review that said use left over cold coffee to make a great coffee shake... just add vanilla ice cream.  I tried it and topped with whipped cream.  MMMMM MMMM.... YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's better than Dunkin' Donuts, better than Archer Farms, better than Green Mountain... better than a lot of coffees that are much more expensive (Peet's, Starbucks).  It's buttery and smooth.  It is NOT bitter, acidic or burnt-tasting.<br /><br />I hope Target never stops carrying this brand and flavor.  (By the way, the French Vanilla is much better than their Hazelnut roast!)  I had never even heard of this brand before I saw it at Target.

This is my go-to coffee for breakfast or when we have company over. I prefer a lighter, more flavored coffee; my husband enjoys his a little darker and less flavored. This coffee always seems to please both of us. The vanilla is not over the top. It is light, without the artificial taste. It's just a good coffee and a great value!

Except I pick these up all the time through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for anywhere between my most recent purchase for 5 bags @ $11.04-$11.82 in the past, so you can't go wrong! If the Warehouse Deals(when available) or straight Amazon have a listing available at a higher price then mentioned in this review, then BE PATIENT and rest assure that the price will come down and you'll snag a great bargain like I do all the time on a regular basis.

While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients. Rating, Average.

review/text: My 11 year old son discovered the joy of jerky in the fall of 2011. Elk jerky, a souvenir from Elk County, PA, was his new favorite. In a moment of desperation-Christmas-stocking-shopping, I thought to get him some 'weird' types of jerky. So I got him Kangaroo and Wild Boar. This was a great hit with all the males (19, 48, 71) we celebrated Christmas with. He shared the Wild Boar with some of his friends at school, but kept two full sticks of the kangaroo jerky for himself. He loves to take these oddities to lunch at his school.<br /><br />Although these were a great hit, I don't imagine I'll be buying many more. The shipping prices it out of my 'casual shopper' mode.<br /><br />PS. I don't want anyone to think I'm sexist. Those present of the female gender chose not to try it, as we cared less than the men, and did not want to eat up all of my son's prize! :)

review/text: The 4 ounce Inka Plantain Chips countains 4 servings of 140 calories each (60 calories from fat).  Sodium 60 mg., Potassium 220 mg, Total Fat 6g (9%), Saturated Fat 2.5 g (13%), 0 Trans Fat, Carbohydrates 20g (0 sugar), Protein 1g, Fiber 1g, Vitamin A (6%), Vitamin C (15%).  The good news about the fat is that it is a plant based saturated short chain fatty acid, so your body can digest it efficiently.<br /><br />For anyone who isn't familiar with plantain, it is an Asian fruit, which like it's cousin, the banana, was introduced to the new world by medieval explorers, such as the Portuguese and Spanish sailors.  For more than a year, I was looking for a good gluten-free cracker and I never considered a plantain chip as an excellent substitute until now, and shame on me, because I discovered them about twenty years ago.  As a matter of fact, instead of making dumplings out of wheat flour, Puerto Ricans make them out of ground green plantains or bananas. I never ate plantain chips as a kid, but I did enjoy the plantain dumplings in soup; they were delicious and low in fat.  Puerto Ricans also combine the ground plantain with other tropical tubers and stewed meats to make a huge dumpling that they boil in parchment paper in order to keep it intact while it cooks in a light brine; it's delicious and filling.  At the West Indian markets in NYC, they sell plantain, banana, casava, and peanut flour.  So, if you like to cook and experiment, you may want to make dumplings from such flours; I'm not a cook.<br /><br />The Inka chips are thicker than the plantain chips that I ate years ago, making them a suitable cracker substitute.  I cover them with peanut butter or fruit preserves and enjoy them as a snack.  I also crush them and add them to my bowl of soup in order to give the soup a nice crunch; these chips hold up well in liquid, better than Saltine crackers, with less salt.

review/text: I have ordered these chips twice and both times they were delivered in a timely manner and were fresh and delicious.  They are salted perfectly and a great substitute for anyone craving salted banana chips.  They are more consistently crunchy than many brands of salted banana chips which tend to clump.  They really do taste fresh - no rancid oil taste here!

review/text: I personally LOVE these plantain chips, i see a few people dogged them and i'm wondering if they got a bad bag...because these are good! I'm no stranger to other brands, i've tried GOYA, trader Joe's and several other brands that i came across in the supermarket specialty aisles. These are certainly as delicious as any others i tried. No complaints from me, other than i could EASILY completely pig out on several bags a day....

review/summary: Muy Sobroso!
review/text: I just came back from a trip to Puerto Rico where we ate plantanutras (plantain chips) by the pound everywhere we could find them. These chips are just as good as the ones there and very similar in taste. Not too salty, but not salt-free.  I found them at a local store where somebody else had requested them. The store had 10 bags. I bought 9 so the next person wouldn't be completely disappointed - -and I asked the manager to order a lot more. Yum!  By the way, I had some serious intestinal problems this past year from stress at work and some kind of stomach virus, and I ate a lot of celery which helped. But I found that I could also eat plantains -- both green and yellow. I fry my own and buy the chips to take on the road or days when I don't have time to peel those suckers.

review/summary: Single Malt and Cigars.
review/text: Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits.<br /><br />This tea has an unmistakeably smokey note, which for years made it a particular favorite with the "single malt and cigars" crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms. That aroma is created during the tea's smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.<br /><br />Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long. The rule of thumb is that the paler its color, the more likely you'll truly enjoy it.

review/text: My wife and I have been using unsweetened iced tea for years.  It's great if you're watching your sugar, however it is rather difficult to find an instant iced tea that is absolutely pure, without any sweeteners, flavorings, or additives.  We sometimes add stevia powder to sweeten it up and it tastes absolutely delicious.  This tea mix specifically is now our favorite.  We've tries many brands, which many of them we also like, but this is the best we have found. The taste is good, it dissolves easily, and it is pure.

The product is great, I tried some dollar store onion powder that looked like onion powder but the flavor was very weak, by contrast this powder has a nice pungency.<br /><br />Finally the mylar packaging is very sturdy and of course blocks all the light and air so the second bag is about as well packaged for storage as a spice can be. Our family has been building a year's supply of food storage and seeing these spices made me realize that we never thought about storing spices, one more reason we were very excited to find this line of products.

Also since I use onion powder virtually on every bit of vegetables I eat, I love the fact that I do not produce plastic waste from a bunch of containers. And the price is better than anything you can find locally.<br />I hope Amazon keeps offering this :)

review/text: Good quality and well sealed. I thought I was purchasing ground or granulated onion. This item stands for what it means "powder". There is a difference between powered onion and ground/granules. The texture of powder is like flour, very fine and can dry up the gravy in the meal. I made the mistake in confusing ground onion for poweder. I've learned that powdered onion does not work well for me. I'll check more careful next time. There is nothing wrong with this product, It's just not my preferece in texture.

review/text: We had to experiment with this product after using it the first few times as it's more concentrated than supermarket brands. When we get that down I expect these two pounds will last a really long time. I'm really starting to be product loyal to Frontier Natural Products Coop and this is the fifth item from them I've purchased via Amazon Subscribe and Save. Everything I've bought is at least better than what I'm accustomed to if not superior. And the volume savings in incredible. Again, two pounds (32 ounces) packaged in two individually sealed pouches for how much? Cheap! This particular item is labeled "Powdered White Onion - Allium cepa", "Non-Irradiated" but does not show a country of origin. I don't really care anyway for onions. Expiration date is shown "Best By May 2015".<br />I'm finding myself checking other Frontier Natural products and just buying them based on my experiences. Suggestion- get a dozen Ball or Kerr brand preserving jars and pack these spices away for freshness.  John

review/summary: The very first, undoubtedly the best, and unfortunately hardest to find root beer.
review/text: I'm a soda (or pop) enthusiast who has tried pretty much every kind of soft drink there is throughout the states. I seem to vaguely remember seeing Hires a time or two in stores when I was a kid, but it has been very elusive in the past two decades in my experience. A couple years ago, I was reading about Vernors ginger ale on Wikipedia one day and found out that it (Vernors) was along with Hires root beer one of the first sodas marketed in the U.S., even long before Coca-cola. This really sparked my interest and I started searching high and low for it on the internet with virtually no luck as it was not available on Amazon at that time. I saw some on sodafinder.com but learned from customer reviews that a lot of the soda they sell is expired. Finally, I called customer service at Dr. Pepper/Snapple and they told me that it was in low production but could be found at Schnuck's Pharmacy in Bettendorf, IA. Delighted, I packed a few things (neglecting my cell phone charger) and departed for the 14 hour or so drive to Iowa. Luckily, this was during my week of summer vacation so I had time to do it.<br />Long story short, I made it to Schnuck's and bought some for $7.29/12-pack. About six months later I returned to Iowa to visit my friend who goes to Iowa State in Ames and picked up a couple more 12-packs but we drank it all and I had to buy more on the way home.<br />Its taste is really unique in my opinion, a little sweeter and spicier than most, but I don't think it's just my imagination when I say it tastes better than A&W (which has a strong vanilla presence), Mug, Dad's, Frostie, or even Boylan's. It's nothing at all like Barq's which I don't like and has caffeine. Maybe it's the 135 years of Hires' existence and experience that makes it the best root beer. All I know is that why Hires is no longer the premier root beer in the United States is beyond me.

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/text: Our Boston Terrier loves these bones - we give them to her as a treat or to keep her busy when we have company.  For a 16 lbs. dog she's a mighty chewer and these last her a couple of hours, with breaks to investigate if she's missing anything!  We'll buy more of these!

review/summary: My dog goes crazy for these!
review/text: My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

review/text: My 3 year old miniature schnauzer loves these bones. I'm really glad that they started making them wheat-free because he has food allergies.
