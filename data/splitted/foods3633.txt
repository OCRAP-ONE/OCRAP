review/summary: Best vegetarian hot dogs in the world!
review/text: I have tried numerous vegetarian hot dogs and this is by FAR the tastiest one!  There is another kind my Loma Linda called linnkettes or little links, but these BIG FRANKS are the best!  They have a great beefy texture and taste!  A lot of other veggy hot dogs have a plastic feel to them, but not these!  I use these to make hot dogs, chili dogs, slice it up in my spaghetti sauce, anything!

review/summary: Great Veggie hot dogs!
review/text: Big Franks are a great replacement for meat products.  They can be used in any recipe calling for hot dogs:  traditional in-bun, sauteed with onions and potatoes, or in casseroles such as a German-style potato/onion/cream sauce mixture.  They can also be used in deep-fried corn dogs.  They have a great flavor and texture and I have used them for 40 years.

review/summary: Best Veggie Dogs
review/text: These are the best vegetarian dogs I've tried. Better than Tofu Pups or any of the Eves products.  They're really good with a whole wheat bun, with or without fixing.  I bought a whole case because they're easy eating out of the can.  Heating them isn't even necessary if the can is warm.

review/summary: Great veggie dog
review/text: These franks are great. I got them because the case was on sale, and I'm glad I did. They're not really like hot dogs... maybe more like a vienna sausage. Smart Dogs are the most realistic vegan hot dog alternative I've found. But for the price and convenience, these little dogs are great. I've had them fried on homemade hot dog buns with all the condiments, and I also snack on them straight from the can. I'll probably buy another case while they're on sale.

review/text: Big Franks are great either cooked hot served in a bun with all of the fixings or just take cold from the can.  I like them either way but do eat most taken directly from the can kept cold in the refrigerator. Compared to many snacks Big Franks are both nutritious and tasty.  Eat with a coke or your favorite beverage without any guilt.

review/summary: Still love Big Franks and Linkettes after 32 years!
review/text: We have been enjoying Big Franks and Linkettes for decades. My children, all vegetarian, were raised on them. A still favorite supper is Big Franks on rolls with sauerkraut, mustard and ketchup, french fries, and vegetarian beans. Perhaps for some Big Franks and Linkettes are an acquired taste, but I would say for most people who like hot dogs, BFs are great!

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: I purchased these BIG FRANKS after reading the positive reviews and after enjoying other LOMA LINDA products.  I have NO idea what the 5-star reviewers ate because I could barely stomach these pseudo-food products.  I'm not sure what to do with the remaining cans because relish, catsup, onions, mustard and tons of other toppings failed to camouflage the rubbery off-taste of these "franks."  My conclusion is that I think I'll eat all the condiments and dispense with this red-grey monstrosity.<br /><br />UPDATE: After reading responses to my review, I realize that the way to appreciate these franks is to eat them during childhood WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER (sorry... just kidding... I couldn't resist).  Okay... If you don't acquire a taste for these during your imprintable years, be cautious about buying them now.  You've been warned.  GOOD LUCK.

review/summary: Edible, but not even close to all the hype
review/text: These canned hot dogs are not what they are hyped up to be.  After reading all of the 5 star reviews my hubby and I had to try them.  I was nervous to buy a full case off of Amazon so I picked up a couple from a safeway grocery store (the other was the Little Links... completely gross!) for about $9 a can.<br /><br />We grilled them, with great success!  We used a little cooking oil spray and there was no sticking and they held together nicely.  I put mine on a toasted bun with ketchup and relish.  The dog was mushy and not much flavor.  It wasn't THE worst veggie dog but NOT even close to greatest.  They are not worth the price.  Morningstar veggie dogs are the best, these don't even compare except that they are hot dog shaped.<br /><br />If I were building a bomb shelter and wanted veggie dogs in my canned food stash, these would be go to choice.  Otherwise, save your money, try a can from the store before getting a giant amount here.

review/text: My 2 stars are not for the product as such.  The hot dogs are very good and offer an excellent alternative.  However, I don't buy these from Amazon anymore as the price has increased dramatically over the last year or so. I used to get these for around $45 with subscriptions and the same price is now around $65.  I can find cheaper then that from a local store.

review/summary: FABULOUS DOGS, the BEST I ever tasted!!!!
review/text: Although I am a confirmed carnivore, and love all things meat, if I ever do decide to quit and become a strict full time vegetarian, these would become a staple. They can be now anyway, thanks to Amazon as they are very difficult to find. Once you taste these you will just be amazed at how fantastic they are, one taste and you will be hooked, they are simply great. You can have them in casseroles, on a bun with onions, pickles and relish or just have them all by themselves, they are unbelievably delicious and this is an excellent deal because they are very filling (without the cholesterol)and at 20 oz, one can will last quite a while, and 12 cans will def last a loooong time no matter how often you have them. I love them with any kind of beans, chili, BBQ, baked beans, kidney beans, or green beans. Have one frank and you will fall in love. Enjoy!

review/summary: Big Franks -- YUM!
review/text: Loma Linda Big Franks, 20-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)<br /><br />God Bless Worthington, Loma Linda and Kellogg for delicious, healthy products such as this one.  I've been a vegetarian since 1980 and could not find anything like their products anywhere, for a long time.<br /><br />Actually stopped eating hot dogs a few years earlier than that when I learned that the FDA allowed a certain percentage of rat excrement and hairs in beef franks.<br /><br />These big vegan franks are a gustatory delight to me.  Once I open a can, I immediately start snacking on one.  Sometimes the rest make it to the frying pan or grill with a little olive oil.  Sometimes I just snack on the rest of them all day or two straight from the can.  Delicious.<br /><br />Can't remember what an animal-based hot dog tasted like, and sure would not like to.  The heavy, oily, acrid smells of animal food cooking actually make me ill.  Happens when you've been a vegan for awhile.  I'd recommend this product and the others offered here.  Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Awesome if you have the right equipment
review/text: This was the coffee in cafes, bars, and homes, all around Malaga, Andulcia where I lived for some time. There are really only two ways to prepare this coffee to make it taste like it did there.<br /><br />A stovetop bialetti espresso maker (or offbrand, it doesn't matter, but it has to be that style) and this was how it was made at home. From my flatmates to their families, to the people I worked with, etc, this was the method we used to make our own cafe con leche. (I'll post directions at the bottom.)<br /><br />At bars and cafes, they used professional grade espresso machines, not the cheap ones many people have - they cannot produce the same amount of pressure, so pretty much anything short of the 800usd range won't get you adequate pressure to make a cafe style cafe con leche. (Personally, for what it is, and how long it lasts, I have invested in a Nuova Simonelli Oscar. It has a high pressure steam and high pressure application for the extraction - and you can use the steam wand and pull a shot of espresso at the same time. For most espresso machines, you're looking at the 2,000usd and above range to get that to happen. Plus Nuova Simonelli's are serious workhorse machines, you just have to take good care of them.)<br /><br />Instructions for the stovetop method:<br /><br />1) Use good water if possible, otherwise tap will do but be aware that you will get calcium deposits forming on all the parts and you will need to soak the stovetop maker in a strong, hot water and vinegar solution regularly.<br /><br />2) In the filter, pack as much coffee grounds as you can without it overflowing, and pack it TIGHT<br /><br />3) Cook on low-medium heat, if it cooks too fast or too high, you will scald your coffee, and that just tastes terrible<br /><br />4) While the espresso is cooking, get whatever mug(s)/cup(s) (in Spain, we used glasses, foreigners and tourists got mugs at cafes) you are going to be serving the cafe con leche in, and fill it three quarters with whole milk. Whole. Not 2%, not skim, not cream or creamer, but whole. Whole milk/3.5% fat. Anything else and the texture will not be the same. Microwave the cup's contents for about two minutes, just until it starts to simmer, then if you have a hand pump frother, go ahead and froth it a little bit. Not a lot, you are not trying to make a macchiato. You just want the hot milk to be a little velvety.<br /><br />5) Pour in a shot to two shots from your stovetop espresso pot and stir well<br /><br />6) Raw sugar or white sugar, usually a tablespoon to two tablespoons was what I saw others use (I usually went whole hog and did 3 tablespoons) and stir.<br /><br />This will yield a velvety, thick, and sweet cafe con leche. It's how pretty much everyone I knew who didn't drink it black would prepare it. (The Brits all used drip style and had no idea what they were doing and would complain about how thin it was because they just used a drip Mr Coffee style set up.)

review/text: Go with Simply Heinz Ketchup not these packs its the best ketchup with real sugar. No poisons like HFCS.<br /><br />HFCS.. Here's why it's far more dangerous to your health than table sugar<br /><br />High fructose corn syrup is a popular sweetener because it is chemically different from sugar ,it has a longer shelf life and mixes better into beverages. Yet the corn industry likes to downplay these differences, pointing out that sugar is 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose, while HFCS is 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.<br /><br />This framing glosses over an essential difference: sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide composed of a single glucose molecule and a single fructose molecule. HFCS, in contrast, is a liquid solution composed of separated individual glucose and fructose molecules (monosaccharides).<br /><br />To make HFCS, a 100 percent glucose solution is converted via enzymes into a 42 percent fructose-58 percent glucose solution. This solution is further treated until it is 90 percent glucose, then mixed with more 42-58 solution to yield a 55-45 concentration. So while the final ratio of fructose to glucose might look similar to table sugar, it is in fact a very different product. Is it any wonder that HFCS is processed differently by the body?

review/summary: Received 6 month old product
review/text: We use ketchup packets in our lunches.  It takes several months to use up a box.  According to Heinz, the shelf life of ketchup packets is 7 months. The product I received is 6 months old.  I will have to donate it to a food bank. This is a good product, but not fresh enough for extended use. I will purchase at GFS after this. I am very disappointed.

I add a variety of other items to it: ground flax seeds, chia seeds, sunflower seeds, cinnamon,Green Vibrance, blueberries, banana, coconut oil, Stevia and ice.

I grind the seeds fresh in a coffee grinder and then add them to my blender. I have a Blendtec blender that mixes it all up to be very smooth. It is delicious and satisfying.

review/summary: definitely different
review/text: To reference a line from Star Trek TOS 2.21 "By Any Other Name", Scotty is getting his Kelvan captor drunk. When asked what the last remaining alcoholic beverage is, Scotty replies, "I don't know. It's green." Well, so is this. I have tried most of the Whey Factors products and they are all great. This is no exception. It is a high-quality product, with an uncommon flavor that is most definitely green tea. It might take some getting used to, and I certainly didn't drink it every day. However, I used up my supply just as rapidly as the other flavors. If you are looking for something different in a good quality protein powder, this might be worth a try.

review/summary: Tastes good, mixes nicely
review/text: I'm a big fan of Natural Factor's unflavored whey protein, which dissolves easily and has a very neutral flavor.  I'm also a big fan of matcha flavor, so I decided to give this a try.  I'm glad I did, because it tastes really good and is just as easily mixed as the unflavored variety!  This protein powder has a sweeter, more vanilla taste than I was expecting - much like green tea ice cream - but it's not saccharine like many protein powders.  I don't care for very sweet protein drinks after my workouts and can drink this without any issue.  The aftertaste of sweetener is hardly detectable.  I usually mix this with my unflavored Natural Factors whey protein using a 1:1 ratio just because I like my whey drinks to be less intense; however, it's still tasty on its own.  I highly recommend trying this if you're looking for something with a pleasant green tea taste that isn't overly sweet!

review/summary: Really hits the spot!
review/text: I have a feeling this is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup for adults.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to buy one of these at a local store several months ago and my mouth still waters whenever I think of them.<br /><br />I used to LOVE the regular Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, but the last few times I've splurged calories on them, I've been less than thrilled. They seem so small and wimpy! Did they really get smaller or is my mouth that much bigger? I can eat a whole regular-sized cup in one bite, and it mostly tastes of the (as another poster unkindly pointed out) slightly waxy chocolate. To me, Reese's Cups have always been about the peanut butter filling, but it seems lacking to me now in the regular-sized cups.<br /><br />Enter the Big Cup! Naturally, it's bigger, but it also seems to have more peanut butter inside--which means more of that yummy peanut flavor. Even though you only get one per pack, and one Big Cup weighs less than two regular-sized cups, I still found it far more *satisfying* than the two-pack. I was able to eat it the way I like--nibble the edges and then chomp the peanutty middle--and the peanut butter flavor filled my mouth to perfection. Mmmmm!<br /><br />I'll keep my eyes open for these at the local stores, since it's already too hot where I live to order chocolate by mail. Otherwise, come Fall, I guess I'll order a box or two if they're still available. *hope!* If you see this at the store, and you're a Reese's Cup fan from way back, grab it, you lucky dog!

review/text: Until you have experienced the "BIG CUP".  I thought that the classic 'two per' Reese's peanut butter cup was the ultimate in store-rack candy, but I was sooo wrong.  There is something so incredibly right about the peanut butter filling in these monoliths and the fact that it has more volume to fill with a slightly thicker chocolate cup makes this form factor perfect.  Would more be better?  That's really hard to imagine, but I'd try it!

review/text: This is not chocolate at all! I don't taste the chocolate at all because there is hardly any cocoa in it. It taste like sugar and is too waxy. Before Reese's and Hershey's started adding junk like soy lecithin, which is vegetable lard, vegetable oils instead of cocoa, preservatives, and loads of milk into its ingredients, it used to taste so good you couldn't stop eating them. Nowadays, it hard to find 65% chocolate or more that is inexpensive because most brands like Hershey's and Mars hardly put an cocoa in their products.<br />Ingredients:MILK chocolate (Sugar; cocoa butter; chocolate; nonfat milk); lactose; soy lecithin; PGPR, emulsifier); peanuts, sugar, dextrose, salt, TBHQ.

review/summary: Reunion Island Coffee
review/text: I enjoy coffee from my pod machine because of the convenience of making just one or two cups in the morning.  After trying several brands of pod coffees, this is the brand I'll continue to order.  The variety assortment is a good way to try out several different flavors, and most of them are very good.  I particularly like the Ethiopia Oromeo flavor, which is full bodied, with a nutty flavor.  The House Blend is also an excellent coffee with a mild flavor for every day drinking.  In fact, I really enjoyed all of the flavors with the exception of the Donut Shop Blend.  After trying it on two separate occasions, I finally ended up throwing out the rest of the Donut Blend pods because I didn't like the bitter taste.  When I reorder, I'll go for the Ethiopia Oromeo and House Blends.  Another excellent flavor to try (not included in the variety assortment) is their Hazelnut Vanilla decaf for those times when you want a cup of coffee before bedtime.  Yum!!

review/summary: Okay but very strong flavor of Parmesan
review/text: I follow a low carb life style and so I do miss having a variety of crunchy things to eat (other than bacon :) ... so I tried this on recommendation from a friend. They are very hard to chew in my opinion and make a bit of a mess when you bite into them as you either have to chew off a hunk to eat or the whole thing crumbles into a mess.<br /><br />And that all would be okay if the flavor was quite so intense. I know Parmesan cheese is a strong cheese flavor naturally but this seems to kick it up a notch. I wanted to use these crisps as a platform for spreads and such but the flavor of the crisp overwhelms anything I would put on it.<br /><br />I won't be buying these again.

review/summary: It's Worked For Us!
review/text: We own a 1 year old Border Collie that has a sensitive system.  We have tried all types of "high-end" feed.  We have spent countless hours doing research and we were still struggling with pickiness and digestive/bowel problems.  One thing we found out is our dog can NOT tolerate chicken.  It goes right through him!  He has checked out totally healthy with the vet and were sent with the task to "just find the right food" for him.  We finally settled on this.  I was very worried at first that I was feeding a "main stream" dog food.  After looking at the quality list of ingredients and a recommendation from my farrier (fellow collie owner), we gave the lamb rice a try.  Our dog loved it!  Never again did we have a bowel problem and he finished his bowl.  I add a little warm water to it with a tablespoon of lowfat yogurt.

review/text: My dog eats holistic Eagle Pack food on a regular basis and we alternate between other Eagle Pack flavors. My husband and I received several samples of this shredded lamb dry dog food at the annual Mutt Strutt in Indianapolis, IN.  The first ingredient was meat and not corn so we tried a bit at a time (we don't want to change his food).  It has a really strong lamb smell to it and it appears really healthy on the ingredient list so we felt it was okay to try as a treat.  The dog food in your hand has some oily residue (possibly to enhance the flavor/taste) but it could be the lamb...<br /><br />This healthy dog food is easy to handle when you are doing fast training exercises and intend to get your hand covered with drool anyway. The food is a good motivator.<br /><br />As for short or long term benefits of the food I don't know but gestational female dogs can eat this food-I'm no vet and i don't know if this dog food is calorie or nutrient dense like puppy food but it is okay for our dog as treats.<br /><br />Because its first ingredient is meat it is already better than the cheap kibble food many dog owners buy- so I would say if you don't have access to Eagle Pack or other holistic dog food this is a good alternative- and leaps and bounds better than cheapo kibble that has corn as the first ingredient.<br /><br />I would assume the shredded dry dog food in other flavors has a similar quality in crunch and texture and oily enhancement on the food. My verdict is it's worth trying out.

The woman that called/emailed me assured me that she would do everything that she could to make sure the product reached me in the best possible state.  She packaged them in bubble wrap and personally submitted them to FedEx.  Once the candies left the store in California, they arrived a week later, still a bit melted (which I expected, being that it's June), but in much better condition than the first time I ordered them.<br /><br />I really appreciate the efforts of the customer service department in trying to remedy the issues that I had with my original order.<br /><br />Original: I bought two of these, one to give as a gift to my mother-in-law who has a nostalgic love of these candies and one for my husband that just loves them.<br />I was extremely disappointed when we received the package.  I was expecting the candies to be packaged in the cute bucket as shown in the photo, but they were not.  They came in plastic bags and the two packages had been smashed into one box.  Also, the chocolates looked like they had melted at some point and then hardened back up by the time they reached my home.<br />I will have to sift through the two packages to find the nicest looking candies and will also need to purchase some sort of package to put them in, as I'm giving them as a Mother's Day gift.<br />The only good thing I can say about this is that it's the lowest price I've been able to find anywhere.

If you dont mind eating crumbs and slivers, it's a good deal. Otherwise, very disappointing.

review/text: This peach tea honestly tastes like it was flavored with peach-scented soap.  The tea itself is probably fine, but the flavoring that they used is overpowering and barely resembles peach flavor.  After I opened the package, a cheap, artificial peach scent filled the entire room, which was not bad in itself, but the soapy taste made this tea completely unacceptable.  It sounds cruel to say this, but the flavor of this tea is closer to peach shampoo than peach tea.

On the first few flavor notes it does taste great: you get the mild black tea with peach flavor that builds quickly. Towards the end and a bit after it starts to taste a little off. I'm not sure if it's the sunflower flavor coming out or something else, but it just isn't for me.<br /><br />If you like peach tea and you need $3 to hit your $25 minimum, I'd say give it a shot. You can see the chunks of real peach and it smells great; it could just be my taster that's off.

review/text: All products from wilton are absolutely incredible. These are not tiny balls of sprinkles, they are slightly bigger and just what I was looking for for the cake idea I had. A must buy for fabulous ideas. Arrived quickly : ) so that was a plus.

review/summary: A fine product, but be warned...
review/text: These sprinkles are fine. We bought them for our 3-year-old daughter. She loves rainbow sprinkles, but wanted individual colors. Well, on the first day she got these she used a bunch of the green ones. Next morning she had green poops!! We were freaked out at first, but then we remembered she ate these. So just be warned - they must use some pretty strong colorants. If you worry about those kinds of chemicals you should probably avoid these.

review/summary: The Perfect Snack
review/text: These crisps are about the same diameter but only 1/3 as thick as rice cakes and much lighter. They are a bit rounded, about halfway between a plate and a bowl. At only 16 calories a piece there is no guilt and they are great edible plates for peanut butter, cream cheese or anything else your heart desires.

review/text: LOL Some fool is running around here claiming this sauce tastes like<br />a "rebranded cocktail sauce" and will make your food taste like shrimp.<br />I swear the internet has made idiots out of half the population.<br /><br />First of all, this Chili Sauce is mandatory for making a good homemade<br />cocktail sauce, just add horseradish and lemon juice. It is also mandatory<br />in any variety of cocktail meatballs recipes. in salad dressings, for<br />making spaghetti sauce and yes, even in a pot of chili, just don't pour<br />this into a skillet of ground beef and expect that you now have Chili!<br /><br />This stuff also makes a great Sloppy Joe, and is even good as a dip for<br />fries and burgers.

review/text: "Splenda" is one of my favorite things ever! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for sweet tasting snacks and drinks that will not effect my blood sugar levels. Splenda makes it possible for us to have sweet baked goods, sweet ice tea and coffee again since I don't like "Nutra-Sweet" or "Sweet and Low"<br /><br />Like most diet products it is not perfect and Splenda does not taste quite as good as regular sugar, but it is as close as we have found. It is really very satisfying and has no calories as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

Now we will purchase granular Splenda along with it. Splenda granular is perfect for baking because it measures exactly like sugar. I use it in my smoothies to avoid using so many packets. For us Splenda granular has the added benefit of making our purchase of packets ship free ($25 spent equals free shipping), so again, it's a sweet deal!

review/text: Honestly these sardines taste fine to me. But there is something inexplicable about them. My cat won't touch them. He loves brunswick sardines and eats them immediately. But I put down these sardines for him and he'd rather eat ordinary cat food! I think he is a picky bastard but maybe he can smell something I can't that makes him think "not fit to eat". It is the same way with canned tuna, he'll never eat it. But he will eat cheap mackeral from a can every time (which I find disgusting). And he will eat the tuna from those rediculously expensive pouches. Perhaps its BPA??<br /><br />These fish are packed in a lot of water which makes me wonder about the net weight claim of 4.4 ounces. Is that fish and chum, or just fish?<br /><br />Maybe I'll just keep these for trading during the zombie apocalypse.

Normally I can eat sardines plain directly from the can, but I struggled to motivate myself to eat these and had to get creative (making sardine balls, adding copious hot sauce, etc.). I would look elsewhere or at least try these first before committing to such a large purchase.

review/text: I have had my Keurig for ten days now.  Since I was waiting for my Amazon-ordered Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf to arrive via Fed Ex, I was using the free variety sampler pack that came with the machine.  I was certain that the whole Keurig thing was hype.  The coffee was weak.  The coffee was fruity-winy, just what I dislike in my coffee mug.  I had even tried the hot chocolate and thought it was about the same as Swiss Miss in an envelope:  crappy-tasting and limpid.  Last night, things started to look up:  I had a Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice herbal tea, and that was verrrry good.  And today, my Dark Magic arrived.  Just had two cups.  It's dark.  It's rich.  It's bold.  It's smooth.  It accepts my half-and-half and stands up to it.  It's a heckuva cup of coffee.  Maybe I'll keep the Keurig after all.

review/text: Recently my cardiologist forced me to give up my beloved coffee with caffeine. I have always been a coffee addict drinking up to 7 cups a day of Green Mountains darkest, richest blends. Sometimes for added oomph I would add a shot of espresso. So imagine my chagrin when forced to give up my beloved coffee? You may ask yourselves why was I giving up coffee? Why wasn't I switching to decaf? Well, lets say that what I remember from the past was that decaf coffee wasn't delicious. It was rather nasty to my taste buds. Sanka Instant and Postum...blech.<br /><br />Since I had been drinking Green Mountain Dark Magic WITH caffeine, I decided to try it in the decaf form. And WOW. What a difference from those weak wanna be coffees that taste like warm water that a brown crayon was dipped in and called coffee.<br /><br />Testing Dark Magic against the French Roast decaf...well thank god Dark Magic is even better since the French Roast Green Mountain will no longer be available.  At least according to Keurig when I asked them.<br /><br /> I had previously thought that the French Roast was the best and that the Dark Magic rated a distant third, but I have a feeling that I had gotten a bad batch since what I have been drinking is excellent.It is surprisingly rich, full flavored, non-acidic and with none of the aftertaste that some coffees can have. I don't think for one minute that I would be able to tell the difference if I was to be served this in a blind taste test.<br /><br />Well this just goes to show that sometimes the past and how we remember things can come back to bite us on our you know whats. I would have been truly suffering had I not found this product!

review/summary: Nice and Bold
review/text: A very rich coffee especially for a decaf and perfect for those that like larger cups of coffee but are trying to restrict caffeine intake. I find that Amazon has many more choices than most for the K Cup and most of the time better prices. It is nice not to be so restricted with the decaf choices and this one is a tasty one but definitely bold!

review/summary: A way for a coffee drinker to enjoy decaf
review/text: I'm a coffee drinking fiend, but the caffeine ups and downs were really starting to wear on me.  I've been hesitant switching to decaf coffee becuase I thought I had to give-up the bold taste that I enjoy so much.  Green Mountain's Extra Bold decaf was the answer.  I still enjoy that bold coffee taste, but without the sluggish affects of the caffeine lull later.  It's a win-win!

review/summary: Impressive Decaf
review/text: I managed to taste this before purchasing and I have to say, in taste and character, it is easily equal to its non-decaffeinated counterparts. It makes a hearty cup with no bitter aftertaste. My sister in law likes to mix it with flavored coffee for strength (as the Green Mountain flavors tend to be on the light side), I like it on its own. An impressive decaf.

review/summary: Extra Bold Decaf is fantastic
review/text: I gave up caffeine September of 2011.  Dark Magic Extra Bold decaf tastes like a caffeinated coffee.  It's hard to drink any other kind (except Starbucks decaf at a Starbucks location).

review/summary: Good Decaf
review/text: Dark Magic is one of my favorite types of K-Cups, and the decaf has the same great flavor as the regular variety. Recommended if you like strong, bold coffee.

review/summary: Deep fabulous rich decaf coffee for the Keurig
review/text: Great great decaf.  Made the Keurig worth it.  Until then all coffees tasted like water.  Very smooth not at all bitter just full of flavor.

review/summary: If you like a big cup of coffee...
review/text: If you like a big cup of coffee, buy the "extra" and/or "dark" cups.  They contain more coffee for the same approximate price as the non-extra cups (as the packaging is the expense in K-cups).<br /><br />I make 14 ounces of coffee from these Extra-Bold Dark Magic Decaf cups, then add two ounces of milk.  (Of course, if you like strong coffee, you'll need to make the usual 8 ounces.)<br /><br />Note: Be careful when ordering decaf coffee from Amazon: Amazon has a big fat bug in their search algorithm:  If you search for decaf, they will happily serve up regular coffee instead. Make sure before you click the Buy button that you really are buying decaf.  Otherwise, you may be awake for the next 40 days and 40 nights.
