review/summary: Bought by accident, bought again on purpose
review/text: I bought this product by accident one morning at a local deli, and I was very surprised when I first ate it.  Granted, you can easily tell (and I was scared because I was expecting beef jerky when I first bit it) that it is not meat.  But, as an alternative, it is very tasty, and I did end up buying it again.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (10g protein, 3g fat, 8g carbs.). The Hickory Smoked variety is very flavorful with a little bit of a spicy kick. The texture is somewhat firm, which I enjoy, but it often gets stuck between my teeth so I always need to have some dental floss handy. I would say that of all the varieties of Primal Strips, this is currently my favorite.

review/summary: Mesquite Lime is my favorite!
review/text: I've tried all flavors of Primal Spirit Vegan Jerky and the Mesquite Lime is my personal favorite, but it depends on your taste. If you're a fan of limes as I am, you'll love this flavor. Its a bit tart. It is also a very tender texture as compared with the others. The Hot and Spicy flavor is my second favorite. It has the toughest texture which is closest to regular jerky and is the only one made from mostly mushrooms. It is a bit spicy if you never eat spicy foods!

review/summary: Seriously Delish!
review/text: WOW! This product is simply delicious. Nice texture, almost like shredded beef(better than beef jerky in my opinion) and the spices for this flavor is just right! A combination of smokey, salty and sweet. The only problem I have with it is trying to stop eating it! I know it is packed with protein, low in fat and only 81 calories, but the carb content (11 grams per serving)seems pretty high for just one strip. Just have to watch my consumption :oD Although, I have replaced a meal with two primal strips and lost about 5 pounds this week. All in all, this is an exceptional meat alternative snack.

review/summary: Nice taste, pretty healthy
review/text: This is a pretty good snack food.  I don't miss meat, but i do miss the seasonings put on it.  This is very tasty and has a nice texture.  A packet is 4 servings, and 100 calories per serving, pretty much equal protein and carbs, so it's a high protein food for most people.<br /><br />Problems: the inner packaging isn't that easy to deal with, a knife is needed to cut it open.  So not a great on-the-go food.  Also, there is not a lot of volume for the 400 calories, so it's not a good food if you are watching your weight.

review/summary: Fermentation is part of the cacao harvesting process
review/text: A number of reviews have remarked that the bag smelled fermented or like vinegar when opened. I experienced the same thing, and being a first time consumer of cacao nibs, specifically this brand, I was concerned that I received a bad batch. Upon further research, I learned that fermentation is a necessary part of cacao processing, used to reduce astringency and develop the flavor we associate with chocolate. Fresh cacao seeds have no chocolatey flavor at all. So, much like my first real piece of Roquefort cheese, I learned that this can be surprising in smell and taste to those of us who have only ever had the overly processed derivatives. While it is possible that some really did receive a compromised product, I found no detectable rancidity or otherwise off flavors in mine. I do pour the nibs into a bowl so they breath a little and this helps to dissipate the fermented aroma when I am eating some plain.<br /><br />This is an item you do not want to buy in quantity until you have a chance to sample first (like that case of vegetarian canned chili I once ordered.)<br /><br />I enjoy the product and plan to incorporate into a trail-mix type bar for some extra flavor.

review/text: Now I can eat chocolate everyday!  These are really good in yogurt and I know I'll find more uses.  I will definitely buy this product again, most likely in bulk.  I'm a health food junkie and nibs will probably be a new staple in my diet.  In case you're wondering, I thought these were bite-size (from the picture) but they're actually little flakes.  You shouldn't compare the taste to "normal" chocolate because all you really taste is the tons of added sugar.  There is no sugar in these, think bitter cocoa powder.

review/summary: Great Coffee Substitute
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of this product because of the bad reviews on it.  I like bittersweet chocolate though so, maybe that's why.  I also mix it with yogurt as it says on the bag.  The "nibs" are more like crumbles however, that is inconsequential to me as I mix them.  These have helped greatly with curbing my chocolate addiction and keeping me on track with my diet.

review/summary: Arrived fast - tast interesting  :)
review/text: I saw this recommended on Dr Oz for energy and stabilizing blood sugar and energy instead of the highs and lows that occur with sweets.  It arrived very fast, it was sold out in my local health food store, probably because of the show.<br /><br />What is it like? If you have ever had Starbucks Chocolate Covered Coffee beans, think of no chocolate covering and crush the bean into small, no tiny bits.  I was expecting something the size and uniformity of a mini-chocolate chip. But these are little tiny irregular shaped pieces of what looks like crushed or milled cocoa beans.<br /><br />Mouth feel and crunch, very crunchy which is satisfying, takes a lot of chewing and it has a natural slight oiliness, reminds me of nuts in that way.<br /><br />I like it and I am not a chocolate person. it seems to help with my cravings and full of antioxidants.  Give it a try. just by one bag first though. I suspect you'll either love it or ..... not love it!  LOL

review/summary: Have to know how to use them
review/text: When I first got these, I tasted them out of the bag and found them so horribly bitter.  People that say they eat these out of the bag are crazy!<br /><br />However, once you put them in something sweetened, like yogurt or candies or cookie dough, etc....you will never go back to "chocolate chips" again.<br /><br />These look like little pieces of the cacao pod.  They are crunchy.  And they STAY crunchy when you mix them in foods.  I haven't cooked them yet, but I have mixed them in with my peanut butter, coconut oil, coconut shreds refrigerator candy and they give them a little crunch!  As long as your recipe is slightly sweetened, you will love these.<br /><br />I actually didn't use mine for almost a year as I was put off by the taste.  Now that I figured out how to use them, I will put them in anything sweet I make!  Love them.  They keep forever just about also.  Don't need to be refrigerated, but I had mine in the freezer since I wasn't using them at first.

review/summary: An excellent addition to your diet.
review/text: As has been noted before, if you arent familiar with Cacao Nibs, dont expect them to be sweet. They aren't sweet at all and are actually somewhat bitter...which is what they are supposed to be. They do carry a peculiar scent due to the natural fermentation. Anyway, that is the bare bones basics of your good old fashioned nibs, and these fit that description. I do enjoy the flavor of them by themselves, but mostly, i use these for a few different things: homemade trail mix, smoothies, sprinkled on waffles, and on rare occasions, i use them for mole and other savory dishes. They are a natural powerhouse when it comes to cancer fighting agents and necessary nutrients.<br />So, why by this brand? Well, they are certified organic, are rinsed with purified water, and basically, every care is made to send them to you the way they should be....good, clean, healthy. Also, the subscribe and save price really surpasses pretty much everybody else's pricing, and especially if you would normally buy these at Whole Foods, Sunflower, or any other organic minded store, you will pay much less here. Solid packaging as well.<br /><br />So, a winner for sure, and in my opinion, a must have for any diet, and especially for vegetarian and vegan diets.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Tastes Pretty Good
review/text: I want to begin by saying that I'm no Cacao expert; this is the first time I've tried it. I wanted to try it for three reasons: 1)Honestly, a trusted friend suggested it, 2)I'm always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day (I'm on the go constantly), 3)Cacao's "supposed" health benefits (I'm not saying it does or does not have them...just alluding to the fact that I'm no health/nutritional expert). So, here's what I think. These are going to be an acquired taste (like beer). Actually, they very much remind me of a red wine (a burgundy, maybe)...the bag even smells like wine when you open it up. They are very tiny pieces. They are very crunchy (if you have teeth that are very sensitive I'd think twice about getting these). Upon tasting them: on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine, then slightly bitter, and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder...then swallow (you are going to want something to rinse it down...it's a little grainy at that point). I like the texture and I like the taste (but then again, I like wine). I have mixed it into yogurt and I find it rather good...you get less of the wine/bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors. I use honey flavored Greek yogurt. I also eat them plain as little nibbles...they don't bother me that way either (a little "wake-me-up"). If the flavor really offends you, but you want the health benefits, you can order Organic Sugar Cacao Nibs (do an internet search), they are tossed with organic cane syrup (I will try those for a treat soon). That's all I got! Cheers.

review/summary: Smells and tastes soured!
review/text: They definitely have a very "fermented" or soured smell that made my nose burn when I opened it. They taste just as bad as they smell. I hadn't used cacao nibs before, so I figured this was just what they were like. Not the case! I went to Nuts.com to purchase some items for a trail mix and saw they had a sample pack of their own Cacao nibs for $2.50 (not sure on size, but it's lasted me awhile; I want to say the package holds about 4 oz). I ordered them with everything else and they are HEAVEN compared to the Navitas. They smell fresh, they taste fresh, and I've been using them in just about everything (about done with the sample pack, sadly!). They are also CHEAPER!! $12.99/lb. I haven't touched the Navitas since and actually just tossed the entire bag (sad to waste the money) out.

review/summary: Not What I Thought They'd Be
review/text: I've had raw cacao before, in recipes, but never by itself, really. I knew it was slightly bitter and acidic in the stomach, but I'd never really thought about it as a snack. Because of the name, 'nibs', I was expecting something more along the lines of a 'snack', so I expected these to have some flavor other than bitter. These are SUPER bitter. You do NOT want to put a handful in your mouth and chomp down on them. But we heard the had some amazing healthful properties, so we got the bag and started looking at how to use these nibs.<br /><br />First, if you put just one on the tip of your tongue and literally just 'nibble' on the 'nib', it's quite good. It's similar in a way to sucking on coffee beans, if you've ever done that, only not as much 'juice' from it.<br /><br />Secondly, these are perfect for grinding up into a powder with some raw sugar (our your favorite natural sweetener) and adding this into hot drinks, like chai teas, or cold drinks like shakes or smoothies. Great breakfast item to help kickstart a day with some natural caffeine type of boost. These are fantastic to add into the hot liquid of a tea directly, or if you use a loose tea in a teaball, you can add a pinch of these to the teaball and steep or brew it.<br /><br />Thirdly, these are not bad sprinkled on salads or other dishes where the other flavors will overpower the bitterness some, and they provide a healthy, boosting, crunch to the food. Baked potatoes, salads, dressings, etc.<br /><br />If you use them in this way, you get some great antioxidants and a little bit of a pick-me-up, without the bitterness and acidity you get from eating them by themselves. The bag says a service size is one ounce, so the bag contains eight services, but honestly, you won't want to eat an ounce of these at one sitting- that's a LOT of these little nibs. You'll use a little spoonful in most things, so this 'little' bag is going to last a long, long time.<br /><br />They are worth trying if you like more savory things, love teas that are spicy and heady, and want to boost your diet in a healthy, natural way. For what they are, this brand and product was quality.

review/text: If you're expecting a crunchy chocolatey treat, don't buy these!  But, if you'd enjoy brown bits with an intensely pungent vinegar odor, these may be just the ticket.  Unlike other chocolate nibs I've eaten, these, upon opening the package, greet you with an olfactory assault suggesting ascetic acid was used in their processing.  There was only the slightest hint of chocolate discernible on the palate. Perhaps this was just a bad lot (240111) given the other positive reviews.

review/summary: Inconsistent
review/text: I tried cocoa nibs during a recent chocolate tasting I attended so I expected the unsweetened, bitter quality of the nibs (taste). These, however, are a disappointment. The pieces are not consistent in flavor or texture from piece to piece (and the pieces are small). Some pieces have a vinegar-like undertone to the taste while others have the cocoa quality I expect. There seems to be a lot of shell fragments so I will need to re-process the pieces before using them in cookies. While the package says they are recommended for cookies, I wouldn't dare put these into a cookie dough without processing and close inspection. I received 2 shipments (one of which was the nibs) and then found a bug under the boxes so I can't tell where it originated (yuck). I thoroughly examined one package (I purchased 2) and found no critters so I plan to use them even though it means extra work for me. I don't suggest these for bakers.

review/summary: I am buying more, but they take some getting used to.
review/text: So first, let me say that I am eating these because of their health properties as a "super food".<br /><br />About the food:<br /><br />1) it stinks, the inside of the beg smells like a sweaty sock because of the fermenting. Not much you can do about this. I put mine out in a bowl and let them sit out for a day to air out, it seemed to help some, and then I put them back in the bag.<br /><br />2) they taste REALLY bitter. If like dark chocolate, but these were bitter for even myself<br /><br />3) The crunchy texture is awesome though! And it's healthy!<br /><br />I found the best way for me to eat this, is to mix them into some healthy yogurt. I get a large fistful and mix it into a cup of yogurt once every day as a snack. The crunchy texture compliment the yogurt, and the sweetness of the yogurt offsets the bitterness of the nibs.<br /><br />Now that I figured out how to eat these easily, I can do it daily. I just finished my first bag, so I am going to buy some more.

review/text: These were wonderful. Because of the reviews I decided to get 3 brands and compare. No connoisseur, however, you still know what is good and what is not. I found these to be tasty, crunchy and fresh with a very nice flavor. I did not find any significant difference between the 3, to tell the truth. They were all organic and raw and to me, they were comparable. None of the 3 stood out as being that much better or worse then the others.  I would buy again, these were shipped fast, as described, great tasting and I just love finding new ways to use them.

review/summary: very bitter
review/text: I'm sure that maybe they're meant to be so bitter - but to me they're inedible because of such a bitter vinegar-like taste and smell. The smell does dissapate eventually and isn't too bad but they stay bitter so you need to add them to sweet things, and since I stay away from sugar I rarely have those types of things around. I imagine they'd be good in yogurt and muffins, stuff like that.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is my favorite energy drink. It is sweetened with sucralose (Splenda). It is akin to drinking an orange soda but contains caffeine. I like to sip two cans per day just because I get the satisfaction of drinking a soda and it replaces my morning cup of coffee when it's hot out.<br /><br />I find these at my local Fred's store for $1 per can. Even in the picture above, the can says, "$1.09" yet this seller is selling each can for $2.49 plus over $9 shipping -- FOR ONE CAN!<br /><br />The reason that I chose to give this drink 4 stars instead of 5 has to do with the actual can. Like all Rip It energy drinks (in the 16-fl can), the aluminum is VERY thin. It seems that the slightest bump anywhere on the can will cause the can to rupture in that spot and spray drink everywhere. On two separate occasions (out of two occasions) that I have bought these at my local Fred's store, I've had at least one can rupture. The manager of the store said she was carrying some and five cans ruptured on her.<br /><br />Each 16-fl oz can is 2 servings. I do not get shaky when drinking two cans within a 6-hour period but I stay alert for about 12 hours. (This is great for doing school work!). If I drink two cups of black coffee, I get the shakes so these energy drinks (at least for me) are not that strong.

review/text: These are good quality pumpkin seeds. Virtually all of the seeds are whole seeds (vs. some companies where the seeds are broken and cracked). I have no complaint about the seed quality, but the shipping costs from this seller are high even if you order a number of items together. Ordering just one or two items is out of the question because shipping costs are so high. On the plus side, the costs for many of their items are very low, so it can cancel out the high shipping. Be aware that if you order more than one item at a time in the same order, shipping is reduced on a per item basis, so take that into consideration when you see over $10 shipping for a couple tiny items!

So many, and I could have offered them to my nut-less friends and to the under-nutted strangers who passed me by with a hunger in their eyes...But they are all gone now....snif.

review/text: I prefer shelled & unsalted pistachios, which are harder to find than salted, unshelled pistachios. These are as good as they get, though salt-lovers might should try unsalted pistachios before they actually make a purchase (5 lbs. will last quite a while even if you like them as much as I do). This is no-frills packaging, which is probably why the price per pound is less than store-bought pistachios. The entire 5 lbs. comes double-bagged (in 2 sturdy clear plastic bags cushioned with packing material) inside a plain cardboard shipping box... no fancy packaging, just very good shelled unsalted pistachios (exactly what I ordered).

The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.<br /><br />On the whole, great product.

This would be a weak argument: every time you put stuff in yer body, you want to have some mix of fat/protein/carbs.

review/text: I like buying Paul Newman products because the profits go to his camp for ill children.  And they taste good too. These pretzels fit that bill.  And I believe the price is reasonable, as well.  It's great to eat pretzels that have a good amount of protein in them, unlike the "average" pretzel with just a bunch of carbohydrates.  All my family and friends like them too.  The only little downside, for me, is they taste a bit too salty. However, the rest of my family didn't find them too salty and thought they were just fine. They are low in fat, with 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. I will definitely buy Paul Newman's Organic Pretzels again and again.

The Spelt ones are awesome, with a slightly nutty flavor and just the right amount of salt.  As a person with a digestive condition, the higher fiber content is a wonderful thing.  Since Amazon sells them in bulk, these bags of pretzels are less expensive than in the stores, with normally run $2.19 a bag.  My only complaint to Newman's Own is that the bags are too small at 7 ounces.  Other than that, it's a great product!

review/text: I love Pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds, these are The BEST.<br /><br />The taste great, are REALLY crunchy - a key requirement for me - and have just the right amount of salt. The Newman's Rounds are just as good - maybe even better.<br /><br />And as an added bonus, Paul Newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity - an unbeatable combination in my book!

review/summary: Great Pretzels...and I love pretzels!
review/text: These Pretzels are great!!  I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels.  I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome.  Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!<br /><br />I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt!

review/text: These pretzels are just the best! The whole grain gives them a richer flavor than regualar pretzels and the slightly thicker stick is just the ticket for a crunchier/chewier more full flavor treat. I buy them by the case!

review/summary: Great source of fiber and protein--but TASTES great, too!
review/text: I used to regularly eat pretzels as snacks or part of my lunches for work.  Although I never really followed along with the low carb diet craze, I did become concerned that pretzels weren't providing me with any nutrition other than carbohydrates, so I gradually stopped buying them.<br /><br />Then someone told me about Newman Hi-Protein Pretzels.  Each generous serving size (18 pretzels) is just 120 calories, but you get 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber, with only 1.5 grams fat!  That's better than what you might get from a lot of yogurts that are on the market today.  Furthermore, like all Newman products, these pretzels are made with all-natural ingredients, including what flour,n pea flour, sunflower oil, and salt.  And finally, they taste great!  I truly cannot taste any difference between these pretzels and others--well, if anything, these are better. :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a delicious snack that is nutritious, too, I highly recommend Newman's Hi-Protein Pretzels.

review/summary: Its burned
review/text: I was excited about my high protein pretzels but when i opened and tasted it, it tasted burned. I inspected the rest of the bags in the package and they all look dark brown. I don't know if i just received a bad batch as i also ordered the spelt pretzels from Vitacost ( lower priced; not like here where the price suddenly got jacked up after being featured in Yahoo from $30 to $49!) and it tasted fine, no burnt taste.<br /><br />I am trying to return the package as i don't know what to do with 12 bags of burnt pretzels. But you can only return unopened one ( i already opened one bag) and within 7 days. After paying for the shipping fees and half refund, if ever they accepted the item for refund, its not worth the effort.<br /><br />So if you are still considering buying the Hi-Protein Pretzel, buy at your own risk.

review/text: Been yer basic pretzel rod freak since I was a kid,and these are the best I've come across in years.  Not too salty, just enough, and not the long rods that break and leave crumbs everywhere (like if you're lounging on the couch watching tv, say) - these are shorter rods, the perfect size for a proper crumbless - or near crumbless - pretzel-indulging experience.  They're fairly healthy, too, as far as snacks go.

review/text: These are the best pretzels I've eaten. They taste great. They're crunchy of course, but after chewing them a bit, they have what I can best describe as a very smooth texture that I've never tasted in any other pretzel. The fact that they're organic and made with spelt is a big plus also.

review/text: These are by far my favorite pretzels I've ever had. The taste is mild, which is what I like in a pretzel (that's not chocolate covered), and they're just the right ratio of thickness and size, not like some that are so thick and dry that they stick in your throat, or so thin that you're chewing super-salty air. Plus they're actually a bit healthier than most others. Unfortunately they're also more expensive, but I'm happy to say I always get what I pay for with these.

review/text: I enjoy the Newman's Own Pretzels on a regular basis and decided to start buying them by the case as my local grocery store stopped carrying them.  The first two cases I bought from a different distributor were fine, however in the last case I purchased from Amazon, all the pretzels tasted stale, although the bags weren't out of expiration and didn't appear to be opened.  I was very disappointed with this batch.

review/text: We love Newman's products...but Amazon lists this as 'wheat-free'.  The package ingredients label shows 'contains: Wheat'.  Not a big deal unless you have a wheat allergy...which by the way LOTS of people do.  Just thought I'd save you the hassle since food products aren't eligible for return.  As far as taste, my husband (not a pretzel fan) tried one and gave them a 3 out of 5....  'a little bland...need more salt.'

review/summary: Spelt pretzels with mustard - YUMMY!
review/text: We buy the organic spelt pretzels by Newman's Own. This company sends them fast and so nicely - packed and separated in individual slots so they don't break or pop open. The pretzels themselves are yummy. Lately we've been dipping into different mustard flavors - a great snack! A good variety of non-salted ones mixed with some salty ones, a good balance. They taste better than your average pretzel on the market and they are healthier for you. I recommend the spelt pretzels!

review/summary: Need to know how long they are?  How many in each bag?
review/text: These taste great, and when I got them very few were broken... on average one pretzel per bag was broken.  They are shorter than most pretzel rods, about 4 inches each.  I was making chocolate-dipped pretzels and was trying to figure out how many I could put in each gift bag, so I had my kids count how many there were per Newman's Own 8-Ounce bag.  There are about 40 pretzels per bag.  I ordered two cases trying to make sure I had enough, so hopefully this info will save someone from doing what I did--buying twice as much as needed.  Now we get to eat them.  :0)

review/summary: Mine Also BURNT flavor!
review/text: I purchased the High Protein Pretzels.  I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all.  95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either!  I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!<br />It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out.  I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.<br />Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk....

review/summary: Review for the Hi-Protein variety
review/text: Simply put these are great pretzels. High roasted flavor, though my cousin said it tasted burnt, and proceeded to eat more. Very crunchy without any hint that it is fortified with soy protein. Only issue with the product is that every few bags I get several oddly shaped pretzels which are thicker and crunchier which is actually a plus in my opinion. The best part is that they're both organic AND affordable! My favorite way to eat them is to pair them with a good quality chocolate for a sweet treat.

review/summary: How can a pretzel taste this good?
review/text: A pretzel is a pretzel right?  Wrong.  I was amazed at how these really taste better than any I have had before.  I think these are the best tasting pretzel rods you can get in a supermarket or here on amazon.<br /><br />The malt really makes a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />The diameter is perfect for dipping in mustard or eating plain, not too thin and not too thick.<br /><br />They have an even and sufficient coating of salt.<br /><br />They arrived undamaged and very fresh with high crunch factor, not at all stale.<br /><br />Mine were not burned like others have experienced with their orders.<br /><br />I have 12 bags and am happy to keep a supply in the pantry to put out for guests when they drop by; it makes it very easy to serve good food at a good price by buying in bulk on amazon.

review/summary: Burnt taste and shelf life short or used up
review/text: I was excited about buying these in bulk at the special price Amazon was offering. However, when I received my case of 24 8 oz bags (purchased 2 sets), I was extremely disappointed to see a use by date of 1 month later.  Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.<br /><br />Pretzels last just about forever. Realizing these are organic would allow for a shorter shelf life, but the real issue is that the shelf life was used up before the sale. So, in short, these were essentially a waste of money as I had to coax people to take them away.

Well I found them at Whole Foods, bought a bag - then I ended up ordering a case since I don't live near a WF & I wanted them to be my snack of choice. Anyway, my VERY picky 13 year old daughter really like them.  They really taste like pretzels not like the gluten-free/high protein ones. My only complaint, dare I say it is, they need more salt!  Even sesame seeds would be good they need a little something more.  I don't think I will order a case soon b/c that's a lot of pretzels(!) but am hoping the word gets out and health food stores close to me would start carrying them so I can buy just a bag or two.

Testing good. Up to the Newman standards...and there is this completely illogical belief that having the exact same calories spread over three or four pieces instead of one large pretzel is more satisfying...bonus...

My favorite Newman's Own pretzel however is their Organic Spelt Flour Pretzel. Once you eaten them, no other pretzel compares. Unfortunaly, very few retail outlets carry Newman's Own Organic Spelt Pretzels. The only stores I've been able to find them is at the Whole Foods Grocery Chain. There are not many Whole Foods around, but it worth the trip.

review/text: I love the shape and taste of mini pretzels like these but don't like the flavor of wheat - so this is the perfect solution. Light on salt, baked just to perfection, with the slightly nutty taste of spelt. They don't overpower anything else I'm eating or drinking, very well balanced. Thanks Newmans' Own, another winner!

review/summary: yummy pretzels!
review/text: I bought these for my husband for healthy snacking in the evening,and they are great! High in fiber and protein, but low in calories per serving.  Even my 5 year old (who does not eat anything!)will eat these pretzels.<br />They are crispy, and slightly nutty tasting. I will always have a case on hand.

review/summary: Top notch snack!
review/text: In my search for healthy snacks I found this item: Organic, high in fiber, low in fat and they use sea salt. They sound like they should be boring, but they are just as good if not better than any pretzel out there.<br />I can eat 20 of them for only 2 points on my Weight Watchers program and that is a whole lot more than other snacks. They're very filling with a piece of cheese or two which is extremely important when watching what you are eatting!<br />I highly recommend them to anyone!

review/summary: I've liked every kind that I've tried
review/text: My latest purchase was the Honey Wheat variety, but I've had the Hi-Protein and Spelt varieties in the past.  I have really enjoyed all three of them.<br /><br />The Honey Wheat have a good taste and crunch.  It took me about five pretzels to get used to them as compared to "normal" pretzels, but then I really got into them.  I like the taste, but I also like the ingredients and nutrition.  The following can be found on the web, but I'm adding it here for convenience:<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic whole wheat flour, organic honey, organic sugar, organic sunflower oil, salt, yeast, soda.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts:  Serving Size: 20 pretzels (30g), Calories per Serving: 110, Calories from fat: 10, Total Fat: 1g (saturated fat: 0g), Cholesterol: 0mg, Sodium: 180mg, Total Carbohydrates: 22g (dietary fiber: 3g, sugars: 2g), Protein: 2g<br /><br />Some typical advice - watch for sales on these!  I got the Honey Wheat 7-oz bags, 12-pack for twelve dollars in October 2010 (the price is why I decided to try them).  As of this writing, they are almost sixty dollars.  At a dollar a bag, I'll recommend them to everyone.  At five dollars a bag...all I can say is that I wouldn't pay that much for these, or any pretzel in a 7-oz bag.
