review/summary: Lot of food for a little one
review/text: I got 3 sets of food for my 6 month old to have some variety.  I didn't realize kids are on stage 1 foods for a very brief period so we had to mix these stage 1 foods in with stage 2 and 3 foods to use them. I'm sure these are great if you have multiple children, but for one child, these packs are too large to get more than one, but one box doesn't provide variety...

review/summary: Natural ingredients...no artificial crummy feeling
review/text: I do not enjoy ethnic food. It really is the smell, but if I ever get past it, it is usually the taste that does not agree with me.<br /><br />My wife bought several boxes of these as we needed some frozen meals, but we wanted them to be made from natural ingredients. I reluctantly tried some and I am really hooked. I pour this over moderate amount of rice and it is just delicious.<br /><br />I am still not going to go to ethnic restaurants, but I believe I will be trying out more of Tandoor Chef that only contain natural ingredients.

review/summary: Not your mom's mac & cheese, but will do in a pinch
review/text: The Triple Cheese is the best of the bunch of the Kraft Easy Mac's.  It has more cheese flavor.  I like to add 1/2 can of no-salt-added diced tomatoes to mine.  It doesn't look like much food in the tub, but it is filling and fairly high in protein (7 grams).<br /><br />I keep these in my desk at work and grab one for an easy lunch if I don't feel like going out somewhere. I think it works best if you add the water to just below the line inside the cup.<br /><br />My only complaint is the high sodium content (28%) but most convenience foods are loaded with salt, so it's not much different from anything else I might choose for lunch.

About 30 will fit in the free bulk rate box given out by the USPS used for the military recipients; cost was $10.99 to ship this last fall.  I enjoy them as a snack, also.

review/summary: It's all about the convenience and savings
review/text: I really like the convenience of ordering things online and having them delivered. Partly because I'm lazy, but mostly because I am on oxygen and it's very difficult for me to get around.<br /><br />I like ordering dry food items in "bulk" because they last a long time.<br /><br />These Easy Mac cups are ideal for someone like me. You simply peal off the seal, take out the cheese package, fill the cup with water up to the line, stick it in the microwave for 3 minutes, add the cheese powder + salt/pepper, and you're done.<br /><br />I also like to combine the Easy Mac with other food items when I want more than just a snack. For example, I might make a microwavable dinner and heat up one of these  Easy Mac cups to go along with it.<br /><br />Also of significant importance to me is the price. At my local grocery store, a 4-pack of Triple Cheese Easy Mac was $4.79 last time I checked, which would be $43.11 for 36 from my local grocery store. (Though I have been able to buy them for $1/each in the past.) But in either case, the current price here on amazon of $34.04 is a better deal ... with free shipping to boot.<br /><br />This is a win-win for me. Convenience and savings.

review/summary: Easy Mac Triple Cheese
review/text: My package arrived right on time and everything inside was intact upon opening.  Easy Mac makes a great snack when it's too cold to go out and get food, and it's quick when you're in a rush.  Great for college students in dorms or otherwise.<br /><br />As far as taste/prep goes, the mac and cheese is very good and creamy if you fill water in the tub just a little above the noodles (when I added water to the line I found that it became too watery, but of course it's a matter of personal preference).<br /><br />I would buy this product again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a snack of this type.

review/summary: Boston Tea Finest Grade Loose Raspberry Patch Tea
review/text: Simply put this very delightful tea can be consumed without aid of sugar or cream.  I like it straight up and hot.  It tastes like a fresh raspberry picked from the vine.  This is a high quality loose tea.  I find it especially comforting when I have it to chase away the chill of those cool fall days and nights. The package contains eight ounces of raspberries, apples, cranberries, and hibiscus.  It is naturally caffeine free and delicious. When you brew it, it will be a deep red and is nice and tart.  It is not too tart though and I find it suits my palate perfectly.  This tea will put a smile on your face and warmth in your heart. I highly recommend it. I will come back for more, should Amazon choose to keep selling it. I am very happy with my purchase.

It was my fault as I did not read the product description very carefully as it clearly states "herbal" tea i.e. not real tea!  I tired a couple of pitchers worth and found it not to my taste.  Very "kool aid" flavor. It has intense flavors if you make it strong and if you like that sort of thing. I don't.  I tried mixing it with regular tea, but did not work out well. If you are into herbal stuff this is just the ticket. If not, take a pass. Oh, it is sort of expensive.

For starters, if you are craving something fruity and chewy, this is for you.  I love the sweet, slightly tangy flavor of raspberries in this licorice, as well as the soft texture.  You can easily chew it, and it is very satisfying.  What's more, it is fat free.  So, no guilt here!  Just keep it out of reach, on a high shelf, so you don't consume it all at once!

Why they would put wheat flour in this licorice. I think that contributes to the odd texture. This is the only licorice I've ever eaten with this weird texture. My favorite licorice is Natural Vines strawberry or black licorice which they sell here on Amazon. It is all natural and has no preservatives and no weird texture.

review/summary: Old/new recipes seem indistinguishable to me.
review/text: I love these from the grocery store and was afraid to get them on Amazon after seeing the reviews that they're different or just bad here. My review is a response to those. They do have a more complicated flavor than stuff like Twizzlers, so maybe some people would be disappointed in them if they just want cheapo, sugary licorice. As for whether they're different from the old ones in stores, you can see in the picture that they are labeled "new," and so I guess these were made with a slightly different recipe. The ingredient list is as simple and natural as I remember.<br /><br />Anyway, I finally took a chance on ordering them and found them to be very similar to what I'm used to from the store. Without a side by side taste test, I can't really tell the difference. I can't explain why some of these other folks think they're so different or bad, but don't be afraid to try them and decide for yourself.

review/text: I read some of the other reviews that warned this licorice was gross, but bought it anyways. I've purchased the same item in grocery stores and have loved it- I decided to buy it in bulk from amazon at a substantial discount- big mistake. I finished the last few in my grocery-store box, and opened a box from amazon. The taste difference was substantial. I'm not really sure how to describe it- they're edible, but they're not good- not something you'd want to eat- more something that you have to choke down like medicine. I checked the expiration date, and it says they're good for another year. Fortunately amazon has great customer service and they refunded my order. Learn from my mistake- these may taste great when you buy them from your local store, but the ones from amazon are really gross.

review/summary: New recipe? Not impressed.
review/text: The, I'm assuming "old" recipe, raspberry confection chews used to be one of my favorite candies. I loved them. However, I recently picked up a new box of these raspberry chews and saw that the packaging had been redesigned a little to include the word licorice on the box, but to my dismay, the chews taste different too! They have more of a licorice taste to them, where they didn't before. I'm so bummed! These are still good- soft, chewy, and not too sweet- but the old recipe was definitely better.

review/summary: Panda Candy- I am an Addict
review/text: I love Panda candy. Seriously. I named my kitten Panda after it. I have gone through so many little pink boxes of Raspberry flavored confection it's a bit disturbing.<br />  I like the black too, but too much real black licorice can raise your blood pressure and has other side effects.<br />  Cocoa ones were amazing, but seem to have been discontinued.<br /> So that leaves me with raspberry, not a bad situation to be in.<br /> These chews are fat free. One serving is 130 calories. There is no refined sugar or artificial ingredients. It contains molasses as a sweetener, wheat flour, citric acid and natural flavor.<br />  The texture is soft and chewy, but not lose a filling chewy. It's a much better texture than a Twizzler for example. Not waxy or rubbery at all.<br />  I can see it's not for everyone. I do not agree that it tastes like prunes or apricots. To me it has a sweet barely tart raspberry flavor that tastes like candy, but perhaps more wholesome.<br />  I suggest trying a bar to see if the taste suits you, as opposed to buying 12 boxes!

review/summary: Foul
review/text: My family members have used words like "gross" and "disgusting" to describe these chews and I have to admit that I agree.  We routinely eat natural foods and snacks so I wasn't expecting Twizzlers - but I was expecting a product that tasted like raspberry.  Something about the molasses + fruit gives it a weird twang and a wretched aftertaste that was very much like prune juice.  If you love really dark molasses (like blackstrap) then perhaps you might like these but I am having trouble even giving them away.

review/text: Very good stuff, good texture and consistency. As the other reviewer said, the description is a bit off, but from looking at the box, I figured it was only 3 flavors, not 5. For any American who has never had mochi, imagine a dense dumpling with a sweet paste in it.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the peanut overpowers the mochi, so they all smell and taste slightly of peanut. I would recommend you take it out of the plastic and the container to let them air out. Then just put them into separate bags.<br /><br />Other than that, if you like foreign snacks I would give these a try.

Creamy white chocolate on top with candy cane crunchies mixed into it for a delightful taste that is not overpowering and a dark chocolate on the bottom. If you take a bag of it and chop it up into chunks - use it in your favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe (replace this candy for the chocolate chips) and you have an instant new favorite holiday cookie!

It is the real stuff, and I got a box of strawberry, and my Wife is now much happier than she was before. Not only is this taffy tasty, you get to play with it as well as eat it. Put it in the fridge for a few minutes and smack it on the table, and then eat a few of the small pieces, works for me, I just hope she doesn't tell me she would like to own a 58 vette next.

There is no creamy sensation when eating it, and, it's very soft.  The old one used to be harder so that you had to suck on it for awhile before you could chew it.  This is more like a flatter version of Laffy Taffy.  What a disappointment!

review/summary: Fantastic Basic Sugar Cookie!
review/text: I bake dozens and dozens of cookies throughout the year, with a huge chunk of that happening at Christmastime.  I recently bought--for the first time--a package of the Betty Crocker Sugar Cookie mix.  Well, I discovered a gold mine!  I compared the ease of adding just a couple of ingredients the package mix, to all that I would have to do, to make up a batch of basic sugar cookies, and realized that I was working just too hard!  From there, I made two different recipes from this wonderful mix.  First, for Orange Cookies, I added a heaping tablespoon of orange zest, 1 1/2 tsp. of orange extract, and 1 cup of Rice Crispies.  I then made 1" balls of dough and rolled them in orange-colored sugar.  They turned out just great!  For the next recipe--Coconut Cookies--I added 1 cup of shredded coconut and 1 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract, and--voila!--another fantastic recipe.  Both, of course, were made from the Betty Crocker mix, and I challenge anyone to tell me that they could tell the difference between this mix and "from scratch" cookies.  I'm now thinking of more ways to embellish my new favorite cookie dough.  The possibilities are endless!

Wrong idea though, this soup instead leaves a sweet flavor in your mouth, as opposed to a more serious, earthy, cognac-reduction flavor that I would expect from an authentic french onion soup. This just a sweet onion soup. Leave the french out.

I bought a case on Amazon, and decided to try the french onion soup as well; I love a GOOD french onion soup, but I guess I am a soup snob, I only like it 1 out of every 5 restaurants I try it at. Although again, never had a canned version that was palatable. This soup is fantastic. Easy to have a nice soup at home, without a big fuss. I add croutons and mozzerella to the top before microwaving.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These are awesomely delicious!  I found them in individual packs in a local health food store, and as with any food item, recommend trying them out before buying a pack of four.  The cookie part is a bit crunchier than what you'd expect from something resembling a fig bar, but I wouldn't describe it as dry.  The filling is great if you're a fan of berries (I am) and there's more of it than one might expect.<br /><br />Notably, there are some gluten free breakfast bars that have soft exteriors, but really skimp on the fruit filling.  These are basically the opposite of that and all the better for it.  I love them :D

review/summary: confused
review/text: I regularly get the Starbucks coffee syrups for my lattes because they are easy to get and have great flavor. I hoped to buy the pumpkin spice syrup from Starbucks however they are not sold at any store.  So I found this after reading the reviews i was hopeful as one person tried the pumpkin spice and said it was horrible then they tried this one and enjoyed it.  I was excited to bring in the fall with a pumpkin latte this morning.  However i was surprised. my wife warned me that it was bitter and did not taste good.  I didn't believe her and made a latte following the instructions on the bottle which is nice. 2 pumps (it suggested 1.5) and I didn't taste much just some bitterness. so i doubled it and put in 4 pumps. it tasted nothing like pumpkin pie that i have made or bought in a store it was bitter and had a spice flavor to it.  it also tasted nothing like the Starbucks pumpkin latte i have had in the past, i tried drinking it to see if it got better but i could not do it. so i tried the syrup by itself and it was gross! bitter and nothing like pumpkin pie.  not sure if i got a bad batch or if this product just is horrible.<br /><br />Edited update.<br /><br />I just got off the phone with Amoretti and remade myself a latte with some new information.... First the Starbucks syrup that i use has 19 grams of sugar in every pump Amoretti has 4 grams.  This is significant if you have a sweet tooth and if you try to watch the calories.  In the 4 pumps of Starbucks syrup for my latte I am getting 76 grams of sugar with Amoretti i got 16 grams of sugar.  If you have a sweet tooth like me that makes a huge difference. Second the syrup is more of a syrup than sugar water like Starbucks so it is full of flavors.  When I put 4 pumps because it wasn't sweet it did make it bitter because i put in way to many spices.  so when i remade my latte (total 16 ounces) I put in 2 pumps, 1 at first and didn't taste anything so i added another one, with some agave nectar for my sweet tooth.  When i tried it there is no bitterness just pumpkin pie flavor that i can taste :)  So lesson learned read the directions and don't think every syrup is made the same.  The Amoretti is healthier and full of flavors, to much and it will be bitter, follow the directions around 1 pump for every 8 ounces.  Amoretti had great customer service when they called and explained the difference in the syrup. I assumed it would be like Starbucks and was wrong. Right now i am enjoying a pumpkin latte with the Amoretti pumpkin syrup.  They have a full line of syrups and i look forward to trying the CREMA DI syrups which have a creamer flavor which i like, can't wait for them to arrive.

review/summary: Great alternative to coffee shop pumpkin spice.
review/text: I'm not surprised that my first Amazon review revolves around coffee.<br /><br />I was spending way too much money on chain brand pumpkin spice lattes, so I decided to give this product a try. I received it yesterday, and 4 cups of coffee later I think I'm hooked. Personally, I like that it's not too sweet so I can control how sweet I want it with extra sugar/sweetener. I think, in terms of flavor intensity, 1 pump goes well with 8-10oz of coffee. Add in 1-2 packs of sweetener and it has a very similar taste to coffee shop pumpkin spice.<br /><br />I was torn between this flavor and pumpkin spice, so I'm curious as to the flavor difference between the two. I might get the holiday syrup pack, and if I do, I'll update my review with a comparison.

review/summary: Pumpkin pie!!
review/text: This is a very tasty syrup!  I've recently started making my own espresso drinks at home and decided it was time to start collecting different flavored syrups for the times that I'm looking for a more "specialty" drink.  This Amoretti syrup is quite tasty (if you like pumpkin pie) - it has a very nice pumpkin taste combined with some of the spices that one would expect.  It is quite potent - one pump in a standard 8oz cappuccino/latte (it comes with a pump) and you have a drink that will blow away the Starbucks equivalent (especially when one uses decent/fresh beans, a good grinder, etc).<br /><br />I'm quite happy with my purchase and I highly recommend it for those looking for a unique flavor...

As an added bonus, it actually works much better with soy milk than whatever blend they use, a big plus for those of us who can't drink regular milk.  I'm looking forward to trying other Amoretti flavors!  Thanks guys!

review/summary: Pretty strong and spicy, not sweet at all
review/text: I anticipated receiving this syrup to ring in the fall season we don't really get here in Florida.  I tried it this morning, making a homemade latte with my Tassimo machine and using 2 pumps of the syrup.  My first sip was very spicy and not sweet at all.  I decided to add a bit of stevia to help make it sweeter.  It helped, but it seemed to taste pretty bitter.  I put some whipped cream on top, and then it was easier to drink.  I am unsure if Amoretti's 'Pumpkin Spice' syrup would have tasted better, but the reviews were more favorable to this product.  Will have to keep experimenting and see if I can make it work better...<br /><br />****UPDATE****<br /><br />Received a call from Amoretti after writing this review.  Unusual, I know!  He (Paul) gave me some very helpful information regarding proper use of the syrups and to know that they contain a LOT less sugar (and artificial ingredients) than the other syrups available.  I have done much experimentation and have found a great balance that I love!  The syrup is also delicious on ice cream, vanilla yogurt, and apple pie!  I have tried several other products since, and have to say, they are just as delicious and the quality is unsurpassed!<br />Thanks, Paul, for your superb customer service, and to Amoretti for running a great American company that stands behind their product 100%.  Well done.<br /><br />p.s. I did forget to mention that I got a handwritten note thanking me for being a customer.  Love that.

review/text: Read the reviews and have more of a savory palate so the low sugar and spicy elements had great appeal. Followed the instructions, we make our lattes with a Nespresso machine and did 1.5 pumps into a Grande Starbucks cup (16oz), filling half the cup with soy milk (dairy issue), the 1.5 pumps of the Amoretti syrup, and then two Lungo pours from the Nespresso. So much better than a Starbucks Pumpkin Latte (which we find too sweet, if we're stuck getting one we do only 2 pumps, not the Starbucks standard 4). Subtle pumpkin with spice elements of cinnamon and cardamon. Looking forward to trying their other products. Didn't know they also make olive oils and martini mixes.

review/summary: Lots of spice, not much pumpkin, but wow great customer service
review/text: I agree with other reviews regarding the very high spice levels in this syrup.  I normally like a lot of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, etc but this syrup had too much for me.  The syrup smells like it will have more pumpkin flavor, but that is not delivered in taste.<br /><br />Amended review 10/25/12 : This company is better at customer service than any other consumer food company I have dealt with.  Perhaps it is due to the strong customer orientation in the part of their business selling high end products to bakeries, food service operations and food companies.  I got a call the same day as I filed my original review.  On that call I learned that their syrups are more concentrated so I need to make sure I go easy on the pumps.  Because they are concentrated and less sweet,  they have only 35 calories per serving which is much less than other syrups and makes it easier to use on my greek yogurt.  I also learned they are working on a third version of a pumpkin syrup which says a lot about how responsive they are to consumer feedback.  To make sure I understood they make high quality products, they also sent me some samples of their other lines which were all very tasty.<br /><br />So if you see a product from Amoretti that you are interested in, give it a try.  It is probably very good.  If it turns out the flavor is not to your liking, the company will make it right as they did for me.

I like pumpkin spiced coffees or lattes in the fall, but don't like paying the coffeehouse prices. And frankly, I was tired of the inconsistent flavoring added to my orders -- some would be bitterly spicy or have little pumpkin flavor at all.<br /><br />The Amoretti Premium Syrup solved those problems. By following the instructions for adding to coffee *exactly as written on the bottle*, my coffee beverages taste great. [This was noted in several of the reviews here, which was very helpful.)<br /><br />This is a quality syrup, and the free pump that comes with it is very convenient.

review/summary: $4 Lattes No More!!!
review/text: I refuse to spend $4 regularly for a coffee, but I LOVE the flavors of fall. So, a couple weeks ago, I found myself in need of a pick-me-up and the specialty coffee shop inside my Target had the sign out advertising their Pumpkin Latte. I couldn't resist. It was delicious, but the next day, I wanted another one. I had to look for an alternative! I read the reviews for the Amoretti Pumpkin Pie Syrup and figured I'd give it a try. I love that it doesn't have so much sugar in it. I can use splenda, stevia, or agave and feel like I am making a better choice for my body and for my wallet! I've been having a pumpkin spice coffee every morning, and it makes me happy. When I want to be a bit more decadent, I add in a dollop of cool whip and sprinkle cinnamon on top. Yum!!!

review/summary: Different than chain coffee syrups but a nice flavor boost
review/text: Firstly I am very pleased with the packaging and size of the syrup-it even comes with a pump which really excites me. The actual flavor of they syrup is different than I expected but that is only because I am used to the cloyingly sweet pumpkin syrups of Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks. This syrup says it only has 4gms of sugar per pump THAT IS NOT SWEET AT ALL, and a pump is a lot-I only put about 1/2 a pump in my latte; due to this the syrup comes across as less sweet but the spice adds a nice flavor to the coffee. I like that is has less sugar and if you want more of a pumpkin spice flavor then add more pumps or add a little regular sugar. I would buy again and I can't wait to try all of the flavors.

review/summary: Makes the BEST oatmeal chocolate chip cookies!
review/text: Growing up, my mom always made oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, but at some point, the recipe was lost, and I was never able to replicate them with other recipes I found.  Betty Crocker's oatmeal cookie mix replicates them perfectly, and the secret ingredient in this mix is CINNAMON.  BC's Oatmeal Chocolate Chip mix doesn't have cinnamon in it, so I use this Oatmeal cookie mix instead and add 3/4 cup chocolate chips to it.  They are so good!  My husband, siblings, and parents all devour these cookies.  Amazon's price is the best, better than my local grocery store.<br /><br />** UPDATE **  I thought I'd try making these cookies as bar cookies, rather than scooping and dropping onto a cookie sheet.  I used an 8x8 square Pyrex pan, kept the temperature the same, but baked for 23-25 minutes.  I personally didn't think they were done, too much still like cookie dough in the middle, but my husband liked them and ate the entire pan, without getting sick, I might add.  This is something I just thought those of you might want to know, in case you were thinking of making these as bar cookies.  I'll use a 9x13 pan next time, I think they'd come out great.

review/summary: Better than from scratch
review/text: The first time I had these cookies was at a party in June.  Everyone was raving about them and so I asked the lady who brought them if I could please have her recipe.  That is when she rather sheepishly told me that they were made from a mix.  I am a "from scratch" cook and baker, but I have to tell you I break the rule with this mix.  In fact, I have just removed the last of a double batch from the oven and they are fantastic.  I like to add one cup of chocolate chips and/or butterscotch chips to each batch.  They have a light cinnamon smell and taste.  These cookies are always cakelike and not flat little greasy discs like some cookies.  I make two packages at once and use one stick of margarine and one stick of butter, along with the two eggs and 2 tablespoons of water.  These can be a life saver when the need arises without much warning to take cookies, or a dish to someone.  Fast, easy, inexpensive (great price on Amazon), and best of all, wonderful. Got to go now and eat one of the freshly baked ones and you wouldn't believe how great and homey my house smells.

review/text: I don't get to eat many cookies but when I do I want them to taste great. You just cannot beat cookies fresh out of the oven for the great taste and the aroma. This mix is nice as you quickly add butter, an egg and bake. In less than 20 minutes you have a nice sweet treat to share with family and friends.<br /><br />My grandson loves to come over and bake some cookies for dessert for dinner. Unfortunately many times they don't last long enough to make it to dinner time. Their life span is pretty short. There is just something about eating them while they are still warm that is just irresistible.  Sometimes I like to add raisins to them and just a touch of cinnamon.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is a good name brand and one you can trust for the highest quality. You should buy some and treat the kids and yourself to something special!  I included a photo of the back of the pouch to show the ingredients and the baking instructions for your review.

review/summary: High quality cat food that my cats love!
review/text: I have three cats, one of which has IBS/digestive issues.  My vets recommended that I switch him to a food with the fewest ingredients as possible and that has an unusual protein (like lamb or venison).  I can get both of those with Ziwipeak!  And all three of my cats love it, which was a real surprise to me.  It took some getting used to since the jerky-style pellets are very different from feeding regular dry food.  But my cats adapted relatively quickly.  All three seem to be thriving on it.  I'm very happy to have found this food.

review/text: I have two very picky cats. One has serious food allergy issues, so I've been trying out new foods. My cat with allergies LOVES this food, and it fortunately does not make him sick. The other cat, unfortunately will barely touch this food. He seems to like the smell, but he's really a dry crunchy food addict. The texture of this food is a bit odd. It comes in small flat squares that are dry, but a bit more like jerky than normal dry cat food (not tough like jerky, that's just the closest thing I can compare it to. I suppose you could even compare it to a chopped fruit roll up, made with meat puree instead of fruit). This food wasn't a complete winner for us, but it works for one cat at least.

review/summary: My cats hated this food
review/text: Both of my cats hated this food--they refused to eat it. My male cat will eat almost literally anything (paper, hair, bugs... whatever he can get his paws on) except for this. I'm glad I got the small bag.

review/summary: Something seems to be very dishonest
review/text: After receiving the package I was hoping my three cats would eat it and get healthier. Well none of them would even look at it. Not even hungry stray cats that live outside of my house would even touch it. For the fairness of all consumers that are interested in this product. I will write out the whole sentence that appears on the back of the package and what has been crossed out. "Look for Ziwipeak  'Cuisine' in convenient pouches and easy-tab cans and Ziwipeak treats and supplements at leading natural pet stocklists. The Ziwkpeak 'Cuisine' range is produced in NZMAF-licensed 'PET FOOD' factory &lt;cross out begins> using ingredients derived from animals that have been passed as fit for human consumption in their raw state. &lt;Cross out ends>" I do not care whatever excuse Ziwipeak may present but this non-human grade food is not what I am willing to spend extra money for health of my cats. I have wasted money and I have no way of returning it.
