review/summary: great product!
review/text: I have a 13 year old cat with chronic irritable bowel syndrome.  He recieves steroid shots once a month, but they wear off by the end of the month.  I started giving him pet rescue remedy once a day and he has had only one vomiting episode in the last two weeks and no loose stools.  I am just amazed.  I've used the human version for stress myself for years, but I never thought to use it with him.  I put it on cat treats for him and also in his water.  He loves the treats and wolfs them down, so he doesn't mind the taste at all - great product!

review/summary: It works!
review/text: ...insanely well.<br /><br />I've used it for my small Pomeranian as he was getting adjusted to my his home. It has the ability to make an animal rather catatonic, so you might want to try 2 or 3 drops for a small animal, to see their reaction, before trying full strength. Seems to last around 12 hours. Sometimes more.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Anxious kitty - major improvement
review/text: I adopted a third cat a few months ago.  I had 2 females so decided a male would be the best addition and I had fallen in love with Bam Bam at the adoption center.  Day one, he howled all night long.  I thought it might take a few days for him to adjust but NO!  It took months, every morning between 3 and 4 he would start howling again.  I finally decided to try Pet Rescue Remedy. I'm putting at least a couple of drops in all bowls of food so no matter who eats it, they all get Rescue Remedy.  It's been about 2 weeks and he's now much quieter and in fact I haven't had to boot him out of the room.  He is still using my other cats tail as his toy but I'll work on that next.  Fantastic product even though it's more expensive than gold.

review/summary: Dog with significant separation anxiety
review/text: I purchased this item back in Fall of 2010 for my rescued Parson Terrier. The poor guy hated being left alone. I heard that these drops may work so I purchased them in a hurry.<br />My dog never minded the taste as I would add the drops to his doggie treats. I never saw a significant change in his anxiety levels due to the drops alone. I walked him more, purchased a Thundershirt for him, and had relaxing classical music playing on the radio while I was gone. I think all three factors worked together to calm his nerves. He is much happier and very well adjusted now.

review/summary: Doesn't work for our dog's separation anxiety
review/text: On the upside, it's herbal so I haven't felt bad giving it to him, and he doesn't mind the taste at all (we just drop it on a treat first). On the down side, it hasn't done much (if anything) for our dog's separation anxiety. We've tried it for about two weeks and haven't seen any improvement. We wanted to give it a go first before having to try prescription drugs. He's not upset/anxious/afraid of anything else, so I can't speak for it's effectiveness for any other events/traumatic situations, but for us it just isn't working for separation anxiety. Fortunately, it's perfectly safe for human use, so we'll probably just try the rest of the bottle for ourselves!

review/text: I highly recommend Rescue Remedy! I purchased this product for my friends dog; a 3-yr old, 85 lb, male yellow Lab named Jack. Jack has always been frightened of thunderstorms. He would pant, drool, shed his fur, and tremble. My friend applied 4 drops on a treat and gave it to Jack. Within moments, his mood settled and was calm and peaceful. They've had two thunderstorms since giving Jack the Rescue Remedy, and each time he calms down and seems unbothered by the weather. Jack is a bit groggy the next day, but no other side affects have been noticed.

review/summary: BRAND NEW CAT!!!!!!
review/text: My cat is the most nervous cat I've ever met. Probably because it was just her and I for the first two years of her life. Along come another cat, Boyfriend and a dog. Not to mention, she has a severe case of "stranger-danger". Now, through in a new house. I'm trying to transition her, so took her to the new house just for the weekend to try to adjust her. The hour drive to the new house was nearly unbearable with a screaming cat in the carrier. Day 1 in new house, I swore my cat was going to die for how bad she was hyperventilating and yowling.<br /><br />My boyfriend's mother works in a natural health shop and was quick to recommend Rescue Remedy, saying it has done wonders for her friend's dog and other customers. What was to lose? I ran over there that day and bought a bottle. I gave my cat the four drops straight down the hatch. Yes, she didn't like it, but who likes liquid medicine shoved down the throat. That was in the morning. Later that afternoon, I gave her a second 4-drop dose. By that night, I had a new cat. No yowls, nothing. She simply settled down and was quiet, yet alert. The next morning, I gave her another 4 drops but followed the alternative directions and rubbed the drops into her ears, nose and paws. It's a bit sticky on the fingers afterward, so wash your hands, but was much easier to give her the dose that way than in the mouth. That day, she was the calmest cat. Even when strangers entered the house, she stayed put - first time in three years of having her!!!! As I said before, she has a bad case of stranger-danger. Usually flees and hides under anything. I packed her and her sister up and drove back to the soon-to-be "old" house and the most amazing thing happened - no yowling. Not a peep.<br /><br />The next four days, I just added the drops to her water bowl as recommended. Now, as people come and go through the front door, she stays put... I don't know if it's coincidence but I am totally giving credit to the drops because I've never seen this behavior from her before. It's worth a try! Best part is, it didn't make her "drugged". She was still active, alert and playful - just not a scaredy cat. And it is a lot cheaper than vet drugs!

review/summary: great for humans too, it does not burn
review/text: My pet and I love this stuff.  It works great and does not burn like the human version.  Please, do not use the human version on your pets as it burns like crazy.  It does not burn some people but if it burns me I am afraid it would burn a pet.  The human version cost just a little less so some people give it to their pets and it has too much alcohol for a pet.  Pet version is for pets and human is for some humans unless you are sensitive like me then use the human version or the spray.  It is really good stuff but human version is for humans who are not sensitive and not for pets.

review/text: I have been using my human Rescue Remedy to calm my pets when traveling and most importantly when going to the vet for a check up. I get nervous going to the doctor(hence Rescue Remedy for me) so I can only imagine what an animal goes through. It worked but I knew they didn't enjoy the alcohol taste(I had to hold them down and quickly squirt before letting go. I tasted the pet formula before trying to give it to my cat. I approved and the cat licked it up in no time so I guess she approves it also. A calm cat is a joy for me and for the vet who has to handle the animal.

review/summary: MIRACLE SO FAR....
review/text: I have 3 very spoiled little dogs, all long-haired breeds, which include 2 very schiz-ee Havanese.  My youngest Havanese has hated, HATED, grooming since she was a puppy.  She sees a brush and she hides and trembles in fear. I mean, grooming positively terrorizes this little dog and it is so sad. She shrieks like she's being axed and her heart goes a million beats a minute. I've always given them their baths and haircuts, but a friend recently started a grooming business, so I thought I would "help" her by bringing my dogs to her.  It has been a harrowing experience for them and for her.  The Shih Tzu mix was halfway decent, but was constantly biting at the clippers.  The two Havanese have been pretty bad. In fact, after doing them...I think my groomer friend needs the Rescue.. but I digress.  We tried this product on the "least bad" Havanese when she went in a few weeks ago and my groomer called and crowed about how wonderful she was.  Today the clipper-biting Shih Tzu mix went in. We tried the product on him for the first time and when my husband picked him up she said he was excellent, and never tried to bite the clippers even once!  If this product works on the other Havanese when she goes next week, I think I'm going to order 50 bottles! Last time she had 2 muzzles on her and still managed to bite my groomer friend.  Stay tuned!

After a trip to the vet to deal with a nasty bite, I started using Bach's drops. He is a different cat after the drops! If I didn't witness the transformation, it would be hard to believe. Wilbur just calms down and chills. He plays nicer, and stops going after other males! This is huge. He is still learning how to socialize, but with the help of these drops, he's making great strides. I whole heartedly recommend these drops. They calm jangled nerves in cats, just as they claim.

review/text: One of my cats weft through a negative personality change, so my vet put him on medication as well as recommended this product.  I have a pet fountain, not a water bowl, and I had used the human variety of Rescue Remedy in my pets' fountain before buying this one.  The human formulation caused no problems.  However, when I switched to the pet formulation, the results were disgusting.  I had cleaned the fountain thoroughly, motor and all, as well as placing a new filter inside it when I made the change between the two formulations: after a week I noticed what looked at first like some type of dirt around the rim, so I took it apart to clean it.  Once I took it apart it looked like it had never been cleaned! The filter was obviously new, but COVERED BY MOLD!  There was mold everywhere!  When I took the motor apart again, it looked like it had never been done!  EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE FOUNTAIN WAS FULL OF MOLD TO SOME DEGREE!  IT MAKES ME ILL TO THINK THAT MY PETS WERE DRINKING FROM IT IN THAT CONDITION!  IF YOU HAVE A PET FOUNTAIN, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT: USE THE HUMAN VARIETY!!

You should soak them for a couple of hours at most.<br />That didn't work either.  I called again, got another person, a lady, who said soak them no more than 45 minutes.  That didn't work either.

review/summary: the best crackers ever!
review/text: These crackers are a wonderful compliment to wine and cheese.  Subtle flavor enhances, doesn't overpower, the main course.  I also love them if I'm not feeling well and need something subtle but filling to soothe my stomach.  Unbeatable price here.

review/text: I love Bremner Wafers, but the crackers in these boxes are stale and rancid tasting.  Unfortunately I didn't open the first box until it was too late to return them. I had checked the sell by date when they arrived last month, and they are supposed to be OK until September of this year, BUT they aren't.  Very, very disappointing.

review/summary: Great stuff (if you need it)
review/text: I don't understand the bad reviews here... if you need this, you'll know it. And it does work. This is only for allergies, if your child doesn't actually need it, you're obviously better served with more tradition formulas (and breast milk :)<br /><br />First try the regular nutrimigen or other hypoallergenic forumulas, then this. We went down the progression and actually saw the symptoms go away. Less random crying and then skin cleared up. It takes some time for it to work just because the allergens in the body from other formulas (or from breastmilk if the mother is eating something child is allergic to) take time to go away. For dairy allergies it can be up to a couple weeks, so really give it some time to work if you think this might be the issue.<br /><br />We did this without recommendation from a doctor, keep in mind that some cases may be beyond the specific expertise of the doctor and you need to do your own troubleshooting to keep your child happy and healthy. We also got confirmation that it worked because I temporarily tried to used regular Enfamil Nutrimigen (which was available from the store locally) while waiting on a shipment of Nutrimigen AA (that I didn't re-order in time). The symptons re-appeared and then went away again when back to the AA.

review/summary: Don't use it unless you absolutely must!
review/text: We got a sample can of AA formula from the doctor after our little one supposedly had mild indications of possible cow protein allergy.<br /><br /> The formula is highly synthetic, looks very white and very fine power. The taste is very bitter. The baby ate it OK, and was less gassy and better behaved. So the allergy concerns were probably addressed (if he had the allergy in the first place!), with some downside. Unlike most other formulas, this formula is not filling for the baby, he did not feel sleepy at all after eating a decent amount of it.<br /><br /> After the can was finished, we switched to Similac Alimentum (also hypo-allergenic), which is quite a bit cheaper per gram than AA. Alimentum is more similar to other formulas, tastes bitter-sweet, and fills him up nicely. He is liking it more, and guzzles down with more pleasure than AA.<br /><br /> To conclude, don't go with AA unless you absolutely must go it and cannot use something like Alimentum. Not sure why the doctor did not recommend cheaper Alimentum in the first place, was there some sort of promotion involved on their part? ...

review/summary: the product is good
review/text: I did not buy our formula from amazon. I bought it from enfamil.com. I thought it was good formula though. Our daughter was sensitive to dairy, soy, and goat's milk proteins so we had to feed her this until she was 18 months old and could drink rice milk. She finally started gaining weight on this formula and did really well. it does taste and smell horrible to me, but she never made a face when switching on to this formula and seemed to always really like it. She was always asking for more milk, anyway.

review/summary: Item's a "5" -- pricing is "1"
review/text: I buy this 2.5 oz size at a large local supermarket for 76-cents each -- that's the price for either the chicken & broth or turkey & broth. So I suspect there's an error in charging c. $30 for only a dozen jars!<br /><br />The product, however, is excellent -- far superior to Gerbers, which includes cornstarch along with chicken and water (and costs more too -- between $.97-.99/jar). Why would anyone put cornstarch in baby food? Makes no sense. Both firms provide the same amount of protein but Beechnut uses only chicken and broth (from water), no fattening cornstarch.<br /><br />I use the food for my cat, btw, not a baby. Twice a day, I mix a T.  with Green Magma and Solid Gold Seameal. It's a super-healthy combo for an older cat. He seems to prefer the Beechnut as he cleans up the plate better. There's also less waste from the jar because every bit comes out cleanly (with Gerbers, the cornstarch makes it "gooey" and there's always some left behind).

Just wish they sold it by a big bag at a lower cost per unit weight, expensive for 8 cats. I have bought some alternatives that most of them reasonable like, but they know the difference between the real stuff, and the 2nd te alternative, and a few of them turn their nose up at any alternative treat.  But nobody turns their nose up at this item.

review/summary: Cats are ADDICTED
review/text: When I first got my two cats, now ages 2 and 3, I was being a "responsible pet owner" and only feeding them all-natural treats. After about a month, they started turning their nose up at the treats. I thought it might be because they were a little stale. I bought a new pack of the all-natural treats and my cats still only ate them once before becoming disinterested at the prospect of "treat time". At $5 a bag, the "healthy" treats weren't worth the price with my cats refusing to eat them. So, I bought two bags of Whisker Lickin's treats, one crunchy, one soft. They are the cheapest treats on the market, so it wasn't a huge dent in my wallet if my cats didn't like them. My cats refused to eat the soft treats, but inhaled the Crunch Lovers Tuna treats. Now, one shake of the canister and they come running. They are constantly begging for treats and I've been able to teach them a few tricks because they'll do anything just to have another morsel.<br /><br />I highly reccommend these treats! I mentioned them to one of my friends who claimed her cat was super picky about treats and refused to eat any she bought. Now he also comes running when he hears the treats rattling in the canister. They might not be "healthy", but they're treats. Are they really supposed to be?

review/text: I have three cats who are addicted to these treats, and think I do not love them if I run-out.  I have tried other treats, I have even made treats from scratch....but they snub their noses at them and give me disappointed  faces and grumbles.  It likely is not the best thing for them, but I like that these treats are crunchy and lower-calorie then others I have compared to.  These treats run $3.50-$4:00 a bag in stores, so I was glad to discover that they can be purchased in a case from amazon with lower cost per unit.  Bulk-ordering also means I am less-likely to run-out........ and get furry guilt-trips parked in front of my computer monitor while I try to work.

review/summary: Kitty Crack Indeed
review/text: I'm almost a little worried about how much my cat loves these treats.  He can't open the container, but daily he leads me to the pantry and places his paw directly on the container while staring at me wistfully and mewing softly (but insistently).  He just can't get enough of them and when he's done eating them from my hand he'll lick it clean.  Whatever Purina put in these, they did it right.  We used to get him greenies, which he relished, but he just loves these so much much I can't imagine switching back.  If you want a happy cat, you want these in your home, no way around it.

review/summary: Need a Tuna Treat Twelve-Step Program
review/text: My cats have eaten and preferred this treat to the exclusion of all other dry treats for many years.  This comment encompasses several cats of differing breeds and applies only to the Tuna flavor.  They have been addicted to them, and have manipulated me into keep them coming. I am a Tuna Treat codependent!  Recently, my grocery store stopped stocking this flavor, and I panicked.  Later, I was relieved to find that I could get it delivered in bulk regularly from Amazon.  Problem solved, and enabling facilitated.<br /><br />If you are game, try these treats on your cats.  I bet they'll like them -- REALLY like them.  Besides, they help with dental tartar.

review/text: I've tried lots of different types of cat treats, but so far they love these the best. They are also hard, crunchy treats, so supposedly they also help with tarter control, though I'm not convinced they actually do. Also, the ingredients aren't exactly the healthiest, so these should be used as treats between healthy meals, not as primary food. Still, my cats absolutely love these treats, and a few here and there won't hurt them.

review/summary: My cat LOVES these!
review/text: I suppose what makes a cat a cat is that it is finicky. That said, my cat loves these treats. I have read reviews where an owner states their cat hates them. I would suggest that you buy one can at a local store first before you buy a case and see your own pet's reaction. The " Subscribe and Save" option makes this even more of a deal as just when I am running out, another shipment arrives. My cat greets me at the door and expects a couple of these every day!

review/text: Just as the other Buffy, the New Buffy enjoys these tasty treats throughout the day. Buying in bulk makes sense, it saves money, time and effort. I would buy these treats at Target but often they would only have to units available. Purchasing in bulk ensure my Buffy will have plenty of product with little chance of running out.

review/text: I have three cats and every day before I leave for work in the morning I yell "treats" and my three butterballs come running.  Not all treats are created equal, but my fussy eater cat likes these treats.<br /><br />This is a really good price for these treats; the three cats consume 1 ounce per week so the seven pack of 6.5 ounce will last me 6-8 months.  Expiration date is some time in 2012 but they will be comsumed by then.<br /><br />While I feed my cats high quality cat food, they hate the healthy treats and I have given up and just buy these treats.<br /><br />For treats, these are as good as any other I've tried and all of my cats seem to like them.

review/text: My cat loves these!  All I have to say is "treat" and he runs to the pantry.  I used to pick these up at a local store but they were often out.  So it's great getting them in a pack of 10.  The pieces are large enough that he doesn't really swallow them whole (some other treats he doesn't seem to chew - little piggy).  He chews these, getting the benefits of cleaning his teeth (I hope).

review/text: All I have to do is say the word "treat" and my cats jump over each other to get to this treat. It is the only treat they have ever liked.  However, the additional benefit that others have not mentioned is that it helps to keep your cats' teeth clean.  One of my cats was prone to building up plaque-- not a problem since she started having these treats twice daily.  Thanks Amazon for making these treats available and affordable. For some reason, they can be hard to find in the stores, and they are much more expensive when purchased that way.

So please do not be fooled by those 5 star reviews, its obvious that those people are ignorant, companies like Purina, Science Diet, whiskas don't care about our animals but their pockets. If you love your pet, feed him/her with the right stuff, they don't need stuff that has corn in it. Also make sure there are no artificial colors or flavors. And make sure there is no BHA and BHT used preservatives. These preservatives have been shown to cause cancer in both cats and dogs. Bad Bad stuff and it's in almost every cat treat on the market.

review/text: This kit has everything you need to make Okonomiyaki, except for the Mayonaise, bacon(optional), and sauce. Well, also obviously, you need to provide the wet ingredients and fresh ingredients, eggs, water, cabbage, etc.. One kit makes two servings, but if you order this, you get 3 kits. So you can make 6 servings with this particular order.<br /><br />I recommend getting the Kewpie Mayonaise and the Okonomi sauce. The sauce is availible from this merchant. You can get Kewpie at your local asian food market, or here on Amazon.<br /><br />The kit comes with the nori flakes and bonito flakes, you will use to garnish your Okonomiyaki after it is done.<br /><br />There are instructions inside, not using our measuring system, but you have the internet, I'm sure you can figure it out for yourself.

review/text: This made for very tasty okonomiyaki each time I used it.  The process is actually very simple and you don't need any specialty pans.  You do have to provide the wet ingredients as the previous reviewer stated, but that is simple enough and they are all readily found probably in your own house.  I agree about procuring some okonomi sauce, but if you are lucky you will be able to find some in an asian market to avoid the shipping fees.  You can also find good recipes for okonomi sauces online that taste just great.  The mayonnaise is a nice touch, but not absolutely necessary if you cannot find it.  I was unable to find a suitable okonomiyaki dry ingredients kit, but was able to find the sauces very easily.<br /><br />This can be a great way to share a "culture night" with your family, or a fun way to connect with a child who maybe has an anime obsession.  Believe me, they'll love telling their equally obsessed friends that they had okonomiyaki with their family over the weekend!  And the toppings are a great way to let everyone individualize their own foods!  We've used bacon, shrimp, shiitake mushrooms and even tried eel as a topping once!  It was alot of fun so enjoy yourself.

review/text: I found this honey when I visited Tasmania five years ago. Leatherwood honey is not made anywhere else in the world and it is a shame because it's not easy to find but so worth the search. I now buy it in the 2Kg can because I go through it so fast that the largest tin available is what I need. I use it in tea and oatmeal, biscuits and toast. You won't be able to go back to just regular honey again. It really has a distinct taste that whenever I give it to someone- they are hooked too. Love it!

review/summary: SO disappointed -- not at all what I was expecting
review/text: The television commercials for Pepperidge Farm's MILANO MELTS cookies really worked -- I couldn't wait to buy a bag! I'm a big fan of the original Milano cookies -- the cookies themselves are light, crispy, and perfectly paired with rich dark chocolate. So what could go wrong with Milano cookies filled with dark, sumptuous chocolate creme?<br /><br />Well, MILANO MELTS are disappointing. First, the cookie itself: It's sort of a "double-thick" Milano cookie, which means it lacks the lightness and the delicate crispness of the original Milanos. It's very hard around the edges, and the texture seems dense and unappetizing. Then, there's the "dark chocolate creme": It just lacks the flavor of the chocolate on the original Milanos. Additionally, there's nowhere as much creme as you see in the TV commercials (or pictured on the package). The creme is mostly located in one half of the cookie -- I took my first bite and wondered, "where is the creme?" All I saw was a thin line of chocolate, which was tasteless buried inside that thick cookie. There was more creme on the other side of the cookie, but it was nothing like what I was expecting.<br /><br />These are simply not as good as the original Milano cookies (which are wonderful). This is an interesting-sounding idea that just didn't pan out. Stick to the original Milanos -- they will not disappoint.

review/summary: seriously limit how many of these you eat.....
review/text: Sweet apricot kernels are used in cooking; apricot kernel oil is prepared in a way that changes it's original elements. BUT apricots, like other fruit seeds, contains a small amount of cyanide. Eating too many will probably make you sick. I didn't realize apple seeds had arsenic in them - and used to eat the seeds all the time. I then read an article about a guy who loved them so much, that he saved a bag of them and after eating, well, let's just say it was his last supper.<br /><br />Do some research before you eat these just like a bag of nuts. The bitter kind, in limited quantities, with special doctors, is used to fight cancer. That has more cyanide in it. Different processes destroy some of the chemicals.<br /><br />It's better to just really limit your intact of apricot kernals. If the producer of this product would like to explain how safe it is, please help us understand. My research has shown that it could be dangerous to eat too many. How much is too many? I think more than a few.<br /><br />dsl

My girlfriend had ordered some kernels from another company but was very disappointed in the quality and taste so she asked me yesterday to order her 6 bags from Home Naturals.<br />A word of caution... don't eat too many in one sitting. You'll be making several trips to the bathroom. HA! They make for a good colon cleanser.

review/summary: Sesame Seeds
review/text: I was happy to find that Amazon had sesame seeds, which are not easly found in my remote part of Texas. I bought three orders, they were reasonanably priced and came in 5 days. I planned to freeze the bags to use throughout the year. I was disappointed to find worms and webs in several of the packages. so I called to see about returning these contaminated ones and send them back. You replaced the six or so bags and they came quickly but three of those also contained worms. (this is not unusual, seeds do get worms and weavels) So this time, I just dumped the bad bags out for the wild turkeys to enjoy. I am still happy with the service Amazon provided and the attempt to take care of the problem. I have enough good seeds to last several months and am happy to have found a source. Thanks, Rita
