review/summary: Addictive and tasty but seeking a purer product with less packaging
review/text: First of all, these are addictive and exactly what I was looking for in a fruit 'strip' type of product.<br /><br />There is too much packaging for this product.  I purchase for the best price, especially when a product has many different packaging options (like this, 6 boxes of individual fruit strips).  This is the best deal per oz at the time of purchase, but I wish I could get something that was less wasteful.  Wouldn't be such a big deal but they seem to be promoting themselves as a 'natural' or sustainable product.<br /><br />Another issue is like others have mentioned that these are not fully strawberry. Strawberry is the third and fourth ingredient after apple puree and pear puree (similar to other products).<br /><br />Still, they are very tasty.  I want to give this 5 stars but because of the 2 issues mentioned, I have to deduct 1 star.

review/text: I've had several different kinds of banana nut coffee, have LOVED them all and was SO excited to get this 4 pack of coffee beans!!  Complete and utter disappointment.  This tasted like fingernail polish smells.  It's not the coffee machine, I recently got a DeLonghi and everything is wonderful made in it.  EXCEPT THIS COFFEE BEAN.  Now I have 3 full, unopened packages of horrible coffee beans and I can't return them!  This makes me extremely unhappy.

review/summary: Competent roast
review/text: I am not generally favorably disposed towards dark roasts. Note that this one, despite saying "extra dark roast", is not QUITE as dark as Starbucks or Kicking Horse Cliffhanger (both of which I absolutely despise). Therein lies its salvation - it's just... "dark". For some roasters, extra-dark is barely more than medium; for others, medium is actually extra-extra-extra-extra-extra-ridiculously-vile-dark. They are not just dark, they are burnt to a crisp. This Community Coffee is a nice bean, enjoyable dark espresso. For those who like dark, I suspect this will rate very, very highly. I won't make another order only because I'm looking for something a bit more comparable to Illy Medium (but for a better price!).<br /><br />Also, this coffee is a little dry and does not produce a very good crema. So I'm not deducting 1 star solely due to my personal preference, but rather for the 'finish' of the shot.<br /><br />I'm using a Rancilio Rocky grinder and an Isomac Venus with a triple-shot basket, single-spout portafilter. I grind the espresso barely large enough so that I don't end up with a ton of grinds in the brew - but some is inevitable. For this one, a setting of 31-32 does the trick.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I used to live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and learned from my relatives to brew and enjoy Community Coffee, preparing it in my little white porcelain beggin just like my grandmother and aunts.  I make my own blend of coffee beans and was so pleased to see that Amazon was now selling Community Coffee.  It is as good as I remember if being, particularly since I like a very strong, rich flavor.  I'm now using their Sumatran, French Roast, Expresso and Columbian to make my blends and am very happy with the results.  So are my relatives and friends who ask to use my blends themselves.<br /><br />Great coffee from the land of strong coffee lovers.  I'm moving on to chicory laced coffee now as Community carries it.  Personally, I like this brand much better than other Louisiana coffees.

review/summary: cheaper than a vet visit
review/text: My vet suggested this for my dog. I have a very elderly pet with lots of aches and pains and a few too many pounds. The vet thought it would satisfy the dog and help her slim down. I've always fedcher premium brands, but never tried a freeze-dried raw food product. The food comes dry in a re-closable plastic bag. I simply add water and let stand in the refrigerator for about 8 hours. I make about a 3-day batch at a time. My dogs (both) love it. They come rushing into the kitchen when I am mixing it up and practically inhale it when it is served.  It's not an unpleasant smell! The older dog did, in fact, lose some weight with no other changes in her routine. I can'tbe sure whether it's the food or the unfortunate wasting that occurs in 14-year-old dogs. Being lighter has been helpful for her joints, I'm sure. I go through a 20-lb bag every 3 weeks feeding 2 dogs(30lb and 47lb) twice a day. They like the turkey version also. Sometimes I add more water to make it on the soupy side. This is pricey stuff, but may be a bargain compared to the vet bills that an overweight dog can wrack-up.

review/summary: Our dog loves this feed
review/text: Our lives are ruled by ten pounds of chihuahua - do not be mistaken, they are demanding little bundles of teeth and tail that make life miserable if they don't like something. Our gutsy little monster loves this feed, and will actually sing to get it. Made from good quality ingredients having NO grain at all - just Raw, Freeze-Dried beef in addition to a blend of high-quality fruits and veggies - which is what dogs of any breed were designed to eat. We are pretty fussy about any food, so research everything we and the dog eat; Sojos is what the dog likes and it is good for him. Just soak it overnight, for a delicious meal that needs nothing else.

review/text: My poodles love this food. They eat every last morsel. They adapted very quickly to it and had no stomach issues.  It looked so good when I mixed it up in the bowl I had to warn others not to eat it if they were looking for a late night snack. You mix enough for 4 days and you leave it in the fridge and then it is ready to serve. I have never seen my poodles gobble food so quickly before. They would shove the other food around and leave it all over the floor. With Sojos there is not one speck left. The ingredients are awesome and I don't think I can make their food any better. Thank you for a great product.

We tried but the only flavor she likes is the strawberry.  You only get two strawberry packets in each pack of 10 Instant Breakfast and you cannot find it in the big canisters.  This was very challenging and potentially expensive.  But a quick Amazon search and we found exactly what we were looking for.  6 boxes all full of strawberry Instant Breakfast.  We are all very happy now and my grand daughter is getting the vitamins and minerals she needs!  Whew!

The product contains FISH OIL, so it is not a suitable candidate for a 6 month old or an introductory food for any age. It is also not returnable.<br /><br />While the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only, the picture of the product says with DHA. The DHA comes from fish oil. After contacting Amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product I thought I was ordering, they refunded my money. They offered to send out a new (replacement) item, but I think I would get the same mislabeled product. While I was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused I think Amazon's customer service did a great job.

review/text: These are my baby's FAVORITE foods!!! And my child is a very very very very picky eater (prefers milk over food).  A little thin but perfect for 4-6 mo and for the older babies, we thicken it by adding meat or rice cereal. I was very disappointed and frustrated when all 5 of our local stores stopped carrying these. So happy I found them here for my baby! The ppl here who complain about tuna oil added are dumb (no pun intended). They help with baby brain development.  It's not super easy to find the organic baby foods you want with DHA added in them (ellas kitchen, plum organic, etc don't have DHA) -- go buy those and quit whining about tuna oil added to The gerber organic green beans bc it's probably folks like you who complained to the stores that make it very difficult for many parents like me to FIND this food in stores! And if the complaining persists, gerber may stop making it all together and babies who love this product will suffer! Gerber, don't stop making these! I would give it 6 stars if I could!<br /><br />I bought 48 containers of gerber organic green beans from Amazon and can't wait to see the smile on her face when we eat  these again (she has been w/o these for 3 mo),

review/summary: Yucky Vegetable Smoothie Add-in
review/text: Gerber changed the recipe for the worse, this version isn't new and improved. It's worse I think because of the addition of the tuna oil/DHA. When the weather cools down I'll hide this in soups and stews as a mystery ingredient. Even the dog won't eat it :(

review/summary: My baby eats it all!
review/text: I bought These green beans for my baby because they're organic. I honestly expected him to reject them, that it would be a good photo op for funny faces. He didn't flinch and in fact ate the whole thing! This was much to my surprise! Maybe it was a fluke, he was really hungry that day. On a different day, he ate the whole container once again! I'm thrilled that this is another green option in his diet since he doesn't seem crazy about peas. I will be buying more of these.

review/text: I mash a small piece of fresh banana and mix with a container of this and my daughter eats the whole thing like candy.  I like to take these on the go as opposed to the glass jars because I don't have to worry about it breaking inside my bag.  If you are vegan you might want to get another brand.  There is tuna oil included in the ingredient list which is how the DHA is added.

review/text: I am not happy with Gerber at all.  I researched their products and they do not have to list ingredients if below a certain percentage.  (LIKE IF GREEN BEANS WERE MADE ON A CONVEYER OF WHERE RICE WAS MADE AND THE RICE WAS UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT TRACED THEY DO NOT LIST IT ON THE INGREDIENTS).  The beans I did not know have fish oil in it.  It is now listed on the product ingredients.

review/text: The vanilla is very tasty, I'm very happy I purchased it.  However, the bottle is closed with a cork stopper.  After about the 10th time I opened and closed it, the cork snapped off the stopper and ended up lodged in the neck of the bottle.  Fortunately my husband was able to dig it out with a small corkscrew.  We put a rubber wine stopper in its place and it works much better.

review/summary: Not the Lipton "Orange Gardens" that you had in the hotel
review/text: I had the most wonderful orange spice tea in a hotel recently and even took some bags home to enjoy. It was Lipton Orange Gardens. I ordered this orange herbal thinking it was the same one but it is not even close. Although the ingredients look the same this one is like water compared to the deep rich orange spice tea I got from the hotel. I went to the Lipton site and there are several orange teas and the one called Orange Gardens is under the food service section available to hotels and other food services like cruises etc.. I did find it searching on Google though and it looks like it is available from one company. If you like very weak mild flavored tea then this orange herbal is for you. It's not bad it's just way to weak for my taste. If you like a strong aromatic, robust and very tasty tea look for the Orange Gardens it is amazing!

review/summary: Oldie but a Goodie
review/text: I have been drinking gentle orange tea by Lipton for over 20 years - the box has changed, the number of tea bags per box has shrunk, etc. but the tea remained one of my favorite herbal teas. Folks always asked what I was drinking because the aroma was so pleasant.It was also relatively inexpensive. BUT - it is no longer being made. The replacement (so to speak) by Lipton in new fancy boxes, has rose hips or something similar I do not like in it. There were no gentle orange boxes left on the shelves of any grocery stores, so I checked Amazon and scored - bingo. I bought a year's supply. However, the boxes are all oldish 2011 teas. That's the best I could do. I figure this gives me a year to find a suitable replacement.

The tea is caffeine free and I have purchased this from Amazon two times now and the shipping is fast and the tea is fresh.  Don't mistake this tea with the one that says orange spice because that one is more spicy and not as mild and good as the orange.  I use a teaspoon of honey in mine and it's the best ever!!!  I would HIGHLY recommend this tea!!!

review/text: This natural sweetener product tastes better than other liquid stevia I have tried, it tastes sweet without any chemical aftertaste.  This sweetener works very well instead of sugar in most applications (beverages), though with black coffee it is clear the product is not sugar.  Its probably the acidity level in the coffee that creates a different result than that with Iced Tea, which tastes very good with stevia.<br /><br />Other Stevia products have tasted more like a chemical to me when tried.

review/text: I love buying dogfood on Amazon.  You are able to buy quality food, normally at a discounted price, and the shipping is free if it's fulfilled by Amazon.  It's a no brainer!  Why go to the store and lug a 30 lb bag of dogfood around when you get get it shipped to your house 2 day mail for free.<br /><br />So, if you're skeptical of buying dogfood on Amazon- don't be! I've been doing it for at least a year or two.<br /><br />Now, for this food specifically: It's high quality and my dogs like it.  I also noticed that when I purchased Wellness my dog had the WORST gas ever.  THis does NOT give my dog bad gas.  I do notice that the dogs eyes are a little gunky (which I heard can be attributed to their food) but not more gunky then when I was giving them the Costco Nature's Domain Salmon and sweet potato. (Also, a good deal but you can only buy at Costco)Their coats feel nice... and they have normal bowel movements.<br /><br />Overall, good deal and i recommend.

review/text: These are just okay. I bought them because I remember seeing them growing up, but I wasn't allowed to eat snack cakes as a child. And they made them look really good on Seinfeld. Now was my chance.<br /><br />They are really dry, and when you bite into them, they immediately begin falling apart. I thought the streusel was going to be moister too, but it was as dry as one would expect straight ground cinnamon with a touch of sugar would be.<br /><br />And for cakes so dry, who can believe they are so fattening? Not to mention the 2.5 grams of (delicious) artery-clogging trans fat. I guess they won't be spoiling any time this year. Strangest thing about them is when you eat them, it's like....you never ate them. They need more flavor.<br /><br />I've never been a dunker with cakes or donuts, but try it and they might be better.

review/text: If you are used to the taste of the American-made Kikkoman, this will have a much stronger taste to you because it is saltier. If you are from Asia (or lived there), this is very similar to the soy sauce locally available (particularly in the Philippines) and it will work much better with old family recipes. I loved it. The bottle has a pour spout that makes it easy to use.

review/text: The chocolate covered raisins seemed fine from the packaging, but when I looked at the container, it was a 48 oz jar instead of a 51 oz jar. I tried to send it back for a refund or get a jar that was the correct size for the money I paid, but there was no return option. It was only a 3 oz difference from the original, but I was still disappointed that I did not receive the item I wanted for the price I paid. Other than that, I am satisfied with my purchase.

review/summary: A favorite snack
review/text: I ordered this in January, so chances of melting was minimal. I agree that ordering any chocolate product in the middle of summer may not be the best idea. My order was received in excellent condition and the raisins tasted as expected. Chocolate Covered Raisins are one of my "all-time" favorite snacks. I love chocolate and the raisins give me the impression I'm eating something that's not so bad for my health. It's 170 cal for 30 pieces with 6g of fat. However, I usually combine the chocolate covered raisins with mixed nuts and regular raisins. Over half the calories are from the sugars in the raisins themselves. But, when mixed with the other stuff, the number eaten is way less than 30 pcs.<br />The packaging is nice but does make a lot of noise in the shipping box. I worry about what people handling the box might think about the contents. Overall, a delicious snack and when mixed with nuts and other dried fruit, not too detrimental to your health.

review/summary: JIffy Corn Muffin Mix Is the Best!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IMTB8">Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix 24ct</a> is a good buy.  Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix is the best!  As a Southern gal who is a serious cornbread cooker, I experiment with everything cornbread.  I cook from scratch and with mixes. I have developed and collected a multiplicity of varied recipes for making cornbread many different ways.  Many of these recipes are based on Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix.<br /><br />For example, my sister Ruth gave me her recipe for Broccoli Bread, which is in my cookbook, Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook.  She heats her oven to 350 degrees.  She melts a stick of butter in a baking pan and sets it aside.  Then she stirs together a small box of frozen chopped broccoli,  a small can of green chilis, 3 cups grated cheddar cheese, 3 eggs, a small box of Jiffy, a small chopped onion, and the cooled butter.  She pours the ingredients into that baking pan and cooks it until done  -- about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Macaroni Bread is an unusual taste treat.  It is in The Collard Patch, and it is wonderful with collards.<br /><br />Macaroni Bread<br /><br />The first day we talked about writing this book, Paul Elliott, the co-author, said, "Try making macaroni bread," I could not believe my ears!  I am glad I took his advice.  He has a good imagination.<br /><br />Macaroni Bread<br /><br />Ingredients<br />� cup (� stick) unsalted butter<br />1 cup chopped red onion<br />1� cups extra sharp shredded cheddar cheese<br />2 cups leftover cold macaroni (prepared according to package instructions)<br />2 teaspoon lemon juice<br />1 (8�-ounce) Jiffy package corn muffin mix<br />� teaspoon baking soda<br />� to � teaspoon ground red pepper<br />2 eggs, beaten<br />� cup milk<br />Non-stick cooking spray<br /><br />Preparation<br />Preheat the oven to 400�.<br />Saut&eacute; the chopped onions in the butter for about 3 minutes.<br />Lightly toss the cheese, macaroni, and lemon juice.<br />In another bowl add the baking soda and red pepper to the muffin mix.  Stir.<br />Stir the eggs and milk into the dry ingredients.<br />Spray and preheat he baking pan.<br />Add the cheese-macaroni mix to the batter.  Stir just enough to mix the ingredients.  Do not continue to stir until the ingredients are indistinct.<br />Spoon and smooth the mixture into the baking pan, spray the top with cooking spray.<br />Bake until a knife, fork, or toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, the corners are crusty, and the house smells delightful.<br /><br />Equipment/Utensils<br />8" square baking pan * 2 or 3 Mixing bowls * Whisk<br /><br />Many of my Southern friends say that Jiffy is a little too sweet for their taste, but if you put a plate of Jiffy muffins in front of them with some butter and some greens, they don't seem to know when to stop eating.  Therefore, I have concluded that they really are not too sweet.  We Southerners don't like to admit we sweeten our food, but we do!<br /><br />Jiffy has been around since the 1930's, and I hope it continues to be around a long time.<br /><br />When I'm enjoying Jiffy muffins, I don't think about calories.  Just in case you do, here's some information:  One sixth of a package, which is the equivalent of one muffin, has 150 calories; and a baked muffin according to the instructions on the box has 170 calories.

review/summary: Other Uses
review/text: I also keep a stock of Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix in my house.<br /><br />  You can pour some of this mix into a glass, add an egg and then enough milk to get it to the consistency of thick pancake batter. If its too wet add more mix, and if too dry add more milk. Pour that into a skillet and in minutes you have a quick piece of cornbread to eat with lunck or dinner.<br /><br />I have used the same mixture poured into bear shaped molds. Cook that in your skillet and serve with butter and the the syrup or preserves of your choice for a breakfast treat.<br /><br />Pour a layer of this corn muffin mix (with egg and milk added) into the bottom of a casserole dish. Add instant sliced chedder potatoes, peas, chopped unions (dried or fresh), sliced mushrooms (optional), (spices (such as basil and thyme) and either beef or tuna. Then bake for an hour at 350. Notice if you use keep dried musrooms, onions, and the sliced dried cheesy potatoes of your choice in your home as well as powdered milk, this can be a fall back recipee if you havent gotten the chance to go to the store. The other bit I love about this is that once you pour all this into an oven safe dish right when you get home, you can do other things with that next hour. Then your oven beeps telling you that dinner is ready.<br /><br />  Also try baked corndogs. Pour a layer of mix (with milk and egg) into the bottom of a baking dish. Push the hotdogs of your choice into that mix evenly spaced. Bake at 350. You are in effect making corn dogs without frying. This also gives you control of what type of milk and meat to use. Feel free to add spice to this mix before it bakes (a bit of salt, barbaque powder, curry powder, masala, ground or chopped dried onion or garlic)<br /><br /> Anyway, you get the idea that this stuff is a work horse where you can get a bit creative. It also makes great cornbread and corn muffins. :)

While the 24 box/case price is excellent, the shipping expense that exceeds the product price itself by almost $5 is ridiculous.

I highly recommend it if you can find a better deal somewhere, or don't mind paying such frightening shipping costs. I could purchase another entire case of 24 boxes and donate them to the local shelter/soup kitchen for what I'm asked to pay for just the shipping here. Too bad. Would have liked to make purchase on regular basis so I COULD have donated some.

review/summary: Heats up a dish nicely!
review/text: I like to spice foods up, when I cook for myself (my family doesn't appreciate my adding heat to their dishes). One of the easiest ways to do this is to use crushed red pepper in enough quantity to add a nice heat to the dish (I use this when I make omelets or egg sandwiches for myself, for example).<br /><br />McCormick is one of the dependable brand names that I use (there are a couple other brands that I use, too, depending on which one is easiest to get at a particular store).<br /><br />This product becomes a versatile addition to many dishes for me. Am I making a soup? Do I want some kick to it? I add some flakes. When making a spaghetti sauce, do I want it to leave a little burn behind after I swallow the dish? I add some flakes. What about chili? A little red pepper does the trick of heating the dish up.<br /><br />Anyhow, I do enjoy heat to a dish. Unless I'm adventurous enough to gamble with habaneros (The first time I added some habanero to an egg dish, I didn't realize how hot this pepper was! I had a burn that lasted 15 minutes or so as well as a brow that sweated for the same length of time!), this does nicely.

review/summary: Worse than factory farm chickens fed coconut swilll = 0
review/text: I bought 4 dozen eggs from this company, after the farmer I was buying pastured eggs from went out of business.  When you crack the eggs the yolk is all watery and falls flat.  The second dozen was rotten and had a bad smell.  Apparently these chickens are fed a diet of cocofeed which is the left over remains after pressing coconut oil from the coconut.  Did one ever think that maybe waste is just waste?  What separates them from factory farming?  They say the chickens are free range but that doesn't really say anything. All it means is they are not in cages but it doesn't guarantee that they are outside of a barn.<br /><br />Fortunate for me the eggs I had ordered from another farmer finally came and they are so beautiful.  The yolks are deep orange against the pure white.  The taste is sensational.  I just can't bear to eat these eggs from tropical traditions.<br /><br />All I can say is buyer beware.  Maybe some of them were rotten because they are old?  Not sure.  It is hard to get eggs grown on pasture shipped but it is truly worth every penny.<br /><br />If you are thinking of having these eggs just get the ones at the store they are surely better.<br />db

I hate to leave a bad review given they were so conscientious about following up, but I have concerns about how safe their eggs are even if not completely putrid. I recommend them for their coconut products -- just not their eggs.

review/text: Tropical Traditions eggs are everything they're cracked up to be:).  I have a severe soy allergy so I can not eat the eggs from grocery stores.  These eggs are an answer to prayer.  They taste great.  Their shells are thick and firm.  The yolks are a beautiful, intact deep yellow.  The only issue I have is the 2 day shipping cost I must pay.  But, in comparison to having no eggs vs. expensive eggs, I definitely choose these expensive eggs.  Worth it.<br /><br />Update:  Down graded from 5 to 2 stars.  Ordered more eggs on 5 Sep, paid extra for expedited shipping, the eggs still haven't arrived.  Contacted the seller, who refunded the extra charges but gave no explanation except to say the eggs are shipped from the farm on Monday or Tuesday each week.  This doesn't explain why the eggs weren't shipped until 17 Sep.  Am not happy with expensive eggs that are not here.

review/summary: EGG-CELLENT
review/text: These eggs changed my life. For many years, I hated eggs. Eggs made me literally sick to even look at. Oftentimes I would see an egg and consider ending my own life. Then one day, a brown package from Amazon.com arrived on my doorstep. I opened it to find a friend had ordered for me these perfectly ovular, smooth, pearly white eggs. I could immediately see that there was something special about them. Handling them as carefully as porcelain china, I carried them into my kitchen and hesitantly cracked one over my skillet. With a little milk, a pinch of salt and pepper, a sprinkle of cheese, and a touch of love, these small, simple eggs were without question the best things I have ever tasted in my life. I am literally addicted to these eggs. I eat at least one for every meal.<br /><br />Whoever would even consider writing a poor review of these eggs obviously has no palette and no intelligence whatsoever. They should truly consider reevaluating their life.<br /><br />Thank you, eggs.<br />And thank you, reader, for taking the time to listen to the inspiring story of how these eggs saved my culinary life and supplied me with enough protein to make it through the day.

My dogs' coats are shiny and healthy looking.  Their teeth are in great condition, since my Husky is 4 going on 5 years old.  The best part is, my Husky used to be allergic to the grass out back and would chew her paws until they were bright red.  Since she's been on the AvoDerm, her paws are in great condition and she hasn't chewed them!  I don't have to feed them much, because it's filling and the nutrition is well absorbed.  This is also a positive, since now I don't have huge piles to clean up out back...if you get my drift.

Both scales reflected a weight of 14 ounces. That is certainly not the 16 ounces, (a pound), that I paid for so I was not happy. Two ounces do not seem like a lot to be concerned about, but you should get what you pay for when you order from a company by weight. I do not appreciate the fact that I was not given the full pound of cheese.

review/summary: Lovely Cheese, just so you know,  though I cannot vouch for this seller
review/text: I bought this cheese at a local gourmet shop and it's a terrific feta. Lovely salty-mild-rich-creamy. Very satisfying mouth feel. I will assuredly be buying more (and thank goodness I can find it nearby).<br /><br />So, if you love your feta---whether in omelettes or salads or dips--this is a beautiful one. You can just eat it alone with some grapes on the side.Nice.<br /><br />However, make sure you read "Mike the Greek's" review and measure it if you buy it from this seller. Maybe his was an off day or their scale was uncalibrated. It may be a fixed problem now. One can hope.<br /><br />Enjoy the lovely feta....

review/summary: Great Seasonjng!!
review/text: Williams chili seasoning is the Good Stuff.  It has no MSG, high fructose corn syrup, fillers, preservatives or any other creepy stuff. The flavor is authentic, rich, smooth, complex and spicy, yet only mildly warm.  (And, no, I am not one of those lunatics that says something "isn't hot" unless it has 500,000 heat units.)  All but the very faintest of heart can handle this stuff.  Williams chili powder is almost identical to "Grandma's Spanish Seasoning", which my family used for years in various favorites.  I was crushed when Grandma's went out of business and thrilled when I found out that Williams had bought them out. I tracked them down on the web and Williams graciously sent me a sample packet of their chili seasoning.  YOWZA!!!  If anything, it is even better than Grandma's.  This stuff is well worth the price.

review/summary: It is almost Grandma's Chili Seasoning.
review/text: Grandma's Chili Seasoning was discontinued a few years ago to the dismay of many fans of chili and enchilada sauces.  This is the real deal as a replacement. It is very difficult to find on the shelves in the Bay Area.  Trust Amazon to bring it to you.

review/summary: Nice flavor and no salt
review/text: This chili mix has a nice flavor, not too spicy. The best part is that there's no salt which I like so that I can control how much salt is added. I also love the bulk packaging, no more buying those expensive little packets in the grocery store.

review/summary: Product and Service - Great!
review/text: I'm outside of CONUS and can't get this locally. A buddy brought it over for me. The taste (I am from Kansas City and was raised on Williams Chilli Seasoning) and price are just right! I'm getting more as soon as another guy comes over!
