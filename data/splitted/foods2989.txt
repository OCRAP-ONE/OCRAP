review/summary: Interesting, but what's the practical use?
review/text: Lickety Stik is an interesting idea. It's a small bottle filled with a thick brown liquid - a liquified dog treat, essentially - which you can squeeze out and smear over the top (sort of like gel deodorant). Your dog, I guess, is then supposed to lick this as a treat, but unfortunately my dog was just confused. I was still able to dab the liquid on his paw, and he seemed to like that quite a bit. So it still works for me to some extent.<br /><br />The big issue, I think, is that I'm not sure what the practical use of this product is. Maybe it's convenient for training; instead of carrying a bag of treats, you can just pop this thing in your pocket. Or I suppose if you have an elderly dog who has trouble with solids, it might come in handy. Otherwise it seems more convenient for me (and probably for many others) to stick with the dry treats.

review/summary: "what, no sales slip"
review/text: I was very disappointed with this one. Most of the cream soup bases I've checked with online state simple water for the base, this one calls for milk, flour, water, + base! I may as well have made it from scratch. The instructions specifically call for 1/2 cup base, 1/4 cup flour and 1 full cup of milk to get a "thin" sauce so "makes  50 servings" of cream soup or gravy is not possible in an 8oz container. I contacted seller for a refund and was prompted to print out a return label which could have been provided w/ the sales slip I never received either. The only response received was to my feedback. They never tried to resolve anything with me and for that I would not purchase from this seller again

review/summary: Whatever happened to HOT cinnamon candy?
review/text: Valentines Day is one of those rare holidays where I join the Philistines whose favorite candy is not chocolate.  Forget the heart shaped box, the chocolate chip roses, the cakes.  Give me cinnamon that's hotter than a scorned woman's temper.<br /><br />Except, where did it go?  Somewhere in the past few years, cinnamon candy got namby pamby.  Someone told me that people complained.<br /><br />These are not the red hot Jelly Bellys I used to get. You know, the ones that made your nose run?  And in a cold February, there's nothing better. (Well, nothing I'm going to talk about here, anyway) They're sanitized, expurgated, dare I say it?  MILD, kiddie candy.<br /><br />Still looking for my sinfully hot cinnamon for the year.  Any suggestions?<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, February 2009

review/summary: Excellent Buy
review/text: I love canned fish, especially sardines, so I'm always on the lookout for a good deal to support my habit.  When I saw these for just over $1.00 a can delivered (with Prime), I was a little skeptical.  In my experience, most sardines in that price range are pretty blah.  However, Crown Prince is a fairly reputable brand, so I took a chance.  I was most pleasantly surprised.  The cans are completely packed with fish, the sardines are firm and flavorful, and the oil (even though soybean, not olive) was very good.  I found they tasted as good as any other single-layer sardine out there, an could only wish for olive oil to make them perfect.  But for a dollar a can, no complaints from me!  I'm sure I will be buying them again.

It is a healthy breakfast item and very tasty by itself.  There is no need for added sugars or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />The subscription discount price as of this posting ($10.47 for 4 16.4-ounce boxes) is competitive with "brick-and-mortar" supermarkets in the Metropolitan New York area.  I hope that this price lasts for a while because it is very convenient to have it delivered right to my doorstep!

review/summary: Not good.
review/text: If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top.  I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking.  It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't.  With the sweetness of the fig,  a bit more acidity would have balanced it out.  I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable.  I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help.  It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months.  I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain.  I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste.  Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store.  I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller.  I can see why.

review/summary: Very uneven quality...
review/text: I purchased the Spicy World Cinnamon 6-pack three times. The first batch was amazingly tasty and fragrant with perhaps 10% bad sticks (taste like wood or dirty/moldy). The 2nd order contained perhaps 50% poor quality Cinnamon. My 3rd--and final--was nearly 100% terrible: dirty, moldy, thin and tasteless sticks. I realize this product is bulk packaged and sold at deep discounts but such uneven quality is the same as tossing your money out the window. Incidentally, pressure cooking (in water) quickly brings out the flavor of Cinnamon if you're into tea making.

I wouldn't have ordered $56 of laffy taffy if I wanted the WRONG one. The picture on the website is definitely not the picture of the laffy taffy I recieved. I for one am very ashamed of the service I have recieved and warn all others to steer clear of this product if you are looking for the taffy with the seeds.... this is NOT the right one.

review/text: My last few boxes of this candy must have been in a warmer climate on its side because the candy was very thick on one side and very thin on the other side of the candy packaging.  It was like was being stored on its side for an extended period of time or had gotten warmer and then gravitated to the end of the candy packaging.  But overall great taste and very consistent vs. store bought multimix packs.  As previously mentioned no seeds but a great product and price.  I am hooked on this flavor and have bought 4 boxes from Amazon because they are so difficult to find locally in mixed boxes.  This is the best flavor IMHO in the line.

Nice crisp crunch to them, they actually have detectable salt flavor (unlike the sesame pretzels, which I have to add salt--pretzels gotta have a little salt).

review/summary: Sesame pretzel rings
review/text: I really enjoyed these sesame pretzel rings. Ever since I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease and went gluten free I searched for pretzels that were easy to chew and tasted good. I tried many brands and most were not very good. These pretzels are tasty and easy to chew.<br />After I am finished with the pretzels there is always some salt and sesame seeds left in the bottom of the bag. I use these to sprinkle on my salad and also other uses.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I had high hopes for these, based on the other reviews. I wanted to like them but I really don't, nor do my husband or son. To us they taste nothing like "real" pretzels, and are definitely not worth the calories, fat, or price. I know that this is because they lack the gluten, but they aren't very crunchy, more like crisp, since they aren't dense at all. They also have a funky, sort of metallic aftertaste.

review/summary: Pricey but delicious
review/text: The cost on these has gone up since I first bought them some 12 years ago. Despite the cost, they are a good deal for anyone who can't eat wheat or gluten.  They taste delicious, and as several others have noted, are just as good, if not better than regular pretzels.  It's hard for me to find these even in the Twin Cities, so I will very happily be buying them through Amazon.  I have tried and used many Ener-G brand products over the years.  These are among the best.  I find their breads dry, tasteless, and unappealing in the extreme, but the pretzels  are awesome.  Other brands have an off taste, but not these.  They are wonderful and I will buy them frequently. Even my gluten eating family enjoys these, so I hide them!  They can eat their own.

review/text: I have enjoyed these pretzels many times. They are also popular with my gluten-eating family members. The only reason I'd rate these pretzels with four stars is due to the somewhat high fat content, most likely due the the second ingredient listed being palm oil. However, the low protein in these pretzels is a positive for those diagnosed with chronic kidney conditions.<br /><br />I will order again!

review/text: I just love these pretzels. They are a great snack from the ordinary gluten-free diet. I was a counselor at camp this summer and one of the kids wanted to try what I was eating. I told her she may not like it; it was my special food. The next day she came back to me and said, "Where's your pretzels? I want more! Can you go buy me some? I will give you some of my allowance if I can have more of them!" So needless to say they are a big hit with all age groups. And don't forget you can dip them in peanut butter for a special treat. Enjoy!

review/summary: Better than Regular Pretzels
review/text: I have to agree with the rest.  These pretzels are so good that people that don't have to be on a gluten free diet love them.  Both the taste and the texture are fabulous.  It's a bit difficult to describe why they are better.  You almost have to try them to see what people are speaking about.  Part of it, I think, is that they have a crunch just like regular pretzels, but not quite as hard.  And they seem to have almost a buttery taste to them.  But, I have to agree with a previous reviewer, this is probably one of Ener-G's better products as I have been disappointed in others.

review/text: These pretzels are really good. They taste just like regular wheat pretzels. I think even people who are not eating GF would not know these pretzels were not "normal" pretzels. The pretzels are crisp, not too salty, with just a hint of buttery richness. However, like most GF foods they add extra fat to make up for the loss of the wheat and gluten. You should know that each 20 oz bag has 350 calories and 18 grams of fat. Snack accordingly.

Thanks to Glutino for this fine product and I am looking forward to trying your other products. I did try the apple-cinnamon cereal and enjoyed it as a snack. Keep up the good work!!

review/summary: Adam Scott's Dream Sauce.  Carolina Style Barbecue.
review/text: Compared to barbecue in the rest of the United States, Carolina-style barbecue is a whole different animal.  Literally.  While most people think of beef dripping a thick, sticky sauce, Carolina Barbecue is shredded, pulled or chopped pork in a spicy vinegar sauce.  You can make the delicious Southern staple at home with a bottle of Scott's Barbecue Sauce.<br /><br />Scott's Barbecue Sauce is based in Goldsboro, North Carolina.  The vinegar-based sauce packs a lot of punch for something that looks so thin.  The punch is in the secret blend of spices that add a bit of hit and lots of flavor to your slow-cooked pork. Don't be surprised if the herbs and spices have settled to the bottom inch of the bottle, just shake it up and you're ready to go.<br /><br />Baste your pig in this vinegary sauce while it cooks.  This can be done in the oven or on the grill with a shoulder or butt.  Basting will give you the maximum infusion of flavor.  You can also add the sauce to the mixture after it has cooked (which many people do in addition to the basting).  The result is a slightly tangy, mildly hot, delicious melt-in-your-mouth pork experience that you have to taste to fully appreciate.<br /><br />The standard bottle size for Scott's Barbecue Sauce is 16 ounces.  The sauce does not contain any sugar or fat.  The ingredients are secret, so the bottle gives the minimal required list of ingredients as vinegar, salt, pepper and spices.  My title alludes to the origins of the sauce, which founder Adam Scott claims was given to him in a dream.  With this recipe, he began making the sauce back in 1917.<br /><br />If you like good Carolina Barbecue (Eastern style), you are certain to enjoy Scott's Barbecue Sauce.  Five finger-licking stars.

review/text: My husband and I love barbecued ribs but are trying to cut out sugar and Scott's was recommended by the eating plan. The pictures looked like a thick red sauce on the meat, but in reality, this is a thin, watery, vinegary, marinade - not a BBQ sauce.  It isn't that it doesn't have a good flavor, but basted our ribs all day in it, and the ribs had no sauce on them at all, looked rather unappetizing and now we are left with a case of something we don't like. I know, I know, we should have just ordered one bottle and tried it first....

review/summary: The Worst...
review/text: There is no kind way to say this. This is terrible.  There are several reasons why:<br />1.  It is thin like water<br />2.  It stinks (I could barely taste it without gagging)<br />3.  It is vinegar based.  If you think you would enjoy dipping your nuggets in vinegar then you would like this.<br />In addition I was mailed expired BBQ sauce.  When I contacted Julia's Pantry about the fact that it was expired they accused me of confusing the lot number with the expiration date.  It clearly said August 1, 2011 on the lid.  They wanted me to mail it back to them.  If I could do that I wouldn't have ordered BBQ sauce online.  Not everyone can get to the post office.  What a complete waste of money and time.

review/summary: nantucket iced coffee
review/text: I tried this coffee, along with a selection of other iced cooffes and teas (disclaimer: As a Buzz agent, I received the items at no cost, in exchange for my honest opinion).<br />I am definately a coffee addict, and drink multiple cups throughout the day. In these steaming days of summer, my previous options were to drink more steaming HOT coffee (WHEW!), waste time and money for a decent cold brew at SBs, or spend quite a bit of time turning a hot coffee into a mediocre iced coffee.<br />The GM nantucket iced coffee wound up being perfect for my needs. It takes significantly less time, so I can make a cup to bring to work in just minutes, without adding to my commute. The taste is as good (or better) as the iced coffees I have had "out", at a much lower cost.<br />I would have given it a full 5 stars, but I prefer a stronger coffee - this is more of a medium rather than bold brew.<br />A suggestion: add a squirt or two of SB's Hazelnut or other flavorings for a really refreshing and delicious treat. I wind up drinking at least two (great for bringing to work as well as a nice pick-up afterwards) when the flavorings are added.<br />Green Mountain also has a hazelnut cold brew, but I have not tried it as yet.

review/summary: Love making my own iced coffee
review/text: This is an easy way to have iced coffee whenever I want without leaving the house. I use a 12 oz. Thermal cup with lid and straw. Fill 3/4 with ice and brew  on smallest cup setting. Stir briskly once brewing is complete to get completely cold. Add milk, cream, sugar or whatever you usually put in your iced coffee.  I had no problem with the pods. I hope they come out with a decaf version so I can enjoy in the evening as well.

review/summary: Great coffee but the pods kept falling apart
review/text: I don't understand the difference that this pod has over other kcups that I could use to brew iced coffee since the only difference is that I brew it over ice.  I like the flavor of coffee so I didn't mind that there wasn't much difference.  I did have a huge problem with the kcups themselves though because every time I tried to brew coffee the top of the pod would come off and then I would get coffee everywhere and grinds would go everywhere.

review/text: Small, affordable bonsai pots with matching trays are somewhat hard to find. This one is very nice and fits the bill for my dwarf ornamental pomegranate trees. Another reviewer gave it one star because of its size and price, but both of these are known before purchasing, so I don't agree with that review. I found the pot to be as advertised and a good value.

review/summary: What's a "Cream Seal" anyway?  Buyer Beware?
review/text: The claim for this balsamic vinegar is that it's 50 years old, and the vinegar has a "Creme Seal".  Hmmm.<br /><br />The "Affinato" designation means it must be at least 12 years old, and a gold designation is reserved for balsamicos that are at least 25 years old.<br /><br />This "offering looks alot like this one also sold on Amazon for more money, but fewer claims. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BGT7O8">Acetaia-Leonardi "Tradizionale" Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena</a>. If you're looking for something older, then go for the silver or gold designations.  Here's a good article on balsamicos:<br />[...]<br /><br />In full disclosure, I haven't bought this specific product from this specific vendor, so, while it COULD be 50 years old, I'm guessing that this is more like 12-year old balsamico than 50-year old....<br /><br />I'm just sayin'

review/summary: Childhood memories...
review/text: My mother used to make this pizza every week when I was a kid.  I LOVED it.  I moved cross-country about 14 years ago and had almost forgotten it existed as you can't find it anywhere in Los Angeles.  Someone from back home mentioned it recently and I went on an internet hunt for it soon after.  I was DELIGHTED to find this seller on Amazon and beg them to keep it in stock!  It's almost exactly as I remember -- crispy and tangy and fantastic!  It does seem like the pizza sauce is thinner, more watery, then I remembered it being, but when it bakes, it's bubbly and rich.  There's never enough cheese, but I always have ground parmesian on hand, so with a few extra sprinkles of that, I think it's about perfect.  So excited to have it again.  If only the shipping charge was a bit better... this would be a meal for a steal.

review/text: Great pizza, but NOT enough cheese or pepperoni.  You have to add your own special touch to it.  They provide the tiniest amount of powdered cheese.  I added my own shredded mozeralla cheese, but it cooked too fast for the crust.  The crust needs more than 20 minutes too cook.  It's a good pizza, but you need to buy extra cheese and pepperoni.

review/text: This is my very favorite pancake syrup for two reasons. Reason one is that you can heat the syrup in the bottle making it easy to have hot syrup for your hot cakes. Reason two is the syrup is thick, rich and buttery tasting. I love this syrup.<br /><br />Unfortunately our local stores quit carrying this syrup so I will now have to buy it from Amazon.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/text: The tea is amazing in taste and color.  I highly recommend it.<br />The "dust" described in another review is due to the Co2 decaf process they use.  It is a natural process that does not use toxic chemicals to de-caffeinate the tea leaves.<br /><br />If you want a decaff tea that tastes like regular English Breakfast Tea, give this a try.  You will not be disappointed with the taste.

review/text: I've ordered many varieties of loose-leaf tea and never seen anything like this. Coffee Bean's "loose leaf" tea is a powder; there is nothing approximating a leaf. So it is not aesthetically pleasing. However, taste seems fine once you figure out measurements that work for the powder.

review/summary: Merrick bone
review/text: I ordered a box of these a while back from Amazon and my Labrador absolutely loved them and since i was starting to run low i decided to come back and reorder some. I tend to favor ordering from vendors that offer Prime shipping since i have the membership but this time i decided to order from PetCo.<br /><br />I compared the prices from other vendors even though Amazon had lowered their price on this to 36$ compared to 59$ when i first bought them and i was shocked to see PetCo offering these for 6.99$ with 6$ shipping!<br /><br />So i figured that's a steal for these bones and even though my logic kept saying there must be something wrong with the advertisement i did not want to believe it so silly me went ahead and ordered a bunch only to get upset when i received them and realized a "SUPER bargain" was only an illusion.<br /><br />I contacted PetCo and they were very polite and helped out right away with the situation so overall even though it was upsetting i didn't find the jackpot of dog bones at least everyone was nice enough to help out and solve this confusion.<br /><br />Either than that i absolutely LOVE the way Merrick bones make my baby girl so happy and excited every time its time for a new so i will definitely not stop buying them just because of this hick-up.
