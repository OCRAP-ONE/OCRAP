If you compare the nutrition values and then compare to Slim Fast....this is just as good and much cheaper.

review/text: I use this product because my kids (boys 3 and 7) love their hot chocolate in the morning and this way I know they are getting as many nutrients as possible.  I do not like to give my kids too many artificial sweeteners, nor do I like to give them too much sugar so I mix the regular stuff with this stuff, reduce the amount I add to the milk and my kids LOVE it (hot or cold).  My boys are both at healthy weights and are very active (like most young boys).  If you are in a hurry, or your kids are drinking chocolate milk or hot chocolate anyway, using this product can be a great way to get some additional nutrients into them.  I would rate this higher

review/summary: N O T......A......D I E T......D R I N K ....?.?
review/text: Despite the reservations I have about this product, CARNATION INSTANT BREATKFAST ESSENTIALS, COMPLETE NUTRITIONAL DRINK, NO SUGAR ADDED, 8.46 OUNCES, PACK OF 3 --I must say here that it tastes very, very, very, very, VERY G O O D : ),  (Yummy!!!!!)  It's somewhat of a misnomer, then, that I give it only two stars -- I DO like it -- but the only thing I like about it is the taste....and the fact that it mixes easily.  However, I do have very serious reservations about the sweetener combination which is in this product, and the fact that it labeled, (clearly, but in a place somewhat difficult to find on the label) NOT A LOW-CALORIE FOOD.....<br /><br />This powder mixes well with milk -- but, as with many ready-to-mix drinks, one must add the powder TO the milk and mix.  The old idea of adding a bit of milk to the powder, making a paste, then adding more milk, only makes for a cakey mess with these newer products.  So, it is curious to me that the directions on the back of the package say: "TO MIX, Scoop 1/4 cup, or 4 level tablespoons into large glass.  Add 1 cup cold, fat free milk, stir."  Well, I guess it could work both ways, (making a paste of a small amount of milk and a small amount of poweder is still not recommended here -- rather adding a lot of milk to the powder) -- but I find that adding the powder TO the milk works well for me.<br /><br />And yes, it is filling.  Not quite so filling as the NOW NUTRITION CHOCOLATE WHEY mix, (which I have also reviewed for Amazon) -- but this Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials Milk Chocolate No Sugar Added drink is much, much easier to prepare, and also has fewer calories.<br /><br />However, Carnation Instant Breakfast Drink Essentials Milk Chocolate, No Sugar Added, is NOT A LOW CALORIE FOOD.  It says so, in smallish letters, right there on the bottom of the left side of the cannister.  Just where a picture of the FRONT of the cannister, (most usually used to advertise this product), will NOT show it!  It's true that the only trace of sugar in this drink is from the lactose in the powdered,nonfat milk which is the first ingredient listed. This gives the product 7 grams of sugar.  Not a lot, but....  The strange thing is, however, that this product, though hiding the words, "Not A Low Calorie Food" on its label, actually HAS made me lose weight.  Yes, it took some effort -- but not as mcuh as usually.  BECAUSE CARNATION INSTANT BREAKFAST ESSENTIALS, (at least in this milk chocolate flavour), DID MAKE ME FEEL FULL, AND NOT TOO HUNGRY, FOR AT LEAST THREE HOURS!  It contains 60 calories per serving, (without milk), compared to 130 calories per serving, (also without milk), of the less-costly full-sugar version.  A low-calorie food probably has less than 60 calories per serving but, as the product here being reviewed DID make me feel full, (and also gave me vitamins and minerals), I was able to lose about 10 pounds using it as one of my meals each day.  But -- although I totally love chocolate drinks, it DID get a bit boring drinkng just this chocolate milk drink for one meal each day.  Hmmm...I see it ALSO comes, (in the sugared variety), in "chocolate malt" flavour,  Yum!  I've ALWAYS loved chocolate malteds, ever since I was little.  OK -- it will have twice the calories, but, even so....using 3 envelopes, (as I sometimes do), per 20-ounce glass size, this would give me 390 calories per 20 ounce glass.  Not bad or a meal.  The only trouble is, of course, that flavours OTHER than plain chocolate, (as is the item being reviewed here), plain vanilla and plain strawberrry, are available ONLY in 10 individual envelope boxes.  I like the freedom, (and lesser expense), of a cannister --which is why I probably bought the chocolate flavour, instead of the chocolate malt flavour, this first time.  Oh, well, I guess I can always combine them....<br /><br />The no-sugar powedered chocolate flavour, being reviewed here, (and probably most of the other flavours), contains powdered milk.  Which is nice if all you want to add is water.  However, the powdered milk used here, though fat-free, is NOT lactose-free.  Which is important, if you are lactose intolerant.<br /><br />True, there is no sugar in this product.  However, here is where I get very nervous reading the ingredients, and imbibing the product, however good it may taste.  For, what gives this product its sweet tast is two other kinds of sweetening: ACESULFAME POTASSIUM, and SUCRALOSE, (which usually goes by the trade name of SPLENDA.)  Sucralose -- as Splenda -- has been called the safest of the artificial sweeteners, in "Eat This, Not That -- Supermarket Survival Guide", by David Zinczenko and Matt Goulding, and is recommended, highly, by Dr. Jana Klauer, a Park Avenue, New York, diet doctor, in her book, "How The Rich Get Thin". Still, sucralose/Splenda has been linked to shrinkage of the body's vital "t" cells, (as these grow shorter, a person ages more), and, being made from sugar, (albeit changed from sugar by replacing one sugar molecule with another), it still oould, concievably, cause cancer, as it IS made FROM sugar to begin with.  However, I, personally, am much more concerned about the ACESULFAME POTASSIUM, (a.p.) sweetener in this product.  Although acesufame potassium is often mixed with splenda/sucralose in many products, I don't like the idea of "a.p." -- which has often been cited as a potential cancer causer, and, unlike splenda/sucralose, is NOT made from a naturally-occuring substance, (sugar) -- to be mixed with anything else. Except maybe with sugar itself, which is totally natural.  Mixing a.p. with anything else -- even the relatively safe(?) splenda/sucralose, raises little alarm bells in my mind.  Maybe I'm being overly cautious here --but when I mentioned this to my doctor, he agreed.<br /><br />Therefore, I feel this product should be used with caution, even by diabetics.  (Diabetics have enough problems --surely they don't need a potential cancer causer combination!)  The "regular", sugared variety of Carnation Breakfast Essentials, Milk Chocolate (or any other) Flavour, will be my choice from now on.  There is about twice as much product in the non-sugar-free variety.  This "sugar-free" variety has on its label: "NOT A LOW CALORIE FOOD", right there on the bottom left of the front of the label, as I have stated before. Still, as I also stated before, it actually did make me feel full....and therefore, did help me lose (a little) weight....<br /><br />But yes, this is yummy stuff.  Very, very tasty.  But I am reminded of a fairy-tale, in which a human man was captured by an ogre.  The ogre's wife gave him some oatmeal --poisoned oatmeal.  "This stuff is good", said the man.  "Can I have some more?"  "Certainly," said the ogre's wife.  Sadly, the man was soon not able to ask for a third helping....or indeed, anything else.<br /><br />Another reviewer has said that it gives him or her diarrhea -- but this can have a good effect on those beset with constipation!  Bu there are other remedies for constipation -- and I am hoping that Carnation Breakfast Essentials, (REGULAR), Milk Chocolate Flavour, will be one of them!

A doggy nutritionist who contacts each manufacturer herself recommended this combination for my Chi because he has bad knees (a typical problem found in small breeds).  She suggested that he should stay away from grains because they are a pro-inflammatory and could make his knees hurt more.<br />It's difficult to find the smaller cans for my little Chi in town, so I've had to order them.  It's not good to keep them after you've opened them for more than a couple of days.<br />Good company and good food for your dog!

review/summary: Great, healthier pasta - my family loves it!
review/text: I've purchased other Bionaturae pastas before, and this, like the others, was a big hit with the family.  This brand is healther than white pasta, but doesn't have the gummy taste you get sometimes from whole wheat products.  The kids and adults alike love it, and I feel a whole lot better about serving it.  Doesn't hurt that it's organic, either.<br /><br />Amazon's price for this and the other Bionaturae products is much better than the grocery store, especially if you use the automatic/subscription feature, where you get an additional discount.  With the discount and free shipping, it's almost the same price as the brand name, white flour products you find at the store, but it's a much better health choice!

review/summary: Great taste, nice texture
review/text: Previously, we usually stayed away from whole wheat pasta because we didn't like the texture of those we tried (they tended to be either too chewy or too "grainy" for our taste, no matter how we cooked them). The bionaturae Organic Whole Wheat Fusilli are a whole different story. Not only do they taste great, but the texture is also very similar to that of good regular pasta. That's not to say that the texture is the _same_ as that of regular pasta, but it's a very good texture. So if hang-ups about texture kept you away from whole wheat pasta in the past, you may want to give this one a shot.

review/summary: perfect pasta- not gluey, chewy or nutty
review/text: This is the BEST whole wheat pasta we've had, and trust me- we've tried most of them. My daughter, who is four years old and a SUPER picky eater, prefer this over her regular semolina pasta. Not only does it taste really great, it stands up to just about anything you subject it to- overcooking, baking with sauces, being sauteed in oil, refrigeration, etc.<br /><br />The bionaturae pastas all cook up lovely. And unlike other whole wheat pastas, there's no weird aftertaste or bitterness no matter how long you cook it for. No matter how al dente (or how tender) you like your pasta cooked, this pasta holds up to whatever you subject it to. We tend to like pasta more on the tender side, and the pasta retains its shape, doesn't disintegrate or get glue-y even after 12 minutes in boiling water. Holds on to sauces very nicely. Also refrigerates well after being mixed with sauces.<br /><br />The Fusilli is a nice pasta for all around use- I use this when I want a big bowl of pasta and tomato sauce. I love the texture as well as the taste.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great texture and taste
review/text: I switched over to whole grain pasta years ago. I happen to love the texture of whole wheat, while some of my family thinks it tastes grainy. This pasta does not have that typical grainy texture of a whole wheat pasta. As an Italian, I love that this brand carries many diff shapes as well. If you've never tried whole wheat, I suggest starting with this product!

review/summary: Healthy and tastes good too
review/text: I do love regular semolina pasta, but I had to switch to whole wheat after being told to limit my processed carb and sugar intake. I tried so hard with whole wheat...even managing to choke down a half and half mixture, but it played havoc with my digestive system, and the taste and texture were so bad that I would actually become nauseous after eating it.<br /><br />Then I stumbled across a review of whole wheat pastas. I had no idea they could be different, but bionaturae received rave reviews, so I placed an order. Am I glad I did. Fantastic pasta that has almost the same texture as "white" pasta and none of that heavy gumminess that makes other whole wheat brands so hard to choke down. Fusilli is my to-go shape as it holds onto sauces so well. I love pairing it with some seafood alfredo or a hearty marinara. I even like it just plain with some butter and parmigian cheese. After having consistent, positive results with both this and the spaghetti, I can safely recommend any of the shapes by this brand.

review/summary: great pasta...all y'all go buy some now!
review/text: I love this pasta.  I hate it when I go to my local grocery stores and I have to choose between white organic pasta (which is organic, but wicked hard on my sugar level), and whole wheat conventional pasta (which is easier on my sugar level, but it full of all those pesticides and whatnot that make it into all foods that are not organic).<br /><br />No more false choices!  This is the good stuff.  Organic, and whole wheat, and yummy!  I love the rotini/fusilli shapes the best because they catch any kind of sauce you want to put on the pasta (pesto, tomato sauce, you name it!).

review/summary: A non-gritty wheat pasta
review/text: I have tried switching to wheat pasta several times, after learning and understanding how white/processed flour carbs are processed in our bodies (raising blood glucose levels, contributing to fat storage, etc). The gritty texture just turned me off. However, this pasta is GREAT! It doesn't taste exactly like regular pasta, but the difference is hardly noticeable and the texture is really similar. I feel better eating pasta when I know it is more nutritious than the regular white flour variety.

review/summary: Great dog treat.
review/text: I have used RedBarn for years. My dog loves it.  I cut it into two inch chunks, Freeze it, and keep one chunk in the refrigerator. I cut off a small slice as a treat as Mosby (my dog) and I walk. He loves it and is eager to obey me.  (Mosby is a relatively good dog, German Shepherd).<br />Other dogs we've tried it on also loved it and were easier to train. In one case, the owner said he was untrainable, and after a sample of the dog treat, he quickly learned to come to my whistle.<br /><br />I routinely walk Mosby without a leash. He comes to a call, clap, or whistle (assuming the proper reward).<br /><br />Unlike hot dog slices, this stuff is good for him.  Mosby is now 11 YO and in fairly good shape.

That was then. Today,it is a mainstay for our dog rescue for elderly dogs with bad or no teeth, ill dogs as a wholesome and natural food product, or as ways to tempt the pickiest dog and the ones with sensitive stomaches. There is nothing to compare. And as far as Amazon's PetFood Direct, they deliver faster than any company I buy from! Today, I buy three rolls of the 4 lb. roll at a time --- chicken only!

review/text: I use this product for training my dogs.  I cut it into slices, and then into small bite size pieces.  My dog will perform almost any trick for these treats.  I don't worry about giving her too much, because it is pretty healthy.  Some of the dog owners will give their dogs cut up hotdogs at the training classes, and although that is probably ok, I feel these are a lot healthier for my pet.  Also, for the money, you get a lot more treats than you would when buying prepackaged training treats.

review/summary: QUALITY AND FLEXIBILITY
review/text: I've owned five German Shepherds, one Dalmation, and one mixed breed dog over a 15 plus yr. period. The Redbarn product is far superior in quality. Not one dog has disliked the product. The plus is that you don't have to refrigerate the Red Barn roll until it is opened. Also, the portions of food you use from the roll can be adjusted by you in the event your budget is a little tighter at certain times of the month. I put slices of the food on top of a good quality dry dog kibble when I need to stretch my money.  I like the variety in sizes of the rolls as well as varied content of each roll.  Finally, many sources are embracing this product, and I am glad this site sells it at the most reasonable prices I have seen.  LORI, Phila.

review/text: I love this stuff. My DOG loves this stuff. I don't use it as a food but as a training aid. They are strong-smelling enough to be effective, I take the entire roll and cut the whole thing up into little cubes (about 1CM). I put a handfuls into seperate baggies, saving one to train immediately then freeze the rest. As soon as one baggie is empty, I move another bag from the freezer to the fridge to defrost. My dog is now trained but still gets these as a treat. Now we have a puppy and he is motivated to learn quickly with these!

review/text: I am a professional dog trainer and I buy this product constantly.  It's a good price for a training treat. One 4 lb roll will last me just over a month when actively training large breed dogs. ( I would say would last one month, as training treats, for 2-3 large breed dogs, depending on their food drive).  I find this to be relatively gentle on their stomachs as well.

review/text: Well, thanks to the internet, what was once available at Brick & Mortar stores is long gone. So, amazon it was. These vials were the right price and the right colour glass (I needed clear, NOT amber or blue) so I ordered them, with fingers crossed.<br /><br />Arrived very, very fast (only days via USPS) and very well-packaged. SCORE!!!! What I'm using them for is sharing extremely expensive spices and flavoured oils (Fiori di Sicilia and White Truffle oil, for example) with friend's who can't afford the full-sized item. These luxury food items last forever because you use them in such small amounts but cost an arm and a leg to buy the original packaging. So, I'm "sharing the wealth" with beloved friends so they can also try these lovely flavours but don't have to spring for the Big Bucks. From oils, to food powders (Vermont Cheese/Vietnamese Cinnamon) to several gourmet salts, these vials are just the right size for my friends to get a good taste and decide if they want or need more, in the larger containers. If they do, I automatically will have future gifts for them which I know they'll cherish rather than go "ick"! LOL<br /><br />Nice way to share the bounties you have with those you love. &lt;3

review/summary: Dogs love it!
review/text: I bought this because it's a tad more affordable than Natural Balance's food roll.  I cut this roll up into bite size pieces and use it as a positive food reward when training my dogs.  Much to my suprise, both my cats LOVE this stuff as well so I crumble a bit of it into their food and they gobble it right down.  My eldercat is thin and I have a hard time keeping weight on her, and she will just about do back flips for this stuff.  Came as a huge shock to me because she only likes sweet, creamy treats like cream and yogurt.  Anyway, 4 lbs cut into cubes will last you a pretty long time, and when fed as treats won't cause your animal to have gastric upset.. atleast not mine.  2 thumbs up!

review/summary: Always Pleased
review/text: I've used Redbarn beef rolls and chicken and liver rolls for many years..  Because they are a balanced food, they don't create nutritional gaps if used often for positive reinforcement and are great for puppy training.  I would cut them up into small squares and put them in sandwich baggies for my pockets. I prefer Redbarn to other brands because they do not cause the enormous stools the others do, which tells me those brands contain a lot of filler.  They also do not contain nitrites.  Eventually I began using them to feed a very picky eater who was always too thin, which is the reason I still purchase them, though she is no longer too thin!  They do contain wheat, an allergen for many dogs.  The Lamb & Rice flavor does not, but my picky eater won't eat that one.

review/summary: Perfect for Dog Training
review/text: This is good stuff.  Smells and looks like sausage. Easy to cut into small training sized portions.  Not as gooey at other semi-moist treats, so it keeps your hands and treat bag clean. Keeps well in the fridge.  Training is much more effective when I'm using this.  Hard to find, so buy it here!

review/text: This is our Shiz-zu's favorite dog food.  He will eat it dry or mixed with canned.  We Motorhome so the convience of the rolled product is much easier and lighter than canned food.  I have found when I open a new roll, I cut it into 1" slices and store in zip lock in fridge.  This makes it very convenient to take out a slice, cut and serve.  Introduce slowly as your pet could experience loose stools as first.

review/summary: Good Mix Of Spices
review/text: These grinders are a large size and will come in handy around home. They have a nice mix of spices in them and tasted great when put on garlic bread last night before it was baked. I also put some on the chicken we had and it did well on that too. I can see using this on pizza and all other kinds of dishes. I'll probably bring one over to my sons place, he loves to cook for his family and the three pack I recieved will probably outlast my lifetime.<br /><br />UPDATE:  This is really a wonderful mix of seasonings. I've used it on garlic bread, added it to some marinade for chicken to be cooked on the grill (everyone remarked how wonderful the spices on the chicken were), added some to pasta salad and on regular green salads too. I use it everywhere sice I purchased it. I do share one with one of our sons and he too loves it on all kinds of things. I originally thought the three large grinders would last me a lifetime.....NOT SO, I am already out of one of the two I kept and son is almost out of the one I gave him, I'm using the second one of mine right now and it is about half gone so I'll be ordering this again.

review/summary: Gives you STAMINA, not just a quick pick me up & crash.
review/text: I highly recommend this tea.<br /><br />First, its claims:<br />I've been drinking it for three years, and I started by picking it up at my local organic co-op.  I tend to be very skeptical, so even though the tea said 'energy' I figured it would be because of the minimal amount of the caffeine in green tea and not whatever else they put in it.<br /><br />I was very, very wrong.  This stuff doesn't give you wham-bam energy like large amounts of caffeine, instead it gives you what I think of as more stamina.  So unlike caffeine with the quick pick up and crash, it will definitely help you keep going and, more importantly, lets you down very gently so that you don't suddenly feel like you're going to start snoring in the middle of typing.  Also, unlike large amounts of caffeine, I'm able to sleep well after drinking multiple cups of this tea over the course of the day.<br /><br />Second, taste:<br />I like the taste, but agree that it would be very possible to dislike it, so try the tea before you stock up on 12 boxes.  I add a small amount of sugar to the tea to counteract a tiny bit of bitterness that's there if you want to drink it straight, but this would also be very drinkable with no sugar added if you're accustomed to that sort of thing.  (My favorite type of tea is chai, and I'm a sugar addict.)<br /><br />To summarize:<br />If you're looking for some sort of energy drink jolt type junk, keep going.  This tea isn't going to rocket blast you out of your seat, but it will provide a strong, gentle boost and take away some of your perception of your fatigue.

review/summary: More than you wanted to know about the herbs contained herein
review/text: First off, let me just say that after trying MANY teas (including many of the other Yogi flavors) this is -in my humble opinion- the best tasting. I make my own teas with natural herbs/teas and a press, but any time I'm in a hurry or want to treat myself I grab one of the Yogi Energy tea bags because, honestly, it tastes better.<br />I will say that I am a wimp and never drink tea without honey. This tea tastes fantastic with a touch of honey and lemon!<br /><br />That being said, lets break down the two "power herbs" in this tea-bag; Ginseng and Spearmint. These are two popular herbs for energy. For my own teas, my top choices would be Ginseng, Peppermint and Rosemary, simply for their incredible energetic properties and HOARDS of other benefits... but I suppose Yogi has tailored this to taste the most pleasing as well, since most people don't know (or care) much about the herbs as much as the taste. (Licorice is a fantastic herb for energy too, but its taste is overpowering).<br /><br />Here are some of the other benefits of Ginseng and Spearmint:<br /><br />--Ginseng Root (Eleutherococcus senticosus)--<br />(Excerpts from The How to Herb Book)<br />Ginseng is considered a cure-all in China. It is a hormonal herb that is good for both men and women since it regulates both male and female hormones. It is considered good for both mental and physical health and builds resistance to all kinds of stress.<br />Is especially good for men because it helps alleviate and prevent impotency.<br />Is non-toxic and used in preventative medicine because it strengthens the body's entire defense mechanism.<br />Benefits the pituitary and adrenal glands.<br />Regulates and normalizes blood pressure and blood sugar levels.<br />Considered to slow the aging process.<br />Used with gotu-kola and Cayenne as a "pick-me-up."<br />Has been used for the following:<br />-Endurance<br />-Energy<br />-Impotency (for men)<br />-Longevity<br />-Pituitary gland<br />-Prostate<br /><br />--Spearmint (Mentha spicata)--<br />(Excerpts from Nutritional Herbology)<br />Contains aromatic compounds that increase the production of digestive fluids and enzymes, relieve smooth muscle spasms, increase blood circulation, promote sweating, relieve pain and are antiseptic. It also contains astringent compounds that shrink inflamed tissues. Spearmint has been used to treat indigestion, morning sickness, nausea, menstrual cramps, flatulence, muscle aches, flu and vomiting.<br />From my studies and experience Spearmint is helpful for the following:<br />-Any sort of digestive problem<br />-Flatulance<br />-Aids for curing Colds and the Flu<br />-Folklore says it has abilities to fight tumors and cancer<br /><br />I don't understand why Yogi put Lemongrass in this tea, as it is known as a light sedative. It is, however, usually a tasty additive, so I suppose they added a touch of it for flavor purposes.<br /><br />So my personal summary is this; There are herbs that have stronger energetic properties than some that have been chosen for this tea, however the taste is superb and this is a fantastic introduction into the green tea world, especially if you are wanting to switch from Coffee to a 'healthy' amount of energy without the drop. You can easily and healthily drink 3 cups a day if you want, and it will only do your body, immune system, muscles and lungs good!<br /><br />Happy Sipping.

review/summary: Green Tea with a Good Taste, Energy Boost and Price!
review/text: I was buying this stuff locally at my grocery store for over $5/box until I found it on Amazon. The tea has a delicate flavor, that isn't overwhelming in anyway. The ingredients seem to balance each other nicely. Now, as far as energy goes, you aren't going to get a "jolt" effect (Red Bull, Coffee, Etc.), but you do get a very nice sustained "boost". I usually have a cup in the morning, and a second shortly after lunch for an all day sustained level of energy. I highly recommend this, any any of the other Yogi products to all of my friends and coworkers. It's truly a great tea! ~ Cheers!<br /><br />(I also drink Yogi's Bedtime tea, and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants help sleeping without the harsh effects of drugs and/or hormones.)

I think anyone who drinks green tea already would get used to it very quickly.

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: I bought this tea because it had good ratings, though I was a bit afraid that I was not going to like the taste based on other comments.<br /><br />Well, I loved it.  The taste is very herbal and may be a bit bitter (do NOT use boiling water to make the tea).  I add a bit of sugar to make it more palatable, and I actually like its taste.  Also, I noticed that it indeed does give me energy, at least as much if not more than caffeine.  It's more of a long-lasting stamina feeling, not necessarily the rush energy caffeine gives.  Also, I never feel like I crash a while after drinking it as it sometimes happens with coffee.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this tea.

review/summary: definitely gives you energy  :)
review/text: I just finished my first cup of this tea & i am full of energy now.<br /><br />This is a green tea that has kombucha & ginseng in it. (ginseng gives me energy but i can't have too much of it. i guess i am sensitive to ginseng as if i have a lot i get WAY too amped up. So YOGI's royal vitality ginseng tea was too much for me to handle)  I figured this blend of green tea & ginseng would be good for a day like today when i just can't get motivated to do anything.  All day long i have felt SO sleepy & lazy. Sure enough the one cup did give me some nice gentle energy but didn't make me feel jittery or weird.  Now other people may want to double the strength or have 2 cups, i doubt everyone is as  sensitive to ginseng as i am.  Anyway, in my experience it was a nice subtle energy booster.  The flavor is kind of earthy/grassy. It is nice, not bitter or icky.  Not sweet either though.  So if you only like minty-sweet types you may not like this.  I prefer sweeter flavors normally but i do like this one as well. (YOGI teas are always nice smooth blends. i'm a big fan)<br /><br />  But i agree with the previous reviewer that the taste may not be for everyone.  I recommend, if at all possible, trying out 1 box of tea before buying in bulk.  So pick some up if they sell this at a local supermarket or tea shop.  Personally i really enjoyed it, both for the flavor & for the energy it gave me.  It inspired me to hop on the computer & review it.  Now i'm gonna work out & get dinner going  :)

review/text: I just received this today in the mail, and tried out my first cup. Much to my surprise, the taste was very good, and I hardly needed any sweetener to actually drink it. This has spearmint and kombucha in it, and I don't know what major effect those had on the tea overall, but I'm fully aware of additional benefits it can provide. I actually like this way better than the Celestial Seasonings green tea. This tastes more authentic and it's organic which is a big thing for me. I'll definitely have to recommend this to anyone I know who drinks green tea. So far, so good with this one. Thanks Amazon for carrying this.

review/summary: Won't be disappointed
review/text: I first tried this as a gift from a co-worker. I like that it's all natural and that it's actually "leaves" and not the powder they sell in the supermarkets. I loved this tea. Had it without any sweetener and it's just great. It's mild flavored and you can leave the bag in the whole time for a stronger flavor.<br />The cost is excellent for a case of 6. I can't buy this in this grocery I usually shop at, so it is a plus to have it available at Amazon. The auto-ship is a good deal if you know how much you'll be drinking.<br />I "think" it gives me energy. Don't know if it's my imagination or not, but I do feel good after having a couple of cups. I will continue to drink this and probably try the other flavors they have. If you go to the Yogi site you can get more details on each kind and then get a cheaper deal at Amazon.

review/summary: Herb-y and Unusual
review/text: ****<br />This Green Tea Energy from Yogi Tea is a "natural energy boost".  It's an unusual, rather herb-y tasting natural herbal tea made from organic green tea leaf, Asian (Panax) ginseng, organic lemongrass, organic spearmint leaf, ginseng-eleuthero extract (Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolium, Eleutherococcus senticosus), and kombucha . The taste is very difficult for me, and the kombucha comes across extra strong. I predict that you'll either love or hate the taste of this tea; try it first before you buy it in large quantities.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Green Tea Energy comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />According to Yogi Tea, this tea is 70% organic and is intended to enhance the immune system and to fight fatigue. It contains 28mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee).<br /><br />I gave this tea only four stars because the taste is so hard for me to handle. It is, however, a quality tea, and if you like it, there are many benefits to be gained.<br /><br />Recommended, if you can stand the taste.<br />****

review/text: Next to the Goya Pico, I think this is the best locally available salsa on the shelves<br />today.<br /><br />I did note other reviews that said this product had "changed." That could be, the company<br />was bought by the giant food processor and enemy of the consumer Hormel. Not long ago, Hormel<br />was a name you could depend on, but they have reformulated so many of their canned products<br />its impossible to recognize them anymore.<br /><br />In any event, this is still a very good salsa, much better than all your other store bought<br />options, and at a better price than all the boutique salsas that keep popping up for insane<br />ticket prices like $6-7 a jar. A fresh tomato and onion base with the enough chiles to get<br />your attention, and the exact blend of garlic and cilantro will make you beg for more. The<br />perfect compliment to any meal, or just on chips or even to reconstitute dishes like spaghetti<br />or to enhance soups, you will absolutely love this stuff.

BUT what it REALLY shines as is a "base" for making your own homemade salsa.<br /><br />Take this salsa, add in some roasted and chopped tomatoes and jalapenos and green chiles and garlic that you roast in your own oven.  Add a little fresh cilantro and maybe a bit of sweet onion.<br /><br />BINGO !!  Awesome homemade salsa.  I just made some yesterday and had some just now and DANG it was GOOD !!  I make it like this ALL the time.  Wally World has larger cans for a good price.

review/summary: Watery and lacking flavor
review/text: I'm always on the lookout for a good salsa, and prefer salsas that deliver both robust flavor and heat. Sadly, Herdez fails on both accounts.<br /><br />My first impression when pour some salsa into a bowl was how much water there was. I had shaken the bottle prior to opening, and expected a better mix. The flavor was weak. For such a simple recipe I expected to taste tomatoes and onions, but there was really nothing there. The heat was also far short of what I expected from a salsa listed as hot. A little of an afterburn, but disappointing.<br /><br />I'll not be buying another bottle. The only reason this isn't a one-star review is that it is affordable and could be used as a base for a better home-brew salsa, but I expect to be able to dig in right out of the jar.

review/summary: not the same as before
review/text: Herdez salsa has a new paper label on the jar.  It's not the same product.  It seems to contain the same ingredients but the texture and the taste are different and I don't like it anymore.  I loved their previous product but have thrown out my latest purchase.  It sucks!

review/summary: I AM REVIEWING PEPSI
review/text: I'm a Coke fan, first and foremost. I want to put that out there first.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />I enjoy Pepsi as well. What draws me to Coke is what I like to call the "Coke burn." That initial burn when you chug a Coke. What draws me to Pepsi is the exact opposite. Pepsi has a much smoother taste.<br /><br />What I like most about Pepsi, though, is that it's so hard to screw up. Sure, pre-mixed bottled/canned Pepsi is always good, but fountain drinks are something different entirely. And, Pepsi is one of those sodas that is incredibly hard to mess up.<br /><br />What I'm saying is that when you can't get a good Coke, Pepsi is a respectible substitute.

review/summary: Very Overpriced
review/text: This is about double what you would pay just to pick up at a store you would be at any ways. Not really worth the convenience. Again this is for a Pepsi 24 case not something bigger or any really nice deal you might think it is. This is just a clever rip off for those who wanted to make things a little easier on them selves. Or if you are like me and have a busted back and have to rely on others to do your shopping a way to ease the burden you put on them. Now if they decide to drop the price or make it worth while I will be the first to come back and change the review and start subscribing. Please do not fall victim to this and waste your money on something you can pick up at the store you are already at anyways.

review/summary: SOME THOUGHTS TO PONDER BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AND GIVE IT TO YOUR FUR FRIENDS
review/text: Well, I have very mixed emotions (some practical; some pure speculation and some possibly unreasonable) about this particular product.  Please note that I have given these treats only three stars...this is over the objection of my dogs who absolutely love these things.<br /><br />I have four dogs and our family spends much time with them.  A lot of time is spent in training and we have found that "treat food" is a wonderful motivator; the more the dogs like the treat, the better they perform.<br /><br />Now there is no doubt that these are a desirable little jar of goodies as far as the taste of our particular dogs is concerned...there is not problem in this area.  I must admit though that I was negligent in doing my research on these things and simply did not read the labeling as I should have done.  Thanks to a couple of wonderful reviews here which brought to my attention that these little things are made in CHINA, I no longer use them.  Perhaps this is being overly cautious and perhaps being overly zealous is my private little hang-up about only buying American made products when ever possible, but so be it.<br /><br />While we have had no health problems with our dogs since using this product, it must be noted that there have been several instances (as noted by other reviewers) of tainted animal food coming out of China.  If you will note, there have also been quite a number of instances where tainted human baby products have been shipped and sold in this country which were also manufactured in china.  Now it would only seem logical to me that if a manufacturing firm or firms made, released and sold products that are harmful to humans, then even less thought would be given to products for "animals."  Perhaps I am wrong here, but it is never-the-less how I see it.<br /><br />Now are dogs are fed these things in very small amounts so  the possibility that they would be injured by a product that was actually tainted is slim, but still and all I am not willing to take this chance with the lives of our dogs who are, in all reality, members of our family.<br /><br />I am also absolutely sick and tired of spending my hard earned money on products that could be and should be manufactured here at home...good grief...this cannot be good for us as a country!<br /><br />To use these things is of course ultimately the decision of each individual.  This is my take on the situation as to the product, and as I said, we will not longer be using it.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: Used to buy but Made in China...
review/text: My dogs love these treats but with the Made in China label, I don't buy them anymore.  The AVMA and FDA has issued warnings related to chicken jerky treats made in China and my wonderful vet made me aware of this.  I'm very unhappy about this as my dogs really do love them.  But I love my dogs enough that I won't purchase these or other Made in China treats.  And let me tell you - that's a challenge.<br />Let me note that I did a search on Amazon for "Dog treats made in USA" and this product came up.  If it doesn't actually say in the description that product is "Made in the USA", it's not.
