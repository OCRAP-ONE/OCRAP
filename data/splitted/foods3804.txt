review/summary: Great for pets too!
review/text: I started using Manuka honey when my Yorkies began experiencing stomach problems.  Just a little bit on a small piece of bread a few times per week and alls well.  There's several studies on this product and all have been favorable.  I was hesitant to gives it to my dogs but they had severe problems once a month and I hated seeing them in pain not eating for days at a time.  The Manuka has been a miracle and well worth the price for it's intended use.  If you want a sweetner in your tea, buy the cheap stuff.  If you want to cure a nasty stomach problem for you or your pets, try Manuka.  Get at least a +16.

review/summary: MANUKA HONEY
review/text: This is my 2nd time doing business with Kevin's Natural Spot and once again I have to say that I am an extremely happy customer.  The product, Manuka Honey, arrived on time and was packed perfectly. The Manuka Honey which I am using as a natural alternative to modern medicine is working wonders for me and my mother.  I take a tablespoon 2 times a day and also use it topically as a skin healer.  It also has completely healed my mother's third degree burn on her hand.  My mother had approximately a 2 inch gaping, open wound from the burn and within a day of applying this honey, the wound already showed signs of healing in which new skin began to form.  This honey is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Thanks for a wonderfully smooth transaction Kevin's Natural Spot.  Looking forward to many more purchases in the near future.

review/text: I purchased this product because I had been diagnosed with H-Pylori.  I had finished the antibiotic therapy but wanted to be sure I was free of the bacteria.  I have ordered my second jar.  I am not sure that there are 4 one teaspoon a day for 30 days in the jar.  I ran out before the 30 days was up, but it was close.  I will be retested when I get home in April to make sure the bacteria is gone.  But the honey is easy to take compared to antibiotics.  Now whether it would cure H-Pylori without the antibiotics or not I do not know.<br /><br />JMW

review/text: This is not the best manuka honey you can buy. My jar arrived with a flimsy lid (I should have returned it right then, but I wanted to give it a try). The honey feels diluted and it doesn't have the consistency of real manuka honey. Yes, it's cheaper, but in the long run, you're better off with a more expensive, but potent product.

review/text: I call this kitty crack, because the simple crinkle of the bag will produce any result you desire.  He becomes the the feline version of Tyrone Bigguns (Dave Chappelle's Show) if he even thinks he'll get a hit.  The only other time I've seen this type of reaction, is when he has access to cat nip.  If the bag is sitting on the couch, he'll paw at it for more crack.  He likes all flavors, though I suspect the dairy is his least favorite - but not enough for him to not eat them.  Also, when we go away for a weekend or so, we'll leave some through the house to keep him happy.  Your cat will thank you.

review/summary: It Doesn't Get Much Better
review/text: As a long-time green tea (and coffee) drinker, I was much pleased with this Genmaicha Tea.  The brown rice is roasted sufficiently and in sufficient quantity to give a nice balance to the green tea, both sharpening the flavor while sweetening it a bit.  But don't get confused: it is not a "sweet" tea.  The brown rice gives the tea a sense of "hops" as one would find in a quality brown beer.  If you are a fan of the style of Genmaicha tea, I heartily recommend trying this brand.  I'll be back for more!

review/summary: Great Mustard!
review/text: I went to a restaurant a few weeks ago and ordered some Bratwurst.  They served a small cup with mustard on the side.  I was so impressed by the bold flavor that I decided to ask the wait staff what kind of mustard they served me.  I'm throwing an Oktoberfest party this weekend and decided to order this mustard to be featured in the party.  It's got a nice thick consistency and is very balanced.  I would say that it's not quite as strong as chinese mustard, but 'reminds' me of the strong stuff that clears your nasal passages.<br /><br />This is not as flavorful as a stone-ground mustard or something with a blend of mustard seeds.  It's not the standard horseradish mustard either.  It's very good though.  I can't wait to see how the party-goers like it.

review/summary: Christmasy heaven!
review/text: Alriiiight I am so glad I decided to get this one now! I definitely debated as to whether I should drink it before Christmas. My curiosity got the better of me and I had to open it when it arrived. Oh! The smell is creeeeamy. It reminds me a lot of Bavarian Cream matcha but with a hint of allspice.<br /><br />I whipped it up and added a bit of sugar. Eggnog as a beverage is usually thick and creamy and coats your throat! I routinely cut mine with milk to make it a little more thin. This technique also makes the Eggnog last longer! The taste of the matcha reminds me a lot of my "milked" down version - the texture as well!<br /><br />For my next cup I upped the creamy ante and added cold milk (I'm not a hot Eggnog drinker, always has to be cold!). This helped a lot with the eggnog taste! It was sweet and just a tad of allspice was present. I'll admit the taste does remind me more of the Bavarian Cream than Eggnog - but that is not a problem in this household!<br /><br />All in all it's a very tasty matcha - does leave a bit to be desired when it comes to associating with the name, but the amazing flavour certainly makes it worth it. Once I get some spiced rum, it'll be splashed in with vigor!

I instantly started singing Fa la la la la ...<br />A huge smile came to my face. &#8232;I knew this was going to be a re-order SOON!<br />Then I took my first sip.<br />It needed sugar.<br />I was a little deflated.<br />I mean it was good and all but its one of those flavors you just know needs a little push to make it POP.<br />So a little sugar was added.<br />Better but it does not have the wow factor I was hoping.<br />Now please, bear in mind, I about had a special moment when I smelled it in dry form. My eyes literally rolled back in my head so my expectations were REALLY high!<br />It is quite pleasing nonetheless but its not going to knock Butterscotch or Macadamia Nut out of my top two list.<br />I will play around with this one some more though to see what I can do with it. It may be better iced as I had this one straight with a little milk which made it sort of luke warm.<br />Still, this is going to score in the high 80' as really there is nothing bad you could get from Red Leaf its just now that I have tried so many I do have my favorites that others need to stand up to.

review/summary: Nog Nog Noggin' on heaven's door....
review/text: Oh, egg nog. When Red Leaf Tea first contacted me, asking what flavors of matcha I'd be interested in trying, my immediate response was this. Egg nog. Oh goodness, egg nog. Please, oh please, egg nog. When the holidays come around, I miss it with a burning passion. There's just too much cream in it for it to be worth the risk, unfortunately. We have been able to find soy nog, but it's just not the same. But I have to say, it does the trick when I'm really just dying for a cup of nog. It certainly brought my father in law and me closer last Christmas when he was always more than happy to get me a glass of soy nog so he had an excuse to grate fresh nutmeg on top. He cracks me up.<br /><br />So this matcha had high, high, high expectations to live up to. It was delicious, very much so, but a little weak. I got a hint of eggnog flavor that was greatly overshadowed by the flavor of the matcha. Which isn't a bad flavor at all, it just isn't what I want when I drink egg nog. Maybe a little soy milk will bring out that creaminess for me and give me that egg nog flavor I crave.

review/summary: Delicious, spot on, Eggnog Matcha!
review/text: While being vegan/vegetarian I've ventured into Soy nog. IMO, the stuff is terrible! It's watery, barely flavored, no depth and the eggy part tastes stale and weird. I've tried a bunch of different brands and never found one I remotely liked. When I saw Red Leaf Tea's Eggnog matcha, hey.. this might have some potential to have an eggnog on my terms!<br />Out of the package, the eggnog matcha smells slightly eggy and spicy.<br /><br />Prepared as a traditional hot matcha, I can taste the eggnog, but in matcha form! The base of bold green tea is there, with a eggy taste second, with a vanilla and nutmeg hit. This matcha is also slightly sweet. No bitterness or astringency.<br /><br />Now the best part, eggnog matcha prepared as a latte! I made mine cold, whisking 1/2tsp of egg nog matcha into some light soy milk and a little sweetener. I find the eggy taste is the strongest! I love eggy taste! Next is the creamy vanilla and a hint of spice.<br /><br />The only thing missing for this to be perfectly like eggnog is the consistency. This might go well with a thicker soy milk (like the very vanilla Silk soy milk) or whisk in a little instant vanilla pudding mix. Of course, this egg nog matcha latte is green, so more festive!<br /><br />Tea peeps, give this one a shot!

review/summary: Christmas Cheer All Year Long!
review/text: Eggnog is really a seasonal treat, and most people associate it with Christmas. For me, though, it means fall! Because as soon as it hits the shelves, I buy some. Sadly, though, eggnog is not my friend. It's delicious, but so rich even a small mug can make me a bit nauseous and regretful. Yet I still go back! This matcha is a great way to get that warm, creamy, custardy taste without any of the regretful stares into a fat and sugar filled mug. Because, well, matcha is healthy!<br /><br />This is like eggnog's light, airy and more mature older sister. The grassiness of the matcha cuts through the custard richness, capturing all of the taste but none of that heaviness. The vanilla here is really nice, but my favorite part is the spices--that hint of nutmeg really brings together everything else! This is perfect as a hot latte, though even with just water it's quite delicious and dessert-y.

review/text: Our family loves eating bamboo. My mom and I would buy the 8oz cans at the grocery stores such as Publix and Kroger ($.79, $.89 per can)because the asian stores where we live do not always check the expiration date and sell expired products. After seeing this on sale, I decided to purchase it for the family to eat. The product is yummy. Price per ounce is incredibly cheaper than buying the 8oz cans. My mom would open the can and take out what she needed to cook and put the rest in a plastic container with its original juices and place it in the fridge for future use. The package came in very well packed but caution, its HEAVY! Very happy with purchase and will buy again once we go through the remaining 5 cans!

review/summary: My dogs love these
review/text: These are great treats, and my dogs love them, but I don't use them as they are designed.  I usually buy 2 packages and then use each piece as a separate treat (2 sticks, 4 flowers).  My flat-coat has a sensitive stomach and once he starts eating something, he can't (won't) give it up.  By giving him each piece separately, I can monitor how much he gets and it is much better on his digestive system.  They do make a bit of a mess, so I either use them outside or in an area that is easy to clean up the drool that ultimately is left when they are done.  They love them so much!

review/summary: Doesn't last any longer than Everlasting treat
review/text: My dog enjoys these treats, but they don't last. The very first time he got an everlasting treat it took him a couple of days to gnaw and lick the rounded treats out of the ball holder. Ever since though, he has figured out how to get the treats out of the ball quickly, then chews them up like biscuits.<br /><br />Thought the interlocking screw-on idea might keep the treats in the ball longer, but I think my dog just chewed off the end of the central threaded stick and then easily removed the treats as usual.<br /><br />Enjoyable but expensive for the short amount of time they last. Also, not sure of the calorie count? My dog is an 85lb young male german shepherd.

review/summary: NEVER-lasting Treats
review/text: It took my dog more than an hour to make it through each of his first two ever-lasting treats.  I thought the ever-locking treats would slow him down even more.  Not so.  Because the edges of the disc pieces are scalloped (rather than smooth like the ever-lasting treats), they don't stay wedged down in the ball as well.  My dog can get the first one out in less than five minutes.  You'd think the twisting "lock" would at least add some complexity, but you'd be wrong.  As soon as my dog chomped through the first disc, he shoved the "stick" back through the ball, using it to pop out disc number two.  It probably would have taken him longer to wolf down the entire contraption if I'd just handed the treats to him in their original packaging.  Fabulous idea; poor results.

review/text: I have a chewer and at first the basic everlasting chew treats lasted a week or two for him. But the Dalmatian is clever, he now knows how to pry the disk out of the toy...drats! So I tried this version thinking it was different and it screwed together; but it didn't slow him down. The whole thing was chewed up in about 1/2 an hour. If your dog is not a voracious chewer---this will probably be good for him/her. My dog DOES love them!

This is not only very high quality & full of important nutrients, protein, fat, etc., but he LOVES it.  Since starting on this, he is gaining weight & feeling MUCH better !  *WHEW !*  Yes, Blue Buffalo is the most expensive pet food you can buy, but if you have a sick, tiny baby, or elder, who won't eat, this will take care of the problem.  The Duck flavor is also good.

review/text: My kitty Carl Jones loves this food.  He knows chicken, too, since he comes from a herd of holler cats that liked to kill the neighbor's chickens and eat them when he was a baby kitten.  It is rather pricey, though, and I suspect that there is a good bit of flavor enhancement happening in these cans given the yummy chicken-y smell of it.  I'm going to test out another more budget-friendly brand to see how he likes that one....but I'm going to go ahead and venture a guess that he'll be wanting this back long before the other food runs out.  It keeps him quite active.

Seriously, she begs, dances, cries, climbs over anything until it's put in her dish. She seems to prefer this flavor over the salmon one. It is pricey (around $2 a can I think?) but I do find it on sale sometimes at the pet store and try to grab a can or two. I've also had great success with the dog version of this food with my Pomeranian mix. You can't go wrong with any Blue Buffalo products, it's the best!

While the taste is not exactly like the old brand, it comes close enough and I ordered 6 more! The chocolate swirl and all the other fancied up halvas never appealed to me. This Koska Plain Halva hits the spot! I love it. The containers are better than the  old round tins, easy to open, and reusable to store small items in my workshop.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Koska Plain Tahini Halva.

review/summary: Whether you like garlic or not you will love this stuff!
review/text: I love garlic and use it raw or roasted almost all of the time.  I had never heard of black garlic and was introduced to it by a friend who actually works for Culinary Elite.  I ordered a pound of it and was blown away.  It is made by fermenting whole bulbs of garlic at high temperature for 45 days which turns the cloves black. The garlic came peeled and in a resealable container.<br /><br />The taste is sweet and complex and reminds me of tamarind.  I can pop the cloves in my mouth and eat them almost like candy.  I have started to use them in a wide variety of dishes, especially when preparing appetizers or small plates.  I sliced some cloves and stuck them under the skin of some duck breasts and roasted them.  They added whole another dimension to the dish and received rave reviews.  It is also a natural for adding to pasta and twice baked potatoes. It is a perfect example of a food with that umami taste, savory and deep.<br /><br />Now that I know about black garlic I have found that many chefs and restaurants have been using it for the last several years.  As a matter of fact, it has even been featured on some of the more popular cooking shows like Chopped and Iron Chef America.  My next door neighbor is one of the top chefs in San Antonio.  When I asked him if he used black garlic he said that he found it difficult to peel.  I gave him some of mine and he was really excited to see that it had no peels, cores or stems.  I keep it in the fridge and use it so often that next time I will be buying a larger tub.

review/summary: A really high quality black garlic
review/text: Peeled is the only way to go; I tried buying unpeeled once and my hands were black and sticky after peeling just a few cloves and I wound up with half the garlic I thought I'd get because of the cores and things. This is much butter and actually higher quality anyway and I wind up with twice as much in the end for the same weight of unpeeled. Very rich in flavor and an excellent texture. This is a great anti-inflammatory and it's touted the best "superfood" of the year because all of the benefits of white garlic are doubled or, in some cases, some antioxidants become 5 times stronger during fermentation. Very sweet.<br /><br />Eat meals with black garlic and green tea and your doc, like my mom's doctor, will ask what in the world she is doing to make her tests do a health flip.

Anytime I don't know how I want to add "zing" to food, I top it with black garlic for rave reviews. And it looks pretty too. Great on lasagna, or in spring rolls, for example.<br /><br />Very versatile.

review/summary: Pretty Sachets, not my everyday treat
review/text: I really do like this herbal infusion, it's an interesting blend. I purchased it for a tea party bridal shower I threw and we had lavender short bread cookies as one of the accompaniments. The floral taste was a a bit bolder than I expected, the blend of cornflower and lavender and lemon was tasty. If you like this you may like Harney and Sons Mother's Bouquet which also has rosebuds and citrus peel to the mix. It is a very fine herbal drink, but most afternoons if I'm not drinking spicy black tea I like a light refreshing white or green tea. I very rarely drink herbals unless I'm off to bed. These tea bags are made to produce two cups of tea, and this is essentially loose tea inside a sachet for convenience.<br /><br />If you know an herbal tea lover this is a unique blend for them to try. The tea sachets are very pretty with the yellow and blue flowers in them.

review/summary: Spa Retreat in a cup
review/text: There is a reason why this tea made it to a favorite list of the lady whose name starts with an "O"!  I can't imagaine how it isn't five stars on her and highly disagree that it has a huge floral scent and tastes. Yes is has a strong Chamomile taste but there is nothing rosey about this one.  Constantly sells out on the H&S website and every friend I've had try it has fell in love.  This probably isn't a morning tea but more of unwinding from a stressful day before bedtime tea.

review/text: If you like a bold floral flavor, this tea may be the one for you.<br /><br />However, I just didn't enjoy this blend. I love most Harney teas, and enjoy a bold flavor, but this one had a bit of a grassy flavor to it to me. It's a very aromatic herbal tea but just didn't have a good flavor to it. I would suggest trying Harney's African Autumn blend for a herbal tea instead.

review/summary: Why You Should Go With Another Product
review/text: Dark chocolate has been well established now to have major heart-health benefits. Only 20 grams (just over 0.7 of an ounce) per day will halve your risk of heart attack, which is a pretty impressive achievement for a chocolate bar!<br /><br />But there is an important caveat here. One of the things I like best about the version of this product that I buy here in Australia is that it has no dairy in it at all. From a health perspective this is very important. Dairy foods block absorption of some of the beneficial phytochemicals in chocolate (the flavanols in particular), which is why eating dark, as opposed to milk chocolate is so important.<br /><br />However, I have also seen a version of this product that does have milk in it, and it is far from clear which version we are getting here. At the time of writing, there is no list of ingredients on the product page. What I can tell you is that Amazon does sell a 70% cocoa version of essentially the same product, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV7Q0">and on that product page there is a list of ingredients</a> which states that the product on sale DOES contain whole milk powder. The fact that whole (as opposed to skim) milk products are used renders this an especially bad choice, since whole milk products have been found to be more potent in blocking absorbtion of the beneficial flavanols.<br /><br />In response to some of the comments I have already received on this review, it seems to be necessary to stress that whole milk powder is specifically listed AS AN INGREDIENT. We are NOT just talking about the standard warning that the equipment used to manufacture the product may also have come in contact with dairy.<br /><br />What's more, despite the fact that whole milk powder is listed as an ingredient, the 70% cocoa version's product page states that it is suitable for vegetarians and VEGANS [my emphasis]. Do these people even know what "vegan" means? It hardly inspires confidence. It's also worth noting that by contrast, this product - the 85% cocoa version - is only described as "suitable for vegetarians". No mention of vegans anywhere. This heightens my suspicion that the product on sale here does have dairy in it.<br /><br />All this is a great pity because otherwise I consider it a very fine chocolate. So it may be worth your while to continue watching this space. My hope is that the version on sale here on Amazon will ultimately be replaced by a dairy-free alternative, just as it has been in Australia.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Don't trust Nutricity
review/text: Unfortunately, this product contains milk. There was no description (except vegetarian), i.e., no ingredients listed. The local version of this product does not contain milk, although it looks exactly the same. I cannot eat the chocolate with milk, and hence am out $40. Nutricity refused any sort of refund or credit and just gave a corporate boilerplate get-lost type response. Also, they refused to change the description of the product for future buyers to indicate the ingredients. If you don't mind milk in your dark chocolate, you might like this product, but I'd advise against buying anything from Nutricity.

review/text: This is probably the best dark chocolate that I have eaten.  85% is definitely something one has to acquire a taste for, but once you're there, this is outstanding.  I much prefer it to the 70%, which now tastes a little too sweet to my palate. Out of several fine chocolate makers- Godiva, Lindt, and Scharfen-Berger- Green & Black's has probably got the finest overall taste.

review/text: Once I had a bite, I went straight here to write a review :) It literally melts in your mouth, which you wouldn't expect from 85% dark chocolate. Instant melting is so noticeable that once you break it with your hand, it leaves traces of chocolate on your fingers. I guess taking one of these bars with you on a summer trip will results in a messy affair, but the taste more than makes up for the texture, trust me.

This one is creamy & smooth, has great flavor of rich chocolate without any bitterness & not overly sweet. I bought 1 bar in a local drugstore & will definitely get more in the future. Excellent treat & chock-full of antioxidant benefits too. Worth the price for this quality gourmet item. Also great occasional low-carb sweet treat without any artificial sweeteners.

review/summary: Poisonous tofu cubes made of sugar and brake dust
review/text: This product is the straw that broke the camel's back, making me 100% convinced I should not eat anything made in India.  Of course, it helps I have a long history of frequenting Indian groceries for staples such as frozen naan and papadam...and it doesn't help that I frequently find half-exploded cans of botulism-encrusted, expired, imported Indian goo in any random neighborhood Indian grocery.<br /><br />So here's my report on first opening the package:<br /><br />The jaggery looks like unreasonably yellow tofu cube looking sugar blocks; they are not the lovely and natural blond or brunette of colombian panela or mexican piconcillo.  The smell is horrible, something like the plastic on a bad capacitor that has burned out, the smell of a soldering iron, something strangely industrial and/or metallic and/or plastic and/or burning.  Brake dust.  Computer on fire.  Pthalates burning in a trash heap.  Scumdog millionaire sets the pool toy factory aflame next door to the sugar fields.<br /><br />...This is food???<br /><br />Ok, I thought, maybe it's the packaging that I'm smelling, so I drop them in some water to bring to a boil.<br /><br />First thing happens, yellow color starts emanating from the cubes.  "Oh", I think to myself, "It's been hit with yellow #5, or at best, Turmeric".<br /><br />Next I notice the jaggery starts to bubble.  Bubble?  My mexican piconcillo doesn't do that.  It's just sugar, right?<br /><br />Finally, as it dissolves, I waft the scent of brake dust, caramel, something strange like a fake beef or meat flavor, something strangely umami but muskier.<br /><br />Then I dump the whole thing and toss out the 2 lbs of jaggery I bought.<br /><br />No more Indian food.  The irony is that you have a perfect product that nature produces, then you have to adulterate it, overcomplicating it with garbage, making it unacceptable.<br /><br />Attention India and China: I will not participate in your industrial-waste-laundering-through-food scheme.

review/summary: Didn't do much for me
review/text: I used it for about 3 weeks. Didn't notice much of a difference in any way. I bought it specifically for seborrheic dermatitis. There was a bit of improvement but not enough. I didn't like the taste much, even with mixing it in with stuff. So I won't be buying again.

review/summary: Only Two Days So Far, but high hopes
review/text: I ordered this after reading multiple articles online and the reviews here.  It has only been 2 days so far, but I am hoping for the best.  Honestly, after perusing the internet and reading about all the wonderful things this product benefits, how can you not try it.  The price was very reasonable, especially with the super saver shipping, and I will be buying more in the future.  Much cheaper than buying it at my local GNC and couldnt even find it at any markets nearby.  I will try to update later on when I have time to see the true benefits.  Taste is really not that bad at all when mixed with water, and I use just a half glass so it goes down quicker.  Not as bad as taking Alka Seltzer and if you hold your nose there is not taste at all.

review/summary: Pure and Organic at its best!
review/text: I have been trying fruitlessly to find organic raw apple cider vinegar at my local grocery store. Since I could not find it, I searched for it here in Amazon and was able to purchase Bragg's ACV.<br /><br />I am totally satisfied with the quality of this product, unlike the other brands (especially not organic / filtered) I can really compare the taste is much better. It goes well if you also add organic honey to a glass of ACV. I recommend this product and gave it 5 stars because of its quality.
