review/summary: Too acidic for my palate
review/text: A matter of taste, I prefer darker, richer roasts. This one is lighter on the coffee aroma and flavor and heavy on the acidity. A true "medium" coffee, I would say.

review/text: For a long time I thought I just didn't like coffee.  Turns out that I just don't like the stuff that my mom bought.  I don't know what she used to buy for the old coffee maker, but now she likes the Donut Shop K-Cups.  I can't stand that stuff without drowning it with vanilla creamer.  It's just too bitter.  The Nantucket Blend is a lot smoother.  Although the Dark Magic blend by Green Mountain is. . . interesting, of the coffees I've sampled, I prefer the Nantucket Blend.

review/summary: Solid, versatile cup of coffee
review/text: Green Mountain's Nantucket blend is a great cup of coffee for almost any occasion. It can be your morning coffee, your afternoon wake-up, or even your after dinner brew. It has a medium body with a smooth flavor. I don't care for dark roasts but I also wanted something that packed more of a punch than a light roast; the Nantucket blend definitely fits the bill.<br /><br />My only complaint about this coffee is that it does have a stronger aftertaste than I would like. I enjoy drinking the coffee but I am sometimes left with a bitter taste in my mouth.

review/summary: A Perfect Coffee Blend, Our Favorite
review/text: If a milder, smoother taste is what you are looking for, you won't find anything better than Green Mountain Nantucket Blend. This is the first coffee I ever tried in my Keurig and it's been a staple in our variety of K-Cups for two years now. The quality is superb - I wouldn't expect anything less from Green Mountain. In fact, a friend who has a relative who works there says the quality control is so strict they throw out cups that have even a tish more or less coffee than the cups are supposed to. At less than 0.60 cents/cup, this is a bargain. With Prime Membership, to have these delivered to my door is too good to be true.

I have changed the recipe a bit......use 2 - 14oz cans of Mexican style chunk tomatoes; 1 - 1 1/2 lbs ground round; and I use cider vinegar (1/3 cup) instead of red wine vinegar.

review/text: NOT what I think of as Cincinnati chili. Seasonings weren't as spicy (meaning allspice, cinnamon, etc.)as the Cincinnati chili I've had there & I didn't think the chocolate added anything. But, if I were to rate it as just chili, I'd give it 4 stars. I ended up adding chili powder, cumin & a can of chopped green chilies & it was good. I did serve it over spaghetti with raw chopped onions & shredded cheddar "Cincinnati 5-way" style.

review/text: Nabisco "Big" Wheat Thins taste great despite a name that didn't exactly excite me about trying them. They make great snacking crackers; and when you serve these to your guests you're gonna be loved by them forever! Hehehe<br /><br />The crackers are very low in fat; and there are no trans fats at all in a serving--hooray! These crackers contain no cholesterol and you do get 5 grams of whole grain in a single serving. Excellent! The crackers contain a relatively low amount of sodium which is more good news.<br /><br />Moreover, the crackers contain defatted wheat germ; this is very healthy for you.<br /><br />The extra large size of these crackers makes them particularly useful when you serve them with a dip to guests. Of course, you can also treat yourself to this same delight! They taste wonderful with a garlic and herb cheese dip I sometimes use.<br /><br />One small caveat: Eat these before any expiration date printed or stamped on the top of the box. You wouldn't want to eat stale crackers, now would you?<br /><br />Overall, Wheat Thins are some of the best crackers on your grocer's shelf. Buy a box and enjoy some today!

Likewise it stands up to a full red or white sauce also.<br /><br />1 disclaimer: by no fault of the pasta manufacturer Amazon once sent me a box of pasta that had passed it's expiration date so just make sure to check the lot date on the side of the box and the end of all the individual packets.

I chose the Sportmix products because I was assured by their customer service rep (who responded to my inquiry within the hour) that the ingredients and manufacturing are US-based.  I do not purchase foreign pet food ingredients - particularly China-made pet products.  I am thoroughly happy with the apparent palatability of the bones.  The dogs fall over each other to get one.  I am a little dissatisfied with the condition of many of the bones - about 20% of them are broken due to packaging.  They are not stacked - just loosely placed in the box to be knocked around during delivery.  This is the only thing I can fault, though.  Otherwise, a fair priced, quality, USA MADE product.

review/summary: This stuff will knock your socks off!
review/text: I first got this at a co-op I worked at a few years ago. Honestly it sat on my shelf for about a year before I got around to using it in some homemade chili. I put the same amount of the Hungarian Paprika the chili as I had with regular generic paprika in the past. Whoa Nelly! That stuff turned my mild chili into crazy hot! Everyone loved it. Since then I've repeatedly been asked to bring my chili to gatherings. When they ask what's in it I just say paprika. ;-)<br /><br />If you get this to replace regular paprika start with a smaller amount than the recipe calls for, say 1/4. Then work from there.<br /><br />Not only is it hot but it does have a wonderful aroma and flavor.

review/text: This is the best paprika available; at least my husband thinks so.  He uses it on so many foods. I used to think it was only used for deviled eggs, but he has taught me differently. I liked the quick arrival and the packaging was good too.  Thank you.  I will use your site again.

review/summary: Nice Taste, But ...
review/text: First of all, when I purchased this product it was listed as two 3-packs for the price.  I only received one 3-pack.  Amazon kindly refunded half of my money, but note that I would not have purchased the product at the current offer of one 3-pack for the same price.<br /><br />Black sugar is reputed to be eaten in Japan as a candy.  This black sugar tastes very nice that way, a bit like the penuche that I made as a child that didn't get cooked long enough and was partially crystallized when it cooled.  Add molasses taste to that, and I think that is pretty close.<br /><br />This black sugar is not uniformally dark throughout.  When you break the brick, in cross-section it is only dark for about one quarter of the way in from the surface top and bottom, and the same absolute distance on the sides.  The inner one-half is the color of light brown sugar.  I don't know what to make of that.  I don't know if it is normal for black sugar to be light brown inside.  Presumably the darkness is from the molasses, but I don't know why the molasses would look like it had soaked in from the outside instead of being uniformally distributed in the sugar brick.  The dark brown raw sugar from Africa, that I also bought, is uniformally dark but not as dark as the outside of this black sugar brick.  I imagine that if I pulverized the inner and outer sections of this Okinawa black sugar together I might get the same color as the dark brown sugar from Africa.  I haven't tried the experiment because the black sugar brick is not easily pulverized, although it is not too hard to bite.<br /><br />In summary, the taste is quite nice but I'm not at all sure that it is novel enough for the price I paid, let alone twice that much.  However, it is a taste of food from a place that I have never been and never will go, so I gave it four stars.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: I went on a search for Japanese Black Sugar (from Okinawa) after my local Japanese Markets all stopped carrying it. I was introduced to black sugar while living with a girl from Kyoto for 3 years. She preferred using black sugar because she believed it was rich in minerals (I cannot confirm or verify this), but I came to prefer it in my coffee. bigtime. The taste is quite unlike other sugar.. with a strong molasses taste. the blocks are often darker on the outside, however, the taste is unmistakable, and this is quite definitely Black Sugar.<br />I am a bit of a coffee connoisseur, and I prefer to drink my coffee with real japanese black sugar or "Kuro Sato".<br />When I last ordered this product, it qualified for Free Super Saver shipping, which made it a good deal. Now the only shipping option available costs $10, which probably means that I'm going back to the local Japanese market, as they've started to re-stock the granulated variety. If the shipping were a little more affordable I would favor this, as the price is decent, and the product is top notch.<br /><br />that's my two cents anyways.<br />thanks!

review/summary: If it's NOT made in Okinawa, then it's NOT Okinawan sugar...
review/text: Having lived in Okinawa for a number of years, I am a big fan of Okinawa's "raw" brown sugar (not to be confused with the brown sugar we know here in America).<br /><br />This may be terrific sugar - however - it is NOT technically, organically, from Okinawa -- it is from Taiwan.

review/text: The cans are listed as 13 fluid ounces each, but I measured and each can was 12 ounces or less.  Since you have to have equal parts water and formula, I had to carefully measure each can.  Each can was different.  The formula itself worked fine, but it was misleading as to how much I was actually getting for the price.  The already mixed formula is much cheaper per ounce than this or even the powder.

review/summary: California may have a few problems right now, but this sauce is not one of them!
review/text: I first ran across this wonderful stuff several years ago while visiting friends in California.  It was instant love!  I have of course not been able to purchase this product here on the E. Coast but friends living in California, traveling through that area, and indeed..every time I make a visit, bottles of this stuff wind up on my shelf.<br /><br />I use this tasty sauce on just about any appropriate food item.  It is a condiment I keep on the table during every meal.  Now don't think you are just getting a hot sauce here...no, no, no!  The flavor is what makes this the best.  The only sauce I have ever tasted that came near it was from two bottles of liquid heaven I purchased in Jamaica which is made and bottled by a single family their and is almost impossible to get.  This product though is almost its equal.<br /><br />The sauce is smooth with a garlic taste most certainly, but not overwhelming.  No edgy jalapeno after taste is present (Jalapeno are not my favorite, that's for sure). This product, as one reviewer her put it, does not focus simply on the burn as most of these concoctions do.  I am not sure what all goes in the stuff, but what ever it is, it works.<br /><br />This is the primary ingredient for a BBQ sauce I make (sorry, old family secret) and of course it works right out of the bottle on almost all meat, fish and many, many vegetables.  I personally do not like any sort of sauce on my eggs but I have many good friends that do and they rave about this stuff every time they stay over and I fix breakfast for them.<br /><br />If this stuff is ever offered nationally, I hope they do not fool around with the process too much.  I would rather it remain a bit hard to get than risk loosing this unique flavor.<br /><br />Trust me and give this stuff a try...I promise you will not be sorry.

review/summary: A California Original!
review/text: The Previous reviews sums up the quality taste of this product.I found this product almost 20 years ago at a diner in Pismo Beach.At the time the Pepper Plant was a local (Atascadero) mom & pop operation and couldn't be found south of Santa Barbara or north of San Luis Obispo.I was living an hour north of San Francisco and was fortunate enough to purchase the sauce at the diner,I purchased 4 bottles and hit that diner about every 6 months for years.The company was purchased by a larger gourmet foods manufacturer in Gilroy and didn't change a thing.If anything it was a benefit for the product as it is now in the heart of where the ingredients are grown.I was able to get my local Whole Foods to carry Pepper Plant and another store across town.I have noticed that people are discovering the fantastic flavor of a California original and hope more people discover the best pepper sauce in the west.The bar-b-que sauce is excellent too. Cheers!

review/text: My husband and I always have this at a local eatery, and WOW, it works with eggs, french fries, burgers, you name it. It's not as much Hot as it is SPICY and the balance of the garlic is a beautiful thing. It doesn't drown out the taste of your food as much as it adds to it or enhances it. It also doesn't have that obnoxious jalapeno taste that many hot sauces have. A must buy for the hot sauce or bbq sauce fan, or someone like me that just loves breakfast.

review/text: I use this product at home and love it to pieces. It's perfect for the office breakroom, especially in bulk, because it doesn't spoil like liquid juice. You can use it in cooking as well to add a jolt of flavor.

review/summary: tastes stale and SMOTHERED in sugar salt and other stuff
review/text: I thought what i ordered was nuts but instead got a stale tasting nut that was smothered in sugar, salt and many other unpleasant seasonings - I would not buy any Emerald product. I went to the store and checked - for the most part these green type containers are smothered nuts, not just nuts. Just basic walnuts - NO WAY; ingredients list seasoning (maltodextrin, yeast extract, carrots, garlic puree, celery, corn syrup solices, ascorbic acid, silicon dioxide, modified potato starch and natural flavorings and spices - not exactly all ingredients but you get the idea.<br /><br />If you like them that way, enjoy and bon appetit. but if you want plain nuts, suggest you look elsewhere

review/text: I am a huge fan of Amazon and I order all the time (at least weekly) and this is the FIRST time I've ever written a review (that's how strongly I feel about these).<br /><br />I am a big walnut lover but these things are absolutely GROSS.  I opened the first can and ate the first one and thought I was going to throw up.  I spit it out and washed out my mouth thinking they were rotten or poisoned or something.  I opened up two other cans and they're the same way.  They are absolutely disgusting.  They taste stale and rotten at the same time.  I threw all six cans in the trash as I wouldn't even give those to our squirrels.  I would look elsewhere.

review/text: I love walnuts so I thought I would save some money and buy them here in bulk. But what an unpleasant surprise. These were horribly stale and had a very distinctive bad bad bad BAD taste. I had been told that Emerald nuts were very good and maybe I just got a bad batch(of 6 canisters?? unlikely). But I will definitely never buy these again nor will I ever recommend them to anyone.

review/text: I first bought this product at my local supermarket, but they hardly ever had them in stock so I came on here looking for them.  Not only are they delicious, but they did something I didn't expect.  I had heard that walnuts are good for cholesterol, but I was shocked at how good they are.  I've struggled with my LDL for years and I don't want to take medicine.  I did nothing at all to change my diet and exercise routine except to add a handful of these walnuts every day - and my cholesterol was better than ever.  My LDL went down.  This is no coincidence as I have my numbers checked every 3 months without fail and this was the best set of test results that I've ever had.  It's nice that something that tastes so great is also good for you!

review/text: Amazon refunded my purchase price for these, but I thought I should still warn others against ordering. The ones I ordered arrived as furry, rancid walnuts. Unfortunately, I dumped the first cannister into my existing walnut storage without looking (since the packaging was in date). This caused me to have to throw away about 2 pounds of good walnuts because they were touched by these rancid ones. (Perhaps buying food online isn't the best idea...)

review/summary: Emerald Dry Roasted Walnuts Review
review/text: I LOVE this product-in fact,it's become addictive for me. This time, however, I noticed some very hard pieces when chewing the nuts and after examining more closely, do think somehow shells got into the nuts as they were being shelled. It made me more careful (therefore, less enjoyment)because the bitterness distorts the otherwise wonderful flavor and I also don't want to crack or chip a tooth. Hope this is an isolated instance with this batch!

review/summary: They are ok
review/text: But not great.  I will agree their taste can be a bit much, think of a garlicky artificial taste that would be on chips.  To be honest, this defeats the purpose of a roasted walnut, where you would think its roasted and perhaps has salt on them.  Granted these aren't awful, but after eating a container I'm not really sure if I would consider them good.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- One of the few "roasted" walnut options I've seen<br />- The taste is ok, but not great<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- These do not taste like the walnuts found in Emerald's deluxe mixed nuts canisters, if thats what you are looking for<br />- The taste can be a bit much, its ok, but if you are looking for a plain roasted walnut this isn't it<br />- Not to nitpick but these are mostly walnut pieces, not many whole walnuts<br /><br />Recommendation:<br /><br />- I don't think I would get them again<br />- I would suggest not buying a 6 pack until you try them first because they aren't just simple roasted walnuts

review/summary: Bizarre taste, yet strangely addicting
review/text: Ok, straight up--these things taste funky.  My first thought when I ate the first walnut was, "What am I going to do with 6 canisters of these weird things?"  My wife tried one and hated it--she refuses to eat them.  But I kept trying them and began to like them (probably because I didn't want to feel I was throwing $30 down the toilet).  I can't quite give them 4 stars, because they're not THAT great.  But I sometimes have a hard time stopping myself from eating them once I start.<br /><br />It would really be cool if Emerald could duplicate the taste that Blue Diamond has accomplished for their Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds.  Now THOSE things are awesome!  I highly recommend those, even if you're not a big fan of almonds.  I'm doubtful, however, that I'll order these walnuts again.

review/summary: You actually have to think when buying....
review/text: 1.  Walnuts are the most unstable of all nuts.  While most nuts have a shelf life of a few months, walnuts go rancid within just a few weeks of being exposed to air and average 65-75 degree temp.  So if you buy 6 canisters of these and eat an ounce a day to help your cholesterol levels, they'll last you about 7-8 weeks. Which is the longest you should expect them to stay fresh.  If you want them to last longer -- freeze them in the unopened containers for up to 4 months.  And I'm guessing that jars or bags of walnuts are just wasted if sent through USPS/military mail channels to soldiers in Asia.  It's too hot and too long a trip.<br /><br />2.  If this product -- or any other for that matter -- arrives stale, then why aren't you calling Amazon or the supplier to return them and get your money back!  This is one of the reasons I try to buy items from Amazon that say they are sold and shipped by Amazon --because Amazon stands behind what they sell and I've never had a problem with getting  a replacement if something arrives in unsatisfactory condition.  To all those reviewers whining about stale products -- grow a pair, pick up the phone, and stand up for yourselves.<br /><br />3.  Read the reviews, and if you don't want seasoned nuts, don't buy these.  Not only are they seasoned, they also have a little sugar.  Not enough to raise the calories beyond those of raw walnuts, but it is a different nut than a fresh cracked walnut.<br />IF YOU WANT RAW WALNUTS, BUY WALNUTS IN THE SHELL.<br /><br />I agree that for internet buying purposes, the manufacturer should INSIST all the contents  be listed on every site, and should rename the product: SEASONED DRY ROASTED WALNUTS.<br /><br />The bottom line is, they have an excellent mild seasoned flavor, and a very DRY dry-roasted texture.

review/text: I just checked with the Post Office here where I am stationed.  People can mail dried fruits and vegitables through the US Postal System.  I tried to order these walnuts to be delivered while I am overseas and can not get them.  My order was refused because according to Amazon "they can't ship food" overseas.  From doing some research I found that the reson they can't ship to an APO address is the vender uses either FedEx or UPS and they can't ship to an APO address.  It doesn't bother me that the vender can't ship, or for that mater won't take the initiative to sell to US Service People overseas, it is they Lied about it.

review/text: Normally I love walnuts, however I regret this purchase.  The nuts are coated in a savory seasoning with paprika, garlic, and veggie flavoring.<br />I was expecting something sweet or plain which I could throw on my morning oatmeal.<br />However, they aren't a bad product, if you like salted and seasoned nuts.  I can only compare it to garden vegetable flavored crackers. The quality is decent overall, just not a flavor I enjoy.  The packaging is lightweight and portable, which is nice to grab on the go for snacking.

review/text: Yum!! These dry roasted walnuts are a really tasty treat which I originally found in stores then couldn't find. I have had them shipped to me several times and never had any bad ones. If you haven't had them before they have the similar seasonings to what is on dry roasted peanuts. Why anyone would buy them without reading the ingredients then complain about them is wacky, but if you don't like what is on doritos and snacks like that then you may not like these. These are one of my favorite snacks because I love the lightly crunchy, salty taste and walnuts are good for us!!

review/text: I started searching the internet for "Emerald Dry Roasted Walnuts" when my mom complained that after purchasing them in a store ONE TIME, she couldn't find them anymore.  Emerald brand nuts, yes, but she was not able to find the dry roasted walnuts at ANY store in her area.  Of course, after hearing that, I checked the stores in my area, too, and she was right; no dry roasted walnuts.<br /><br />So World Wide Web, here I come.  I googled the term and bingo, Amazon sells them in the 9 oz. canisters (6 pack).<br /><br />My mom loves these nuts!!!!!  I mean, absolutely, in no uncertain terms loves them!  The 6 packs that I purchase from Amazon are her BD, Mother's Day, Easter, Christmas, and every other Holiday gift out there!  When she's down to the 5th canister, she lets me know and I just order another pack to be delivered to her house.  No muss, no fuss, and it's the best gift I can send her because she can't get them anywhere else.<br /><br />As my Mom states, "Flowers die, chocolates make you fat, but nuts are good for you!".  So, in my case, nuts it is!

review/summary: Incredible walnuts with wonderful health benefits!!!
review/text: I love walnuts and tried these at a friend's house.  I was hooked.  But, I had also heard that walnuts are good for cholesterol issues.  I have always struggled with keeping my LDL (bad) cholesterol down while keeping my good (HDL) cholesterol up.  I eat a healthy diet, I exercise, and do everything I can, but after adding these walnuts to my diet (I eat a handful a day), the results have been incredible! For the first time in my life, my cholesterol is so great that my doctor doesn't try to get me to take medicine for it anymore. (I always refused to take it).  My LDL is way down and my HDL is so high it's off the charts (108)!  The best thing is that the nuts taste wonderful and are a great afternoon snack!!!
