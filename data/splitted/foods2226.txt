review/summary: Some Hyperbole Here
review/text: Yes, these are tasty goldfish crackers. But not explosive. Not flavor Blasted.  Not Extreme by any means. They are more flavorful than regular bland Goldfish crackers, and might even be called finger licking good. The flavor by any other standards though is mild and one step above bland.<br /><br />When I opened the bag my dogs got real interested and I worried about giving them something too spicy in the evening. One dog ate a couple readily while the other wanted no part of these pizza goldfish. Luckily I still had a few regular cheese goldfish around to give her.<br /><br />It's funny that the first ingredient listed is "Smiles." The last listed is paprika and its mark is detectable.<br /><br />I enjoy these crackers, but they're nothing I'd ever crave or overindulge in. That's a good thing.

review/summary: Runny and blaa
review/text: I was not impressed with this product.<br /><br />First, the contents are more like a thick soup than chili.  It's very runny and has relatively little "content" within the liquidy sauce.  I guess that would be okay if you intended to use this as chili sauce - but that's a different type of product in my mind, and shouldn't be marketed as chili of this type, which should be more stew-like.<br /><br />I found the overall experience of consuming this unpleasant, not only because I was left with the sensation that I was consuming a filler liquid of a canned product, but it had an unpleasant quality to it on top of being too runny.  I can only describe it as being almost mucous like; whatever thickener they used in the liquid results in a very un-chili like effect.<br /><br />The few beans, "meat?" chunks etc. - very, very few - were almost flavorless.<br /><br />Honestly, I can only imagine this product serving a purpose for something like topping a baked potato; but I would say that it would ruin anything you used it on.<br /><br />In essence - this is one of those products that I categorize as utter "rip-offs" by the manufacturer.  You can confirm this by the product photo it used on the packaging - intentional deception is obvious.<br /><br />Finding good canned chili has become very difficult; but I have to say that many others I've tried are better than this one.

review/summary: Popcorn Jelly Bellies do not hold up to heat in transport!
review/text: I bought a pound of Jelly Bellies from a local Wegmans's grocery, half Toasted Marshmallow and half Buttered Popcorn.  My daughters and I had some of them when we left the store and both flavors tasted fine.  I left them in my car in the Va heat for a couple of days, figuring the worst that would happen is that they'd get soft.  But while the Toasted Marshmallow were fine, the Buttered Popcorn ones tasted awful, and I had to throw the whole bag out. Something happened to the flavoring in the heat, I conclude... which leads me to believe that other reviewers got the real thing but that they were exposed to heat in transport.  In any case, it's a crapshoot, esp. in summer months, to order this flavor for delivery.  3 stars because the jelly beans are great, but you can't count on them arriving that way.

review/summary: Messy but my dogs ADORE them!
review/text: These Mega Mighty Ribs are my dogs favorite chew treat. I am impressed by how truly mighty and meaty they are, and I can see how a dog would love them!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) They're an amazing value, because you can break one treat in half or even thirds. They are huge, thick slabs of ribs with dried meat and some savory fat on them. There are usually two or three long rib bones surrounded by meat in a slab form. You get 20 slabs per box, which can be broken into perhaps ~35 smaller bones. And at my house, everything gets eaten. ~35 treats at this price and quality is a great value for me.<br /><br />2) They are like 2 treats in one: first they chew off all the meaty goodness, then they chew up the bones. More value!<br /><br />3) The rib bones are safe to devour. They don't splinter, but are simply soft but heartily gnaw-able. You wind up with about 3 per slab, so I usually throw away two and just let my dogs finish one, otherwise we'd have piles of rib bones "buried" everywhere by my sneaky pups who like to hide their treats.<br /><br />4) They keep my dogs busy. Oh, do they love working on these! Even my sweet old papillon Gigi, with 9 lost teeth, will spend hours doing her best with the especially soft, easy-to-pick-at ones I set aside just for her. Dachshund Sophie will work on one on and off for a day or two, while my parents' dachshunds Sadie and Gussie will be busy for hours on end, determinedly devouring the whole thing from start to finish. When I present each of them with one, we know the house will be quiet for the rest of the day!<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) They are a crumb disaster, I must warn you. Definitely give these as either outside treats or on an easy-to-clean surface, like the kitchen floor. One of my girls brought one into our bed one day and I had to change the entire bedding, the crumbs were simply everywhere. These crumbs will haunt you if you're not careful. I think it's worth it, others may not. At least give them a try.<br /><br />2) They are *slightly* smelly, but not offensive. Nothing like the horrors of bully sticks. They just have a kind of greasy, gamey odor but it doesn't permeate the house or anything. Sophie can be working on one two feet away and I'll just get an occasional whiff. It stays on their breath, though, so if you're a stickler about doggie breath, you'll want to brush their teeth or rinse their mouths after they're done. This is barely a con, really.<br /><br />My dogs and I really love these mega mighty rib bones. I buy them in bulk at least every other month. They never tire of them. They've never gotten sick from them. They are so cute and happy when they have their bones! In fact, Sophie just started working on one that she'd apparently "set aside" (she's our treat hider). She read my mind. We're close like that ;)

review/text: An Angel must've had a hand in creating this confection. I like peeps but they get old after a while, and I was iffy about trying this product at first. I wish I had purchased more at the time.<br /><br />They just melt in your mouth. There is not so much as a marshmallow in the center as it's more of a heavenly cream mixture. Just the right amount with the mouthwatering silky smooth chocolate on the outside. I ate one whole bag of the 3 I originally purchased. Then my children discovered that by dropping one or two in their hot chocolate or even my coffee became an experience almost as close to paradise we'll ever get in this world.<br /><br />I can't wait till they become available again! The chocolate is exquisite and tastes like or better than some of world's finest.

review/summary: Not Good, Sorry
review/text: Cute concept, cute name. If you love original peeps, and you love chocolate, Peepsters sounds like a winning combination.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these do not live up to expectations. In fact, they're really not good at all. The marshmallow creme doesn't taste anything like marshmallow. It's got a heavy, thick, sticky texture and an unpleasant, artificial flavor. The chocolate is fairly good quality, but is not tempered correctly so it melts way before you can get it into your mouth. It melts so quickly it will practically slide out of your fingers between the wrapper and your mouth. The one positive note is that Peepsters are so stingy with their creme filling you can barely find any when you bite into them. Which is a good thing, since the filling is cloying and artificial. I love candy, and while I can be a bit of a chocolate snob, I will never pass up or not finish a bite-sized piece of candy. Until now. I couldn't even eat a whole Peepster, which is not even an inch in diameter.<br /><br />Personally, I really don't see Peepsters catching on. Save your easter-basket candy money for Original Peeps or other, more inspired candies.

I called customer service before I ordered to confirm this was the five pound bag.  They are big, beautiful dehydrated mushrooms, not broken bits.  The bags are taller than my coffee table!  If you like mushrooms, and if you like a bargain, you can't go wrong here (I paid $19.36 per bag...I got 2 bags).  That's a LOT of mushrooms!<br /><br />Correction:  I purchased two bags at $19.36 per 5 lb bag because it was such an outstanding deal...not two bags for $19.36.  Just wanted to clear that up.

review/summary: Eclipse Mints are the best!
review/text: I've been buying these mints regularly for the last year or so. They're really nice to have in general, especially when I'm studying or at work. They have one of the best winterfrost (sweeter than peppermint with less mint overkill) flavor of all the mints I've ever tried. It's not an overwhelming amount of mint flavor; it's just right. The mints are easy to chew if you choose to (I definitely do), they're a bit soft so it won't hurt your teeth if you like to chew your mints instead of just licking them. Since I can easily pop a mint every few minutes, it's a good thing each tin has a whopping 50 mints inside.<br /><br />The tin is really cool, this product's only flaw is that it is a metal tin filled with mints so it will make a bit of clanking noise if you're not careful. Not too good if you're at the library or in class. Just be slow with handling the tin and most of the noise can be eliminated. That's basically the ONLY flaw here, in my opinion.<br /><br />I try to buy these mints at Target (usually about 2 tins for $2.49 in the candy isle) or at Walmart (1 tin for like $1.29). I haven't ever seen a bulk package at Sam's Club, but Sam's does carry Eclipse gum and other Wrigley's products in bulk. I'll probably order from Amazon and see how the order goes, since 16 tins for like $20 is a pretty good deal by comparison. This product is really inexpensive so I suggest you try it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Tastes great<br />-Breath freshener<br />-No sugar (not much of anything really, nutrition facts show 0's down the line)<br />-Chewable or lickable<br />-Cool tin<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Tin can be a little loud at times if you're not careful<br />-One mint won't noticeably cover up your breath, I suggest two mints at once for that (i.e. the mint flavor is not overwhelming per mint)<br /><br />Enjoy!

It is very powerful without being overwhelming, and definitely leaves you with very fresh breath. I take medications that cause my mouth to get dry, so I carry these mints with me everywhere.<br /><br />It's true that the container/tin is loud if you shake it. I don't dare try to open it if I'm in a quiet place. That's why I just keep some in my pocket and they're good to go. I agree that it takes two to get the full effect, but one at a time'll do if you're using them as much as I am. I'd definitely recommend these to anyone.

review/summary: Delicious mayo!
review/text: Ever since Unilever bought Best Foods/Hellmann's and watered it down, I've been looking for a suitable replacement product because I refuse to buy Best Foods ever again. I tried several different products including Duke's, Blue Plate and various store brands before finding this obscure brand by Reily Foods, makers of Blue Plate. This is the richest and creamiest mayo available and is basically the same as what is called "heavy duty" in commercial settings. The taste is eggy (not oily like Duke's), not too tangy (Blue Plate is much tangier) and somewhat zesty due to mustard powder. The 4 main ingredients are soybean oil, egg yolks, vinegar and water which is how mayo is supposed to be. If you think I'm a bit obsessive about this, it's only because I HATE it when food makers change their products-didn't Unilever learn anything from the 1985 New Coke debacle? Find a winning formula and stick with it!

Delicious and a super bargain.  If you don't use a lot of mayo, then share with friends and family. If you're stuck using that "certain brand", just try JFG.  It's delicious and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Delicious but came across a few that were tasteless
review/text: I am a Tootsie Roll Pop fanatatic and recently discovered the watermelon flavoured ones.  They are my new favourite but are unfortunately very hard to find.  When I came across them on Amazon, I knew I had to order them!  They are delicious!  The only problem I ran into was that a few of them were tasteless.  Both my husband and I came across one like this.  There was absolutely no watermelon flavouring, it just tasted like a big sugar lump.  Other than that, they are very good!

Fantastic - it's strong and flavorful without being overpowering.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and all other Vail Mountain coffees to coffee fans and newcomers.

review/summary: Better than I anticpated...
review/text: I stock my pantry with staples this time of year against the coming winter; if the weather gets bad in the coming months, I like to have enough on hand to ride out what ever Mother Nature may throw at us. I bought this as something of an impulse buy, when it was featured as a Gold Box Deal, with some trepidation, as I have had similar blends in the past that I wasn't wild about. However, this product was a pleasant surprise. Sure, in a perfect world, anyone would prefer fresh cheese from the market, I usually buy this type of cheese either in wedges or shredded; but it is not fair to compare a shelf stable (refrigerate after opening)item to fresh dairy cheese. If anyone is not familiar, this is a *grated* cheese blend (coarse powdery texture). However, when I needed some cheese for pasta, with no fresh on hand, having two large jars, I thought I would try one... and it's pretty good.<br /><br />This blend has a distinct cheese flavor, unlike the nondescript stuff you sometimes get in grated cheese products, or that they send with most pizzas. It is a bit salty, but I like that; it makes a nice contrast to the dish to which it is added. This cheese makes a nice topping for pasta, pizza, or popcorn. After purchasing it to set aside for winter, we've gone through about two thirds of a jar already; I may have to order more for the pantry.<br /><br />For those looking for a commercial grated cheese blend, I found this to be a very good product.

review/summary: Two types of ESE pods - this type ESE pod does not work
review/text: It turns out there are actually two different types of ESE pods, both from the same manufacturer, same label & similar description. It's hard to believe, and I'm sure someone will argue that it's not true, but it is. You'd think that E.S.E. would be a well-specified standard such that all of them are interoperable, but the evidence shows that is not the case.<br /><br />Illy Caffe sells two different types of decaf ESE pods with similar labels (regular roast, green band.) One kind comes in a cardboard box with pods in individual foil packs. Those work great. The other - this one - comes in a metal box, with all the pods loose in the box. The pods in these two cases are designed & manufactured differently, despite their both being labeled as E.S.E. pods!<br /><br />These - the ones that come in the metal can - do not fit properly in an E.S.E. espresso machine. I'm using a DeLonghi, which is a good machine and it's highly reviewed here. These particular ESE pods result in water running around the outside of the pod, such that all you get is hot water with a little bit of brown coloring - nothing like espresso! Their diameter is too small. I tried many times - including tamping them in very hard - and finally gave up. The only way to use these pods is to tear them open and put the loose coffee in the porta filter. Of course that defeats the purpose of using pods. If you're going to use loose coffee, you might as well buy a really good grinder, or buy properly pre-ground espresso coffee from a local shop.<br /><br />To be clear - the other kind of Illy ESE decaf pods, which come in a cardboard box, do work correctly - in the same machine, same everything.<br /><br />Of course, the coffee made from pods is not as good as what you can make with loose high quality coffee that is properly and freshly ground. But pods are a lot less hassle especially if you use your machine at work, or anyplace where a sink is not near by for cleaning up.

review/summary: Decent coffee, less waste than individually wrapped pods
review/text: The coffee is...well, it's never going to be as good as something you buy fresh and grind yourself.  But for canned coffee, it's reasonable.  (Purchased in Jan 2011, the can was stamped for sale until Feb 2012.  So it can be a year or older when you get it and still be considered salable.  That's a bit scary.)<br /><br />My espresso machine came with a box of the individually wrapped Illy ESE pods.  I was dismayed at the quantity of non-recyclable waste from the wrappers, so if that bothers you also, these are slightly better.  The nice reusable tin is filled with plain pods, not individually wrapped, so use them quickly once opened.  If you use very infrequently, the box of individually-wrapped pods might be preferable.

review/summary: Great for us rare corn allergy folks
review/text: I've been on a quest for 15 years to find a true replacement for the corn tortilla chip, one of my favorite snack foods ever before it became apparent that I had a corn intolerance.  Beanitos are the best I've found, and the Nutrition Facts make it clear that they're less bad for you than potato or corn chips.  I prefer the black bean flavors -- chipotle and plain.  Great with many kinds of dips, in nachos, etc.  I hope the product gains more widespread appeal so the price can come down a little, but I'm willing to pay for a more nutritious snack that doesn't make me regret it.

review/summary: Healthy AND Tasty!
review/text: I tried them all, as did my kids. Let me tell you, I love, love, LOVE these chips! More importantly, my picky "I don't like beans" toddlers LOVE these chips. These chips are PACKED with flavor and they are a snack I can feel good about giving to my kids. I honestly cannot pick a favorite, because I truly liked them all. (The Chipolte BBQ are a bit too spicy for tiny tastebuds, though.) While I don't suffer from a gluten intolerance, I have a co-worker who does. She was over the moon for these chips because they are so flavorful!<br />Dr. Oz recently touted the benefits of beans, particularly for those of us that have reached...ahem...40. Incorporating beans into your diet is super easy with Beanitos! Now, I know what you are all thinking...BEANS = GAS! Not so with these chips. The company uses a "natural, proprietary process that eliminates the common side effects some people associate with eating beans." So, feel free to snack FREELY and around ANYONE!! :)<br /><br />If you are a chip lover, but are worried about the calories, fat and preservatives found in most chips, I highly encourage you to try Beanitos! You will not be disappointed. These are a great mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack to keep your diet on track!<br />See my full review at www.amysuesplace.com

This product does just that--very good chips.

I like them way better than corn chips now. The taste is incredible! The only time you *might* want to use something different is if you are wanting to use them with a very thick/hard dip, because these chips are thinner than corn chips and might break while you're scooping. Not that I mind... when my dip is full of crumblies, I just eat the rest of it with a spoon. :-p<br /><br />Oh and they have lots of fiber too, in addition to being corn-free, gluten-free, low-glycemic, and all that other good stuff. :D

review/summary: Make authentic Thai food at home
review/text: We have a large international community in our town and are blessed with dozens of specialty grocery stores.  All of our Asian markets carry Maesri Panang Curry Paste - a product that lets a home cook turn out delicious Thai meals.  The Panang Curry is fresh-tasting and the seasonings are nicely balanced. It's a bit hotter than red curry, but pleasantly so. We saute a couple scallions, a quarter-sized slice of pulverized ginger, and a clove of pulverized garlic in a TBS of oil, then add the paste to saute for half a minute. Then we add coconut milk and simmer a couple minutes.<br /><br />About 1/3 of a can of curry paste mixed with 1/2 can of coconut milk is the right amount to season 2 servings.  We freeze the remainder of the milk and curry paste and it's just as good the next time. Be brave! Try this!  Its wonderful!

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I recently realized my wife had a couple of cans of these in the back of our spice cabinet. Turns out the best-by date was 3 years ago so she's obviously had them for a long time but since they were sealed cans I gave it a shot and I was blown away by how close to restaurant quality this stuff is.<br /><br />Here's a tip: If you don't have chicken/beef on hand or if you're vegetarian/vegan, try frying some cauliflower in oil first until it's a little crispy and make a sauce of this paste with a little coconut milk. There's no fish sauce in this brand.

review/summary: The best curry paste for Panang Chicken
review/text: My favorite Thai dish is Panang Chicken, and this is the absolute best Panang curry paste for the recipe.  Unfortunately, I live 250 miles from the nearest Asian food store, which means I sometimes cannot get the ingredients I want.  I've tried a couple of other curry pastes that are sold in regular grocery stores, but they are a poor substitute for this brand and the recipe tastes commpletely different.  This particular curry paste has just the right amount of heat to it and the perfect flavor.<br /><br />I try to stock up on this when I am near an Asian food store because the price is much lower, but I am thankful to know that I can get it here on Amazon when I am craving Panang Chicken and can't wait till I can make a trip to buy ingredients elsewhere.

review/summary: Worked very well
review/text: My aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available. However, she has absoloutely no problems with this. Not once in all the months i've been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way. Not to mention she's acting healthier and seems stronger on this brand.<br /><br />And she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable. She clearly likes the taste.<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat.

review/summary: Keeps my cats happy and healthy
review/text: I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Kitty Junk Food
review/text: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

review/text: Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all.

review/summary: Not minced
review/text: I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money.

review/summary: All By-Product & Corn -- Don't Waste Your Money!
review/text: I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: sounds weird but tastes great!
review/text: I have always loved cinnamon bears and had never heard of the chocolate covered ones until recently.  It sounded a bit weird to me, even though I love chocolate as well, but loving cinnamon bears like I do, I took an chance on them.  All I can say is these taste VERY GOOD!!  They have a familiar taste to them, even though I can't think of any candy that has chocolate and cinnamon.  They are chewy and it's almost like eating a Charleston Chew as far as texture.  That is as enjoyable as the taste, I think.<br /><br />Result is a great candy!!  5lbs is a lot, but would make for a unique party food.  I have asked around and most people don't know these even exist (thought i might be the only one), so it would probably get people talking as everybody knows cinnamon bears and chocolate as individual candies.<br /><br />One suggestion I would make is having a DARK CHOCOLATE variety.  That would be nice.

review/summary: Fabulous! Useful in so many ways
review/text: I purchased this seasoning last spring at our local grocery and used it on everything--pork, seafood, veggies, burgers, you name it--all summer long. Imagine my dismay, when I went to restock, to find the store was only carrying it during the grilling season. Granted, it's great on grilled food, but I used it in so many other ways (a little on eggs is amazing).  There is some zing to this spice blend but it isn't so hot it overrides all other flavors of the food. I have also used several of Emeril's blends and like this one better.  Also, although it is not stated that this blend is gluten free, I cannot tolerate gluten and haven't had problems using this product.) When used liberally on meats it is easy to get a restaurant-blackened flavor with this spice. I absolutely love it and was so happy to see Amazon had some and at a reasonable price. I'm stocking up!

review/summary: Hip Bones helped my dog
review/text: My sister bought a bag of Hip Bones for our 14+ year old dog and we have been giving our pet one in the morning along with one of the Overby Farm Hip Flex Chewable Cherry Dog Treats in the evening. Before we had these I was giving our dog tart cherry juice extract in her food ( I diluted it 2 T of extract to 6 oz of water). I gave 2 T of the diluted mixture mixed into her dog food.  Since I have gotten the Overby Hip Bones I have reduced the cherry extract to 1T in the evening. As I have increased the tart cherry intake for our dog I have reduced and within the last two weeks eliminated prescription arthritis medication (Metacam) for her. She is now two weeks medication free and is doing quite well. I think I am going to gradually reduce the cherry juice extract and see if our dog manages just as well with the Hip Bones treats.  Finding the tart cherry for our dog has been really wonderful since we can eliminate the medication which has potentially damaging side effects.  I recommend Hip Bones. They seem to work and our dog loves them.

review/summary: Very nice coffee :)
review/text: I'm writing this brief review as noone has yet commented on this particular variety.<br />A year or so ago I came to Amazon looking for good single origin coffee as the roaster i had been purchasing from quadrupled their shipping charges, making it somewhat less than practical. Initially I got rather a lot of mediocre to outright bad scorched coffee, then I tried a sampler from coffee masters, and was by & large impressed with the quality, even discovered some new favorites.<br /><br />I approached this particular roast cautiously as noone had yet reviewed it, and there are so many blends, such a variety sold as Java.<br /><br />I am pretty impressed with this particular roast.  It is full and rich, similar in many ways to African coffees (my personal favorites) right down to the clay-red color and chocolatey undertones.  This is the first time I have purchased a Java estate and understood why it is frequently blended with Ethiopian Mokka.  I have some of that arriving in a day or two.. and am *hoping* I can hold on to some of this until it arrives.  Funny thing happens when good coffee gets to my house... it tends to not stay around for very long ;)<br /><br />If I had to choose a single coffee, I would still probably go with Kenya aa, Ethipian yegecheffe or Tanzanian peaberry... but this is right up there... pretty darn close, and the (medium) roast is just about right.  Another single estate coffee from coffee masters which gets it right :).  Now, if Amazon would let me put together a variety pack, I would have it coming every month).<br /><br />Edited to note that my opinion has changed slightly.  As we neared the end of our supply I thought I was really going to miss it.  I'm knocking this one up to my top 5 and raced to get one of the last 2 Amazon had in stock.  I am hoping this was not a micro lot which is gone when the stock is gone.  Really great coffee which I now have in rotation with the 2 Africans which Coffee Masters roasts.  If you are a coffee lover, you will want to try this.

review/text: I saw this tea at a local farmer's market and bought it.  I read the description and thought I would give it a try. I have been dealing with PCOS for at least 6 years now and have had amenorrhea off and on.  I drank the tea as directed (2-3 cups a day). I drank it hot as well as an iced tea every single day, and have had normal cycles ever since.  I would recommend it to any woman who has similar problems and who might not want to rely on medication. In addition, it taste with a slight mint/citrus taste.

review/text: Chuck a bag into your water bottle and sip cold during the day, or make a tea every 4 hours or so.  Decimates bloating, mood swings, foggy brain, cramps.  Start drinking it at the first twinges of pms for strongest results.  I've used this for years and don't know what I did before it.

review/summary: This Tea is Amazing!
review/text: Five months ago I was diagnosed with Endometriosis (they think I have it but haven't done a laparoscopy to confirm) and was put on Birth Control pills from my Gyno. I don't do well on birth control; it makes me extremely unbearable to be around due to the intense mood swings it causes. But because I was in chronic pain from the Endometriosis I decided to try it. After three months I had to stop and find an alternative method because I wasn't handling the birth control well at all. This caused me to search for alternative/holistic methods to help ease the pain and regulate my periods. I read others reviews on this site and on fertility sites about the benefits of raspberry leaf tea. Since I use the Throat Coat from Traditional Medicinal which works wonders I trusted the brand completely.<br /><br />After I got off the birth control I started drinking this tea immediately, as directed and included Chaste Tree (VITEX) extract into each cup 2-3 times a day. I even steep it for the recommended 15 minutes to maximize the benefits. Since starting this I have reduced my periods from a standard super heavy flow for 7-8 days to a light-medium flow for 3.5-4 days (PLEASE NOTE HOW AMAZING THAT IS!) It started working right away on my very first period off the birth control but before I wrote a review to preach about it I waited another two cycles to see if it was consistent. It was! My periods are regular and the cramping has become less and less each month.<br /><br />Would I recommend this tea? ABSOLUTELY! If you have an issue with Endometriosis this could be an alternative to birth control pills and is something that I've found really helpful for reducing the length of my period and thus reducing the damaging effects that Endometriosis can cause. I am SO GRATEFUL for the accessibility to these types of traditional medicines!!! THANK YOU TRADITIONAL MEDICINALS!!!

review/summary: Didn't expect this to work....
review/text: After an usually unpleasant cycle, I started drinking this tea daily.  I have one cup in the morning after breakfast and one or two in the afternoon or evening.  My last cycle was noticeably better!  This did not help at all with the pms mood swings or water retention (which is does not claim to do) but I did notice that my actual period was much more pleasant than it has been in a long time.  I also noticed that the "flow" itself was different, more consistent, fewer clots, etc.  I can best describe the whole experience by saying that it seemed very healthy and what I would expect my "ideal" cycle to be like (except for the pms!).  Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />This tea is delicious and I would drink it even if I saw no benefit.  Its slightly sweet with a hint of mint and an undertone of raspberry leaf flavor.  Very complex and delicious.  I love this tea!  Very nice product!

review/summary: Female Toner is HEAVEN SENT!
review/text: This tea works wonders!  I am in my mid 20s and ever since puberty, the first 1-2 days of my period were absolutely unbearable.  I would literally stay in the bathroom for hours on end in excruciating pain from cramps and terrible nausea and vomiting.  Anything I tried to eat would eventually come right back up.  I also had hot and cold sweats and light headedness.  When my symptoms finally subsided, usually 6-8 hours later, I would be completely exhausted and dehydrated.  Due to the severity of my periods, I would have to leave school, work, or any activity I was doing as I obviously couldn't be in public going through this. I know no woman likes getting her period, but I actually feared mine every single month!<br /><br />My doctor prescribed prescription strength sodium naproxen, but this did nothing to help.  Once I finished college, I decided to start taking birth control pills, at the recommendation of my doctor.  The birth control helped my pain quite a bit, but I did not like the other side effects that came with it.  After a year on the pill, I got fed up with these side effects and quit taking them.  I decided to go to my local health food store and picked up everything they had for mentrual pain, one item being the Female Toner Tea.  After one month of drinking two cups of tea a day, my menstrual cramps were so minimal I was in absolute shock/JOY! I did not have any vomiting or hot and cold sweats either!  I have been drinking this tea ever since and cannot say enough good things about how it has changed my life.  I can now get through my day when I start my period without having to suffer the terrible pain and vomitting that I endured for so many years before.  I usually take a couple Aleve for the first day when I get some uncomfortable cramping, but this is absolutely nothing compared to the type of pain I was going through before and it usually only lasts a couple hours- totally manageable.<br /><br />I wish more doctors advocated natural herbal remedies to their patients instead of automatically prescribing strong medications or hormones that are not good for our bodies.  I tell my doctor and  women who suffer from difficult mentruation about this product all the time and hope that they spread the word to give herbal a try!  I recommend this tea to any woman who is suffering from the symptoms I had before I found this product.  I have been drinking this tea for over 3 years now and it still works wonderfully for me!

review/summary: Uterine toner
review/text: Thought I should write a review for others in case they experience similar symptoms. The tea definitely does not taste bad at all. I began taking to regulate cycles. On the side of box it states that "Female Toners supports female systems by combining herbs to support healthy menstruation, purify blood and to strengthen and tone the uterus". While I did not notice too much difference in my cycles (probably because I did not take long enough), I definitely noticed the uterine toning. My uterus would contract, giving a very uncomfortable feeling. I know what it feels like as I've had 3 children. I went to drinking only 1/2 cup each time to ease this uncomfortable feeling, which helped. I called the 800 number for Traditional Medicinals to ask if this was normal, but they didn't seem to know. So I guess I'm just saying, if this happens to anyone, I think it's normal but it was enough to make me not want to stick with drinking the tea for long. I am however ordering other tea from Traditional Medicinals as obviously I know they have some great products which seem to work.

review/text: I generally love these Sunbelt products.  They are tasty and healthy and that is a wonderful combination.  Sadly, these bars have a distinct taste that is off-putting and really makes them less than wonderful in my eyes.  The outer shell smells and tastes like a wheat tortilla.  I'm not joking.  The center is wonderfully apple like and the cinnamon flavor is apparent, but the initial taste one has when placing this in their mouth is not pleasant.

I have ALWAYS been a fan of salt and vinegar chips, but these very crunchy things are just awesome! they go GREAT with a nice sub sandwich to complete a lunch. this might sound like a commercial, but I am in no way affiliated with this company, I just really like these chips. they are not for people who don't like super crunchy, kettle-cooked type chips though. I don't know about buying 25 bags at once lol but I do suggest you try them if you can get your hands on some. another thing... they tend to be expensive in the store. the deli had them for 1.25, I guess that's not so bad. it's worth it to buy a bag a week lol.

review/summary: hmm... dogs enjoy, but there are healthier liver treat options
review/text: My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is "made with liver".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken "by-products"-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide.
