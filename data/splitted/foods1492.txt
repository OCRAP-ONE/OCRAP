review/text: Like most of the other reviews state, you can use this product for just about anything. Cooking. Hair care. Skin care. The list goes on and on. It's also great to give to your fur-kids, of which I have 6. I use this in my baking to replace butter, shortening or margarine and you can't tell the difference. Love it!

review/summary: Used to help repair my bad teeth and gums.
review/text: After seeing a few youtube videos about oral care using this type of coconut paste I opted for this brand. It tastes good in the mouth and after swishing for 15 minutes each night it seems to have helped my gums feel better and brushing no longer hurts the gums. But I also changed a few things in my routine like using Sensodyne Pronamel tooth paste (big help) and the new Cinnamon Listerine Total care. - I have not used to oil/paste for cooking at all but I can see it being great for baking and using in sweets that call for oils. For oral care it takes about 1 minute to turn into an oil in your mouth and leaves your mouth tasting nice and sweet. So before romantic night of kissing I would highly recommend this paste prior to kissing! Just be sure you do not swallow this stuff as it is very high in fat but if you are constipated it will help "ease your troubles" if you do swallow some of it.

review/summary: Difficult to use.
review/text: This came in 2 pretty big jars.  I opened one and it was completely white. After a week or so of using it, i saw small black patches of what looked like mold on the surface of the surface. So I scraped it off. But within a couple of days, it grew back. I thought it was disgusting. Didn't want to throw such expensive oil away though. So I refrigerated it.  When refrigerated, the oil is hard as a brick. It's really difficult to scrape out chucks for use.  I mostly use this for pan frying eggs, veggies, meats, toast, etc.

review/text: This brand of coconut oil is just great.  It has a light, fresh, creamy taste.  It is great for cooking or can be used in place of butter on bread, veges, or for anything you might use butter.  From what I have read, there are really good health benefits from coconut oil also.  I have not used any other brands of coconut oil, but see no reason to try others because this one is so good.

review/summary: Dreamy & Luscious!!!!!
review/text: I have never cooked with coconut oil before, but after reading the great reviews on this product, decided to subscribe to it on "Subscribe & Save" here on Amazon. Received my first shipment, and today cracked open a jar for the first time to cook some homemade lamb patties.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. The oil spread very evenly over the skillet, almost in a gel-like manner--unlike oil.  The kitchen took on such a wonderful smell because of the mixture of the cooking meat with the coconut oil.  The patties cooked evenly and beautifully because none of them were on a "bare spot" on the skillet. And it didn't take very much to create this culinary heaven!! I may have used three-quarters of a teaspoon for four patties.<br /><br />In short: I'm SOLD!

review/text: I originally purchased this product for my hair but I think I prefer to use it in my food better than the results I got from using it in my hair. It is in a tub jar so you would need to scoop it out with a spoon. I like that is stays solid until you put it in your hands or on your food then it starts to melt. The smell is delicious and it isn't overwhelming. For my hair it was soft but I felt as though it weighed my hair down even after washing it afterward. For my food, it gave a subtle coconut taste and was delicious and not to greasy. I love that it is organic and is extra virgin coconut. Definitely worth trying.

review/text: I really like this c oil. It has a great taste, but no greasy aftertaste. Tonight I cooked fish filets in it. They tasted much better than other oils like olive or sunflower oils.<br />Packaging was great, no leakage at all. The paper and plastic membrane was very tightly fastened to the rim of the jar. I was a bit surprised that an organic c oil would be put into a plastic jar. Next time I will find a comparable product in glass jars. Although if that is not possible I would buy Nutiva c oil again.

review/summary: a healthier fat for baking and frying and it tastes great too!
review/text: Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil can easily be a healthier replacement in your baking and frying recipes. Mono fats like olive and coconut are healthier fats than even sunflower, vegetable, and canola oils, however olive oil doesn't tolerate the higher heats for frying/pan frying and some people don't like the way it tastes in baked goods.  Coconut oil doesn't contribute to slowing of the thyroid like vegetable oils can and tolerates the higher heats of frying that olive oils can't.  It imparts a light tasty coconutty flavor to baked goods.  I just wish it came in more user friendly packaging.  Convenient 1/2 cup portions within a larger container for instance would be great.

review/text: Been experimenting with Coconut Oil.  The Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin is very nice with barley a hint of coconut taste.  Been using it mostly to cook eggs and it does much better than the vegetable oil it replaced.<br /><br />One side effect of taking this oil in teaspoon+ quantities a day is that I sleep much warmer at night. It could be placebo or some other factor but I almost immediately noticed this effect this winter.<br /><br />I would buy this product again, though it would be nice to pay about half.  Might go for a larger quantity next time.

review/text: I have just begun to discover all the amazing uses for coconut oil and its' incredible health benefits.  Google it and you will be amazed!  I knew that I only wanted to use Organic & Extra Virgin coconut oil.  I did a price comparison and this was the best price anywhere especially when I signed up for "Subscribe & Save".  The smell is wonderful.  I now use it daily as my face lotion and anywhere my skin is dry.  When my 6 year old was diagnosed with Eczema, I used coconut oil instead of the prescription and it went away in a few days.  It is also fantastic for cooking and baking.  I use it as a butter substitution.  I know that it costs more then vegetable oil or butter but the health benefits outweigh the price for me.  I have purchased it in a glass jar in a grocery store and wish that it came shipped to me in a glass jar instead of plastic so it would not be exposed to the toxins in the plastic.  Highly recommended!!!

It tastes great and I can get it for a good deal on Amazon. The main advantage over the other brands is the container shape. It makes it so much easier to get the coconut oil out... unlike the standard jars.<br /><br />I cook pretty much everything with it - sauteed asparagus or other veggies, I use it for baking or spread it on grilled cheese sandwiches - AMAZING!!<br /><br />I also use it as a mask for my hair or for my dry skin.

review/text: i have used this product, nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil, for about 8 months now...and i have to say that, 1. it has a high heat resistance so my foods don't burn (not like olive oil which has a low resistance to heat), 2. the taste with my foods is exceptional, and 3. it is really REALLY good for you...coconut oil is expensive but i find it lasts me for a long time...about a month for a 29 fl.oz. though i use it for just me, one person.  i also dribble it on my pets foods for their health and their coats...i use my oil every day....and i feel great!  a very good product !!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1MI">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a>

review/text: Wasn't sure if this coconut oil would pass the tests but it did. It's organic, extra virgin, cold pressed, not refined or deodorized or bleached. After my first order, I reordered the larger size and am getting it auto shipped from now on. I have started using this to replace all but olive oil and flaxseed oil so am glad that it comes in various sizes. I already use it for a moisturizer and if I ever need a bug repellant, I am going to use this. It's what they use in Panama for the skeeters and cheetras(no see ums).

review/summary: LOVING THIS PRODUCT!!!
review/text: A friend of mine recommended this.  I use it on my daughters hair as a scalp moisturizer.  The oil makes its way down the shaft of her hair leaving it shiny but not heavy.  I live in south florida and because of the temperature the oil is rarely solid so I keep it in an applicator bottle.  I will be a customer for life.  Oh yeah, I keep a little bit in the kitchen for cooking.  Great Flavor.

review/text: This oil is not as opaque as pictured.  I made delicious coconut ice cream first.  Then I tried it on toast and it didn't really taste like anything.  I will use this item when coconut flavor is required in baking.<br /><br />This item really shone when it was used for frying Indian spices.  The spices for once did not burn and the fragrance was amazing.  It is a true flavor enhancer.<br /><br />gme

review/summary: Product was bad but customer service was excellent
review/text: On 9/9/2011 I order the above product.  My daughter and I recently started the Atkins diet, heard wonderful things about it and decided to give it a try.  The first jar was wonderful!  Creamy, aromatic, flavorful...absolutely devine.  I opened the second jar at the beginning of this week and what a disappointment.  I'm not sure if the ingredients are cooked but the oil has a burnt horrid taste to it.  Before we realized it, we had made a batch of carb-free chocolate candy with cream cheese and coconut frosting, a huge batch of chicken fried in the oil and a huge batch of faux-potatoes using the oil.  We had to throw everything away.  The taste was atrocious.  Everything had a burnt and bitter taste to it.  I'm extremely disappointed and according to my 15 year old daughter, they need to hire better quality control employees.<br /><br />I have to post an update to this review because I've been working with a customer service rep today and he has provided fantastic service.  He is shipping me, for free, a replacement product as well as some additional free products.  I am also sending the remaining jar back to the company, at no cost to me, for additional research.

review/summary: Smart and Savory
review/text: I used to cook with coconut oil years ago, but gave it up when the "experts" said it was bad for your health. I started cooking with "healthier" alternatives--like artificial sweeteners and chemical-loaded, aerosol-powered, partially hydrogenated cooking sprays--also on the advice of the experts.  My food tasted like a tin can, my skin was an oily mess, I felt sluggish all the time, and my jeans hugged me ever more tightly. Thankfully, the conventional wisdom has come full circle, and I've spent the last few years making the grateful journey back to a more natural--and genuinely healthy--way of living. I looked for a good, organic coconut oil at our regular grocer with no luck, so I was glad to find this brand here on Amazon.  I'll agree with some of the other reviewers that say this oil has a "toasty" scent.  It does, and that's why I like it.  Its warm, toasty aroma actually smells a little buttery--which is perfect if you're using this as a substitute for butter or margarine.  I've tried other oils that have a more coconut-y aroma, and they also had a sweeter, pronounced fruit-oil flavor that's great for desserts and dressings--but clashed with meats and savory dishes. This coconut oil and EVOO now get nearly equal time in my day-to-day cooking, and the warm "toastiness" of this oil adds a richness that enhances other flavors. I can't see it working in place of butter on something like toast or popcorn, but cooking with it gives a noticeably buttery taste to foods. This came in a pack of two tubs, which is convenient since this oil has so many uses. I can have one in the fridge to keep it solid for cosmetic/medicinal use, and the other in the cabinet as an ever-ready liquid for cooking. I'm once again enjoying all the benefits of virgin coconut oil--health, nutrition, beauty, and flavor all in one jar. These containers are fairly small, so if you use this as one of your staple oils, you may want to get a bigger size.

review/summary: Yummy for skin, and your palate!
review/text: (I thought I had reviewed this product already, but perhaps it was under a different size? Oh, well)<br /><br />With apologies for possible redundancy, I will simply say that this stuff is fantastic.<br /><br />Other reviewers have written about the "clean" taste, and I can say that after tasting this product, I wholeheartedly agree. It just tastes fresh.<br /><br />And it melts in your hand. And tastes terrific in food.<br /><br />It DOES have a delicious fresh scent, but make no mistake, it does NOT smell like suntan oil. If you wear it on your skin, you will not smell like the stuff that comes in a brown bottle. It actually fades relatively quickly, but no one will accuse you of rolling around in coconuts.<br /><br />Same goes for putting in food. I think it adds a nice depth and nuttiness, and is yummy in popcorn, as some have stated. But it is absolute HEAVEN in your fried brekkie potatoes.<br /><br />Think it is also worth mentioning that to the lower ratings reviewers, I think that ordering this product in the cooler months has merit. If it becomes liquid at 75-ish degrees, I can see that it would be easy for this stuff to leak, despite what appears to be the best efforts on the part of the manufacturer when it comes to the packaging.<br /><br />Finally, I think that the 15 oz size is fine if you are going to be using this product for topical use only, but if you plan on cooking with it as well, I would recommend getting a larger size-<br /><br />Can't wait to use this during the summer, and show off my glowing skin!<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: Love this product!
review/text: This is the first time I have ever used coconut oil and I love it!<br /><br />I first tried cooking with it--I used one tablespoon in the pan, added onion, garlic, mushrooms and peppers.  I usually use EVOO so I was a bit worried about the taste difference.  It defininely smells like coconut, but surprisingly, it is not overly strong.  The taste was pleasant with my veggies.  First try: delicious and easy.<br /><br />Next, I put some on my face as a moisturizer.  Again, the smell was pleasant and mild.  In the past I have also used EVOO on my skin because it is a milder moisturizer than a store bought facial moisturizer.  EVOO takes hours and hours to soak in, so I only use it at night before bed.  I thought the coconut oil would be similar.  I put in on in the evening and sat down to watch a movie.  It was completely absorbed before I even hit the sheets!  And by the time it was absorbed, the smell was gone (not that the smell of coconut on the skin would be a bad thing!) So it is lovely as a facial moisturizer.<br /><br />Then I read on the label that it could be used in place of butter, so I spread some on a cracker and tried it that way.  It was delicious!  I love the oily texture--similar to butter, with the coconut taste.  So it is a wonderful substitute for butter.<br /><br />I am sure I will find more uses for this incredible product and I can't wait to try it again.

review/summary: Delicious and good for you, it can't get any better than this!
review/text: I bought this coconut oil based solely on other great customer reviews and believe me when I tell you how happy I am that I did! I am 39 years old and at the age where health is something that is starting to become very important to me, as I am starting to see more and more friends and school mates with various health issues.. I have never had any health complaints and have decided to be proactive about health matters, instead of trying to "fix" them as they come along (as long as I'm able, of course). So, in my hours and hours of reading, I came across so many articles, websites and books devoted to coconut oil. I was shocked, that I have never heard of it and I have still not met anyone who uses it.<br /><br />So, I decided I had to try it! The main reason was I read that eating 2-4 teaspoons a day had health benefits, but I have also came across my fair share of home spa recipes for moisturizers using coconut oil as one of there main ingredients. I figured, I couldn't go wrong buying it, because if it didn't taste nice, I could still use it. I'm very happy to report that I was blown away by the taste of this coconut oil! It is not sweet at all but the coconut oil was so reminiscent of a Almond Joy candy bar to me, that I find myself going back for another spoon just to enjoy the delicious flavor..  I'm afraid I'm going to have to reorder more to use in my moisturizer recipes, as I intend to use these two containers to cook with now that I am hooked on this fantastic product.! I would recommend this coconut oil to everyone because of it's many health benefits and versatility of use (You can spread it on your toast it tastes so great or cook with it as you would any cooking oil, as well as use it on your skin. Google Coconut oil moisturizer recipes, cooking recipes and also health benefits for yourself as well as the  health benefits for your dogs if you have pets. You will be amazed at all the interesting information on the web about coconut oil))! Unless you truly dislike coconuts I think you will find, like me, that you now have a new favorite oil!

review/summary: Actual Coconut!
review/text: I have to admit I'm floored by this product.  I'm originally from the West Indies so needless to say I love coconut.  I've tried other extra virgin coconut oils and wasn't impressed, they tasted and smelled more like vegetable oil than anything, and forget about trying them straight.  I was very skeptical about Nutiva but reading some good reviews and being hounded by my vegetarian friend who swears by it, I said what the hell.  It arrived from Amazon and it was in liquid form, which was to be expected as it's 96' in the shade here in Florida.  I removed the lid off the jar and before I even took the seal off, I was entranced by this wondeful coconut fragrance.  I stuck my finger in and even in liquid form, I was tasting nothing but melted coconut.  Later, when it turned into solid form I tried it again, a dap on a teaspoon, once again, nothing but coconut.  Definitely will buy this coconut oil again.  Nutiva did a great job of impressing an Islander ;)

review/summary: Coo Coo for Coconuts
review/text: I love the smell of coconut! However, I must say, I assumed that coconuts were naturally sugary. Well....i was WRONG! There is no sugar taste to this stuff at all! It does have a very strong smell of coconut though, and not much flavor to it.<br /><br />I bought this stuff because of some Candida overgrowth issues I've had recently been dealing with (which was caused by too many antibiotics given to me by my doctor) and also for a new found minor eczema problem (probably caused by the Candida overgrowth).<br /><br />So basically I eat and rub this stuff on me all day. Lol.<br /><br />I love the added taste it gives to coffee or tea. It says it can be used as a 'buttery spread on bread' but I can't imagine actually substituting butter for this stuff.<br /><br />I have yet to cook with it, but I'm sure it will work fine.<br /><br />My stomach problems I've been having have seemed to have cleared up.<br /><br />As far as the eczema, it seems to be helping a bit, but not as quickly as Dermarest Eczema lotion did.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RTU4GE">Dermarest Eczema Medicated Lotion 4 fl oz (118 ml)</a><br /><br />I still find myself scratching a bit, but not nearly as much as before and redness or bumps are gone. However, I am still going to keep using this for my eczema because it is more natural way of clearing it up. After using the Dermarest lotion a few days my heart started pumping slow and hard.<br /><br />One more thing I should mention (why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5) is because I keep forgetting that this stuff melts once it reaches 76 degrees. I inadvertently opened the jar on an angle one day thinking the coconut was still solid and the oil spilled out everywhere!! Definately my own fault, but the jar itself doesn't seem to be the best thing for containing such an oily liquid when it melts. This still would not stop me from purchasing this specific brand though, just don't be an idiot like me and you will be fine.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this brand as I've seen others in stores and they cost about 12 for 1 jar. Amazon had 2 jars for 12. Can't beat that! +++

review/text: This is my first time experimenting with coconut oil and I am very pleased. I've used it in cookies and brownies and they have turned out amazing. I would that that when I make cookies, I melt the oil instead of creaming it with the sugar like you would butter.<br /><br />I've used it on my hand when they dry and crack and it works very well and smells wonderful.<br /><br />I've also used the oil for a stir-fry and in some basmati rice and both turned out wonderfully.<br /><br />0 Cholesterol is an added bonus to the wonderful taste it adds to dishes.

review/text: I've been buying this two-pack of unrefined coconut oil for my family the last couple of years. Great quality, taste and value. If I were to purchase at a local natural food store, I'd pay at least $3 more for the same amount of the same product.<br /><br />We use coconut oil for all of our cooking due to the MFAs and high heat point. It takes the place of butter as a sandwich spread and in most our baking. I also use it (just a touch!) as a hair product for my twin toddlers and a moisturizer for our skin.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend. =)

review/text: I love, love, love this product. I use it for my hair, skin, cook with it and even use for massages.  Its organic, cold pressed, virgin which is the best grade you can get.  The price is very reasonable.  I bought the two container option. I keep one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen. I put a little in a small, reusable container so I can keep in my purse.  Don't want to be without it.

review/summary: Nutiva Coconut Oil is a Multi-purpose product!
review/text: Nutiva is the cleanest Coconut Oil I have ever purchased... It is the best for top of the stove cooking, and greasing or oiling cookie sheets and pie pans... Adds an excellent taste to chicken stir fry... or cooking pancakes, the flavor is great....  The best part is that get some on your hands?  Don't wipe it off, put it on your hands, face, arms or legs, or a treatment for your hair, just prior to washing... what a little container for a versatile product.. buy it,  you will be amazed!

review/summary: Perfect stay fresh size!
review/text: I've been using this brand of coconut oil for over a year and I love it.  I've tried other brands but none of them were as good. I like this 15 ounce size better because you can use it up before it gets rancid. I had a much larger container before but it turned before I used it all up, we live in a hot climate so this is a great size to insure it stays fresh. I use one jar as a cosmetic on my skin and hair and we cook and bake with the other jar and use it in smoothies. It tastes great and is wonderful for baking when you want a little coconut flavor substitute it for the oil in the recipe. Great for curry and sambal recipes. Just know that it solidifies if it gets cold so as a salad oil it's not good because it gets hard when it hits cold food. It will do this when used as a marinade on cold seafood or meat but thats a good thing in that case because it stays hardened on the food till you get it on the grill and then it melts into it making it really tasty! There are too many uses to list and now that we know that coconut oil is a healthy oil there is no more guilt. I highly recommend this great oil.

review/text: This coconut oil is amazing. I use it for cooking, making homemade deodorant, making homemade body wash,  as a butter substitute, on popcorn, on bread.... its just amazing. It smells delicious and tastes SO good. And the subscribe and save price makes it a really great deal :)<br />PS for those who havent used coconut oil, it is solid at below 75 degrees (so pretty much room temperature). It is super easy to melt tho... even just putting it between your fingers will turn it into liquid :)

I cut off a chunk and use it to rub on my skin before a shower.

review/summary: Love, love ...
review/text: I love to use this as a butter replacement in many baked goods such as banana bread and pancakes. Some other goods the coconut taste is more powerful, so I don't usually use it for those. For some reason, we don't care for it in scrambled eggs because we can taste it, but it is perfect for omelets. Not sure why, but you can't taste it there. In baked goods, it lends a perfect crunchy texture to the outside. And you can't go wrong in the health department with this stuff. It's one of the "good" fats, and is full of healthy stuff. I add it to smoothies, too.

review/text: I like the taste and health benefits of this product, my only beef is that it is really messy to get out of the package. I cannot pour it due to the round jar shape. Regardless of how careful I am spooning it out there always seems to be a greasy mess on the countertop and in the pantry on the shelf where it is stored. I'd love to see this coconut oil packaged in a bottle that is easier to pour from, then I'd totally buy it again. So all in all, good product, poor packaging.

Another reviewer recommended frying up a peanutbutter and jelly sandwich by using a tbsp or so per side of the sandwich until golden brown.  It is SOOO good.  I also like how it usually stays solid at room temp.

review/text: I have nothing but great things to say for this oil. I use it in two ways, for cooking (it adds a slight coconut essence) and for my hair. I created a bar of it using my tupperware, as it is solid at room temperature and I use this after I wash my hair. It leaves my hair soft and shiny and isn't greasy. I rub it on my hands and run it through my wet hair and let it air dry. I also sometimes use it on my skin. It absorbs well and does not leave it greasy like baby oil. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Excellent! (for my purposes)
review/text: After hearing a lot of good things about this product in the way of hair-care, I decided to give it a go. I got the two because it was cheapest, and if all else failed, I could cook with it, right?<br /><br />Well, I never got to the cooking phase. This oil is a WONDERFUL moisturizer, and I use it every time I wash my hair - sometimes between washes, if it's an extended time. My hair has never felt so healthy and... not-dry. And after this, I began to wonder what else it was good for. I also discovered it's good as a low-cost additive in paint (oil or acrylic) that keeps the application smooth and elegant.<br /><br />So! Two fun uses that have nothing to do with food. I suppose when I use it correctly, it won't disappoint me there, either.

review/text: The Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is simply, one of the best products out there. If you have not tried cooking with coconut oil, at least give it a try. Fried eggs, fried potatoes fried in coconut oil is delicious. I'm 58 yrs old and just recently tried cooking with cocnut oil.. I've been missing out on something wonderful for years. If you are a popcorn fan, you should eat popcorn cooked in cocconut oil. It is excellent. I also use this on my dry skin. Just put some on your finger and rub it in. Again, this is a great product. Try it, I think you will agree.<br /><br />Tony

I use this coconut oil to make chocolate bark, in my coffee, for my hair, and on our skin as a lotion.  I am very happy with the scent and quality. Will continue to buy this brand. I've tried 2 other brands that were not only more expensive but just did not have the scent or quality of this brand.  And one of the best parts of Nutiva is that you can have it sent free of shipping charge with the super saver shipping!!!

review/text: I have compared many prices of the coconut oil and spent many hours reading reviews of various types/brands.  This one seemed to have many wonderful reviews and hardly any bad ones so I thought I'd try it.  The process used to produce this product keeps it as close to the real thing as possible. Although it seems to be unwise to purchase them in a small container, it actually adds up to less per oz than purchasing the larger ones.  It is excellent on popcorn and once you try it you will never stop using it as the health benefits are awesome.  I also use this on my face as a moisturizer for my face and hair.  It's healthy inside and out...I suggest getting this right away and incorporating it in your diet today!!!!

review/text: I had heard about the wonders of coconut oil not only for cooking but also as body lotion, conditioner, hair gel, and intimate lube. I've been using this for a couple of weeks now and love it! It has a nice, mild coconut smell and works very well for all of the above, though I haven't cooked with it yet. It's solid at room temperature, but melts when you warm it in your hands. I'm glad to use this instead of other products with artificially manufactured chemicals and preservatives in them. I'm very satisfied and plan to use this long term.
