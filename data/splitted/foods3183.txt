review/text: I love Pilon cuban coffee! I'm from Miami, FL and just moved to rural Mississippi recently and can't find it here anywhere! Please do something about that. LOL. In the meantime I'll order form Amazon.com so I can have it in the morning before work and at lunchtime and after dinner. There's some things a Miami girl can't live without, and Pilon is definitely one of them. It's the best coffee in the whole world, hands down.<br /><br />Lula

review/summary: Don't let espresso deter you
review/text: A wonderfully tasting coffee but I offered a package to a friend and she said, "I don't like espresso coffee". Well, it seems to me that the actual use of the word is used to describe the grind of the coffee which is as fine as dust. I don't use this coffee in an espresso machine but just put it in my Mr Coffee with the paper filter. Works great and with the fine grind, one gets much more "mileage" out of a given amount of coffee. The finer grind makes much more surface area of the coffee available as opposed to a regular grind with big chunks of bean which needs much more product to produce a similiar cup of coffee.<br />I found this coffee in a Florida Publix and enjoyed it very much. Upon returning home, the only source for it was on Amazon and even with shipping, its a great bargain. Enjoy.

review/summary: Roasted in USA vs Imported from Italy Saves BIG BUCKS.
review/text: I was ordering cans of the fancy Italian import, but decided to buy from an American roaster and also save some cash.  For less than one can of the import,  I can get four bricks that are comparable in quality. The roaster (Rowlands -javacabana dot com) has a wide variety of blends for everything from true espresso machines to stove top pots.  One note: I believe some of the other blends may use some cheaper "robusta" beans, and therefore may have a bit more caffeine kick. But this one is 100% arabica.<br /><br />Espresso snobs will turn up their noses at pre-ground, but don't let them fool you.  You will need to get a $[...] burr grinder to grind you own beans fine enough to match Pilon.  Blade grinders and cheap $[...] Chinese burr grinders with boutique names  sold in big box stores simply won't cut it.  Even my $[...] grinder is not good enough.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Good Coffee
review/text: This coffee is just outstanding. I don't even know where to start. Umm lets start with the amount of pure Arabica (not cheaper Robusta beens) coffee you get for just 10-12 bucks. 2.5 lbs that's just crazy cheap, but the flavor is anything but cheap. This coffee is probably the best I have tasted. It's very dark and rich, full body, and no bitterness. I use an aerobie coffee maker 2 scoops of this coffee and it makes some darn good espresso. I normally make a American style coffee, buy filling the mug up with hot water. Just the best cup of coffee and the price is so low it's almost a joke. Most things in life you get what you pay for. Well with this coffee you get way more then you paid for and that's nice now a days. I would also like to add that I have also recently bought (Lavazza Qualita Rossa) that was three times the price of Pilon Espresso. It was just horrible. Bad aroma, very bitter, and 2nd rate beans (Robusta). Again for the price you can't beat this coffee. As far as a drip coffee maker, I don't have one. So it might turn out differently for you. I do recommended get a aerobie coffee maker and this coffee.

We used to pay anywhere between $1.50 to $1.99.  Now for the past few months the price has gone up to $2.69/10oz brick or a 10oz.can.  You buy with Amazon you are insane.  The name of the store that we buy our Pilon coffee" is "Tradefair" in New York (Queens).

review/summary: Very good relief; natural anti-inflammatory
review/text: I sustained severe trauma to my upper torso due to a horseback riding incident over 25 years ago.  My C-2,3,4 and 5 discs were ruptured, but as a result of my youth I achieved what seemed at the time a complete recovery.  However, as the years have progressed, the injuries have taken their toll.  I have been to medical doctors and specialists repeatedly, but only for moderate and temporary relief of the pain from the grinding together of the discs.  The lengthiest relief I acquire is through massage  with the mustard rub and copious quantities of curcumin taken orally. The rub does work for me for several hours at a time.  The edge is taken from the pain and I'm able to go about a somewhat normal lifestyle (which does include regular PT exercises as well, but I've been able to dodge further surgery and addictive painkillers thus far).

review/summary: Note - this is duck LIVER, not meat.
review/text: I wanted to write a review to let folks know that these are duck LIVER treats, not duck meat. I bought these before the review posted by "vivere" who also warns folks of this. It is very unfortunate that this ingredient information is not listed for this product, it's important for buyers to know.<br /><br />I did not want another liver treat for our dogs. I wanted regular meat because you can only use a few liver treats per day for a dog. So, while you can use these as a treat, you really wouldn't want to use a large quantity for a larger training session.<br /><br />Anyway, other than the issue of this treat being liver.... Our dogs love them. But, even if they were meat, I would not order again because they are too "crushed" in the package. There was a significant amount of "dust" instead of treat bites in our bag. Amazon packaged it well, with plastic pillows, but I think the product soft-side packaging just doesn't protect it well enough. For our standard liver treats, we buy  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Stewart's Pro-Treat 21 ounce Tub Freeze Dried Dog Treats, Beef Liver by MiracleCorp/Gimborn</a> that come in a hard bucket that helps protect the treats from destruction.  Of course, the reason I didn't want more liver treats is because I already have this one liver treat, and that's plenty.<br /><br />I'm rating this 2 stars because it is different from the standard treats, therefore our dogs love them as a special reward (e.g. used for recall command).  But, I feel like I have to rate this lower because of the lack of ingredient information. It's an important missing fact.<br /><br />Hope this info helps.<br />c-

review/summary: fine sugarless gum with a spearmint burst
review/text: Trident White makes a terrific spearmint flavored sugarless gum. The sugar free gum is healthier for your teeth; and the gum makes your breath fresh in an instant. The thin cardboard package is easy to carry because it is so small; and inside the thin cardboard package the pieces of gum are wrapped individually in tiny plastic pockets that are easy to open. The package states that the gum whitens teeth but I cannot comment on that. Always remember to brush your teeth--this gum isn't a substitute for that!<br /><br />A single piece of gum has absolutely no sugar. Trident White uses sugar substitutes to sweeten the gum. Moreover, the gum stays fresh until the expiration date stamped on the reverse of the package. Good job!<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a couple of caveats: Read the ingredients list to see if there are any ingredients in this gum that might disagree with you. In addition, use this gum before any expiration date printed on the back of the thin cardboard container. Don't chew stale gum!<br /><br />Have further questions? No problem--the manufacturers give you both a toll free number and a website. The website goes into detail about how this gum helps to whiten your teeth.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great gum that comes packaged in an easy to carry container. This gum makes your breath fresh; and it's a very tasty gum that you won't want to spit out after a mere five minutes.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

I forgot how truly awful Trident gum is.<br /><br />I bought a box of Trident, a box of Wrigley's and a box of Orbit all at the same time so I could really try them all out. The worst was Trident.<br /><br />Each piece of this gum is tougher, harder to chew and lasts a fraction of the time the other two gums last. After a short time the Trident gum starts to make the inside of your mouth feel like it's being burned. It's intolerable. It has to be spit out. Whereas, the Orbit and Wrigley's keep their flavor for much longer, don't burn the inside of your mouth and are soft to chew.<br /><br />I wouldn't purchase Trident gum again, any flavor.

The cake was gone in a matter of minutes.  My family all loved it.<br /><br />Like all the other Garvey's products I have received this had a sell by date that is a long way away (2011, in this case.  We'll have eaten these mixes up in a few months- but since I have gotten expired stuff from Amazon, I like that this brand is (apparently) all very fresh.  I took a picture of my cake for facebook to show all my friends- I wish I could show you how pretty this tea cake was when it was baked.

review/text: I am not a huge fan of chocolate, usually only in small doses do I eat it. But I saw this NEW in stores and decided to give it a try. WOW this stuff is awesome! It flavors the milk nicely and doesn't hurt the roof of my mouth like original cocoa puffs, the milk softens it a bit but keeping it crunchy at the same time. Its even good without milk. What I also enjoy is that you get quite a lot for the serving size. It's now been added to my regular cereal rotation!

The flavors vary from packet to packet, but include licorice, buttered popcorn, and bubble gum, in addition to the usual vanilla and fruit flavors.  For Halloween treats, I'll probably offer two packets to each child, unless I start to run out of candy!

review/summary: Awesome stuff! A++++
review/text: This stuff is so good! My dogs go crazy for it. It smells like people food, and I believe it is made with human-grade food. I use 1/2 can per dog, mixed with premium, grain-free dry food. Awesome! Just look at the ingredients listed below!<br /><br />Dogswell Happy Hips Stew Canned Dog Food really is,  "Everything you want, nothing you don't."<br /><br />Happy Hips Stew Canned Dog Food is all natural and grain-free. It contains Glucosamine and Chondroitin to help maintain healthy hips and joints. Made with cage-free and antibiotic-free meat. Contains no soy, corn, rice, gluten, wheat, BHA/BHT, ethoxyquin, rendered poultry, added hormones, artifical colors, flavors or preservatives. Dogswell makes it easy to feel confident that you are feeding your pet natural healthy food.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Water sufficient for processing, lamb, lamb liver, beef, beef liver, salmon, dried egg product, peas, potato starch, sweet potatoes, carrots, red peppers, guar gum, natural flavor, sodium phosphate, shrimp meal (source of Glucosamine), canola oil, spinach, garlic powder, flaxseed oil, squash, cranberries, blueberries, zucchini, potassium chloride, tricalcium phosphate, Chondroitin sulfate, taurine, iron amino acid chelate, vitamin E supplement, zinc amino acid chelate, choline chloride, cobalt amino acid chelate, copper amino acid chelate, manganese amino acid chelate, riboflavin supplement, sodium selenite, thiamine mononitrate, vitamin A supplement, vitamin B-12 supplement, potassium iodide, biotin, vitamin D-3 supplement, Glucosamine hydrochloride.<br /><br />UPDATE: I vary the amount I use in their meals, and I also use other Dogswell Happy Hips and Vitality canned food (the lamb and the duck). Instead of 1/2 can per meal I will often add more dry food and use just 1/4 can per meal per dog mixed with dry (they love Wellness Core Reduced Fat dry food, which is highly palatable on its own as well) instead of a half can per dog, depending on how much of the dry food I'm giving them. With this stuff mixed in with the dry food and the wild salmon oil, they go crazy for it every time. They even love it cold. One of my dogs is supposed to drink a lot of water, so I started to add a little bit of hot water with the dry and wet mix sometimes, and they seem to really enjoy it like that as well.

review/summary: The dog loves it, so I love it
review/text: Switching to grain-free dog food has been the best thing I've ever done for my dog...no more scratching/skin problems, no more constant rear end dragging, no more nonstop paw-licking!  To supplement her wet food I feed her grain-free kibble (salmon and sweet potato or chicken and sweet potato).  The only odd thing I've noticed is that she seems hungrier between meals - not sure if it's just a matter of her getting used to this brand or I need to investigate the volume and/or total ingredients she's getting (although I wonder if I've created a foodie with the various treats I give her between meals sometimes).  Regardless, my vet agreed my dog and grain foods just don't mix - fewer vet appointments makes me a happy girl.<br /><br />Of note, I/we really liked Wellness as well, and it's a bit cheaper, however the fact that this brand uses pop tops vs. having to use a can opener, well, to me this was the deal-maker.  No, I'm not that lazy, but I do have a hand problem that makes using the can opener a pain and I don't want another appliance (electric can opener)! :)<br /><br />I've set this up for monthly deliveries, saves 15% - can always stop without penalty - no more trips to the pet store hoping they have what I seek, instead, delivered to my door :)<br /><br />Update: my first time trying the automatic delivery option and today I received the first shipment.  I was/am impressed to find that I receive(d) reminders from Amazon.com of the pending shipment with the option to cancel instead of "too late, it's shipping". The timing works out well for me/my dog - one case lasts a month as I supplement the canned food with grain free dry food each day.  Not only is the cost savings appreciated, but I appreciate not having to run out to the pet store on a regular basis....which often meets me with "we're out, it's on order, come back in a week".  I'm sold!

review/summary: My dog loves this and it seems to help
review/text: I have a 9 year old Pomeranian and she has bad knees and hips. I have her on glucosamine pills and to find a dog food with glucosomine and other healthy ingredients is awesome. Plus she loves this stuff and seems to have more bounce in her steps and more energy and playfulness.. I recently adopted a 3 yr old Pomeranian and I am going to get the Vitality formula for her. This stuff has great ingredients and once your eyes are opened about the junk that the main dog food companies put in their food you never want to feed that to your pets again. It is worth the extra money. If only I have known about that when my 9 yr old was a growing puppy it might have helped her and prevented the joint problems. Companies like Purina, Pedigree, even regular formula Iams, Beneful, Kibbles 'N Bits == crap.. I really appreciate that amazon and dogswell have this food on their site and with a great price. I love Amazon.com!!

review/text: I usually prepare my dog's meals (mixing protein sources with The Honest Kitchen) since I have the luxury of working from home.  However, I will be traveling more without my baby so I needed an alternative that will make life easy for my husband when he's home with our pet.  I went online and did extensive research on canned petfood that is natural and if possible human-grade.  After learning that Dogswell use cage/hormone-free poultry in addition to the positive reviews from customers, I took a chance and ordered the 12-pack of the chicken and sweet potato formula.  I am more than thrilled I gave it a try.  I was impressed with the large chunks of meat and veggies mixed with gravy.  Very gourmet quality.  If I wasn't vegetarian, I would have tried it myself!  If our dog wasn't already spoiled!  It's comforting knowing our baby will eat well when I'm away since my husband won't be cooking anything :)

review/summary: Even picky dogs, like mine, love this food!
review/text: I love my dog, a 6 year old Siberian Husky named Dexter, but he is pickier than even any small child I've ever met.  The dog seems to think he should eat what I eat (even though in reality, his food is healthier than mine) and will turn his nose up at a bowl of food that most dogs would devour in seconds.  But then I found Happy Hips in a can!  Dexter was already a fan of the chicken treats, so I thought I'd give this stuff a try.  He walked to his bowl, sniffed the food, stepped back for a moment, looked at me and then finally returned to his bowl to eat the food.  He loved it!  This is unusual for Dexter since he can go a day or two without eating, just to make it clear to me that he doesn't like the food I've given him.  I was pleased when he ate this can at the time when I wanted him to eat.  I sometimes mix it with Dogswell's Vitality kibbles and he seems to enjoy that too.  I very highly recommend this food if you have a picky eater in your household.

review/text: I was hesitant on purchasing canned food as my Aussie seems to get the runs no matter what kind it is. Yes, I transition my dogs into their foods for those questioning that. I was please to see that I could get this for 19.00 on subscribe and save as I was paying 20.00 on another site. I'm now frustrated that this has gone up in price to 22.43. Amazon seems to do this often with everything, but I've especially seen it on dog food. I use to purchase all my dog food from amazon and now I go elsewhere. They use to have the best price for Halos spots stew, and now they are more expensive that the website. Needless to say my dogs love this and no one had the runs and I loooooove, LOVE the ingredients in here. This is great food for the cost, but I will now be going back to the website I normally purchase my dog food from. With 3 large dogs, we go through lots of food and every dollar counts for us.

review/summary: Poor customer service
review/text: In general I love using xylitol and erythritol -- it is a great sweetener and a healthy alternative to sugar and artificial sugar substitutes. But when I received my order of erythritol from this company, it had a very strange smell. Too nasty for me to use the product, so I called for instructions on how to get a refund. When I asked where they got the substance, they said from China. This had me worried. I was not sure where the rest of their products came from, but they did confirm some of them do come from China.  I was concerned about product contamination, not knowing why the product smelled as it did.<br /><br />I ordered a great variety of items including the candies from them.  But when I called to voice my concerns about some of the products, they were very rude and negative on the phone and even hung up on me at one point. I would not order from them again, especially since NOW foods has a better product and wonderful customer service.<br /><br />(Note:  their xylitol apparently comes from the US.  I don't know why the erythritol is not, but this information is from their own representatives.)

review/text: The small bag is a perfect size for when you're only sharing with one person or you just want a quick snack.<br />The popcorn is a little greasy, but it's sooo delicious.<br />The one (BIG) problem I have is that the bag tends to burn, I don't know if this is something I'm doing wrong, but I hate it.<br /><br />The first time I made it: bag super burnt and popcorn didn't make, bag did not even inflate. Second time I made it, worked fine. Third time, bag burnt, butter melted, big mess.<br /><br />My microwave works fine with other popcorn, so not sure what is wrong.

review/summary: EXCELLENT
review/text: This product arrived three days after i placed the order! For a good price, you get the most realistic can safe available. This one is bigger than the cheap pepci can, allowing you to be able to fit a lot more in it. We bought a real arizona tea can, and found no difference at all, down to the serial codes. The fact that it is weighed to feel more real is awesome, and makes it impossible to break apart or dent. There is no sceme where you unscrew the cap, and when you look inside, you see two layers of aluminum, the outside layer filled with some rubbery like substance, to protect the contents from shock, and it makes the can feel pressurized like a normal soda can would. in the middle is a big empty cavity where you store whatever.<br /><br />Overall, excellent product, amazing shipping, my money well spent.

review/summary: Very Well Designed !!!
review/text: I am extremely impressed with this can safe.  First, this is not a reproduction of an Arizona can ... it is an actual Arizona can that has been converted into a safe ... plus the one that I received has the UPDATED design, so it is exactly the same as you'd pick up at your local 7-11 (currently in 2012).  The weight also feels very close, and there is no seam where the top screws off.  I think they did one fine job with this can.  Stash it with a bunch of real cans and your valuables should be well hidden in plain sight (the best way to do it !!).<br /><br />Bottom line - I have 2 cans side by side - one with actual Arizona Ice Tea and the other is the can safe - YOU CANNOT TELL ANY DIFFERENCE BY APPEARANCE !!!

review/text: The can looks nothing like the picture, the colors are wrong and the logo is sideways so it doesn't look like a real can, so that's pretty pointless. It's also dented right on the top. I've had different ones before that looked perfect so this one is definitely a disappointment.

review/summary: Damaged via mail
review/text: The product was shipped in a manilla envelope with a bit of bubble wrap. The lid was broken off the screw top and the lip of the safe was dented.  I glued the top back with super-glue and straightened it back up. (I didn't feel like waiting for a replacement.) Additionally, the can was not as pictured. It was an Arizona health drink which sort of sticks out in my pantry with canned goods. I kept it anyway.  It looks like and feels like a real can so overall, I think this is a great consealed safe.<br />  My only suggestion is for the company to use a small box to ship it.  If you order one, you might request it.  I would buy this product again.

review/summary: Wonderful experience
review/text: I love my Moka pot.  It keeps my espresso habit at a very inexpensive cost value.  I stumbled on this type of Illy espresso (made especially for the Moka pot).  It is coarser than the grind you'd find for a real machine.  I first found the Illy brand in the airport in Germany and the line was long.  I now understand why.<br /><br />It also has that classic Illy taste.  Not too much bite or bitterness.  The Illy espresso is 100% arabica beans made from producing countries.  It is very smooth.  One added bonus, I can take the grinds out to my garden to help my soil.  By using the Moka pot, I cut down on the amount of waste (from filters, pods or capsules)<br /><br />This espresso made with a Moka pot, coupled with a milk frother unit and you can have the ultimate value in espresso or cappuccino at home!<br /><br />The shipping took a while, but it was free and the Illy standard of packing the espresso in Nitrogen keeps the grinds away from oxidation.  The smell when it is first opened is wonderful!

review/summary: Much better than Starbucks "bold" espresso roast
review/text: I upgraded to this for my Bialetti Moka pot after using about half a bag of the Starbucks espresso roast... there is just no comparison.  The Starbucks blend left an over-roasted bitterness behind after every sip, even in mixture with steamed milk and mocha powder.  The Illy product is superior by a huge margin; the smell when you open the sealed cans is enough to make the difference obvious.  It's a bit pricey, but not too bad in the 2-packs with Prime membership (free 2-day shipping).  Once I judge my consumption, I'll go on the 15% discount subscription delivery plan.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Delicious Moka Coffee
review/text: This grind of Illy's popular Normale roast coffee was created specifially for the Bialetti Moka Express coffee maker. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNY6UK">Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a><br /><br />The coffee comes out thick, rich, and aromatic.  The Moka brewers give two-ounce servings.  It is close to the consistency of cream with a very strong (but not bitter) taste.  The moka grind prevents sediment from getting into the coffee and leaves you with a shot of pure coffee essence.<br /><br />While not true espresso, this grind will give you the best results you can get from the Italian stovetop coffee brewers.

review/text: This coffee is really delicious.  The particular blend of Illy coffee goes hand in hand with the Moka stovetop coffee maker. We make this coffee every morning after coming back from a trip to Italy and love it. We bought the 3 cup and 6 cup Moka stove top coffee maker from Bialetti and use this Illy Moka blend only and love it.  I don't think you can use this blend as you would a regular espresso using a regular espresso machine.

review/summary: Illy Moka is the best!!!
review/text: I thought I was in heaven when I acquired the Bialetti Brikka stovetop espresso (Moka Pot) maker.  I loved it so much that I actually purchased a second one just in case the first one failed me. THEN........I came across Illy MOKA coffee,that is roasted and ground especially for stovetop makers and have to say it is by far the absolute BEST tasting coffee I ever had.  I've tried Starbucks Espresso blend and just as the other person said, it left a strong bitter after taste leaving a displeasing taste on my pallet.  When made correctly, this coffee will yield about 1/8" layer of crema with a velvity smooth flavor.<br /><br />I also own a Bodum milk frother that goes hand-in-hand with my Brikka pot and Illy MOKA coffee.  I am able to replicate cappaccino that will stand up to ANY local coffee house.  I say this with confidence because it's true, so I must share my success.  The trick in my opinion is to use fresh 2% milk with a drop of light cream for absolute perfect froth.<br /><br />I'm rambling... but bottom line is ILLY MOKA COFFEE is the BEST on the market!!!  Get some today and you won't be dissapointed.  I also like the fact that they are in vacuum sealed 8.8 oz. cans that you can use up before they have a chance to get stale.<br /><br />Happy coffee drinking!

review/summary: Enjoy Illy Espresso Outdoors
review/text: I've been drinking Illy espresso for over 20 years.  It's the only brand of coffee I will drink if I have anything to say about it.  Usually, I brew Illy's whole bean medium and dark roast in my super  automatic espresso maker. So what do I do when going camping?<br /><br />I recommend Illy's MOKA coffee for those espresso drinkers who want to enjoy their warm coffee while out in the wilderness.  For those who do not already have a MOKA stove top coffee maker, I would highly recommend one of the Bialetii Moka Express stove top espresso makers that are sold right here on Amazon.  If you like to travel light like me, you may also want to purchase an MSR Pocket Rocket stove which is also available on Amazon.

review/text: Makes delicious and unique drinks. Everything about this product is attractive, from the packaging, recipe pamphlet, glass infusion chambers to even the tea packets. It is a little pricey but the glass and teas are quality, so I think it's worth it.<br /><br />I bought this as a gift for a girl turning 21 who liked drinking, but not heavily, and loved tea. It was a great way to celebrate the spirit of the occasion while still giving an interesting gift (as opposed to just a bottle of liquor or something).<br /><br />The directions say each tea packet should only be used once, but we found this was not the case. They could steep at least 2-3 times; just let them steep longer with each use. I figure it says this because they want you to buy more tea packets, which of course are a little pricey. You can also probably get away with steeping it in more liquid than they list in the recipes.

review/text: The product description here does not specify exactly what you are getting, but the picture strongly implies dulce. Wrong!<br /><br />The blue tin top in the picture matches a tin we had, which was dulce (sweet). We received a product with a black top - we thought it was just a package design update. However, it was agridulce (bittersweet, or medium hot), a distinction we did not notice until the product was opened.<br /><br />Since La Dalia makes three types (dulce, agridulce, and picante - hot) perhaps this vendor may ship you any of those. Be forewarned!<br /><br />This product La Dalia Sweet Smoked Paprika by La Tienda specifies the dulce type. Note the explicit picture.
