review/text: Actually too sweet for me but they do the job in an emergency.  All the good things are packed inside, I know they're the healthy choice but lots of water needed to get them down.  Nice packaging and this is the place to order them if you're looking for a discount.

review/summary: great for quick snack
review/text: I have been buying Larabars for some time now and I have to say, they are the best source of "good" calories, especially for someone who deals with changes in blood sugars.  The nuts provide fibre and the " good " fats, whereas the dates are a great source for energy on the go.  I love the new flavours ( Peanut butter chocolate chip and the chocolate chip brownie).  My old favourite still is the coconut chocolate chew--I am a huge fan.  They are so much better than any old chocolate bar--in fact, chocolate bars not even in the ballpark as far as a comparison!

review/text: I have been on a journey to shed weight and have lost over 100 pounds. I got all the junk food out of my diet and turned to natural whole foods like lean meat, nuts, fruits, and lots of veggies. I wanted to find something I can bring along with me in my purse and when I travel that was easy and healthy. My personal trainer told me about Larabar and now I am hooked. Of all the flavors I love these best: Lemon, Cherry Pie, Chocolate Chip Brownie, Blueberry Muffin, and Banana Bread. Yum!

review/summary: Great for Snack Attack!
review/text: I choose to follow a gluten-free, dairy-free diet because I have multiple sclerosis.  This product enables me to have my "sweets" without the consequences.  It's substantial & if I have two, I end up skipping a meal. (Not recommended, I know.)  The consistency is slightly moist, compact, heavy; the flavor is not overly sweet, peanut butter-y and fun (it's the only way I can describe it) when you get the chocolate chip.  If the bars had any more chips, they would overpower it.  I only wish it was a wee bit larger.  Just a wee bit because I go through three to four boxes every month.

review/summary: Carrot Cake
review/text: I just discovered a new flavor of Larabar:  Carrot Cake.  I love carrot cake, and this bar is awesome.  It tastes just like carrot cake.  The yummy, scrumptious ingredients of dates, almonds, walnuts, raisins, pineapple, unsweetened coconut, carrots, cinnamon, and extra virgin olive oil all put together is heavenly.  This is one of my favorite flavors of Larabars.<br /><br />I can't sing enough praises for Larabars:  good taste, healthy, convenient.  It's good to have a few (or a lot) on hand in case you get a little hungry or weak.<br /><br />And, oh, I must mention:  These bars are created and made in Colorado.  I know, that has nothing to do with the goodness of these bars.  But Colorado is my new favorite state, so I mentioned it.  The goodness of these bars are just as wonderful as Colorado is beautiful.  And if you know how breathtaking Colorado is, then you know I am comparing these bars to something awesome.  Awesome, healthy, tasty bars that are convenient.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like these type of bars.<br /><br />Carrot cake highly recommended if you like carrot cake.

review/text: I was surprised by these bars when they were provided as a snack while out on a sailing trip. These bars are soft & moist, and more like eating actual food than the typical nutrition bar. I am so tired of the bars that taste like sawdust, and am really tired of having to eat something dry and with oats if I want nutrition (mind you.. I actually like oats, but options are nice). I didn't consider myself a fan of dates, one of the main ingredients, but this is such a pleasent alternative that you will be serendipitously delighted.

review/summary: Can't live with out these!
review/text: Have to Love Lara bars!  The only raw, natural,delicious snack to be found widely at most groceries in our area, and in so many flavors!  No added sugar or salt!  They have only 3-5 ingredients each.  All raw (except the peanuts in the peanut butter flavors are roasted.) It is exciting to be able to have them in larger quantities at a significantly lower price.  Now we never run out!  I think I'm going to have to set them up on subscription to be automatically shipped monthly!  They arrive quickly and we take them everywhere and enjoy them.  Even my two year old loves them.  Perfect for when you are away from home or don't have time for a meal and don't want to consume something full of bad fats, sugar, and preservatives.  Three in our family are gluten intolerant.  It is very hard to find something gluten free when you are out and about.  These are naturally gluten free!

review/text: The bar is pretty good. Taste more like cinnamon than apple pie IMHO!!<br />The texture, to my surprise was pretty mushy, thick and had bits of almond throughout.<br />Very chewy and you can taste the real fruit inside. (just think of a few different dried fruits pressed together)<br />This was my first time trying bars like this as part of a new diet. I like the minimal ingredients used.(no chems)<br />I ate the Trio brand bars along side this one for comparison.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because of personal preference. I like the more nutty, crunchy textures of the Trio brand.<br /><br />Overall, I think it was a good bar. Not high on cals pretty good on nutrients.<br />Looking for a good tasting vegan bar, this is a good one to try out.

review/text: I've now sampled four different varieties of LaraBar, and here's my main take on the lemon ones: if you like lemon squares, this is your bar.  The all-natural raw foods approach makes for a great snack bar - not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner - but the lemon flavor here is definitely not subtle.  I still enjoyed the box, but prefer the cherry pie or banana cookie flavors.

The fat in L&Auml;RABAR comes primarily from nuts-all plant-based fats containing Omega 3 & 6 essential fatty acids, which have been proven to reduce LDL cholesterol and help protect the heart."  I read all the reviews before making this purchase and I was amazed at how misleading PEN PAL's, review was (they said: "LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES!").  It sounded scary.<br /><br />Olive oil is good for you, but no matter what, the calories from fat (9 calories per gram) are going to be the same whether it is from bad sources of fat or good sources.  The calories from this product are from good sources and that is what counts.  Everybody who has gotten to the point of good intelligence regarding managing their intake of food should be aware how to use good fats vs bad fats, good carbs vs bad carbs but this IS, in my estimation, a very healthy product and just as you would not put too much olive oil on your food, or overeat nuts, you won't binge on Larabars or anything else you know will have unwanted consequences.  I'd give these delicious bars a try and fit them into your food management routine any way you see fit!  It definitely goes in the good food category for sure.  Don't hate the fat, hate the lack of discipline and they are a tempting yummy. :)

review/summary: Delicious Snack/Energy Bar without Fake Sweetener Aftertaste
review/text: I'm on the go and trying to keep healthy and fit by making sure I eat at regular intervals. I tried the "energy" bars and "nutrition" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw these in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />I have now tried most of the Larabar flavours, and these are my favourite - very simple 2-ingredients, but they go great together.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar.

review/summary: Still Love 'Em
review/text: I am a food bar junkie. I found these at Whole Foods about 6 months ago, and eat them regularly. I still havent got tired of them. I basically eat them as a meal supplement. I look for bars that taste good, are low in saturated fat, high in fiber, high in protein, and low in things like corn syrup and sodium. The Larabar product meets all these criteria. They are kind of unusual in their consistency though whic hmay turn some people off. They are quite dense in consistency, and some flavors also have a "sticky" consistency. The flavors are potent fresh and generally good. They taste like they are really made of the "flavor" on the label. Cherry taste like an actual cherry. Banana tastes like actual banana, etc.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Larabar is the best Food bar product, followed by Clif Bar, followed by PowerBar Harvest.

review/summary: Best LaraBar flavor yet!
review/text: This is my new favorite Larabar. My only gripe is that it's hard finding the new flavor in stores. I love Larabars in general because of their amazing ability to weave a few simple ingredients into great-tasting, portable snacks. There's no strange chemicals added, just fruit and nuts. They're my go-to snack to keep in my bag for those times when gluten-free food is hard to find. And they're the most reasonably priced of their class.<br /><br />The PB&J flavor is great because it combines the tart bite of their Cherry Pie flavor with the richness of peanut butter. If you can get used to the idea of a PB&J sandwich in bar form, it really will remind you of the original.<br /><br />This flavor has only 4 ingredients, no added sugar (sweetened with dates) and a respectable 6g of protein (they range from 3-6g, I believe).

review/summary: Great Natural Taste!
review/text: I've reviewed a lot of these products, and most have some common flaws: Bad, "unnatural," or chemical-like taste (especially in the metallic after-taste), woefully stale, cardboard-like texture, high fat content, and relatively high price.<br /><br />Fortunately, Lara-Bars are perhaps the best tasting line of "nutritional bars" available. The apple pie version is nicely chewy, with a taste of rolled oats, cinnamon, raisin, and, of course, apple, though it's not as intense or satisfying a fruit flavor as their Cherry Pie bar.  The apple hits you especially in the aftertaste, which is very satisfying.  Perhaps a bit on the dry side, but neither boring or cloying, and without that awful artificial taste mentioned above.<br /><br />The ingredient list is all one needs to read to discover the "secret" of Lara's natural taste:<br />Dates, almonds, unsweetened apples, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon. That's it! This is absolutely unheard of in type of food! Go to any comparable product (e.g., Cliff, Balance, Promax, South Beach, etc.) and you will find a veritable mine of vitamin and mineral additives.  For that reason alone (OK, and the concomitant wonderfully natural taste), these stand leagues above the competition.<br /><br />Does this reliance on natural foods cost you in nutrition?  I don't know--that's one for doctors and dietitians. However, I can list the nutritional values here:<br /><br />In one bar, you ingest the following:<br /><br />One serving (45 grams) provides 180 Calories--90 of them from fat;  10 g, Total Fat, of which only 1 gram is saturated fat,  4 grams are monounsaturated, and 4.5 grams are polyunsaturated (no trans fat, although, interesting enough, those grams add only to 9.5);  NO Cholesterol; 5mg of Sodium: 280mg, Potassium; 23 grams, Total Carbohydrate. Of which 4 grams are fiber and 17 grams, sugar (all that fruit), and 4 grams of protein. IT also provides 1 gram of Omega-3 and 4 grams of Omega 6 fatty acids. The fruit content sums to 1 serving of fruit according to the USDA food guide pyramid (I'm reading all this off the wrapper).<br /><br />Vitamins: Vitamins A and C --0% (of the percent daily values, based on a 2,0000 calorie diet), Vitamin E -10%,  Calcium--6%, Iron--8%, Thiamin (B1) --4%, Riboflavin (B2)-8%, Niacin (B3)--4%, Vitamin B6--4% Folate--4%, Zinc--4%, Copper--15%, Magnesium--10%.<br /><br />Some additional information can be found at--where-else--larabar.com, a nice little website where interested foodies can read about the company philosophy. For those not so inclined to visit, I offer an excerpt:<br /><br />"Humm Foods, the creator of L&Auml;RABAR, firmly believes that the foundation of a healthy mind, body and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is healthiest and most satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state...<br /><br />HUMM FOODS [note: this is contrasted with "junk foods"] ... resonate with energy in a whole, natural state. When consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive when consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive.<br /><br />You can expect an unmistakable urge to humm after every L&Auml;RABAR  you eat.<br /><br />Let the humming begin!"<br /><br />Writing like that tells me these people are--and I hate using this overused word--PASSIONATE about their product. Give it a try!

review/summary: Great for hiking or breakfast on the go
review/text: These bars are my favorite trail food. One makes a good breakfast. Two make a decent lunch while hiking. Not as sticky as Powerbars and Cliffbars, although I like those too.<br /><br />Others have commented that they are high in fat, calories and carbohydrates. What's wrong with that? These are not rice cakes, they are energy bars. The ingredients are: dates, almonds, unsweetened cherries. No added sugar. Non-gmo, gluten-, dairy- and soy-free. Vegan and kosher. No trans fat. One bar has only 3% of your recommended daily value of saturated fat. Healthier than lots of alternatives.<br /><br />Cherry and Lemon are great. Apple is almost as good. Pecan is just so-so. Haven't tried the other flavors yet.<br /><br />It's hard for me to believe that mold could grow on these because they are pretty dry.  Maybe it was crystalized sugar? My box from Amazon is labelled best by 12/2008, and they are all fine.<br /><br />I like these so much that I signed up for regular Amazon deliveries through Subscribe and Save.  Now I won't have to depend on Costco for a steady supply.  Keep up the good work, Humm Foods!

review/text: These bars are fantastic- I love how they are not overly sweet like every other bar I've tasted ie luna and cliff bars. I LOVE that- all I taste are gently sweet dried fruit and nuts, not sugary crap that gives me a tummy ache. All natural stuff. I think for many people with low ratings of this product regarding taste, that is their beef- "no flavor" when they are used to super sweet processed taste. These bars are great for people with any sort of intolerance for soy or gluten and make great snacks after a workout.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ENWSBW">Larabar, Bar Cherry Pie, 1.7-Ounce (16 Pack)</a><br /><br />Oh My!!!  The Cherry Pie Larabar reminds me of the cherry pies my mother used to make.  They are not overly sweet (like the store-bought pies made these days) and the tart cherry flavor really comes through.  I must admit I had my doubts when I first opened the wrapper, because the Larabar did not look very appealing.  Don't let looks fool you...this bar is delicious!!<br /><br />I first purchased a variety of Larabars at a local store to try them out.  Once I found the Cherry Pie bars, I decided to purchase a whole box of them through Amazon to save money.  An unexpected bonus was that the bars I received through Amazon.com were much softer (and fresher) than those bought locally.

review/text: I got into Larabars, because I am trying to eat more natural, less packaged food.  Yes Larabars come in a package, but they do not have any preservatives, chemicals, or ingredients whose names I cannot pronounce.  Each flavor has 4 or 5 ingredients.  It's refreshing to read a package label that you can pronounce, understand, and visualize each ingredient.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are Coconut (SO YUMMY), Lemon (tastes like a lemon square, very tart), and Banana (tastes freakishly like banana bread).<br /><br />These bars will satisfy your sweet tooth and keep you feeling full.

review/text: This is my favorite energy bar.  Most of the time I prefer to eat real food, but there are occasions (long hikes, motorcycle trips) when it is more convenient to stash a small energy bar that is not damaged by extreme temperatures or being squished, and does not need anything else for preparation or clean up.  I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I'm not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos.  I like that there are not any artificial flavors or colors, no ingredients I cannot pronounce or have to look up in a dictionary, and no preservatives.  This is my favorite flavor, followed closely by the lemon.

review/text: I love Larabars but the Pecan Pie bars are by far my favorite.  These make a fantastic breakfast or lunch on the go.  I love knowing that when I hand one to my kids they are getting nothing but natural ingredients.  My husband's favorite is the Cherry Pie and the kids like the Cinnamon Role.

Great for packing up in your desk, purse, car, or where ever else you need to reach for a snack. I have my Larabars available, so I'm never stuck without food. All of the bars are excellent, this one is especially good!

review/summary: Not good anymore
review/text: I was a HUGE fan and recommended it highly.  However, I just tossed a whole box.  Something has changed -- and not in a good way.  I had concerns last year and thought maybe the taste was "off" just on the one box.  So I picked up another box last week.  It's even WORSE!  Since General Mills bought LaraBars (Humm Foods) three years ago, the product just seems to have gone down hill.  It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned.  Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch.  Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid.<br /><br />Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that AMAZON continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product "LaraBar" by "LaraBar".  I suppose this is because people who generally buy raw food product are not usually the same people who support multinational food conglomerates like General Mills.  But it just makes me think that Amazon thinks consumers are ignorant.  I feel insulted every time I see it.

review/summary: Some Amazing! Some Not So Amazing...
review/text: It took me a long time to try these larabars out and I don't know what really prompted me to try one finally but I am so glad I did.  From the flavors that I have tried some just blew me away while some really left me feeling unsatisfied in the flavor department.  I will rate the ones out of 5 stars that I have tried, 1 being terrible and 5 being so delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cookie- 5 stars for this one, so delicious!!!  It tasted just like peanut butter cookie dough but made with crunchy peanut butter due to the nuts that are not ground up.  Such amazing texture and taste, it actually is better when left in the sun to warm up.  The flavor comes out so much better and texture too.  This has to be my favorite so far out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Pecan Pie- 5 stars for this one.  I am not a pie person at all, and pecan pie would never be my first choice but after having this larabar I am hooked on its flavor.  It tastes just like pecan pie, no kidding.  It's so strange how such simple ingredients can taste like the real thing.  It has a very deep flavor, almost a caramel molasses flavor.  There are nice pieces of pecans and almonds but not too many to overwhelm the bar itself.<br /><br />Peanut butter and jelly- 4 stars for this one.  It tastes just like that stuff called goober where there is peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.  I grew up eating that stuff and it's so much fun to be able to get that same flavor with this larabar.  I only gave it 4 stars though because it tends to get really tart due to that unsweetened cherries but still really delicious.<br /><br />Apple Pie- 2 stars for this one.  This was such a forgettable flavor, it was too tart in my opinion to taste like apple pie and they were really heavy on the cinnamon.  Don't get me wrong, I know that they are not suppose to really taste like the title says but it still is my least favorite out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Cherry Pie- 3.5 stars for this one.  This actually does taste like cherry pie but does taste like the filling of a cherry pie. I bet if they were to add cashews it would lend more of a buttery crust like taste but maybe not.  While this is a nice change every once in a while it is not one that I would get excited over.  Very tart but I love the ratio of nuts they used.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough- 0 stars, and yes I can give zero stars if I want.  This bar I took a bite out of and was so turned off by the taste.  Way way too sweet due to the chocolate chips used.  I love the larabars because of the no added sugar but by them adding chocolate chips which contain way too much sugar in my opinion really ruined this bar.  If it were not for the chocolate chips I think that it would have been better.  Unsweetened cocoa powder would have been better.  If you like almost candy bars but want a healthier option then you would like this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie- 5 stars for this bar.  This I was worried about trying because I am not really a fan of cashews to begin with but I want to try all of these bars, most of them anyways.  I was so surprised at how scrumptious this bar was.  It was not too sweet at all and the cashews lend such a wonderful almost buttery like flavor.  There is no added salt but I felt as though there was a nice saltiness to this bar.  This is my second most favorite after the peanut butter cookie larabar.  I like this one on days when I do not want any strong flavors and nothing too sweet and this one fits the bill.  I have never had a cashew cookie or heard of them but I can imagine they wouldn't be as good as this bar.<br /><br />I plan to try more so I will update this review soon.

I share them with friends all the time and the only friend that didn't like it just had a thing about not liking dates (and the ONLY three ingredients in this bar-o-goodness are: almonds, dates, and unsweetened bananas). THANK YOU LARA FOR YOUR DELICIOUSNESS IN A BAR. Just as tasty as it is nutritious ... and THAT is somewhat difficulat to find in "ready to eat" foods.

review/summary: Healthy option, but Not so palatable
review/text: I liked the fact that this product has a simple ingredient list and I could find gluten and dairy free protein bars.  So after hearing much about these, I decided to try them.  I tried various flavors, but still I just don't like them.  The texture is probably the worst part, I just find it gross and gummy.  As for taste, they're rather bland.  I think there are better tasting healthy options out there.  As for me, I won't be purchasing these again.
