review/summary: Convenient Green Tea, but not great
review/text: The positive for this is that it is easy and convenient.  However, I find the flavor of the tea to be just "OK".  It is not the worst tea I have had, but it just isn't the same as a tea bag.  Plus, you don't really save much of a mess by using these k-cups versus a tea bag.  Doesn't have the same advantages that the coffee k-cups have.

review/text: This green tea tastes very bitter. It almost has a coffee taste to it, which I initially thought was because of the keurig after-effects of another coffee drinker. when I run hot water out of the keurig and make my own green tea of another brand, I don't taste that bitter, coffee flavor.

review/summary: It's the Economy, Stupid
review/text: While the flavour of this green tea was enjoyable (as either hot or iced tea), its recent price increase is certainly not. Paying 74% more for this tea than one pays Amazon for the equivalent number of servings of Bigelow or Twinings green tea ($39.95 US vs $23.00 US) or 83 cents/cup rather than 48 cents/cup is not justified by the product's quality, perceived taste, or manufacturer reputation. I would not purchase this product again at its current price-point. Additionally, it appears the current retailer no longer supports the convenient Subscribe-and-Save option.

I would definitely pick Gloria Jeans over this on my personal scale, but it's a nice change in pace if you constantly drink greens and want to add some variety.

review/summary: My Dog Loves It
review/text: Her's my problem with people like the previous reviewer. I don't need your novice, pseudo medical opinion for a product you have not tried. You are as bad as the people that review a recipe after they change 6 ingredients and then say it was just okay. They didn't review the recipe at hand! I digress... The company has been making this stuff for over 30 years and have not seen any issues or side effects. In fact, dogs and cats seem to love it and they seem happier with better coats. From the Avoderm website:<br /><br />"SAFETY<br />You can feel quite confident in AvoDerm� pet products safety and nutritional value. In the over 30 years since Breeder's Choice first introduced this product line, millions of dogs and cats worldwide have consumed AvoDerm� with no negative reactions from avocado oil or meal.<br /><br />AvoDerm� pet products use only carefully selected suppliers of avocado meal and avocado oil. Years of problem-free consumption of these products indicate that AvoDerm products are not only safe for dogs and cats, but also provide vital nutrients for them.<br /><br />Concern has been expressed by the ASPCA about the consumption of the leaves, fruit, bark, and stems from the avocado tree, with the exception of the avocado fruit which is used for the oil and meal; none of these parts are factors in any of the AvoDerm� pet products formulations and we have no indication that avocado oil and meal as used in AvoDerm� are toxic, poisonous, harmful or bad for your dogs or cats diet.<br /><br />Dr. Art Craigmill, UC Davis, Professor and Extension Specialist in Environmental Toxicology has said that his studies and other research in the United States and Australia have shown that the problem of toxicity is in the leaves and the pit of the Guatemalan variety; the avocado meat of the fruit and oils have not been shown to be toxic. AvoDerm pet products do not utilize any Guatemalan variety avocados, nor do we use any leaves or pits of any variety of avocados for our avocado meal and oil.<br /><br />The avocado meal and oil used in the AvoDerm pet products comes from the meat of the fruit and does not contain leaves, bark, skin or pit of the fruit. The oil is extracted from ripened fruit in which the meat pulp has been separated from the skin and the pit. Through a mechanical separation process the oil is extracted and filtered and placed into sealed containers. The pulp of the fruit is dried, ground, and screened before being placed into its final packaging and than shipped to our facility."<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Do your own research, research the company or the claims about the ingredients or try it for yourself. My dog (Yorkshire Terrier) seems to love this food. He gets excited and waits by his bowl when he knows it is almost time to eat. He does this even for just the dry food alone! Other dry foods that I have tried before would require me to mix in some wet food after a while to make it more appealing. Not Avoderm - he is still always excited to eat it. He also gets a spoonful of the wet food in the afternoon as a snack and he goes even more bonkers for that stuff. I am happy with it - I will be trying the grooming products next.

review/summary: Chihuahaua does very well on this food
review/text: My chihuahua puppy did so well on this food, but then I could not find it anymore. I tried a new food, but she had diarrhea and bloody mucous. Finally I put her on the Avoderm Small Breed Adult food as the formulation is a lot like the small breed puppy version, except with a little less protein. My puppy is 8 months old now so I figured it was okay. Now she is thriving again -- nicely formed stool, very silky coat that is luxurious to touch, and lots and lots of cheerful energy. I am not kidding. I hate paying a premium price and having to go way out of my way to buy Avoderm, but my dog does so well on it that I am going to keep her on it. How much can a 3 pound dog eat, anyway.

review/summary: My Cavalier Loves This Stuff!
review/text: My small Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (81/2 months old & only 8 lbs.) loves this food!  Anything else, she turns her nose up at (she's picky, too!).  But she gobbles this up like crazy.  Its a great formula and the avocado meal and oil in it has given her a most beautiful and soft, silky coat (the grandkids say she feels like a bunny!).  She also has a bit of a sensitive stomach and vomits whenever she has any food with beef in it, or rawhides, bully sticks, etc.  With this formula, no disgestive problems at all.  My only complaint is that Avoderm only makes it in a 3.5 lb bag instead of larger, more economical sizes.  I've sent them an e-mail to ask about manufacturing larger bags.  Otherwise, this has been really great for my "baby".

review/summary: The only thing my picky dogs will eat!
review/text: I have had a really difficult time getting my dogs to eat dog food:  one had to be on a special homemade diet for 6 months, after which no kibble would make the grade.  Fortunately, this one worked, although I do take extra measures for my incredibly picky dogs, including crushing it, adding warm water, heating it in the microwave, and mixing it with ground beef.  Avoderm is a healthy food that I trust, and the other reviewer with concerns about avocados need not worry:  it's the stems and leaves of the avocado that are a problem for dogs, not the meat of the fruit itself.  I will keep buying as long as they make it.

review/summary: FINALLY, ANOTHER OPTION FOR SMALL OLDER DOGS WITH TEETH PROBLEMS
review/text: I have have 10 toy poodles and all are over 8 years old and have lost some teeth.  I have searched and searched for a very tiny kibble which, when water is added, will not take an hour to soften up for them.  All others I have tried are so hard  and larger than I like, except bil-jac.  I have been giving them bil-jac for years mixed with canned dog food.  Bil-jac is the only one I had found that the kibbles are small and easy to crumble for them even dry.  To add water to it, however, makes it more gooey.  I wanted to try something new for them but had just about given up.  I tried this brand of canned dog food and that was a hit so thought I'd give this dry a try.  Well, it works just great and they love it.  I use a  Cuisinart  k-cup type coffee maker that also is used in our household for hot water.  I just put the dog food in a bowl add the hot water and it is soft enough in less than 10 minutes.  It is not as gooey as bil jac when wet. The kibble is triangle shaped about 3/8 of an inch on all sides. VERY TINY, which is what I needed. I would recommend this food to anyone with small dogs, older dogs of any size who have gum and teeth problems and have  trouble chewing or are missing teeth and can't chew at all. I am so happy I discovered this food!  P.S.  It's a very healthy food for them too.  As long as the price is reasonable, like now, 15.00 for 7 lbs, and can be bought with Prime 2 day shipping free, I will continue to buy it on a regular basis.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/21/12 - Oh rats!  I went to re-order and price went up to 16.98 plus 5.73 for shipping.  Disappointed, but found another seller who offers prime shipping on this item, thank goodness. Regular USPS does not deliver directly to our house, in the mountains, and we have to go pick it up.  I am not always able to do that due to health restraints, so Prime shipping is very important to us as it offers UPS delivery to our door. This seller always did an amazing job getting our order to us quickly with the prime shipping and I was very happy with them. I regret having to change, but is necessary.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014VTNW">Marmite 125g</a><br />Marmite is one of those things that people seem to either love or hate.  I'm in the former camp.  I think the way I was introduced to it has a lot to do with my positive impression.  Marmite is very salty and rich, it's almost like a bouillon cube softened with butter.  Well, not quite that salty.  The British friends who gave me my first taste knew how to eat it and taught me right.  /;+)<br /><br />The British supposedly eat it on their toast to help boost their Vitamin B levels, as tea inhibits the absorption of B vitamins.  And we all know the Brits drink a lot of tea.  I look upon it as a stress reliever that tastes good, too.<br /><br />Try it on toasted French bread, spread with lots of melty butter.  Then, ever so lightly, spread a thin, very thin film of Marmite over the top.  It should be barely tan on the ridges of the bread's surface, unless of course you find you like this salty spread, then have at it.<br /><br />Tea, toast with Marmite, and a simple scrambled egg make a satisfying and tasty meal.  Give it a try.<br /><br />Added 10 May 2008:  I posted this review before tasting the "new" Marmite.  I had been using up my stash of Marmite from before they started getting PC and health conscious and all that nasty stuff.  The new Marmite is less flavorful, thinner, and really not too appealing for a fan of the original version - I think it must be the veggie-no meat flavor.  You can carmelize veggies until the cows come home (heh!), but they will never have as rich a flavor as beef.  Unless, hmmm, maybe miso???  That's got a pretty rich flavor without meat.  Maybe I need to add that to my "new" Marmite.  Excuse the digression.<br /><br />If you've never tried Marmite before, never fear.  It's still got all the positives I mentioned at the top, but, for us fans of the beefy version, it's a little tame.

review/text: I just love this italian sauce.  Stores where I live no longer carry this product (boo hoo). Dei Fratelli charges more for shipping the product than the product itself.  Quite ridiculous!!  Does any one know where to find this in a store in Massachusetts or, bordering MA?

review/summary: Show Your Love. . .Make a Good Soup for Dinner!
review/text: My  family is a  big fan of soups and stews.  These Blackeye Peas (Beans) make a wonderful soup when you add ham with ham bone, finely chopped onion, finely chopped celery, lots of freshly ground pepper, and a bit of salt (to your taste). I also use Knorr Beef base to boil the ham w ham bone first. I also do a pan of cornbread made with Quaker corn meal. These beans do not have to be soaked overnight...a big plus.<br />The thing here is that all this can be done in a crock pot or on the stove top easily.  Blackeye peas (beans) are so very healthy  for you and your family.  Sometimes when I make vegetable soup I add about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of blackeye peas. I also add about the same amount of pearl barley.<br />Now, I am going to make a plea to all you good folks out there. Please start making your meals from scratch. Involve the kids.  All my soups and strews make great left overs or re-heated for the kids when they get home from school and sports.  This is not hard, OK?  It just takes a bit of planning and fore thought.  Let's all get healthy.  Let's cook and eat together again as families.  I know that your kids will love to cook with you as mine did.  I also taught them to bake. . .we started with my grandmother's great chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now both of my sons are married and approaching their 40's. In their own homes they both help a lot with the cooking, baking, and housework.  They also love camping, fishing, hunting, golf. . .and football.<br />I hope that you purchase these beans.  I love the packaging and the freshness. The quality is superb. My blessings go to each of you, your kitchens, and your families!

review/summary: too good to be true?
review/text: I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and am trying to find ways to enjoy breakfast, without raising my blood sugar and don't want eggs.  These are sooo good toasted with cream cheese, but they seem too low in calories and carbs for the nutrional information to be accurate.  There are no weird chemicals listed and the calorie count for one of these HUGE bagels in 135.  They must mean a half or even a fourth on the label.  What does anyone else think?

review/summary: Bread, how I've missed you!
review/text: It tastes just like the real thing!  I've been low carb for several months now and have no plans of falling off the wagon, but oh! did I miss having bread.  For low-carb dieters, this can be the one Achilles heel, passing the bread basket at dinner or walking by a bakery can leave you wanting.<br /><br />Carb Krunchers Low Carb bagels can satiate the craving for bread.  Toasted, it smells of a regular whole wheat bagel.  Texture: it crisped on the outside and had the chewy, gluteny, bread-like appeal of a full carb bagel.  Flavor, well, I bet bite for bite, no one would have been able to tell the difference... if I'd shared.<br /><br />Note that the "low carb" refers to the net carbs (minus the fiber) on the packaging.  I was worried at first that the carb count was so high.  My body is very sensitive to carbohydrates and will show it by inching up the scale or making me feel really lethargic.  I did not have either effect when eating these, though I did limit myself to one bagel every other day or so.  A binge-fest with a stack of bagels and a whole brick of cream cheese may have proven different.<br /><br />The one downside, $$$!  No "Prime" shipping for this, so it meant that each 6 count package of bagels cost about $16, which means this possible addiction will be limited to a special occasion request.  I'll probably order again, but sadly, it won't be on a regular grocery list.

The texture is closer to a "real" bagel than any low carb bagel I have tried and I've tried a lot of them.  These bagels are really worth trying if you want to lose weight on a low carb diet and still have some bread.

review/summary: Nice Mild & Sweet Cinnamon
review/text: This is a good mild and sweet ceylon cinnamon.<br />Anyways, i'm using it to lower blood sugar, i'm not diabetic but i'm trying to loose weight and by lowering blood sugar it helps regulate the insulin levels. A teaspoon of cinnamon a day lowered my blood sugar levels after eating a meal, i simply sprinkle it on my food or mix it in, it's mild enough that i sometimes don't even notice it's on my toast etc.<br />Higher insulin levels lead to less use of excess blood sugar (and sugar is stored in the body as fat), so a reduction in insulin after a meal is significant. If cinnamon can help control the level of blood sugar and, by offshoot, fat levels, then that is corroboration of what some have said regarding its weight loss potential.

review/summary: tasteless...
review/text: I adore cinnamon and try different types and sources. Sadly, this cinnamon is tasteless. It is extremely dry [which I assume means it has very little actual "oil" in it]. Moreover, its texture is actually unpleasant. It feels as through the cinnamon bark has been "cut" with some tasteless, dry filler. Oddly, there is a mild clove aftertaste to this brand. That is not unpleasant but I prefer the spicy flavor of Saigon cinnamon, but that is a personal choice. I can't recommend this particular Ceylon cinnamon. Sorry.

review/text: I bought a pound of this a year and a half ago to use for baking and to sprinkle on my morning oatmeal.  It arrived quite fresh, unlike bottled spices, but the flavor is inherently less hot than the grocery store cinnamon I've always used.  I can use a lot more cinnamon at a time, but to get enough flavor I need to use at least a little more. My one-pound purchase is almost gone. I've decided that I like buying bulk cinnamon but next time, I'll get the hotter kind.

It is also difficult to get all of the food out because of the way the pouch is designed.

The beauty of dried is it keeps longer but you have to add some coriander to get a more pungent flavorful spice out of it.

review/text: This is a very smokey salsa quite like any other I have tried.  I like that it doesn't taste like tomato paste but couldn't get beyond the smokey quality.  The chipotles -- as one would expect from the name -- are very present and ancho peppers contribute to the overall flavor.  The overall consistency was nice -- the salsa stayed on my chips and wasn't overly drippy or overly chunky.  I love many of Drew's products.  Their salad dressings are fantastic.  This salsa was not among my favorites, unfortunately.  I will likely try another Drew's salsa since I find their products to be of high quality.<br /><br />Ingredients:  organic diced tomatoes, organic crush tomatoes, organic onions, water, organic garlic, organic cilantro, sea salt, organic cider vinegar, organic lime juice concentrate, organic jalapeno peppers, organic chipotle peppers, organic ancho peppers, organic cumin, organic black pepper.<br /><br />Each serving of this salsa is two tablespoons.  There are 12 servings in a 12 ounce jar.  Each serving has 10 calories, 100 mg. of sodium, and two grams of carbohydrates.  There is no fat or cholesterol in this product.<br /><br />I purchase Drew's products at my local co-op.  This particular salsa was 2.99 a jar.<br /><br />This is a gluten free product.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.

review/summary: The Sweetest Cornbread You'll Ever Eat
review/text: I LOVE this mix. The cornbread is very sweet - almost like cake. It reminds me of the corn pone we had on Sundays with fried chicken when I was a child. Smothered with chicken gravey it is to die for. It's texture is "soft" like a cake so perhaps adding some cornmeal might help. This would be great for breakfast with pancake syrup on it! This is not your "normal" cornbread so DON'T use it for chili, cooked greens, or fried fish.

review/summary: Not what I had hoped for...
review/text: There were two things I did not like about this corn bread.<br /><br />1.  It is way over-the-top sweet.  I like sweet corn bread, but this is so sweet that it did not taste good with my chili or soup.  It tasted like something  to eat for dessert.  I wish they had left out about 2/3 of the sugar.  You can put more in, but you can't take it out.<br /><br />2.  It does not have the crumbly, corn-meal texture that I like.  It must have a higher percentage of wheat flour than I am used to, because the texture is finer and like there is more gluten than I like.  Maybe it is just a very finely ground corn flour.  I don't know.<br /><br />That said, if you know what to expect, and this does not sound bad to you, you might like it.  It just does not suit my preference for corn-bread.

review/summary: HORRIBLE!
review/text: This was undoubtedly the nastiest cornbread I've ever tried to eat.  If you like to eat sugar out of a spoon, you might like it.  In addition to being too sweet, it also has a slightly "bitter" flavor which indicates to me that it contains "too much" baking soda and/or baking powder!  Neither the taste OR the texture resembled any corn bread I've ever eaten (or care to eat again), in my entire life.  I wouldn't even recommend it as a cake!<br /><br />Since the postage would be too prohibitive to return the product, I'll probably bake the remaining five boxes this winter and feed them to the birds.  Maybe THEY can eat it!

review/text: Starwest has been a solid source of herbs for a while for my wife and I, however, I cannot recommend this tea. I drink a lot of different green teas, Gunpowder included. This Gunpowder is not tightly rolled, the leaves are not vibrant and the taste is just not what it should be. I got the subscription for the 1lb bags, but canceled it after I received this due to it being B grade tea.<br /><br />Gunpowder should be green (not brownish green), tightly rolled and have a rich heavy taste after 2 minutes of steep at about 170 degrees.

review/summary: From Lipton to REAL tea!
review/text: I have never tried Gunpowder tea before and was hesitant to after reading the recent reviews about how the quality of tea had changed.  I tried it anyway and have learned a lot and now LOVE this tea which is perfect for a tea lover on a budget, because this is A LOT of tea for this price!<br /><br />My co-worker informed me of the following and haven't had a bad brew yet!<br /><br />1) Use about a teaspoon full of tea in your teapot.  I use it with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPN8TK">Adagio Teas 16-Ounce Ingenuitea Teapot</a> and I got the 32oz size for free shipping.<br /><br />2) For the "first run," the leaves are bitter, so let the water stay in the pot for a few seconds then dump that tea.  It is WAY MORE BITTER and why I didn't like the tea at first.  The subsequent runs will be much smoother<br /><br />3) The leaves can be used 3-6 times (per your taste) before throwing them out.  The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th runs (I have used up to 5 or 6 times and still gotten great tea) are subtle and not bitter and I don't use any sweetener anymore in my tea because I have gotten used to this.<br /><br />4) Lastly, the most important point!  Green tea only needs to steep for one maybe two minutes.  Don't steep it for 3 or 4 minutes or it will get a bitter taste.<br /><br />Don't be afraid to try this tea.  I hated green tea until now.  I actually ordered a second Adagio Teapot for work and split this pound bag of tea in half so I can have green tea whenever I want.<br /><br />I have recommended this tea and teapot combo to all my friends and family and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

review/text: This was my first experience with gunpowder tea, and I have come to like it a lot.  Just be careful - it's very dense.  Only use about 1/3 - 1/2 the amount you would otherwise use of normal green tea.  I made that mistake -once- and will never again.  Steeping too much of this tea makes it unbearable, but at the right strength it's got a subtle smoky, savory flavor.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good value for a whole pound of organic tea.

review/summary: Great green tea, fresh taste, long shelf life.
review/text: Gunpowder green tea has the longest shelf life of all green tea. The tea is pan fried and then rolled into balls. When the tea is boiled, the balls open up into leaves, and the taste is POW! Which is why it's called gunpowder tea.<br /><br />I drink tea every day, all kinds. This tea is my staple tea. You can blend it with other teas pretty easily because it is so taste neutral. I like it plain though. If you brew it over 5 minutes it will become very strong and bitter tea. Brewing for shorter times makes a more mellow tea.<br /><br />Also, this tea is good with cheap tea balls because the "gunpowder" is generally whole leaves that will not slip through larger mesh like many other kinds of loose-leaf tea, which get brittle when dried and tend to break into smaller flakes.<br /><br />In case you are new to tea and nutrition: Green tea is high in antioxidants, the beneficial components in fruits and vegetables that make them fight cancer and free radicals that cause cellular damage, which is one of the reason people in Japan have such a lower rate of cancer than us, it is surmised, although they are an industrialized nation like us, they drink a ton of tea, at every meal.

review/summary: Quite decent
review/text: I drink a lot of green tea and was suspicious at seeing an organic gunpowder tea that was so inexpensive.  It is pretty good -- a lot better than some other cheap gunpowder teas.  It has a pleasant balanced taste with just the right amount of smokiness.  The flavor is not quite as refined as a really good gunpowder, the leaves are not as large, and there is some tea dust.  But for everyday drinking, this is now my choice.  I tried another organic bulk gunpowder that cost twice as much (still a good price), and found it to be more bitter and less rounded in its flavor.<br /><br />Comments on making the tea:<br />Particularly for gunpowder, you should do several soaks.  The water from the first soak should be thrown out, as it is more bitter than later soaks and contains tea dust.  For this tea, the third soak is the tastiest, and the fourth is still good.  (Note added later: my recent batches of this tea have been milder, and so the first soak does not need to be tossed.)<br />Do not use boiling water directly on the tea!  What I do to cool the water to the right temperature is pour boiling water into a mug and let is sit for 30 seconds to transfer its heat to the mug.  Then I pour the cooled water into a second mug, where I place the tea.  For the first couple of soaks, 2 minutes of soaking time is about right.  For later soaks, 3 or even 4 minutes give more flavor.  I like fairly strong green tea, and so use a heaping teaspoon of tea for one cup.  There is a very nice stainless steel "Tea Infuser and Porcelain Dish Set" sold on Amazon that is ideal for making a mug at a time.<br /><br />Enjoy!

It's like dying chicken breast into red color, marinating it in steak souse, and selling it as New York Strip Steak...<br /><br />Real caviar doesn't come from lumpfish, and real caviar only have two ingredients - caviar and salt.

I can buy the regular "original" flavor in the convenient store for twice as much, but they don't carry any other flavors. The ranch so far are the best flavor. If you don't know what Corn Nuts are, picture big crunchy fried kernels of corn with salt and flavorings added. They are VERY crunchy, you can't eat these while someone is sleeping next to you. If that sounds like something interesting to you, buy them, they are very good, they are probably healthier than other far more processed snacks, are very filling and for the price, you can't beat it.

We eat these right out of the bag, we put them on cereal, we put them in muffins and pancakes.  These rehydrate nicely overnight if you want a plumper and moister berry.  My favorite is to soak them in orange juice.  The orange and cranberry flavors together are amazing.  Again, these too go into everything.<br /><br />They come in two 48 ounce bags with one of the better ziploc type tops.  These open and stay shut just as you would expect unlike some of the cheaper zip sealers.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
