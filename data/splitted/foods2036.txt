review/summary: A Definite Hit for my Cats!
review/text: I have four cats - ages 3 to 14, one of which is a very finicky eater.  Over the years, it's been difficult to find something they all would like.  However, they all loved this food from the very beginning!  I have it scheduled on auto-delivery - and the price is right!

review/summary: It's Corn. Cats can't live on corn.
review/text: This food is primarily corn: ground corn and corn meal. That food pyramid above the cat's head definitely doesn't represent what's in the food. I don't think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is "animal fat." It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it's still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime.

review/summary: Absolute garbage....  get a clue folks...
review/text: Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a "C").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food

review/summary: Cat Killer!
review/text: I fed this to my three cats. Within a month one of them began getting sick, throwing up his food once a day then every meal. Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!<br />DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!

review/summary: Maybe its  timing ?
review/text: I saw the one negative review here and because the price I was about to pay was exceptionally cheap(it was on some sort of special at the time), I decided to take a chance. I have to report that my experience was quite the opposite of the negative review I read. The order I recieved was fresh and the product is excellent. I love torrone and this is very good. My only criticism is simply that torrone itself is so good, coating it in chocolate, beleive it or not, only detracts from the enjoyment IMHO. If other varieties had been available at the sale price I paid, I'd likely have chosen the plainer or simpler variety over this one.<br /><br />The only other point I'd like to make is that it is true that Amazon is notorious for sending out stale and near out of date grocery items. Old stuff seems to be especially true when it's on one of their specials. The previous reviewer may well have recieved a bad shipment as they described. Whether it was luck or timing, the order I got was very good and it was exceptionally cheap.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/summary: Not Bad For A Sauce in a Bag
review/text: I tried this for the first time on chicken and cheese enchiladas. It tasted great. I was a little concerned that it might taste plastic since it came in a bag but was pleasantly surprised. The ingredients are all natural and it has a medium spice to the sauce. As far as sodium goes, 2 tablespoonfuls contain 190 mg. of sodium. I poured the sauce over 10 enchiladas. I did some quick math and decided you will probably get approximately 400- 500 mg. of sodium per 2 enchiladas. That is not bad. I do not think the sauce tastes salty. I am also on a low sodium diet and am cautious about high sodium foods. This is my idea of a healthy fast food.

review/summary: Very salty
review/text: I just tried this sauce tonight.  I used the recipe on the back of the pouch (makes 4 cheese enchiladas, basically just tortillas + cheese + sauce from pouch).  It looked pretty, but I was surprised by the first bite.  It is way too salty! This is coming from a self-proclaimed salt lover.  I just checked the nutrition facts.  Sodium - 190mg (8% of DV) per 2 Tbsp serving with roughly 8 servings per pouch.  Yikes!<br /><br />Besides the overwhelming saltiness, the flavor is pretty good.  Not too spicy, but there is a little kick.  I would try this again, but I would probably use half the sauce and try to dilute it with something else.  Maybe a salsa verde from a jar?  Not sure what the sodium is like on all of those.

review/summary: I can't believe I'm giving something with soy milk so many stars...
review/text: I'd never tried anything with soy intentionally and didn't realize this was soy milk.  I'm not a gym goer, someone who exercises much or even a healthy eater.  So why did I get this?<br /><br />I need to cut down on my calorie intake.  I tend to nibble during the day and have a big dinner, usually late because of work hours and then off to bed.  This needs to change so I've started eating breakfast and lunch but decided I didn't need the crazy amount of calories at dinner time but did need something to tide me over until the morning.<br /><br />This product is low calories (260 total for the whole 15.9 oz container) and high in protein (16g).<br /><br />As for the taste...<br />Chocolate - very rich and thick, for me just a little too thick so I can't finish the whole container.<br />French vanilla - never liked french vanilla anything but I really like this.<br />Cappuccino - I was drinking cappuccino coffee multiple times a day - this doesn't thrill me that much, I thought it would be better but it's just OK.<br />Spiced Chai - I've never had Chai anything, I knew I was going to dislike this and oddly enough instead I really like it.<br /><br />I do make sure it is cold, I think if any of these were on the warm side they would be a little less tasty.<br /><br />*Update*<br />December 3, 2011 - With the exception of a once a week dinner out I've been having this in the evening after a salad loaded with veggies and fruits (fruit in the salad cuts down on the amount of dressing I need for some reason).<br /><br />I decided to get on the scale, I am down 9 Lbs in just about 2 1/2 weeks.  That's with no exercising.<br /><br />French vanilla & Spiced Chai (the two I thought I wouldn't like) are my favorites.<br /><br />*Update*<br />December 26, 011 - Well, goodbye 9 Lb weight loss.  Didn't eat my typical salad and drink for dinner because of later holiday hours, parties and meetings and darn if I didn't gain back the 9 Lbs+.  I'll be starting what I hope is a lifestyle change in the new year.  I'm going to keep this drink for late night, try to eat dinner earlier and also make it a lighter meal.  I'm also going for a max of 30 minutes a day of some kind of but light exercise so I don't get frustrated.  Since I spend a ton of time driving and sitting at work, any exercise is an improvement.<br /><br />One test I did make was I drank one of these a few times before those late nights, parties or dinners out and I definitely ate less because I was less hungry (high protein in the drink I assume) but I stopped drinking them because I was enjoying the holiday munchies too much.

Two to three times a week my work day diet consists of two pieces of fruit, one of these protein drinks and a handful of almonds.  At lunch I take to the park one of these drinks, a piece of fruit and a large bottle of water. I go back to work satisfied.

I have trouble eating when I am playing sports, and 2 of these work perfectly to sustain me for a whole day of tournament play. I think that the Cappuchino is the best flavor and I'm not that much of a fan of the other three. They're okay but maybe too sweet so it's easier to drink it too fast than the cappuchino.

review/text: so the strangest thing about this product is that the drink box always seems full after you've completed what you think is the full box. not sure what the problem is but it's like there's a layer of film in there that needs to warm up to room temperature to loosen up. had that happen with every box i drank; just a waste of a product if you ask me.<br /><br />there are options out there that are way better than this product. try Orgain.

review/summary: Too thick, not great tasting
review/text: These are sickeningly thick and the flavor would be moderately okay if it didn't have the nasty consistency.  I took a sip and handed it to my spouse it was so bad... who then took a drink and poured it down the sink.<br /><br />I have only tried the chocolate as it was so bad I'm hesitant to try any of the others.

review/summary: pretty good
review/text: I have a protein shake for breakfast every morning... usually I use powdered protein -- but when Im in a hurry it's good to have a pre-mixed liquid available.  These are pretty good.  I liked that they are organic, not too sweet, and creamy.  The variety pack is nice because you can try the different flavors.  I would have given it a 5 but there was a slight stevia-like after-taste, particularly on the chai that I didn't care fore.

review/summary: Decent Protein Drink
review/text: I started out with the Iced Mocha Orgain protein drinks and really liked them.  I saw these at the store, was curious about them so I tried the variety pack from Amazon.  I have to say that the Stevia taste is overpowering in these drinks - it's a shame.  The Cappuccino and Spiced Chai ended up being my favorites out of the four flavors, but I'd definitely recommend Orgain over these.  The packaging is great, the variety of flavors is nice to have, and it filled me up for hours, but that sickeningly sweet taste is too much.  Orgain has many vitamins, is organic, fills you up and tastes better!

review/summary: Best drink out there.
review/text: These protein drinks are sooo good!  I went with the variety pack to try all the 4 flavors and my favorite was the Vanilla (it is delicious) followed by the Chai, which at first I did not like but by the time I finished the box I changed my mind.  The chocolate I did not really like, but I tend to never like chocolate drinks so don't listen to me on that.  My favorite thing about it was that they are big (15.9 ounces of yum) as opposed to other protein drinks that are what, like 10-12 ounces or so? I am not sure but anyway these are big, delicious and definitely fill you up for a few hours.  I used them as meal replacements.  They got a little too expensive for me to use everyday so I alternate between this and another brand.  Oh one thing I wanted to say- usually meal replacement drinks/protein drinks give me an upset stomach specially the first few days.  These drinks never gave me a problem, so that is a huge plus.

review/summary: Don't waste your money like I did!
review/text: I scoured the internet looking for a healthier protein shake and came across Svelte.  I remember seeing it at Whole Foods because I loved the packaging and the fact that its resealable so I didn't have to drink it all at once.  That's where the positives for me stopped though.<br /><br />Svelte boils down to soy milk , sugar alcohols, and sugar!  I took one to the gym and my trainer looked at the bottle, laughed and handed it back to me saying "just buy some soy milk, it's cheaper, you get the same protein and probably tastes better."  He then went on a rant about how much he doesn't like soy protein.  I don't care about that part as much but the taste was really artificial.  My favorite one was cappuccino, chocolate and vanilla tasted really bad and the spiced chai one was even worse.<br /><br />Folks, don't waste your money, just blend your own shakes!  And maybe do some research on soy, apparently it's not good for you like I initially thought.

review/summary: Good rendition of tea for an instant machine
review/text: Let's not fool ourselves, tea from a Keurig is not the same as brewing tea in a teapot and letting it steep.  If you typically make tea by dunking a tea-bag in a cup of hot water then you will like this tea.  Overall it tastes pretty good, better than I expected.  In fact you can make two cups of tea or one very large mug from one pod.  One cup is a little strong tasting (and I actually like strong tea).  I will buy this product again as it was a good value and for those times I don't feel like waiting to boil water and let the tea steep these Twinning K-cups are an acceptable alternative.

review/summary: Grounds in my tea
review/text: I like English Breakfast tea and there was nothing wrong with the flavor of this tea when brewed.  However, when used in the keurig machine, my tea consistently had grounds in the bottom.  It's not a big deal to have a few grounds in my tea, but there were a lot more than a few, more than could be ignored.  I ended up not drinking the entire cup because of it.<br /><br />At first I thought it was because most people in the office use coffee k-cups and I was getting coffee grounds in my tea.  But after switching to Timothy's brand of tea I no longer had a problem with grounds.  Usually I had no grounds in my tea or one.<br /><br />After brewing a cup of each, I cut off the foil top.  Both of them have filters built in and the Twinings filter didn't seem to be pierced.  But I had the same grounds in the tea that I hadn't had in my cups of brewed Timothy's tea.<br /><br />To sum up, if you want to avoid grounds in your tea and still have great taste go with the Timothy's k-cups (Timothy's World Coffee English Breakfast Tea, Decaffeinated, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)) instead.

Then I made the mistake of trying to contact customer service.<br /><br />The first clue should have been that they're located in New Jersey.  I got all the respect and consideration you'd expect from the cast of "Jersey Shore".  Aside from the fact their phones are deliberately off, their email response was, "What's your problem?  What do you want us to do about it?"<br /><br />Buy this horse piss at your own peril.  If there's something sub-standard you're on your own.

review/summary: Twining English Breakfast Tea K-Cups - Bad Seals & Grounds
review/text: ** Update 11/05/2011 **<br /><br />I sent an email to Twining to also point out the problem to them. They replied to thank me for taking the time to bring the problem to their attention. They indicated they had addressed the issue and said they wanted to make things right for us, which they did.<br /><br />They sent a package with a selection of teas in a beautiful wooden box and also some boxes of the k-cup English Breakfast tea and a personalized letter from Monica, Twining's Customer Relations Representative (was not a canned letter response) again thanking me for taking the time to make them aware of the issue.<br /><br />I must admit I was very pleasantly surprised by Twining's gester. I just didn't think--or expect--a corporation would respond in such a personalized way to acknowledge an issue and to want to make things right the way they did. Bravo to Twining for understanding their customer-base is made up of individuals just like me that warrants a personal touch when things aren't quite right with a product.<br /><br />I can report I have not had the same problem with the new k-cups Twining send us and so it appears the problem has been resolved. As such, I have raised my rating from a 1 star to a 4 star, still withholding 1 star for the original issue. I will now return to purchasing the new red top English Breakfast tea k-cups.<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />Recently poor seals between the plastic part of the k-cup and the foil seal on top of the Twining English Breakfast Tea K-Cups have plagued us with tea leaves in the tea and overflowing tea leaves into the top of the holder requiring clean up just about every time.<br /><br />At first we thought it was our Keurig coffeemaker having a faulty seal and replaced it even though we'd only had the previous one for less than a year. However, upon purchasing a new Keurig we experienced the exact same thing right from the start. Of course, we then wondered if we'd bought a second faulty coffeemaker. That's when the light bulb went on and we realized the problem didn't happen with other k-cups--a different brand of tea, coffee, hot chocolate, etc--just the Twining brand English Breakfast Tea regular k-cups.<br /><br />It's a shame because we've been ordering and drinking Twining's English Breakfast Tea K-Cups at least a year or two now and it's only been the last two bulk batches we've ordered that have done the exact same thing. And, it's not just from one of the boxes. We've opened and tried k-cups from some of the other boxes and the same thing happens.<br /><br />The fact that it has done the same thing with two separate Keurig coffeemakers, it doesn't happen with any other brand or flavor of k-cup beverages, and it only happens with Twining English Tea K-Cups from different boxes from two different bulk orders pretty much narrows it down to the Twining English Breakfast Tea K-Cups themselves.<br /><br />I hope someone at Twining--we'll also leave the same feedback on their web site--will see this review and resolve this apparent and repeatable problem. Until then we're going to switch brands. Too bad because we've still got 6 boxes of the offending tea k-cups but having to strain tea leaves out through our teeth and having to keep cleaning tea leaves from the top of the coffeemaker holder isn't an option.

I had a hard time getting through it, as it just doesn't compare to Twinings tea in a tea bag. I like strong tea (with milk) and the K cups just don't have the same amount of flavor. I kept thinking, "How hard is it to pour boiling water over a tea bag? Why do I need a K cup to make tea?" I appreciated my brother's thoughtful gift, but can't recommend making ANY tea with a cup machine.

review/summary: Tea Totaller
review/text: We enjoy our Keurig for coffee but tea leaves (sorry) a bit to be desired. Somehow the taste provided by the steeping process outweighs the expensive convenience of the K-Cups. For those of a like mind, we would suggest the following.<br /><br />Buy your tea loose. You will probably save money, can control the quantity per serving and will end up with better quality.<br />Loose tea is available from Amazon.<br /><br />Purchase a Adagio Teas Ingenuitea Teapot thru Amazon. Efficient and brews a good 16 oz. cup of tea. For a few dollars more they have a 32 oz.<br /><br />Add a bit of tea to the teapot, place the teapot on your Keurig and fill with hot water.<br /><br />Wait the appropriate steeping time and your tea is ready.<br /><br />For those who would like a warmed cup to pour into. Fill the cup with a bit of hot water from the Keurig and let it warm while the tea steeps.

review/summary: I really like this tea!
review/text: I have been using the Keurig machine for five years now and have drank hot tea for decades (would not consider myself an expert). I bought some twinings tea in Epcot and really enjoyed it. When I found twinings tea K-cups on Amazon, I bought it. I really like the k-cup convenience and I believe twining is superior to most other available k-cup teas.

review/text: I had just finished a box of chai black tea, which I love, love, love, and which I only need to add some cream and a 1/4 tsp. of sugar, or so, to make it perfect.  I thought I'd try the English Breakfast, which I like, but it is strong!  I add a full tsp. of sugar and some cream and it still has a strong taste.  I think I'll go back to the chai next time.

review/text: While I like the Twinings bag tea, I found this product to be weak, watery, and downright nasty with a plastic aftertaste. Perhaps part of the problem is that the K-cup system does not allow for proper steeping time (5 minutes for a good strong cuppa').  Putting it in the K-cup is a waste of good tea.

review/text: I never really expected to make anything but coffee in my Keurig.  But making tea was starting to get awfully inconvenient, comparatively.  I figured these K-cups would be worth a try.<br /><br />Oh. Yeah.<br /><br />This is so good, and so fast.  Better than Twinnings tea bags, and probably better than loose tea (at least, with *my* skill at making tea.) If you like English style tea and have  Keurig brewer, you need to get these.<br /><br />Suggest adding some nice organic whole milk and a couple packets of Splenda.

review/text: I drink tea only occasionally and find the Twinings English Breakfast excellent.  My wife is a tea drinker from way back and likes the K-cup tea better than tea bag tea. She's always loved English Breakfast and Twinings E.B.K-cup has now replaced her tea bag standard.  She's currently drinking Grace Rare Tea's Lemon Verbena (in a can with what looks like dried from the tree tea leaves) and makes it with the Keurig's hot water only feature.  Tea steeps for five minutes or so and results are also excellent.

Once again, I found that this tea is excellently balanced and, contrary to some reviewers, I can personally attest that the quality is similar to that of tea brewed using a teapot.  This tea is a great tea for breakfast or any time of the day.  It is very flavorful and the package contains more than enough k-cups to make it much less expensive to drink daily, which is a good thing considering how good it tastes.

As of January, 2010, it has become a staple - via Amazon Subscription, it's pretty reaasonable and all others in the family like the convenience.  I stick with my PG Tips and a pot for that wonderful British truck stop tea flavor (or is it "flavour"?).

review/text: Every single K-cup I put in breaks open during brewing.  I always end up with a horrible tea leaf mess which has to be strained if I want to drink it and the machine has to be cleaned after every single one.  It's like the heat or something makes the covering over the top separate around the circle from the cup.  I thought at first maybe it was the machine, but my husband's (Scott) several different varieties of coffee never do this and then I thought "well, maybe it's just the one odd box so I'll stick with it til next order." 5 orders later it's no different.  Whoever packages these Kcups (is it really Twinings?) has an awful manufacturing process.  Do not buy these unless you want a goopey tea-leaf-grounds mess everywhere.

review/summary: Expensive but convenient although a little weak
review/text: Well, I was a little disappointed in these Twinings K-cups.  The reason being that while waiting for these guys to come in the mail I tried some normal Twinings english breakfast teabags beforehand.  The K-Cups still brew a decent cup of tea, although as you cannot control the steepage the tea comes out on the weak side for me.  While still tasty, the much greater expense ($0.45/cup vs less than half that for teabags) for the convenience may not add up for a lot of people. However, if you're go-go-go in the morning and don't have time it may be worthwhile.  I myself will be going back to teabags but will still use the Keurig to get fast hot water!  Best of both worlds!

I do usually have a few tea leaf specs either floating around the top or sunk to the bottom, but it's not so many that it bothers me.  I just don't drink the last little sip.  I give this tea 5 stars regardless of the tea leaf specs, because I find this happens often in other k-cups and regular tea bags, too.  I don't really think it's their fault.<br />It's strong enough to brew a flavorful cup on the largest setting, but it's not too strong when put on the smaller settings, either.

review/text: There are not many choices for tea in K-cups, but this one is a nice choice among the few.  My secretary drinks tea every day and loves the K-cups.  I think it is an expensive way to drink tea, but again, if you are going to use the K-cups for tea, these are very good.
