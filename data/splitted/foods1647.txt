review/summary: Fantastic Crisps; Use for Everything
review/text: We love these crisps.  They are akin to a cracker as opposed to a potato chip.  As such, we use them in soup now all of the time and they are so much better than soup crackers.  We also use them with cheese and as the legend on the package tells you, the sellers developed them for their then cheese store.  However, these crisps became so popular that they left the cheese business for this instead. These are actual New York bagels, sliced and put back into their ovens to become crisps.  I buy a big bag of these at Sam's Club locally. I've also tried Stacy's chips but like these better.

review/summary: Great Price, Great Packaging, Great Taste!
review/text: If you've never had these Bagel Crisps before they are about the size of a large potato chip but much thicker and made from bagels.  They are crunchy and taste like garlic and salt.  Compared to the Ranch Wheat thins (15 crackers a serving) I usually snack on, the serving of Bagel Crisps (6 crisps) has 10 less calories but fills me up the same.  However, there is a lot more sodium in the crisps, 320mg vs.190mg in the Wheat Thins.<br /><br />The package of 12 arrived quickly, well packaged, and fresh.  My particular order which was placed in mid July has an expiration date of May 2011.  Plenty of time to eat all 12 packages without feeling rushed!<br /><br />All in all... for a moderately healthy crunchy snack you can't go wrong.

review/summary: Very flavorful!
review/text: After ignoring these in the supermarket for some time, I was introduced to them at my new job where everyone kept scarfing them down. Being a garlic lover, I just had to try one. I'm hooked. They are light, airy, and so full of flavor. They do get your hands a bit greasy reminding you that they aren't a fat free light food. I'm not into potato chips, so I searched my supermarket for the garlic flavor to no avail. How delightful I can order them from Amazon!<br /><br />I gave the review 4 stars because sometimes the bag is full of broken pieces instead of full bagel chips. As another reviewer said, a resealable bag would add to the product. However, maybe the creators know how quickly they will be devoured... :)

review/text: We purchased a variety of Turkish Delight for a "Chronicles of Narnia" party.  In the book and movie, Edmond is temped by the White Witch with this traditional dessert.  It was fun sharing it with the guests.  Most people had never tried it (us included)!  My son enjoyed it the most.  It is a acquired taste.  I think the guests liked being able to try something completely different.  My son has asked for more (not unlike Edmond!!!)

review/summary: Delicious and unusual treat
review/text: I've never had turkish delight before, but being a fan of both C.S. Lewis and They Might Be Giants, I had always wanted to try some. I can't compare this with other versions of turkish delight, but I can say that my entire family has enjoyed this unusual treat. I say unusual since the flavors are not typical candy flavors. But since it's basically just sugar and starch, the consistency ends up being similar to a soft jelly candy (or very solid jello). All four flavors are enjoyable and the price for the sampler seems very reasonable. I'll probably order this again as a fun alternative treat to bring to a party.

All my friends, including those who are picky in foreign treats like this, loved it.<br />I tried to find it locally or online but couldn't. Then I saw this at Amazon and ordered 4 packages at once after reading some reviews.<br />It was not as I expected to taste at all.It was much more sugary than the original one that I tasted, with less flavor, too.<br />Besides, package was kind of loose so some of content were squashed.<br />I should've ordered only one. Too late. I sent one to my sister in Korea and didn't like it too much either.<br />I just saw another one here that says Divan turkish delight but doesn't look the same.<br />Definitely would not buy more from here again.

Maybe it's just an acquired taste. I also used to chew only the hard shell gum. The stick gum wasn't as good, in my opinion. I still prefer American gum over Japanese gum but it's not horrible.

review/summary: Short but amazing flavor
review/text: I lived in Japan for a little while and during that time I could say that I always carried a couple sticks of this gum with me. I love the flavor it is simply amazing but like some of the previous post mentioned it does not last long. Still highly recommend this for anyone looking a short burst of amazing blueberry flavored candy.

review/text: I LOVE this gum, but unfortunately not enough to pay the shipping costs for it on Amazon.  I recently came back from month-long vacation in China - always carried a few sticks of this in my purse.  I'm not usually a big gum chewer, but this stuff was delicious.<br /><br />Tasted nothing like cough medicine to me.  Very blueberry.  Perhaps the other reviewer got a bad batch?

review/summary: Ginger Tea
review/text: I purchased this tea because ginger is supposed to help with muscle aches and pains as well rheumatoid arthritis.  I've only had two cups so it's a little early to tell if there will be significant improvment but so far I can tell my neck muscles move with less pain.  For my first cup I poured the whole packet of crystals into my cup.  As a lifelong coffee drinker, one packet was way to much.  I could feel the peppery taste on roof of my mouth and throat.  There seems to be approx 2 TAB of crystals in each packet.  For my next cup I measured out 1 TAB and it was just perfect.  I really like the taste of this tea.  The blend of ginger and honey seems to be just right.  For avid tea drinkers, this is an excellent choice and for avid coffee drinkers, I would also recommend  this tea.

review/text: I found this product (Prince of Peace Ginger Honey Crystals) at a small market on the California coast during a recent vacation.  I had a cold and a sore throat, and was looking for something to soothe it.<br />This really worked wonders!  My wife and I both loved it.<br />After returning home, I couldn't find it in stores, so I searched online and found it through Amazon.  The price was great, although shipping made it more expensive than in the store, so I ordered three boxes and the total cost per box was pretty reasonable.<br />Service was very prompt - no problems.

review/summary: Glad this smells nothin' like a billy goat!
review/text: Ok, I'm a sucker for just about any product with a nasty-looking goat on the label. Why? Because I've raised goats for years and just love 'em. Anyone who's ever had a billy goat knows that they are just about the stinkiest, foulest-behaved creatures around, but also very affectionate. This coffee really is something like a buck goat in season - mighty high and strong, but lovable. The aroma actually reminds me of compost in my goat barn - and this is NOT a bad thing! It's got a deep, earthy smell that is unusual. Lovely dark roast. Not acidic at all like cheap coffee. Complex and wonderful. Goes great with goat milk and sugar, or black. And, unlike a real billy goat, you won't have to wash your clothes after you touch it....  I'm very picky about coffee and can say without hesitation that I'll be buying this one again!

review/summary: Good STUFF - but grind it a bit finer than normal.
review/text: First, my palette coffee lends itself towards darker oily roasts from Africa and Asia rather than lighter South & Central American coffees.  So, now you know how to discount my ramblings here's my review.<br /><br />When I opened my first bag of this stuff the first thing I noticed was an inconsistency in the oil present on the beans - only about 10% looked oily & the rest looked pretty dry.  The aroma is very good, so I figured what the heck, tossed it in the grinder and brewed a pot.  I have to say that my first results were disappointing - the aroma color and opacity were all spot on but the taste was demi body with a watery finish.<br /><br />I had just bought 24 ounces of this stuff and wasn't ready to chuck it so I did something I haven't done in over a year - I adjusted my grinder to a finer grind setting.  The disappointing half bodied flavor was gone and I had a good strong cup.  I would say the overall flavor lends itself more to the coffees from the Americas and par with a cup of coffee you might get after a meal at a really good restaurant.<br /><br />If you don't like the first batch then just grind it a bit finer and you should get better results.

review/text: I am a coffee lover. Many will not enjoy these bold flavors, but Raven's Brew coffees are exceptional. They are never bitter, have a smooth finish. Savored this coffee when I first had it on business a long while ago in the northwest. Since then, I randomly order it from Raven's Brew Coffees on line. I like all their coffees, and only wish I could pick them up locally. I like their funky philosphies too, and their website is fun for the eyes. I also wish the company would bring back their long sleeve t-shirts with the Served in Bed Wakes up the Dead (something like that, don't quote me!)logo of the Skeleton drinking coffee. My husband has the 3- Peckered Billy Goat T shirt too. Their whole culture is fun & I wish there was something fun & funky like that around these Connecticut Yankee hills!Definistely WORTH the price!

review/text: I LOVE Raven's Brew: Deadman's Reach.  It's, quite literally, the best coffee I've ever tried.<br /><br />So I thought I'd try another Raven's Brew blend, and ordered a couple bags of Three-Peckered Billy Goat.<br /><br />The aroma of the beans in the bag is great, just like DM Reach.  However, when I brewed it; using exactly the same bean volume, grind, and water volume as I do with the Reach; it just isn't as good.  It has a weak, almost slightly sour flavor.  You don't get any of the dark nutty, chocolate, roasted notes that make Deadman's Reach so good.<br /><br />Overall, I love Raven's Brew, but this blend just isn't for me.

review/summary: Very tasty spread - would definitely get it again.
review/text: We ordered two jars of the Amish spreads, which arrived today.<br />The seller packs carefully, and the jars arrived quickly and in fine shape.<br /><br />We anxiously opened them both with spoons in hand to enjoy.<br />Both spreads were very tasty.<br />The apple blueberry is a definite keeper and I would buy it again without a blink.<br />The cinnamon was a little heavy, but it was still very tasty.<br /><br />The cherry was a little too spicy in my opinion - it seemed again like there was<br />too much cinnamon in it, to the point of overriding any cherry flavor.<br />If I was tasting that one blindfolded, I am not sure I could tell it was cherry!<br />It was still very good, just not as "cherry-ful" as other fruit butters I've had.<br />The spread looked lovely - you could see the cherries, but the taste was obscured<br />by the spices. Note that I love cinnamon in all forms - in cookies, on toast,<br />in spreads, in candy, in gum. So, I am not picking on it - it just seemed to be out of balance.<br /><br />Now, I do want to mention one thing that bothered me a little bit.<br />I saw no place or way that these jars were sanitarily sealed.<br />In other words, there was no lid to pop up, no inner seal, no plastic seal on the edges.<br />I am guessing that the jars are filled as orders come in, but it still<br />bugged me that the screw-on lids didn't seem to have any real seals.<br /><br />I would have liked to at least see those plastic heat-shrink seals around<br />the lids so I could have at least felt I was the first person dipping in the jar!<br />I did deduct one star for the lack of a visible sanitation process.<br />The jar does say to refrigerate after opening. Since there is no seal inside or out,<br />I would refrigerate immediately upon receipt no matter what.<br /><br />So, I would recommend the apple blueberry butter.<br />The cherry butter - well, I am going to keep trying other kinds.

review/summary: Yum, Cherries in butter form!
review/text: I was so excited to find cherry butter on Amazon, let alone that it was made by the Amish! we bought the two jar pack. I decided just to get cherry butter as a start and was happy with it, but want to try more flavors, now! I just read a previous reviewer's comments and have to agree taht there needs to be some kind of indication that the jar was sealed the whole time between jarring and my opening the jar. Even a sticker over the lid would make me happy. The jars were wrapped in bubble wrap in put into a box that just fit the two jars. They made it here in great shape. Just a little put off by the costs involved. "For that price it better last a while"  lol But it was made by the Amish, I grew up having a semi-awed respect for the Amish and find it has not changed.

review/summary: Great alternative to Tabasco,
review/text: As far as Louisiana style sauces go, this is one of the best and cheapest. Most any<br />"local" type establishment you visit in and around New Orleans will have a bottle of<br />Crystal on the table. Its not hot at all, maybe a 3 on a 10 scale, but the flavor<br />particularly for your basic generic Cajun spread is fantastic.<br /><br />The best thing about Crystal is that its not only available at most retail outlets, but<br />its cheap. Locally, a 12oz. bottle can be had for $1.39. Comparatively, the 2oz. bottle<br />of Tabasco costs $1.59 at the local grocery so it pays to have a couple of bottles of<br />Crystal laying around. Its also a beautiful stunning red color that I've learned to<br />appreciate over the years of sampling all the Louisiana style sauces. Next to Chef Paul's<br />Magic Pepper Sauce, this is my favorite.<br /><br />Good in stews, gumbos, on fish, chicken and pork when you want all the flavor without<br />the burn. If you're cooking for friends they wont mind you throwing in liberal doses<br />of this stuff. 5 Scovies<br /><br />BTW, I've been a long time fan of Crystal, and when they introduced their Extra Hot Sauce<br />I got so excited I wrote them a letter, a week later I got a personal note back from the<br />president of Baumer Foods thanking me for my business and he included two coupons for any<br />size Crystal Hot Sauce. These guys are doing it right!

review/text: I bought a case of these for my granddaughter at college. After I ordered, I told my wife what I had done. She informed me that these sell for $0.36/ea at Wal-Mart. This price was $0.63/ea.<br /><br />Okay, dear, I'm a dweeb. Should've asked you first.<br /><br />Save your money folks. Shop local on this one.

review/summary: Convenience food delivered to my door
review/text: Unlike some I am willing to pay a bit more for the convenience of having a case of this delivered to my door.<br />I don't like schlepping into Sam's club, and anything I use regularly such as bottled Fuji water, Tes's Tea jasmin green tea,<br />and this, I like to have delivered.  Considering I don't eat more than one of these a week it's not like I'm going to be losing big bucks. This is a 24 week supply for me.<br /><br />As for the soup itself, it's hot, filling, and it's oriental noodles ready to go after a couple of minutes in the microwave.  Try adding a few drops of Soy Sauce or Sesame Oil, or if you have time some chopped carrots, celery or peas.) So at two of these cases a year, at an additional $6 per case over what I might pay in a store (plus Fla. state sales tax), that's an extra $12 a year for this conveneince.  It's worth it to me.  I don't pay shipping as I have Amazon Prime, which is totally worth it for frequent Amazon purchases. So far I can still afford an extra $12 per year for this.<br /><br />One thing people might want to think about is this, taken from Wikipedia: "The most recent controversy concerns dioxin and other hormone-like substances that could theoretically be extracted from the packaging and glues used to pack the instant noodles. It was reasoned that harmful substances could seep into the soup as hot water was added to cup style instant noodles."  I empty the contents of the cup into a Pyrex bowl to heat it.<br />I like this as a quick snack and love the convenience of home delivery.

review/summary: didn't like...
review/text: I much prefer Maruchan ramen to top ramen i think the flavors taste better, and top ramen's noodles just don't have a good taste at all to me. Really loving the chicken flavor in the packets, I thought I would give these a shot just for a change. As a college student if you don't have a stove handy you can just heat up hot water in a microwave and add the noodles and flavor packet. Being that these were conveniently already in cup and Maruchaun i thought maybe these would take good...not really. I didn't like the flavor and the noodles were not good. I definitely will be sticking to the chicken in the packet not the cup. I wouldn't recommend them unless you already like them in the first place. I am still a Maruchan noodle lover tho :)

review/text: These are a delightful treat.  We always run out of Snickers Peanut Butter Squares at our house.  Don't be fooled - it looks like a single bar in the larger format, but there are actually two squares in the package.  Our home family enjoys the delicious peanut-buttery taste (is peanut-buttery a word?).  In fact, we would like some now, but Mom ate them all.  We are ordering more right now!

review/summary: Not as good as the original
review/text: This is the 2nd time Snickers tried this. The first time was in the late 80s/early 90s....except the product was called "Peanut Butter Snickers" not "Snickers Peanut Butter" and it was in a red wrapper not yellow. It was in a regular sized Snickers candybar. Lasted for awhile then became rare.<br /><br />This version...<br />Not bad, but what I dont like is the fact these come in squares, they are wider and small, they dont feel like a candybar at all. They are little snacks, but I dont understand the point of them selling them in just the small squares in every packaging variation. People sometimes want a full size candybar to fill them, but the snack squares are the only option they give though.<br /><br />It is nice they have this though because it is one of those flavors that should have always been around, since Peanut Butter and chocolate are one of the most populat combinations.

review/summary: YUMMY !
review/text: Scott's Cakes is one of the best brands of fudge I bought all during the past holiday season.  You can't eat any better than this brand.  It's sometimes difficult to find a white chocolate/maple no nut based fudge and I found it.  It's easy to eat the whole container which is nicely wrapped and the truffles are really large approximately 1 and a 1/2 inch yummy fudge.  This is perfect for gift giving with the Scott's paper box it arrived in.  Fudge was fresh and delicious.  ( I know not the nutritional label as it did not arrive with one or I would have posted that information )  The fudge is quite expensive for just 12 pieces but then again these are really large truffles.  5 stars.  I will buy again the next holiday occasion.

review/text: Compared to other gluten-free or 100% rice pasta this pasta is lacking. The pasta is easy to overcook and even when cooked al dente, the pasta crumbles and falls apart easily. I really enjoy eating pasta that isn't in a million pieces and is easy to cook - this just doesn't pass my gluten-free test. Not overcooking is the key for this pasta, but there are better pastas out there I would rather spend my money on.

I've had other rice pastas that hold their shape better.  If I did the 7 min it was still a bit not finished and then any time longer would turn it to mush and it wouldn't hold it's shape.
