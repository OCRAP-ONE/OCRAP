review/summary: Perfect snack in a perfect snacker size container
review/text: Let me start off by stating that I myself do not have a peanut allergy, but I first bought this when I was going to be working at a site with someone with a severe peanut allergy. Years later I now continue to eat Barney Butter because of the great taste and for the health benefits of almonds!  I think that the creamy Barney Butter is better tasting than the popular peanut butter brands available and the consistency is almost on par with the "natural" peanut butters available at super markets. You DO have to stir Barney Butter though, and because of that I highly recommend going with this smaller size jar rather than the full size jar.  I've bought both the full size and this what I like to refer as a "snacker" size and it is much easier to stir to the bottom of this size jar.  When I was buying the full size jars, the last inch or so on the bottom would always wind up going to waste as it was too difficult to mix the oils with a knife or spoon down to that level.  I keep a jar of this at home as well as at work and it's the perfect addition to have with an apple or celery as a snack and it makes for a rocking Almond Butter & Jelly sandwich.  One of my favorite foods!

review/summary: It's Peanut Butter made with Almonds.
review/text: So the Almond Butters that I've had and grown to love have an almond taste.  This is really just peanut butter.  As in if I gave you a spoon of this and a spoon of Jiff, you wouldn't be able to tell me which was which.  If you're allergic to peanuts but love PB&J's then this may be a heaven send.  If you're looking for almond butter... keep looking.<br /><br />So the above, would normally leave me with a 3-star review... but when the package arrived all three jars were really oily on the outside.  Like, I can't wash these clean and don't want to touch them oily or put them on my counter oily.  Additionally, when I opened one of them, I saw the small container was half full (I'd say close to 40% full).<br /><br />For $6 a jar this just isn't worth buying unless as I stated above you are allergic to peanuts and looking for your PB fix.  But if that's the case... I'd say get this for sure but be prepared to scoop the contents into another container.

review/summary: Thank you Barney Butter!
review/text: My daughter is allergic to peanuts, cashews, and pistachios. And she is also a picky fussy eater. Packing lunches for school was becoming a nightmare. She finally got the clearance to eat almonds from her allergist but they had to come from an almond only facility. Easier said then done! I was so happy to find this almond butter. No chance of cross contamination. Of course my daughter was hesitant at first because she never really had any nut product. But now she loves it! Great with Nutella. Her favorite breakfast is toast  with Barney butter and bananas. Yummy!

review/summary: Barney Butter- Best Almond Butter!! (For adults and toddlers)
review/text: I have been looking for a peanut butter substitute since I was diagnosed with a serious peanut allergy 3 years ago.  Barney Butter is gluten free and made in a completely peanut free facility (Yay!).  No worries about cross-contamination anymore.  Many of the other almond butters or sunflower butters found at the health food store say "may contain traces of peanuts", which is not an option for our family.<br /><br />In addition, Barney Butter has both a smooth and a crunchy variety.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00370957E">Barney Butter Crunchy Almond Butter, 10-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a>  This is the closest flavor to the "Jif" peanut butter or "Skippy" peanut butter I remember growing up with.  It is sweetened lightly with evaporated cane juice.  This is the almond butter I chose to use when introducing my toddler to "peanut butter" sandwiches.  I love almond butter as a peanut butter alternative for children- so much healthier and high in protein and not as common of an allergen.  Barney Butter also comes in little travel pouches- look for them on Amazon. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P22GHC">Barney Butter Almond Butter 90 Calorie Snack Packs, 0.6-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>  We have used this smooth Barney Butter in peanut butter cookie recipes with great success, too!

review/text: We have a child who is allergic to peanuts.  Over the years I have tried every kind of peanut butter subsititute under the sun (sunflower, soy, cashew etc).  Barney Butter is hands down the best option for a peanut butter subsitute.  It has the texutre and consistency of peanut butter and is similar in taste as well.  This is the only almond butter that I have found to be made in a peanut free facility as well.  Other almond and nut butters just do not come close to the quality and taste of Barney Butter.  Thanks to Jennifer Barney for coming up with this wonderful product!

review/summary: Very strong flavor
review/text: I bought a bag of these on clearance for .75 locally. I'd never heard of them. They are basically round tortilla chips rolled up like a taquito and coated with a flavor powder. The flavor, hot chili pepper and lime, is as described. It tastes like hot chili pepper powder with a hint of lime. The heat is about on par with flamin' cheetos if you've had those. It's hot but it doesn't burn so much you can't taste. I can eat about 5 at one time before I'm overwhelmed. But for me these have too much flavoring on each chip. They are a dark orange color, and there is none of the corn chip color showing through. I like the amount of flavoring on Doritos or Pringles. It's obvious but not too much. The Takis is too much. Although it does make it easier to not eat too many of them. Also you should wear a bib when eating them, the flavoring drops off on your shirt and if you try to wipe it it stains a little. I lifted some off with a piece of tape that didn't get ground into the fabric though. But back to the chips. Crunchy. Very strong flavor. On the hot side as the "Fuego" would indicate. Not something I would probably buy again, though I might buy a bag for my friend who likes the flamin' cheetos. If you like the strong flavored spicy chips, and lime, you should like these.

review/text: We tried these treats to help with plaque and tartar.  I have two dogs, a Siberian Husky and a Mini Schnauzer. Their vet told us that they should both have treats for their teeth that will help with tartar.  We can't really use big bones because the dogs get too aggressive with them.  Treats work better.  We bought these to try and they seemed okay, but the next day the dogs had very bad upset stomachs.  This was the only new thing introduced to their diet so that is why I feel that it was the culprit. They may work, but for my dogs they did not work.

review/summary: Part of my variety pack
review/text: I buy different types of treats for my dogs and keep them all in a large Rubbermaid container on top of the fridge.  The dogs go nuts every time I reach for that box.  I think they enjoy the variety because after I give them their treat they still look at me like "what else is she gonna give us" and sometimes I swear it's more like "but mom, I don't like that kind, I want the other one".<br /><br />I mix all kinds of mainly dental treats together in the box.  Rawhide sticks (all colors and flavors, not just green ones), Greenies, Dingos, CET and also use some rawhide bones.  These treats help scrape plaque from their teeth while chewing before tarter can form if given after meals or once a day.  My dogs do not get soft food or treats unless we are training.  Saving soft treats for training makes them want it all the more and the hard food is better for their teeth and digestion.<br /><br />I have a Miniature Pinscher and 2 Pomeranians that are prone to tooth loss so taking care of their teeth is very important to me.  My oldest Pomeranian is 6 years old and just had his first professional cleaning and that was mainly because it is hard for me to get his back teeth because his mouth is so tiny.<br /><br />They love when they see the bag of treats come out of the cupboard because they now it's the soft stuff or the small one bite treats and they are more receptive to training and their sessions go much faster.<br /><br />I would recommend these treats as part of a variety.  Mix it up so your dog doesn't get bored and use different shapes to get different angles on their teeth.<br /><br />[...]  Thanks!

review/summary: my dogs love these bones!
review/text: my dogs have been eating these bones for several years now, and they adore them.  My chihuahua goes outside to potty, and sometimes she sniffs around too long and it can be annoying waiting on her.  But if I say, "want a bone?"  her head jerks up and she looks at me to make sure I mean it, and if I say it again she GALLOPS to me all excited for that bone.  After I give it to her she then has a game where she goes all over the house trying to decide where to bury it, (it really is hysterical to watch her dig around the pillows) but after she's held it in her mouth a while the juiciness of the bone gets to her, and she has to sit down and eat it.  It is a joy to watch her.<br /><br />Our dachie-poo has long since eaten her bone, and she is wondering, "why does sister have a bone and I don't?"<br /><br />Seriously, our dogs love these bones and consider them a great treat.  I've never noticed anything harmful about them, and our dogs have been eating them for about 3-4 years.  They are a treat, not a bone that will last very long like a rawhide chew, but they are safe and don't splinter.  The worst thing about them is that they are EXPENSIVE.  But our dogs love them, so we give them to them.  They do make our dog's breath better, that's a fact.  But I can't attest to how well they clean their teeth - we get our dogs' teeth cleaned anyway, so whether this helps any I can't say.

But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/text: I tried the other liquid kind, but it killed my young plants. I was not able to measure it properly. I thought I would try this brand just because I was tired of messing with the yucky, power plant food. Guess what? It works great. My plants seem to really love it. The dropper adds a nice touch and helps to make sure you are consistent with giving your babies the right amount of good nutrients. I give it five starts, because a few drops is really all you need for a great pick me up.

Since it's concentrated, it's also economical to use. The only time I use anything else is when I can't find this product in the stores. Finding it at Amazon solves that problem, happily.

review/summary: Seems to work!
review/text: I don't actually have much to compare it to, since I've been using it ever since I got my first houseplant. But my plants don't die, (even my pothos that I kept waterlogged for 2 years straight..) and my hoya is now growing 6-inch leaves (all the leaves it had when I got it were 2-4 inches.) so it seems to be good. Also, I used it on some blueberry bushes outside, and while I can't tell how much it helped the blueberries, (they were having a really hard time because they'd been under a bunch of ivy, and I uncovered them, so their improved health could be attributed to their improved living conditions..) the weeds around them shot WAY up past weeds only a foot away. That's good enough for me. Plus, I haven't observed any negative effects. I'm going to keep using this stuff.

review/text: I've used this for years and it's the best I've found.  I have a seriously black thumb but with Schultz Plant Food, I can actually get things to grow.  I have no problem with over fertilizing or under fertilizing, it works for young plants, old plants, indoor or outdoor plants, flowers or edibles, you can even use it in your Topsy-Turvy.<br /><br />It's concentrated and easy to use(this bottle lasts a LONG time).  I usually mix up a half gallon and water my plants as needed.<br /><br />Best of all, it's safe so if someone (human or pet) accidentally gets a taste of it, there's none of that rushing off the to the ER.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />**Note** Not suitable for Air Ferns

review/text: For years I used Miracle Grow granules mixed in water, to feed my house plants.  I couldn't find them when it was time to order more so I decided to try Schultz plant food.  I'm very happy with this product, and will order it again.<br /><br />It's so simple to use - just squeeze 7 drops (dropper included in the bottle) in a quart of water, or adjust the number of drops for more or less water. Water your plants, and watch them thrive.  I use plant food about once a month in the winter months, and every two weeks in the warm months.  If they need watering between those times, I just use plain water.<br /><br />This bottle is 8 ounces, which will last me for years.

review/text: Very dark chocolate. Very smooth chocolate. Very necessary chocolate. This is the type of chocolate that is as good for your heart as red wine. And it definitely does not hurt your feelings to eat it! We have developed the habit of eating 3-4 pieces after dinner in lieu of dessert. Since we've been doing the 17-day diet, this makes it bearable as well as adding the anti-oxidant and flavonoids that are important to health. It's such a great signal to "end" the day's eating, we seldom eat anything after that bit of Dove! BONUS: We've each lost about 20-25 lb in the 3 months we've been using this practice.

review/text: I opened the first bag ordered and received today, wondering how they could be as good as I'd anticipated.  Well, they are.  The 5 pounds is the drained weight and they are fresh, firm, tasty and not too salty.  There is a minimal amount of liquid, and I've not seen any that are mushy.  I separated the olives into jars for three and put the remaining half (yes that's right, half) into a FoodSaver medium sized cannister and vacuum sealed that one.  I gave two of the jars away and received great thanks and praise for this thrifty online purchase of high quality olives.  The spices are minimal, which was a concern of mine.  Can't wait to receive the Antipasto Olives next week for comparison.  I'd definitely buy these again and serve them to any person who loves olives.

review/text: I've ordered these olives on 5 different occasions.  They'd become a favorite snack.<br /><br />However, two of these 5 times, they arrived in a rather poor state: the olives were perhaps cured too long or stored too long or something, as they were quite mushy - even the normally firm, green ones.<br /><br />There are apparently no returns on these, so sadly I'm having to rethink whether I want to continue ordering them.<br /><br />When they arrive in a good state, they're excellent, and the price beats any other olives of remotely similar quality I've seen in stores or elsewhere on the web.  But when they arrive mushy, it's kind of hard to eat them - the normally firm ones have the consistency of an overripe pear, and the normally-firm and normally-soft ones taste a little more acidic than I think they probably should.

review/summary: Wonderful plain olives.
review/text: Delicious olives, and lots of them, simply processed, without excess favorings. No hot peppers, no excess garlic.  Although many of the olives are ripe (brown and black), they are soft---not similar to "American" ripe black olives (which are slightly crisp and packaged in brine only). If preparing a mix for a luncheon, etc. a few "American" black olives mixed-in make a nice contrast.<br /><br />The similar "Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto"  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAKUP0">Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Bag</a>  is the same product but with tasty capers, a few garlic cloves and a few peices of bell peppers (for color), perhaps a slightly larger ratio of ripe olives, and perhaps saltier. I like the flavor of the "Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto" better, but it is a close call.<br /><br />The packaging (into a heavy plastic bag) apparently consisted of draining the olives and then coating them with olive oil. Amazon packages the bag (folded in half) in a standard ca 3" x 8" x 12" cardboard box. The packaging works well, however, shipment is hard some of the softer types of olives.<br /><br />The olives are salty. You may be tempted to soak them in plain water to reduce the salt content. Unless you plan to eat the olives in the next few hours, resist the temptation. First, you'll leach out too much salt and flavor. Second, the olives will rot in a few weeks. Really.<br /><br />I suggest gently rinsing the olives when you receive them (e.g., in your colander), and repackaging them in your own light brine and white vinegar mix (and jars), and refrigerate. The light brine will reduce the saltiness of the olives to an appropriate level in a day or two. It will take about 5 cups of water, about 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) of salt, and 1/3 cup (6 tbsp) of white vinegar to your taste. It is best to use "sea-salt" or pickling salt, because brine made from regular processed salt can get cloudy.<br /><br />Some of the olives are firm, some are soft---that's simply the nature of a true mix. Most Americans (like myself), raised on pimento-stuffed queen olives think that they don't like soft olives. Indeed, mushy queen olives are yucky. However, some types of olives are meant to be soft, and are best soft. It is an acquired taste, worth acquiring. The mix includes a large variety of olives, both firm and soft. It is said that the key to oriental cuisine is variety---a variety of colors, textures, and flavors. The same is true of an olive mix meant for snacking or as the basis of a light meal.<br /><br />Recommendation 1: A half-can of chick-peas, a diced tomato, a half-cup of these mixed olives, all mixed together with a little olive oil is a wonderful, tasty, health, lunch.<br /><br />Recommendation 2: There is a whole world of olives out their worth exploring. As just example, Grabers Ripe Green Olives are more different from stuffed queen olives than you can imagine, but are marvelous. Mild and nutty.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P8HPCI">Graber Olives Size 14 7.5 oz. Can</a>

The olives then can be stored on the counter top (away from direct sunlight and heat) for months. Do NOT refrigerate. The mix of green & black olives is good.  The only reason I did not give a five star rating is the price.  These are only slightly less expensive than what I purchase in our local grocery store. We eat a lot of olives so price is a consideration.  I have been ordering Vigo Black olives but since they are not currently available from Amazon I decided to try the Byzantine Country Olive mix, 5 pound bag. The Vigo olives were nearly half the price (for four pounds vs five pounds) and are very good.  I will probably continue to purchase the Byzantine olive mix until the Vigo black olives are again available.<br /><br />NOTE: we tried Mustapha's Moroccan Olives, Dry Cured Black, 4-Pound Tub once and had to throw the entire bucket out.  See the reviews of this product before you even consider purchasing them -- there are three reviews and all are bad. I am unsure why Amazon keeps them on the site.  In all fairness to Amazon, they did make a full refund of the price for the Mustapha olives.

review/summary: Fabulous tastes!
review/text: I decided on these because I only wanted olives -- not capers or other distractions. I ordered about a week before a game night with friends, and they arrived in time. By the end of the evening, more than half were gone -- and there were only 10 of us eating them! Everyone who likes olives loved these, commenting on the good tastes. Some folks took containers home. I probably had 50 left to take home. Yummy -- and well worth it.

review/summary: Rating and a rant
review/text: This was a great deal! The amount of olives seems overwhelming at first glance but quickly dwindles after some divvying up with friends and a few parties. One of the varieties of olive did become mushy upon refrigeration but the others held their firmness. Now, I myself can't purchase them again because Amazon has declined to ship groceries to Alaska any longer. I really cant fathom why some companies choose to treat both Alaska & Hawaii as though we are located on another planet. If you are shipping from the west coast, it is the same amount to ship to either Alaska or the east coast. How 'bout cutting off New jersey's olive supply? I digress....buy the olives, have some for me.

review/summary: Great Product - almost perfect
review/text: The good - olives are pretty much uniform in quality and taste great.  Packaging allows them to ship without swimming in brine.  Olives keep their quality in original bag - we usually go thru the bag in two weeks.  Thru the mail is the best way for us to buy olives since we are about 60 miles from any kind of gourmet store.  So why not five stars?  Some of the brown olives can be a little mushy - but the taste is consistently good even in the ones less firm.  Over all a really good product.

review/summary: Why not to buy the country olive mix
review/text: I have been buying olives from Amazon for years and these are the worst I have received. The mix was supposed to have cracked olives, for some reason I was thinking cracked green olives with coriander, like they have in Cyprus.  What arrived were just green olives, raw, green, uncured, green olives. Also, about five pounds and no liquid, after I poured the olives into a large jar, there was about one inch of liquid. the rest of the olives were not all that good. Not good

review/text: These are good. There are lots of them. I know it says 5 pounds, but you don't really have an appreciation for how much that is until you unpack them.<br /><br />They are very good. I'd have given 5 stars, but I like my olives firm. And some of them (maybe 15%) are kind of mushy. It is just one of the kinds that are in there that are mushy, but it kind of impacts the overall effect for me. I probably won't order again. Mostly because it is probably more than I can eat as a single person, plus I'll look for some that have more of the French olive mix that I was really after. But if you like the mix here, you'll really enjoy them.

review/text: There are a number of recipes on line for roasted olives using herbs, citrus zest, sherry and red wine vinegars.  The black olives in this mix are soft, but I suspect that's because they are actually ripe olives, not the black ones in the can that have been treated with chemicals.

review/summary: Good on the first day, down hill from there
review/text: I received these olives in great shape. They tasted great with very few if any that were soft. The bag was very cold. I separated the bag into 5 equal sized hard plastic food tubs and put them in the fridge. The second day, many of the olives were getting soggy and were not the same quality. On the 4th day, any that were not eaten, I had to throw out. I loved the olives, but it was a bit disappointing on how quickly they went bad. They shipped to Seattle from Maryland in winter, so I am not sure if they got frozen in the shipping, which could explain the speed at which they went bad. There was little protective packing around them, so they were subjected to all the temperature fluctuations in route. Sadly, you cannot not request money back for this item. Eating 5lbs of olives, even with friends is a huge task, so I felt I wasted a lot of olives (and money). Given the price locally, I think I am going to skip buying on Amazon for this item.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: I though the price seemed a little high, especially considering that you are paying for pits along with the edible parts.  But then when I thought about it, these kinds of olives are typically very expensive and only sold in teensy little jars.  When I did a little comparison math, I found the price to be a good deal.<br /><br />When the bag arrived, I thought it didn't look like all that many olives (5 lbs. sounds like a lot) but then, they were heavy.  That meant, and it was obvious, that each olive was very plump, fresh and full.<br /><br />Upon tasting, I am very happy.  These definitely seem quite fresh and nice, plump with a lot of meat on them.  The flavor is good, a little of that expected kick from the oily seasoned brine, but not too strong and not too salty.  I consider this to be mild for these kinds of olives, which is good for my purposes here, as I want to be able to use them in a variety of ways.  Note when I say "mild" I don't mean like typical canned American olives, which are "bland".  :)<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again; it's a great and convenient way to get a nice mix of tasty and healthy olives.<br /><br />P.S.:  I'm updating my review because I learned something which I think will be of interest.  When I received this, I put some into a separate small plastic storage container with a lid for convenience using in the frig, and put the rest of the bag into the vegetable bin.  I noticed that the olives appeared to be continuing to ferment, as the lid on the storage container was being pushed up a little.  This happened for the first three times I filled the storage container (within a short period of time, as I have been eating a lot of the olives!).  What I found out is that this is good - it means that, like real yogurt, these olives are naturally fermented and have the "good probiotics" in them, which are very helpful to your digestive system.  Apparently, most pickled type foods sold in the U.S. are pasteurized which stops this process.  I read some research suggesting that it is very good to consume safely prepared and preserved pickled/fermented products, such as these olives appear to be, just as it is good to consume real yogurt with live cultures - the same kinds of health benefits from the good probiotics.

I just wonder if they could be packed and sold in smaller units where the customer would not have to locate containers to store this large supply after opening the bag.

review/summary: Moist muffins, mmm!
review/text: Yum, the muffins are dark, moist, not too cinnamon-y or overwhelmingly apple--they're just right. It's easy to whip up a batch. They make a great morning muffin or an afternoon snack, definitely a tasty way to get more fiber into your diet. I've even tried them substituting apple sauce for the oil, and they're good that way too. Sometimes I add raisins, currants, or chopped dried apricots, equally good.<br /><br />I first saw these at Costco. Then Costco stopped carrying them except in Montana (I like these, but not THAT much). Costco said this was a special item with a limited run, but it appears that Amazon has cornered the market on this item, which is okay with me.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/text: I've never reviewed anything before, but have relied on reviews for many purchases.  If this keeps anyone else from buying this new soup thinking it is the same as the old one, then it's worth it.<br /><br />I've purchased and eaten the old version of the Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Chicken Ramen Big Cup Soup for several years.  When I suddenly couldn't get the 2.1 oz soup cups, and this appeared (1.8 oz soup cup), I bought 3 boxes of 6.  I ate the first one a few days ago, and barely could choke it down.<br /><br />The broth in no way resembles chicken broth, it's brown and watery and has a slight trace of miso or soy flavor, with a bitter after taste.<br /><br />YUCK!  Don't buy this, unless or until they re-formulate it again to once again be edible and resemble chicken soup.

review/summary: A good alternative for vegetarians/vegans
review/text: Personally, I think this is a decent soup. I can see why people think it's a bit bland, but if you add just a little of your own touches, it's awesome. I think it's a great alternative for vegetarians and vegans or anyone who wants healthier ramen. And yes, it does boil over in the microwave, so you should probably just put it all in a bowl. I'm also used to odd tasting food being a vegetarian, so that could be why I think it's better than other people do. Not sure if I would buy it again or not, but I would eat it again.<br />And if you follow the directions (other than putting it in your own bowl) it turns out perfectly. You heat in the microwave for 2 minutes, and let it set for 5 or so minutes to soften the noodles. If they're too firm, you're not waiting long enough.

review/text: I enjoy ramen noodles but not in the usual form of extremely high fat, carbs, and salt so this product is an improvement. My only complaint? The flavor is very bland to the point that I likely wouldnt buy it again or will always have to have some spices on hand for flavor. Vegan doesnt mean without flavor. Also let it set for a long time, the noodles take a long time to soften.

review/summary: great healthy soup
review/text: I use this soup as a base.  I use twice the amount of water or more, add 1 tsp applecider vinegar or any vinegar, the seasoning pack, throw in the ramen...cook it for a few minutes in a pan, then add plenty of beansprouts and spinach and cook for a another minute or so. You have a fantastic meal for around 200 calories and very filling. If desire, Add a piece of whole grain bread.

review/summary: Meh; noodles too firm
review/text: I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it. The noodles are a little too firm for "ramen". The broth was ok...again, didn't hate it, but didn't like it. It didn't all dissolve (I followed the instructions completely) and it got kind of grainy at the bottom. I will eat the rest but will definitely not order it again.

review/summary: Beware:  blows up in the microwave
review/text: Unfortunately, this item does not hold up well in the microwave.  I purchased the pack of six and have tried three.  After following directions, each have bubbled up in the microwave, causing the liquid to spill everywhere.  I will not buy again.

review/summary: Really different
review/text: I was ordering a large bottle of vanilla extract and while I was on Amazon I saw the tahitian vanilla and decided to order a small bottle just to see if I could tell the difference.....OMG  while I don't know if it a substitute in baking (I really don't want to waste it)  it is really delicious.  I am doing the South Beach diet and I mixed ricotta, Splenda, and this vanilla and it was awesome.  Really different from regular vanilla.  I have used it in a fruit salad dressing, and it made all the difference in the world

review/summary: Taste just like you cut open a real coconut!
review/text: I grew up in the Caribbean (Trinidad) drinking coconut water often.  As a kid we'd look forward to going for a walk around the park where pickup trucks would be parked loaded with coconuts sitting on ice.  They'd slice off the top for you and give you a straw.  I now live in the US and thought I'd never taste that again.  That is... until I stumbled across A&B Coconut juice with pulp.<br /><br />Let me tell you... I've had all kinds of coconut juice in cans from the grocery store and online.  None of them ever really tasted like the real deal, but it was close enough to make me buy more every once in a while.<br /><br />BUT, A&B coconut juice with pulp IS the real deal people.  I swear the first time I opened a can, I stopped, looked at the can and said "OMG!  This tastes like a real coconut!"  Needless to say, I was hooked.  Got my fiance hooked.  Told him we need a separate A&B line item in the budget now.<br /><br />There's nothing like a cold A&B coconut juice with pulp after a workout in the morning.  Or with lunch.... or winding down for the night.  Hey, what can I say, I'm addicted.<br /><br />A&B, if you ever change the taste of this thing, I'll hunt you down!  LOL!  And folks, if you're looking for the real deal in coconut water (with NO sugar added!), I promise you THIS IS IT.  And I grew up in the Caribbean so I know when I hit the jackpot with the real coconut water taste.<br /><br />Now I do have to say that the one without pulp did not taste as much like a real coconut as the one with pulp did.  So get the one with pulp.  Caution - you may just get hooked.  Look for space in your budget to accommodate this new (and very healthy!!) habit.<br /><br />By the way, do an internet search for the nutritional value and benefits of coconut water. You won't be disappointed.  And to have it taste THIS good?  Wow!  I'd bet if you did a taste test between this and coconut juice straight out of a coconut, you won't be able to tell the difference.  I'm telling you, it's THAT good.<br /><br />I don't know how you pulled this off in a can A&B but THANK YOU!!

review/summary: Love this stuff - has no strange ingredients or sweeteners
review/text: This is the best tasting natural coconut water - Zico is good too but they don't have one that comes with pulp. Also Amy & Brian's come in a can so it's recyclable. Amazon needs to lower the price a bit - it is cheaper to buy at the store.

review/summary: "The closes thing!!As if I'm in Southeast Asia !!!
review/text: I've been drinking coconut juice since I was a little boy ,I really know which ones are good & which ones are not,The taste should be mildly sweet ,fresh & clean .This one is a winner! .I tried many brands including Zicco for me it's very sour& woodsy ! & where I'm originally from that would be considered a reject. Again if you want the real thing this one would be it!!!! Gosh Amy & Brian coconut juice are just the best!

review/summary: I Hadn't Had Coconut Juice Before
review/text: A&B coconut  juice was very refreshing.  I though it would be a little sweeter, but it was very good.  I'd probably buy it again if the price was a little lower.

review/summary: Best on the market!
review/text: i've tried most brands on the market, and i have found this one to be the best. sweeter and less "green" tasting than the brazilian varieties. plus, the price is hard to match. the others are twice the price.<br /><br />my only hope is that they begin to package the product in less heavy gauge cans.
