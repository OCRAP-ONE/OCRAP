review/summary: Disappointed dogs
review/text: After reading several satisfactory reviews on Amazon, I purchased the Zuke's Turkey and Taterz mini bakes.  My two dogs are not picky eaters and especially love turkey and potatoes.  My miniature poodle absolutely refused them.  My terrier took them in his mouth and immediately spit them out.  I have tried several times, but the result is the same.  Since the ingredients are all natural, I took a small nibble myself to see why.  They taste terrible and the texture is awful.  This was a waste of money.

review/summary: 5 stars for flavor
review/text: However, I had to deduct 1 star because they don't break in half - they crumble - wish they were already the smaller size for toy breeds.  I'm disappointed they're not in a resealable bag.  My shih tzu loves these - couldn't tell if she liked the Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz or the Turkey n' Taterz more - great for training aids.  Haven't tried the Chicken n' Cherryz  yet.  Zuke's mini bakes are made in the USA and the "use by" dates on our boxes were over a year and a half away.<br /><br />Update - she likes Chicken n' Cherryz best.

review/summary: Great idea that didn't work
review/text: I got 2 boxes of these because I have 3 dogs.  The 2 large dogs love these, but they really are just like giving them a crumb if they only get 1.  My small dog (Bichon) grudgingly accepts them, but she doesn't like that they are hard.  They get hard kibble for dinner, and she rarely turns down dinner.  So it has to be something about these treats.<br /><br />They don't have any odor.  They are easy to give to the dog.  I like Zuke's products because they are healthier and safer than most other brands.  One of my dogs has allergies to the grains so this is better for her than most treats are.<br /><br />I will keep looking for that perfect but elusive dog treat.

review/summary: Excellent for elderly cat with digestion issues
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019RR12I">By Nature Naturals 95% Meat - Beef & Liver - 12 x 6.5 oz</a><br /><br />I have been using 'By Nature Naturals 95% Meat' for several years (in both the 'chicken & liver' and 'beef & liver' varieties) for 2 seniors who are 19-year-old Siamese cats.  After trying brand after brand and having them either reject it or vomit it back up, I found this brand at my local "big box" pet store and not only did they like it, but their tummy problems resolved (over time.)<br /><br />Many senior cats (especially Siamese, it seems) have digestive problems and the foods that are on the market are not well-formulated for their needs.  Some have too much fat, others not enough nutrition or fiber, and many are made from poor quality ingredients that irritate their digestive system and make the food unappealing to them.  I've also noticed that the quality of a given brand varies from batch to batch -- some to the point that it was apparent to me (a mere human) that something was "off"  based on the smell and appearance of it.  I haven't had that problem with this item -- ever.<br /><br />I can't, however, endorse *all* of 'by Nature's'  products. I tried 'by Nature's' "Organic" line of cat food.  After initially accepting it, both cats got very sick with vomiting and diarrhea.  I didn't make the connection right away so, after nursing them back to health, I re-introduced the 'Organic' food.  They got sick again and, after that, wouldn't eat the stuff no matter how hungry they were. (Can't say as I blame them.) I remembered that they had liked the '95% meat' cat food and tried that again.  On comparing the ingredients, I realized that the 'Organic' product line had a lot of other ingredients in it (some I found questionable) while the '95% Meat' product line is ALL meat with only the vitamin and mineral supplements any vet would recommend added (to make up 5% of the product.) I've also found that, with the higher quality ingredients, the cats are satisfied to eat less of it -- making the litter box less of an ordeal.<br /><br />When I discovered that they liked it and they did well on it (with the addition of a fiber supplement suggested by their vet) I have fed it to them exclusively.  The quality is consistently good from can-to-can and hasn't varied through the several years I have used it.  In fact, the only problem I've had was when our local store stopped carrying it and I searched frantically for a new source for the stuff.  I found some on-line vendors.  I was recently surprised to see that I could also buy from several  sellers through Amazon at reasonable prices.  I find myself making more and more of my purchases through Amazon because of their guarantees and customer-friendly approach.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019RR12I">By Nature Natural 95% Meat Beef and Liver Formula Canned Cat Food</a><br />Our cat has an alergy to chicken and chicken by products that are in most cat foods.

This is the only food they would actually devour, I mean clean the dish completely.<br />This was the last can that was on the shelf so I asked the manager of the store, part of a national chain when he would get more  into the store. He told me they would get no more because corporate had made the decision to no longer carry this line of food.<br />  Fortunately for us and our cats we were able to find this available through Amazon at PetFoodDirect.com. The order was placed on June3 and delivered on June 9. Thank you PetFoodDirect.com from us and our kittys

review/summary: Solved 2 years of 'poop problems' in 24 hours...
review/text: I adopted 2 kittens from an animal shelter 2 years ago. Both were treated for coccidia and roundworm at that time, and repeated stool tests over a 2-year period confirmed that these infections were indeed gone and nothing else funky was growing - but still, they had ongoing poop problems. By 'poop problems' I mean that both cats suffered from chronic softer-than-normal stools, ranging in color from pale orange-brown to pale yellow-brown, sometimes even medium orange-brown, but never the dark brown 'normal' color that I'd become accustomed to with other cats I'd owned over the years. Their stools were often formed, but definitely on the soft side, becoming drippy and/or pudding-like at the tail-end of each bowel movement - either that or (less frequently) pudding-like straight through. The worst part was probably the smell - their bowel movements smelled like some weird combination of parmesan cheese and eggs? and one cat even had 'eggy' gas. This cat is also overweight and pushing 20 lbs.<br /><br />I tried all sorts of cat foods in a desperate search for some resolution - pricier 'healthy' brands, grain-free, prescription diets (EN Cat Food) - you name it - nothing seemed to help. And every time I tried a new food I was stuck with the results too until the bag/cans ran out.<br /><br />Recently I began suspecting a seafood allergy since almost every brand and flavor cat food out there contains seafood, but in my search for a cat food free of ALL the 'extras' (not just grains and seafood), I stumbled on Nature Naturals Beef and Liver, tried it, and for the first time in the 2 years I've had these cats, both are having solid, dark brown, 'segmented' (if that makes any sense?) bowel movements.<br /><br />Now I also purchased the Nature Naturals Turkey and Turkey Liver, but I haven't tried that one yet on them. If for some reason they do not do as well on that flavor, I will post an update. But I'm loving this food, and so are my cats - even the scrawny one. The results were quick too. Hoping this food will also help my fatty lose a few since he is now (finally) digesting his food!<br /><br />Just an update: Both cats are still doing well on this food and even the other flavors I've tried in this brand (chicken, turkey). They love them all, and their stool problems are still history. The only flavor I haven't tried on them is the seafood flavor. If your cat has unexplained digestive issues, try this food! I swear this food saved my sanity. My 'fatty' is still fat, but at least he doesn't smell like egg and cheese anymore - nor does his brother. I was surprised too how quickly they adapted to the routine of eating canned food twice a day, and ONLY canned food, after having had 24/7 access to dry food all of their lives. They don't seem to miss the dry food at all.

review/summary: Good for Guests.
review/text: We buy this Starbucks Frappuccino Coffee Drink by the case at our local warehouse store. We don't drink it very often, but it makes a nice occasional treat. Rather, we like to have it around for others. When it comes time to offer our guests something to drink, the Frappuccino coffee drink is one of the many choices. Everyone who takes it seems to like it and an amazing number of people seem to like coffee drinks, plus Starbucks is such a well-known name. Personally, I find the Starbucks Frappuchino and other coffee drinks a little rich and much too sweet tasting. When it comes to coffee, I prefer my coffee brewed hot, black and strong, and Starbucks is an excellent coffee. My wife, on the other hand, prefers tea to coffee. Both she and I enjoy the Starbucks Frappuccino on rare occasions and we prefer drinking it ice cold. This is a good product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

They love them so much that they know what "Cookie" means and jump with excitement over receiving their treat. I love the size of these because they are just big enough not for my Chihuahua's or my pugweenie pup to be able to gulp down in one bite.  There is no greasiness as I have found with other brands, and no funky smell either.

review/summary: Bad Taste
review/text: One of the reasons people hate being healthy or trying to be fit is because of flavor. The old saying "If it tastes good, spit it out" referring to diets is how a lot of people view it. This beverage won't help this thought.  I have tried at least three of the Skinny girl alcohols, the most recent being the white peach margarita which sounded good in theory. The flavor is horrible....barely drinkable at best. You'll only finish it out of desperation not to waste your money. It smells like peaches and tastes like super bitter grapefruits. There are plenty of other options to turn to if you don't want to stray from your fit lifestyle and still have some flavor or enjoy a cocktail once in a while. I'm confused why these products are still being sold....must be the celebrity attachment. Bethenny probably doesn't drink her own products.

review/summary: Smells Peachy but tastes bitter....
review/text: I had heard mixed reviews about the Skinny Girl Margarita "empire" but was willing to buy the White Peach margarita as I love peach margaritas! Plus, it was on Sale so I thought I would give it a try.  I wish I could get my $10 back.  It smells like peaches which was a great sign but it doesn't actually taste like peaches? Only thing I can think of is that they used artificial extract.  And I am not a mixologist but the balance is "off" - it either has way too much lime juice and/or not enough agave nectar.  It tastes bitter and harsh which are not two things a margarita should taste like! I actually had to dilute it with ice and add some sugar in the raw to make it somewhat drinkable.  For a great peach margarita, I will stick to puree-ing frozen peach slices with Jose Cuervo Light Margarita or the Costco Brand margarita.  No more Skinny Girl for this girl!

Also I feel the price is reasonable and you can split the treats in half which makes the box stretch. I have found that even big dogs don't care about the size of the treat as long as they get one.

When I noticed they made a product called turkey 'n taterz, I had to buy it so my girls could try it. Evie the bichon loved them right away and gobbled several of the flat-bottomed, oval treats in short order. Ever the fussy one, Piper the shih tzu had to be cajoled and had to see if Evie liked them. After her first taste, Piper was a convert soon begging for more.<br /><br />The crunchy treats come in a convenient small size, but have an indentation in the middle so that one can more readily break them in two for dainty dogs who like small bites. (Namely Piper the shih tzu)<br /><br />Made with USDA turkey and fresh potatoes, these wholesome treats are bound to get the attention of spudophiles everywhere. Give them as treats or rewards or sprinkle them on the dinner plate for those reluctant fussy eaters. (See Piper above)

Our dogs took to these treats immediately.  We started with Turkey and Taterz and have also given them the Chicken and Cherries.  The mini bakes are bite sized, so they are great for training.  If you have a smaller dog, the treats have a mild indentation so they can be split in half.

review/summary: So far.. no good
review/text: **Well, I'm amending my review... in the negative.  10 more dogs found it completely unappetizing.  Some wouldn't even pay attention to me when I held it out.  The few who tried seemed to spit it out in confusion, like, "Why does a cookie taste bad?  I don't understand this."  Have to return.  Wholly disappointing.<br /><br />As a behaviorist at a local shelter, I need lots of different types of treats to keep dogs' attention.  I trust Zuke's to make non-reactive yet enticing doggie snacks and had success with their moist "mini naturals", so I thought I'd give this a shot.  I bought the Blueberry flavor.  So far, 5 dogs have informed me in varying ways that they couldn't give less of a flip that these are edible.  I've had them spat on the ground or flat-out ignored.  I have no idea where Zuke's went so wrong with this treat, but 5 otherwise treat-motivated pups give it two paws down.<br /><br />Risking disgusted stares, I will venture this information; I occasionally taste a crumb of a dog treat.  These were entirely bland and tasteless, and frankly reminded me of the insides of a vitamin pill.  No hint of blueberry or peanut butter... and downright sandy.  They may be starting to sell old stock from the back of the warehouse, as others had good experiences earlier with this treat.  I can't explain this shelter's unanimous population down-vote any other way.

These treats are big for a puppy so we cut each one in half 2. Since they are hard, our puppy has to stop our training to eat which can cause him to loose focus. If you're looking for training treats, I'd get a smaller and softer kind, but if your just looking for some yummy treats they seem work well.

review/summary: They go nuts for chicken and cherryz!
review/text: Just bought a box of Chicken and Cherryz at my local pet store to try (they were on clearance!). My girls just go CRAZY for these treats! My older dog will sit, then lay down, then stand up just to get one. The baby girl at 5 months doesnt know how to sit yet and just wiggles and jumps all over the kitchen to have the treat. They are so affordable and low calorie! We will keep buying them.<br /><br />Beth

review/summary: The best dog treats
review/text: My little dachshund absolutely loves these treats.  They are the perfect size for my small dog (though they might be too small for big dogs) and make a great training treat.  You can also break them in half thereby doubling the already plentiful number of treats in the box.

review/summary: Great for pockets!
review/text: So many dog treats leave crumby greasy messes in my pocket that is worth celebrating a treat that does not. These treats are also easy to break in half, which makes them a great size for training.  I am usually running around with a pocket full for my dog, and she likes them enough to listen to me.  On a side note, this is the first box of dog treats that my cats have ever tried to break into... they must smell pretty good even to finicky eaters.

review/text: I think the title explains it. We cut it into quarters and use it for rewarding our puppy while we train it. Took us 24 hours to teach a 8 week puppy to use the outdoor for relieving itself. The dog will do anything for a reward.<br />Do be careful in how you store it as it will dry out if exposed to too much air.

review/summary: great treats at a great value!
review/text: healthy treats my puppy loves.  not to big for a puppy, they are about 3/4 of an inch long and 3/8 of an inch wide and are scored down the middle so you can break them in half if you want (makes two pieces about the size of a kibble of food each) and you can easily give a larger dog a few at a time.<br /><br />peanut butter n' blueberryz is the only flavor I have tried so far but my puppy gets excited when she has earned one!<br /><br />great value especially considering the quality ingredients they are made with.<br /><br />I rotate these with Blue Buffalo Health Bars <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XGAE">Blue Buffalo Health Bars for Dogs, Apple Yogurt, 16-Ounce Bag</a> several flavors available.

He's used to eating rawhide treats and the blueberry/peanut butter treats were really a hit. Now everytime I see Lucky he greets me and rolls over for a belly rub. My sister says I spoiled him and now he thinks he's elite.

review/summary: Great treat for dogs with sensitive tummies!
review/text: While I wouldn't necessarily suggest these for a dog with food allergies--every case has to weighed carefully--for my German shepherd who seems to have tummy issues with nearly anything, these are a fantastic find.<br /><br />I picked them up on Amazon when I needed to spend a little more to get free shipping. I read the ingredients, didn't see anything that I wouldn't use when I make my own and the price was right (they've since gone up.) While I don't smell the blueberries like others have said they do, I will say it's nice to buy a dog treat that doesn't smell bad.  The scent sort of reminds me of going into the local feed and grain store. Even better, you CAN carry them in a pocket to use as a training treat and your fingers won't stink. (Or your pockets.)<br /><br />Both my GSD's love them, and the one with the sensitive tummy has NO PROBLEM with these at all. I'm also impressed with the quantity-a full pound. The insulated plastic bag in the box is full up. This is pretty unheard of when buying dog treats. I've been using them almost 2 full weeks and the container is barely half empty. This includes taking a small baggie of them to work so I can give treats when I'm in the office too.<br /><br />I've always liked Zuke's products, but because of tummy issues, and budgetary concerns, I typically make my own dog treats.  These are a great alternative when I don't feel like spending a Sunday afternoon making dog cookies I can't eat myself. (Well I could, but they don't really appeal.) Definitely will buy again.

review/summary: My go-to training reward
review/text: These are great treats for dogs prone to allergies and I always have a box or two on hand for my dog.  They are made with good ingredients and haven't caused any allergic reactions.<br /><br />They are small and can be broken in half most of the time without shattering.  Since they aren't enormous, you don't give as many calories to your dog as a training reward or lose too much focus on a treat that takes time to eat (or is so big it needs to be carried to some special super important treat-eating-spot).  I value keeping my dog in shape and not itchy and these treats do the trick.  He sits through nightly ear cleanings without a fuss because he knows he gets one of these per ear.<br /><br />I don't know if they are particularly tasty because my dog eats all of the things- and a friend's dog did reject them when I tried them for him, so if your dog is especially picky, these might not be perfect for you.

review/summary: Pixel says they're pretty good
review/text: The Zuke's Mini Bakes in Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz smell good and my small dog Pixel (a beagle-daschund) enjoys them (though they aren't her favorite treat).<br /><br />I bought these because the ingredients are simple, they're free of wheat and corn, they had no animal products or by-products, and they're made in the USA. One of the nice things about the Mini Bakes is that you can easily break them in half and get two little bites out of one treat.<br /><br />These are crunchy treats, but they're not super hard. They should be fine for smaller dogs, especially if you break them in half.<br /><br />I still think that the best dog treats out there are The Lazy Dog Cookie Co Inc Coconut Carob Chip Pup-squeaks (which are unfortunately out of stock right now on Amazon). But these Mini Bakes are good too.

The younger was having a hard time being potty trained among regulating her bathroom schedule, we'd also reward them with these treats after doing they're business outside. Now they run inside and sit by the cupboard where we keep the box. They are kinda difficult to break in half, but other than that they're great.

I'm going to try something different for treats or maybe a different flavor. We have the chicken n' cherries.

No need to give our dogs chemicals or preservatives.  Give them a try.  You will be pleased as I was.

review/summary: My puppy loves them.
review/text: I like everything about Zuke's treats - the ingredients, no artificial stuff, and they're made in the USA.  They're a good (healthier) alternative to the stuff you can typically find in most retail stores.  They cost more by weight, but they're not really expensive either.  (If you try some and like them, stock up in bulk on Amazon because they're eligible for the free shipping, too!)  And they actually do last a long time - each pound box is a big supply because the treats are small, and my puppy doesn't care that they're small, he just loves eating them.<br /><br />I started using Zuke's Mini Naturals treats when my English Setter puppy was right around 7-8 weeks old when we started training simple obedience, then a few weeks later I ordered the Zuke's Mini Bakes as well.  As far as training goes, I agree with the reviewers who said that it is better to use a small moist treat for early training, as the dog can swallow it quickly and not take extra time to chew it up.  If the puppy is small in size or young, use a moist treat.<br /><br />For a larger puppy that's a little older, these mini bakes work fine for training.  My dog is now 5 months old and ~40 lbs. but he's still a puppy, and he can eat these quickly enough that they are a good training reward.  I still break them in half to make them smaller and make the box last longer.  They're scored across the middle so they break in half pretty easily.<br /><br />We've tried both the Turkey n' Taterz flavor and the Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz flavor.  He loves both.  He was a little hesitant to eat the biscuit the first time I offered it.  He sniffed, dropped it on the floor, and sniffed some more before eating it... after tasting it, he gobbled them readily, and continues to enjoy them.<br /><br />If you're wondering just how big these are... "mini" is correct.  They measure about 2cm long and 1cm wide, or about 7/8ths in. by 7/16ths in.  Small, but effective.  Recommended.

review/summary: Great Treats, Go a Long Way
review/text: Zuke's treats have been pleasing my pups for several years now.  I particularly like these Mini Bakes because they're a small, crunchy treat that can even be broken (easily) in half - - - perfect for training or just because.  So far I've only bought the Turkey n' Taterz flavor in this product, but Gnocchi (3 yr old Chinese Crested Powder Puff) and Peanut (2 1/2 yr old Yorkie/Bichon Frise) LOVE them!  As I mentioned, they can easily be broken in half which I think is good on two counts: 1) It makes them last longer, saving $$ and 2) It enables you to give your dog a tasty little treat while keeping calories in check.  I also like that they use healthier ingredients and are corn & wheat free since one of my boys has sensitivities to those *and* they're made in the USA.  Last, but certainly not least, I like that Zuke's give back, donating portion of annual profits the Dog and Cat Cancer Fund.  No, I do not work for the company!  I just like their products & so do my pets. :-)

review/text: We have two dogs who both love these. One of the dogs is new to our house, and we've used these to help crate train him (he gets one every time he goes into his crate). They're the perfect size for training, and I love that we're feeding our dogs something we can feel good about. I also love the price! We use jerky treats for potty training, but for everything else these are the best we've found by far.

review/text: After reading several satisfactory reviews on Amazon, I purchased the Zuke's Turkey and Taterz mini bakes.  My two dogs are not picky eaters and especially love turkey and potatoes.  My miniature poodle absolutely refused them.  My terrier took them in his mouth and immediately spit them out.  I have tried several times, but the result is the same.  Since the ingredients are all natural, I took a small nibble myself to see why.  They taste terrible and the texture is awful.  This was a waste of money.

review/text: I got 2 boxes of these because I have 3 dogs.  The 2 large dogs love these, but they really are just like giving them a crumb if they only get 1.  My small dog (Bichon) grudgingly accepts them, but she doesn't like that they are hard.  They get hard kibble for dinner, and she rarely turns down dinner.  So it has to be something about these treats.<br /><br />They don't have any odor.  They are easy to give to the dog.  I like Zuke's products because they are healthier and safer than most other brands.  One of my dogs has allergies to the grains so this is better for her than most treats are.<br /><br />I will keep looking for that perfect but elusive dog treat.

review/summary: the most "straightforward" of the Earl Grey K-Cup varieties
review/text: This is my favorite of the currently (1/2007) available K-Cup Earl Grey teas.  To calibrate this review to your tastes: (1) I like *tea*, plus this one flavoring, not herbs with a little bit of tea -- I'm even finicky about how much Bergamot gets put in.  (2) I prefer Twinings to Stash (in bags, not available in K-Cups) for that very reason.  Twinings is sightly less expensive than Gloria Jean's or Celestial Seasonings, and has the "cleanest" taste of the three.  If you like a "brighter" or more flowery taste, go for the Celestial Seasonings; or if you like a more "complex" or "spicy" taste, choose the Gloria Jean's.

review/summary: Week flavor and leaves tea "powder" in the cup.
review/text: I really enjoy tea, and especially Earl Grey. I do not drink coffee, soda or anything else other then tea and water. So I find myself drinking lots of tea.<br /><br />When I purchased my Keurig, I also bought a selection of teas from Celestial Seasonings, which included their Earl Grey and English Breakfast. After using them up, I decided to try the Earl Grey from Twinings for K-cups but was disappointed. The flavor was quite weak, not to say everyone likes a strong tea, but those who enjoy the sophisticated taste of Earl Grey, often like it to have a bolder taste then what this produced. Also it left a lot of unpleasant tea powder at the bottom of the tea cup which gave the cup of tea an unappealing appearance of being dirty.<br /><br />I would have just assumed that this was the best a Keurig maker could do to produce a cup of tea if I hadn't already had 2 boxes of Celestial Seasoning teas that produced stronger tea with no muddy appearance. I was quite surprised with this result because I ordered the Twinings tea with the assumption that it would be better then the Celestial Seasoning.<br /><br />Not my favorite K-cup tea for the Keurig.

review/text: Twinings Earl Grey is my favorite tea, and I drink it almost daily.  I've tried Bigelow, Harrods, etc. and I like Twinings best, either loose or in bags, so I know exactly what this tea is supposed to taste like.  I was a bit concerned that the K-cups would disappoint, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I tried the 3 smallest brew sizes before I found a trick that works for me.  I double-brew one K-cup on the smallest setting.  By this I mean that I run the water through 1 K-cup twice, both times on the smallest size which makes a large cup that for me is about the right strength and flavor.  When you factor in the convenience and speed of using the Keurig, this makes getting a good cup of tea a breeze.

review/summary: Great Earl Grey, Now Available for Your Keurig Brewer!
review/text: Earl Grey has been one of my favorite teas since the first time I tried it (roughly 2 years ago).  I like the taste of bergamot, though I can understand how some might find it strange or overpowering.  This product was, to me and contrary to the opinion of others, just right in terms of strength.  I always use the lowest water setting on my brewer and am able to clearly taste the tea with no trouble and without feeling as though it should be diluted.  Of course, I should clarify that I drink my tea like my coffee (that is black with no sugar).  As a result, the tea may be too dilute when mixed with milk, but I can't say I've tried it that way.  I also haven't found it to leave "tea dust" behind, like another reviewer claimed, but that could be due to luck on my part or bad luck on that person's.  If you're looking for a delicious earl grey tea for your Keurig brewer, look no further.

review/text: This tea tastes good, but it is very finely ground and some of that ends up in the cup.  I like to use the same tea k-cup 2-3 times to make iced tea and with Twinnigs it doesn't work because there is so little tea in the k-cup (I suppose that's why it is so finely ground - so they can use less) that it ends up too dilute.  With Timothy's Earl Grey, on the other hand, there is much more tea in the k-cup which allows for my reuse of 2-3 times and the grounds don't end up in the cup.  The taste is about the same except you get more for your money with Timothys.

He told me that Twinings Earl Grey K-cups were available, but I was worried the tea would taste just like it does when you try to make tea using a hotel room coffee maker--like really bad coffee.  So it was a great surprise to find that the Twinings K-cups were so delicious.  Using the K-cups is also a time-saver, obviously.  Only down side is the environmental impact of all those plastic cups.  I'm hoping they come up with a solution to that soon.

But I've been drinking Bigelow Green Tea that way for about a year and I wanted to revisit Earl Grey via a Keurig-clone machine I got for my birthday over the summer. After I went through a couple of "variety packs" I picked up an Ekobrew Refillable basket and started drinking expresso done that way for my morning coffee. I admit, using a Keurig machine is still a bit low tech compared to just asking for "Earl Grey, hot" in my best Patrick Stewart imitation (which isn't very good) but give Mr. Coffee 10-20 years and they'll come up with a voice-activated machine. After all, if I'd wanted to pay another c-note per month, the car I've been leasing since last year could have come with that technology.

review/summary: Earl Grey Hot Please!
review/text: Our entire family loves this tea!  Great value on the Subscribe and Save option.  Until very recently this tea wasn't available in any local stores and this was our only option.  It's still a better deal online.

review/summary: Tea Time
review/text: I have been a tea drinker all of my life. When I bought my Keurig coffee maker I was delighted to learn that I could make tea also. At the time I needed to drink only Decaf and after trying a few different brands which are hard to find I ordered Twinings Decaf tea and was so happy to taste such a good cup of tea. It tasted so similar to the regular Twinings tea that you wouldn't it was decaf. I am a satisfied customer

review/summary: Great tea for Keurig
review/text: I have always loved Twinings Earl Grey tea...usually loose or in teabags.  I was delighted to find it available in a Keurig pod and found it every bit as good as I had experienced in other modes.
