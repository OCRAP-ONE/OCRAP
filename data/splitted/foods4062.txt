review/summary: jablum dont buy it
review/text: My son had this Jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from Jamaica and paid a lot for it.  I have drunk blue mountain for years when I can but this was shocking.  It tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it.  It was definitely off.  He bought 5 bags and every one we tried was the same.  I would never buy another.  We had bought another brand in a tin from Jamaica which was fine.  I think this is a con.  You get all the rubbish about it being tested in Jamaica, well I dont know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee.  I just dont understand how people say its any good. Maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperor's new clothes.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, not all that exotic, though...
review/text: I love my coffee, and because of that, I have tried lots and lots of varieties although I began as a simple Folgers fantatic.  Jamaican Mountain Blue Coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the Food Network and the kitchens of the White House.<br /><br />I found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing, but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out.  To me, this tastes like Folgers at its best, but nothing more than that.  Great for everyday drinking, because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid "bite."  But still, after having tried Kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors, I found Blue Mountain kinda boring.<br /><br />I guess I disagree with experts, but hey, my coffee is important and taste is everything!  If you like exotic flavors, this isn't it.  But it you would like to have consistently smooth, rich, honest coffee, this is the one.

review/text: While in Jamaica, my wife and I drank Blue Mountain Coffer every day and loved it.  We even went on a bike tour of the Blue Mountains, and purchased some coffee.  It came in a plain clear plastic bag, and we could see the darkness of the roast.  We enjoyed that coffee.<br /><br />In Ocho Rios, we bought some bags of JABLUM.  You can't see the darkness of the roast, and all you can smell is the burlap bag.  When we opened it up, it was a very light roast, not much fragrance, and once brewed, the coffee tasted a lot like dirt.  We were very disappointed.

review/text: I ordered this for my husband for Valentine's Day.  The picture and description on Amazon's website made it appear to be a large, loaded gift basket.  This is so not the case!  One basket was used just to make it appear larger, there wasn't anything in it!  The other items were stacked around the edge of it and on the smaller basket on top.  The roses are small and cheap looking.  The candy, what there is of it, is not all that great and brands that I have never heard of!  The coffee packet made terrible coffee that I dumped out.  I would not recommend this gift basket and will never order from them again.  The basket was probably worth about  $19.95 at most.  Definitely a rip off!!

review/text: Twinings Blackcurrant Black Tea is one of the very few flavored teas that I like. Too many of these teas have a strong, artificial taste that spoils them for me. According to the label, the ingredients are "black tea, natural & artificial flavour, and blackcurrent pieces." To my senses, the aroma and taste are just fine, with little or no hint of any artificial ingredients.<br /><br />I've been drinking about two cups a day for about a year, and I still love the great aroma and slightly sweet taste of this tea. If you like flavored teas, this one is definitely worth trying.

review/text: Enstrem's Toffee is absolutely the best candy I have ever eaten.  When I was a kid living in Grand Junction, Colorado (the home also of Enstrem's) my parents used to get a box of this every year at Christmas.  Needless to say the box would not last very long.  This is thick, rich, and buttery toffee at its finest.  Whole almonds inside this delicious toffee make for the excellent crunch and the crushed almonds and milk chocolate on the top is beyond yummy!  After you eat this awesomeness, there is the crushed almonds, bits of the toffee and chocolate, at the bottom of the box.  You literally have to shake the box of these delicious crumbs in your mouth!  Enstrems has become world famous not only for their toffee but for their chocolate, hard candy, and so much other delicious candy.  They have shops in Colorado from Grand Junciton to Colorado Springs.  It is now easy to order Enstrem's off the internet and their website is outstanding!  I order at least a pound of this delicious toffee every Christmas and have to be careful not to order it every month of the year!  But, I just torture myself and wait to Christmas to order this.  I can't recommend this delicious candy enough!  5 stars and more!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DELICIOUSNESS!

I just had some on a piece of costco whole grain bread.  It is really like a dessert.  If you order direct from bariani it is only $15.  I just got 2 bottles of their green olive oil and the truffle yesterday.  It makes all other olive oils taste mediocre.  At least that is my opinion.  Or, you can order some olive oil from some winery in CA and pay $50-200 if that makes you think you are getting better oil.[...]  I give it as gifts.  And, I  detest people selling olive oil for $100 for a small bottle when you can buy the best for 1/4 that.

review/text: My dogs go nuts when they see the package..  They absolutely love these bones.  Both my dogs are large and the small/medium size is the perfect size for them.  The large size was too big.  One dog, an older dog, couldn't bite into it- it was just too large.  A good price and prompt delivery

review/summary: Great bones for sensitive tummies
review/text: My dog has a hx. of pancreatitis.  She cannot eat anything with a high fat content (i.e. pig ears).  Her stomach is also very senistive and a lot of other bones and dog chews give her terrible diarrhea.  The Chew-Lotta bones have been a God send for us.  She loves to chew and she gets one Chew-Lotta every week.  She tolerates them well and they usually last for 2-3 days.  This is the best dog treat I've found.

review/summary: Good for a large dog.
review/text: This was larger than I realized (my fault). I wish it was about half the size. This is more like a meal than a treat, at least for a mid to large sized dog. My lab went through hers within minutes, so it's not a long chew, just a very large treat. She loved it, but I won't buy it again only because I think it was just too much treat for her size (she's 80 lbs).

review/summary: Chew Lotta dog bones terrific
review/text: We have a chew fan, but so many are unsafe.  Used to buy Booda Velvets, until they "reformulated" them.  Used to take 3-4 DAYS for my pup to chew up one of them, now it's about 20 minutes, so haven't bought them since.  Tried Chew Lotta and she doesn't finish it at one sitting, which I really like, these are a LOT less pricey than the Booda ones.  My only gripe is I wish they had a "petite" size for small dogs, it'd be perfect for my small dog.  But try these, they last a long time and they are SAFE!!!

review/text: I received a sampler of Brooklyn Brewery's K-cup coffee and probably tried half of them within two days. I love the names of their flavors and I had no problem with any of the K-cups as some stated below. I found the flavors of the coffees to be light and mellow. I found it to be a good choice for a later morning and afternoon cup of joe. For my morning cup I am sticking with Revv.

review/text: I really like this coffee myself. I didn't get any issues with the actual cups and the flavor of the Maple Syrup one is awesome it actually really tastes like maple syrup. These are not overpriced either which is nice. I just sent a text to my mom recomending them as we are both coffee junkies. I also when reading through these reviews saw their responses to bad reviews and think it is great they are trying to address the issues they initially had with each of the customers who had an issue. Overall a good product for a very reasonable price.

review/summary: Horrible Coffee
review/text: I was very excited to try these K Cups with the great names and designs for the K cups because I have been to brooklyn many times. The coffee was so weak, I tried every flavor in the variety pack, they all taste very weak and similar. I tried them with milk as well as black and same result. The quality of the K cups is terrible, they have destroyed my B70 brewer one of the K cups lid came off and coffee is all over inside my brewer, I cannot clean it. So now everytime I brew coffee or tea, coffee grinds end up in my cup.<br /><br />So now I have to replace my brewer, all because the cute designs sucked me in to thinking this was going to be good coffee. Beware folks, the coffee is weak and the K cups are not like the regular K cups you can buy anywhere. They are not engineered the same, you will see when you brew your first cup. Hopefully you do not have the problems that I had and end up having to replace your Keurig brewer.

review/summary: Got the variety pack - even the DECAF is great!
review/text: Thought I'd try the "Brooklyn Beans Variety Pack K-Cups, 40-Count", and I'm really glad I did.  All of the blends/varieties included in this pack that I've tried so far have been really good - even the decaf (which in my experience tends to be both weak and bitter - but THIS version of decaf is actually really, really good!).<br /><br />Some of the blends ARE stronger than others, and it's kind of obvious which ones would be.  But overall, I haven't noticed any bitterness or burnt aftertaste (like you'd find from a certain major coffeehouse chain), and I haven't had ANY problems with the K-cups during brewing or whatever.<br /><br />I would not, however, suggest the "Maple" flavor (it seemed more a combo of hazelnut and caramel than maple), but then, I don't particularly like flavored coffees anyway.<br /><br />The rest of the non-flavored varieties are really good, not bitter, not burnt, don't taste like they've been swept up off the grinding room floor, don't smell like they've been left exposed to open air for a month, and have a great "mouth feel" (if you're a snob and try to care about such things).<br /><br />Did I mention that the decaf is actually good?  Yeah - it really is.

review/text: I am normally the last person in the world to willingly drink a cup of coffee, but I was at a friend's house and they made a cup of Vanilla Skyline and it smelled so good I shocked myself by asking for a cup.  Not only that, I drank it straight up!  No milk, no sugar, just the coffee as it came out of the machine!<br /><br />I am now pestering my husband to get one of the machines, but in the meantime I find myself carpooling with her and spending more time at her place than ever before.  I hope she will not be lonely once I finally get my husband to cave and get me a machine of my own.

review/text: Their Colombian is by far the BEST Colombian I have ever had, very complex in taste with sweet and nutty undertones.<br /><br />French Roast is usually not high on my list, but Brooklyn's is astounding! It doesn't display the bitterness that I usually find with other French Roasts, and makes an excellent dark roast after dinner coffee.<br /><br />In short, we're so fond of Brooklyn Bean coffees, all of them so far, that it really is a tough choice to shop for a single box of any one blend. This is why you should really try the variety packs! Keep up the great work, Brooklyn, I predict that this will soon be the #1 K-cup coffee on the planet!

review/summary: Cyclone and French Roast
review/text: Hi,<br /><br />I have only tried two flavors, so I can not speak about all their products, but this coffee is great. I have had my Keurig for over 2 years now and I have been using Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee, as well as the brands, with no problem. I am so glad someone has finally upped the cup amount to 40 per package, I would like even a little more. I like it even better that I can order it via Prime. Now I get more great coffee and Free Shipping. What could be better. The two flavors I like are darker roasts, so some may not like this type, but for those who love really dark roasted coffee, this is the way to go.<br /><br />Cyclone is a a very heavy roast, which is great for the monrning for me. I use it as a quick pick me up. I have never had any issue and they taste great. I got French Roast one time because the Cyclone was sold out. It was slightly less dark, but still dark enough for my tastes. I think I will get one order of the Variety Packs, when they are not sold out, next time. This way I can try them all and figure out if any of the others can match my current experiences.

review/summary: Finally "Pulled the Trigger"
review/text: I've been reading all the reviews on Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee for weeks now. I've read the horror stories about exploding K Cups and fouled Keurig Coffee Makers.  But I also read the quick responses from the Manufacturer and the mostly positive comments about the taste of the coffee. It looks like the problem with the K-cups has been corrected (though there may be a few older K-Cups still floating around). So, I finally decided to "pull the trigger" and try the Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee "Corner Donut Shop" K-Cups. I am happy to report my family and I love it.  Following the advice of a reviewer, we make sure we firmly close the lid on the Keurig machine to make certain the cup is punctured.  So far, no problems with the K-cups. As far as our family taste goes, this is good coffee.  It tastes different from the other coffee shop brands, but is an excellent, medium blend. The taste and the price make Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee a winner, in my opinion (and that of my wife and 2 sons).  I look forward to trying some of the other BBR blends and commend the company on its responsiveness to consumer concerns. Give it a try. Hopefully, you will like it as much as we do.<br />10/7/12 Have used most of a box of 40 K-cups, zero product failures!

review/text: Brooklyn Bean Roastery Blend K-Cups are great tasting coffee. I like the Breakfast blend flavor the best, it is light tasting and it surprised me how fast it wakes you up. The dark roasts Fudgeddaboutit and Cyclone have a stronger rich flavor. I think the donut shop and maple flavor is sweet flavored and light which is good in coffee. The Brooklyn Bridge is a good well balanced coffee. I think the Breakfast Blend flavor is the best flavor and it wakes you up quickly.

review/text: Been looking for a vanilla k-cup coffee for awhile now.  Have tried many of the French Vanilla k-cups out there but really enjoy a plain vanilla coffee.  The box arrived yesterday(8/25/2012) and so far I have not been able to stop drinking them.  The vanilla k-cups is a perfect blend of vanilla and a strong coffee.  I drink my coffee black and do not add any artificial flavorings to it.  I will be ordering another box or two as this box won't last.  Finally, a vanilla coffee that is strong as has a true vanilla taste.

review/summary: Best K-Cups I've ever had!
review/text: I happened upon this brand of K-cups on another website that offers weekly specials in different categories.  Wanting to get out of my usual 2 flavors of K-cups that I always drink, I thought I'd give this company a go.  So, I tried their Corner Donut Shop and Vanilla Skyline varieties.  The Corner Donut Shop coffee blew me away!  I love another brand's donut shop k-cups, but this one just has a better flavor.  My sister raves about the Vanilla Skyline.  Not being much of a flavored coffee person, I wasn't as crazy about it.  But, rest assured, my sister loves flavored coffees, and she went wild over it.  This time, I'm getting more of the Corner Donut Shop stuff, and I'm trying the Brooklyn Bridge type too.  I look forward to getting it!

review/summary: Great coffee, great price
review/text: I was a bit skeptical at getting another brand than Green Mountain brands, since Grove Square and San Fran Bay were really bad. Besides the original problem they had with the production on their first boxes, Brooklyn Beans have been a great new find for us. I could go through each blend, but they are all similar to other GMCR brands. The k cups seem a little lighter in weight and the lighter roasts  did seem watery for the travel cup size, but that is about the norm with all k cups. The best thing I really like is the company actually responds and fixes any problems. So, stop complaining about the shipping when you are leaving feedback on the product! (I always get my shipments at least 2 days ahead of scheduled date.) So, don't be afraid to try these and save money. Subscribe and save another 5%.

review/summary: OK Hazelnut
review/text: Brooklyn Bean's hazelnut has a strong aroma, but it's a little weak on our Keurig's high setting.  I'd rate it slightly above Gloria Jean's, but it's not, alas, as strong as the Green Mountain or Timothy's hazelnuts I've had, and is nowhere close to Van Houtte, who I think makes the best hazelnut k-cup.  On the other hand, the BB's are (currently) cheaper than the afore-mentioned.  On the other foot, though, k-cups costing more than $.050/ea just aren't worth it IMHO unless you only drink a single cup a day or never leave the house - it's Wawa city around here and their hazelnut is VERY good, and cheaper per quart.<br /><br />It's too bad, 'cause I like the Brooklyn Bean coffees we've had - Colombian, Donut Shop, and Boardwalk Blend - decent medium blends.  I've never had the exploding pod problem some people speak of.  I'd like to support the company, but economic pressures are pushing the Keurig off our kitchen counter generally!

review/text: Working long hours is made much more enjoyable with this tasty coffee from BK. I am a big fan of the Brooklyn Bridge Blend. It's a great medium roast. Not too strong like some of the dark roasts people like but still has a nice full body. If you're tired of so-so coffee from your Keurig, look no further. Get the real stuff from these guys.

review/summary: Finding Your Roast is the Ticket to Bliss
review/text: When I first bought my Keurig, it came with a box of assorted K-cups from some more established coffee companies, and I worked my way through the donut blends, the dark, light, and medium roasts, and the decafs.  It came to the point where I was looking forward to finishing off the box because I hadn't found any K-cups that I loved.<br /><br />I bought Brooklyn Beans on the recommendation of a friend, and I felt that I had hit coffee Nirvana.  I first bought a full box of the Cyclone dark roast, which was the perfect dark roast for me--dark, but not over-roasted, and very rich.  I bought the variety pack so I could try all the varieties.  I'm still working my way through each type of coffee included in the variety pack, and I have a strong preference for a darker roast, but every cup has been smooth and flavorful.  The light roasts are not overly acidic or tannic.  In addition to the Cyclone, I will definitely be a repeat customer for the Fuhgeddaboutit dark roast, and the Maple Sleigh is my pick for best flavored coffee.<br /><br />There have been absolutely no problems with brewing this coffee.  I have gone through a whole 40-count box of Cyclone without any issues with grounds in the cup or problems with the way the cup works in the Keurig.  I've found the taste to be consistent, cup after cup.<br /><br />As an enthusiastic (and picky!) coffee drinker, I say Brooklyn Beans Roastery earns its five stars.

review/summary: A great way to sample new K-cups - "Brooklyn Beans"
review/text: This is the first time I've tried Brooklyn Beans and so far the selection has been great.  It's also cheaper than most other K-cups.  "Cyclone" is an excellent dark roast and i found it to be more full-bodied than "Fuhgeddaboutit".  I'm not a big fan of flavored K-cups, but "maple sleigh" wasn't bad.  "Breakfast Blend" is a good light roast.  However, I personally dont get "Breakfast Decaf" - if it's my first cup of the morning, I want it to wake me up!  Overall, it offered great variety and allowed me to sample most, if not all, of the Brooklyn Beans K-cups.  I would recommend this.

review/summary: The BEST coffee you'll ever brew in your K-Cup brewer, hands down!
review/text: I was pleased to win a sampler box of Brooklyn Bean Roastery's eight most popular varieties (2 of each) in a contest promotion, and I can't say enough wonderful things about this ambitious new company's offerings.  The quality of the coffee is top notch, and the blend variety is mesmerizing.  It's SO good, in fact, that it's really hard to pick favorites, which is why I think that the most brilliant thing Brooklyn Bean did, is offer a VARIETY PACK!  After all, not every one wants the same exact coffee, cup after cup.  Variety is what makes life interesting, does it not?<br /><br />Brooklyn Bridge Blend was the first one I tried, and my personal favorite.  It's a delightful medium roast that delights any time of day or evening, with just the right balance of body and flavor.  If I had to choose one coffee to drink for the rest of my life, THIS would be the one.<br /><br />Breakfast Blend paled in comparison, being a light roasted coffee, but was not a standout for me.  My wife thought it was stellar, and she usually prefers dark, strong roasts.<br /><br />Their Colombian is by far the BEST Colombian I have ever had, very complex in taste with sweet and nutty undertones.  Start your day with this, and you'll have a happy day.<br /><br />French Roast is usually not high on my list, but Brooklyn's is astounding!  It doesn't display the bitterness that I usually find with other French Roasts, and makes an excellent dark roast after dinner coffee.<br /><br />Boardwalk Blend is a medium roast, extra bold, that is best made in a larger size cup, 10 or 12 oz, and is also excellent over ice!  It won't knock you out, because it's not overwhelming in any one character, but it's a pleasant, drinkable blend.<br /><br />Corner Donut Shop is unique, in that it's not like any other company's "donut shop" blends for the Keurig type machines.  The flavor is a bit more subtle, and compliments pastries, pies, donuts (of course) any time of day.  This is a relaxing coffee, not one to shake you up, which is a good thing sometimes.  Think of it as the "comfort food" of coffees.  Medium roast, extra bold, make this in a larger size cup, also.<br /><br />Cyclone, named for the iconic Coney Island rollercoaster, is a kick in the pants coffee.  Strong, bold, daring and a thrill-ride of complex, intense flavors, circling your palette, with each sip being a new thrill ride.  Yes, you'll want to ride again!  My wife has called this the "Guinness of coffees", with chocolaty undertones and full-bodied texture.  Definitely make this in a larger cup, being both a dark roast and an extra bold cup.<br /><br />A Brooklyn uniqueness, Fuhgeddaboudit, is another dark roast extra bold blend that leaves no doubt in your mind that you're drinking a cup of COFFEE!  This will wake you up out of a coma, folks!  Only in New York could they possibly come up with something this brash, cosmopolitan and interesting.<br /><br />In short, we're so fond of Brooklyn Bean coffees, all of them so far, that it really is a tough choice to shop for a single box of any one blend.  This is why you should really try the variety packs!  Keep up the great work, Brooklyn, I predict that this will soon be the #1 K-cup coffee on the planet!

review/text: I received my order of 40 of the Brooklyn Beans Brooklyn Bridge K-cups yesterday, and we first tried them this morning. I don't care for the flavor, and I'm not sure what to compare it to except it has a bit of a "cardboard" taste, I think. It certainly does not care to Green Mountain's Nantucket, in my estimation. In addition, two of the 4 k-cups we used today did not give a steady stream of coffee, but squirted out in an erratic manner. I am disappointed.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY!!
review/text: If you want coffee grounds floating in every cup of coffee, and K-cups that explode open in your Keurig, then this product is for you. I have used about a dozen of these K-cups so far, and about half have come open inside my Keurig, with the top foil seal coming off and the water and grounds going everywhere. The other half stayed sealed, but I still get a lot of coffee grounds floating in my coffee.The inner constuction and filter must be defective as well. The manufacture of these K-cups is somehow inferior to Green Mountain and others. The taste of the coffee is irrelevant when the K-cups don't work. I have used many other different K-cups, Tully's, Donut Shop, Emeril's, Starbucks, Green Mountain,Timothy's, Caribou, etc. and never had any problems. I should have heeded the other reviews that stated the same problems, and not believed the company's claim that these problems were resolved. I now have a partial box of unusable K-cups.

review/summary: Exploding K-Cup
review/text: First off - disappointed with the false "Prime Shipping". I ordered this on 8/9 thinking I would get it before my vacation on 8/12. It came on 8/13 after I was already gone - if that was the case I would have ordered it when I returned.<br /><br />So I tried this product, despite the reviews and it exploded for me also. I used Cyclone first - it started coming out fine then began to squirt all over. When the K-Cup exploded, the foil opened on the side of the cup. What I noticed when I opened the box was that the foil that seals the K-Cups were not properly attached to them. They did not go all the way to the ends of the cups (like all the other brands I compared them too). Also, they were not sealed tight with the bubble on the top (like the other brands I have) which tells me they are not sealed properly.<br />I am disappointed. The taste is OK (that's the 2 stars) but the poor design is frustrating and messy. POOR DESIGN!<br />I will not order these again. I am not even sure I will use what I have or if I will attempt to return them.

review/summary: Boardwalk Blend - Unimpressive
review/text: I purchased the Boardwalk Blend because it was described as being a flavor match with Newman's Own (which I like very much). It wasn't a match. It didn't have much taste and had no aroma at all. Its taste most resembled the flat-tasting stuff that came out of my pot-and-filter coffee maker, and that's what I was trying to get away from with the K-cup machine.<br /><br />Immediately after I tasted this coffee, I made a cup of Newman's Own to be sure I wasn't being too critical. I was not. It's definitely not a flavor match.<br /><br />I am all for as much competition in the K-cup market as possible (so their prices might finally come down). But Brooklyn Beans is going to have to try harder if it wants to stay in that competition.

review/text: Over the last year we've tried to up our "coffee cred" at work. I purchased an Aeropress here on Amazon and we've been making amazing coffee ever since. The problem is it takes a little bit of time and some mornings you are running late for meetings and need something fast. We've started experimenting with Kcups for those quite pick-me-ups. I've tried almost every brand and flavor so far and Brooklyn is by far one of the worst! Terrible quality and taste. Flat and bland coffee. Don't waste your time.

review/text: Don't believe the hype about this coffee being strong and flavorfull. I was looking for new options besides Jetfuel, Emeril's Big and Bold, and Donut House, and thought BB would be the one, based on the reviews. I'm not sure what coffee they got, but the Fuggedaboutit and Cyclone are both really weak and without much flavor. I even tried the smallest size setting, thinking it might make the coffee more concentrated, but it was still weak and dissapointing. I can't speak for the other coffee, but Fuggedaboudit and Cyclone were a waste of my money. I have a machine at home and at work, so I will just take them to work as an option for people who like weaker coffees.
