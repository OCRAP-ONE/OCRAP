review/summary: Our 8 month old loves them
review/text: Our son has been enjoying these meals since he was 7-8 months old and still does at nearly 10 months old. We love that they are organic, easy and quick to warm and great for quick meals or on the go while traveling.  The variety is good and we tend to mix in other cooked veggies, oatmeal or whatever is on hand to enhance the nutrition and texture. I know these are for toddlers, but they work great for younger babies who are ready for more textured meals also (the texture of these meals is quite mushy/easy to gum).

review/summary: This Is What Gives Grits A Bad Rap...
review/text: I was hoping I found a source for "real" grits.  I was tipped off that this wasn't the real deal when the label said something about "mush".  It fits the definition of mush i.e. soft or soggy mass.<br /><br />I have been searching for real grits since my supplier retired.  He refurbished an old grist mill as a hobby then decided to use the plentiful local corn to mill grits.  They were fabulous, the real kind that you had to add water, let the hulls float to the top, pour off the water, add more water, then cook for 45 minutes.  Lots of butter, salt, and pepper and there's nothing better.

review/text: Vegan. Natural. Big beautiful butter beans. Nice texture and flavor. Great for pasta with your favorite tomato veggie sauce. Butter beans also make a great topping on vegan (cheese-less) pizzas. I like them as a combo with spinach for pizza. Can also be used to make hearty butter bean burritos with salsa. Approx 627 calories and 45g protein per 14.28 oz/400g can. Case of 24 cans. Made with butter beans, water, salt. Product of Italy. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.

review/summary: Butter Beans from Italy
review/text: The beans are special, couldn't find the same type of bean domestically,the taste is good. Unfortunately many of the cans are crushed in the shipping, and I guess the the crushed cans were crushed in transit from Italy, rather than the cans from Amazon to us.<br />The result of crushed cans is that the skin of the beans in the cans are separated from the bean. This is cosmetic, but if the beans are served just heated, it looks terrible. The importer needs to do a better job on packing and shipping to the states.

review/text: From Italy, low sodium (the entire can has about 250 grams of sodium). They are plump and tasty, great to mix with rice, to add to soups and chili, etc.,  or to just eat plain. The flavor is very mild, similar to cannellini beans.  Not like lima beans (don't like those). Unlike someone else's complaint, the cans were not dented when I got them.  All arrived in good condition.  Great deal, saved even more $$$ by using Subscribe and Save.

review/summary: Great Item, Fast Shipping
review/text: I am currently overseas so just finding people who ship here can sometimes be a task. I purchased this through "Choo Choo R Snacks" and the item arrived very fast - in less than a week. They also shipped the item in a very sturdy box so everything was in good shape when it arrived.<br /><br />The jerky comes in a re-usable cooler of decent construction. The jerky is great and completely what I expected after previously having it on several occasions in the US.<br /><br />Everything is what I expected which gives it a solid four stars, what set it apart in my book is the multiple free samples that I received along with what I ordered. A beach ball also came as a freebie!<br /><br />Five Stars.

review/text: The quality of this gum has taken a major dive. It used to be more substantial, and it had a very prominent cinnamon flavor, which outlasted one's ability to keep chewing. It used to be great. Now, the flavor is almost straight sugar, and the taste is gone in a very SHORT time. I would much rather see a legit price hike due to inflation than a sharp decline in quality!

review/summary: Contains Chemical Sweeteners
review/text: Yes, ALL Wrigley's Gums, even the ones with SUGAR, now contain at least ONE, (and many contain two or all of them) ASPARTAME, ACESULFAME-K, SUCRALOSE!<br /><br />WHY a gum with Sugar needs these dangerous chemical sweeteners is a mystery to me, but since they changed the logo of the packages on their gum, you can no longer buy any Wrigley's (or most other brands too) gum without one or more of these nasty chemical additives.<br /><br />Also note that Sucralose (AKA brand name Splenda) is NOT the same thing as Sucrose! (Sugar)  The slight spelling difference is to decieve those that read ingredient labels to think they are reading Sucrose and not notice it is Sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose causes severe abdominal pain, so if you have had that after chewing gum, now you know why.<br /><br />Aspartame has dozens of books and thousands of websites explaining what is wrong with that, as well as the other one.<br /><br />Very sad that I never again will get to enjoy my childhood favorites of Wrigley's Spearmint, Juicy Fruit or Big Red ever again.

review/summary: Bull Dog sauce
review/text: I first tasted Bull Dog over 20 years ago, at a Japanese restaurant in Northern NH....I tried it on Kushi-Katu (a chicken appetizer) and on my fried rice. Wasn't all that crazy about it in the beginning, but that soon changed. It's wonderful as a marinade on chicken, beef or pork. I've also used some in my meatloaf, and I'll bet it'd be quite tasty on grilled burgers.<br />Love the opportunity to buy this in quantity. The only place we can find it is up in northern NH & it's a long ride for Bull Dog. Makes our lives much better to be able to buy this through Amazon, that's for sure!<br /><br />If you haven't tried it, go for it! Enjoy!

review/text: I really like this pasta, but if soft and starchy bother you, this may not be the right kind for you.  My son is aware of any texture changes, and coming from whole wheat pasta, there is definitely a difference.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars b/c the cooking time on the box is off.  If cooked according to the package, the noodles are crunchy.  They also have a tendancy to over boil, and this is with the heat turned down after initial boil.  So don't leave them unattended! :)

review/summary: The best chocolate milk, bar none
review/text: Better than milk with Trader Joe's Midnight Moo syrup.<br />Better than Hershey's syrup.<br />Way better than Quik.<br />WAY better than Ovaltine, which should be drunk only by starving children in third-world countries and by people who like Vegemite.<br /><br />This is the real deal.  I have been drinking chocolate malt for over 40 years. First Horlicks, then when they stopped making it, the Carnation here.  It's hard to find in stores, and we had been ordering in flats of 12.  I am thrilled to find it in 3-packs on Amazon, and with FREE PRIME SHIPPING!<br /><br />Great with plain skim milk, and if you add a little vanilla ice cream, it's SINFULLY good.<br /><br />First-timers may want to note that this powder dissolves easily in milk, just stirring with a spoon.  No machines, no fuss.

review/summary: Good for Baking Too
review/text: I have to watch my calories and when I want a treat this is usually it. I don't feel bad having it because I add it to skim milk it's a more healthy snack than chips or cookies. One serving is pretty satisfying when I'm craving something sweet and chocolately.<br /><br />I sometimes add this to my chocolate chip cookie recipe. I just add and keep tasting little bits of the dough until I think it's "right". It does tend to make the cookies slightly more crispy than if I didn't use it but they taste really yummy. I've also made coconut cookies and added this. My kids thought they were great but I found them a bit sweet. Next time I'll try cutting the sugar a little and see if that doesn't do the trick.<br /><br />I'm currently working on using it for a coffe cake sort of recipe but so far my attempts have been not as good as I'd like.....cakes are just more tempermental than cookies and since we don't eat a lot of sweets it'll probably take awhile before I get it right.<br /><br />I think this is good heated too and adding it to fat free half and half makes a tastey coffee creamer.<br /><br />This is something I've used for years and will be in my pantry for as long as they keep making it.

When I saw this product for sale I gave it a try. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I thought it could be a little "maltier", but it's still pretty good. In fact after I orderd the first three jars and used them up quickly, I ordered another three jars.

review/summary: Awesome stuff, way better than chocolate syrup
review/text: Mix some with a tall glass of milk and enjoy. The Carnation chocolate malted milk is absolutely delicious. I've tried other powders, other brands and other flavors, but I keep coming back to this one, my all time favorite. My local grocery store stopped carrying it for some reason, so now I get it here on Amazon. If you drink milk every day like I do, then get this!

review/text: I could not find the Carnation malted milk anywhere in the stores.  I used to be<br />able to find it at Wal Mart in Oberlin but then I moved and none of the other stores<br />carried it.  So I emailed Carnation but before they got back to me I found it at<br />Amazon.  Much to my dismay it is in the Wal Mart and Giant Eagle now where I live.<br />So my four pack will last a long while!  Milk shakes are OK but malts are simply<br />out of this world.

review/text: The formulation for the original version has no sugar, but sugar is the first ingredient in the chocolate version, making it more like Nestles Quick.  So I am using it in place of NQ.  Why can't they just add chocolate to the original version so that sugar is not the first ingredient?  Still very good for Mochas though.

review/text: I was disappointed that the on-line advertisement did not indicate what the packaging does. I.e. this product is to tell you that you have a moth problem, does not and is not intended to eliminate moths. To me if you are ordering the product you already know you have a moth problem. I think the product could be useful to know if your moth problem returns after treatment, but after washing tons of loads of laundry and removing the cloths from the house altogether, I am going to be very certain to treat sufficiently that I don't have a re-occurrence. I am happy being green when possible and have pets, but I don't want to waste huge amounts of water and energy rewashing cloths. It does attract moths - that is the only reason for two stars and not one - my issue is the incorrect advertizing.

review/summary: Clothes Moths
review/text: Please see my extended (with video) review of the Pro-Pest product.<br /><br />I keep and use industrial felt which is 50/50 wool/synthetic material. No bug problem in the first 2 years I have started using it. In the last two weeks, I start to see moths flying around the felt. Oh, oh, trouble, trouble. Googledee peck, peckity google.<br />Identify malefactors. It's not so easy catching the little buggers on the fly so I bought both the Propest and the Safer sticky catchers. $40 worth from Amazon.<br />It appears I have plain Clothes Moths. Light brown wings, less than 1/2" long. No mottling on wings.<br />Both moth catchers I received, are triangular open cardboard tubes with the sticky lining inside and their own little tiny strip of bug alluring super secret squirrel perfume inside. Did taxpayer money fund the research for this secret stuff? We want to know.<br />Neither brand captures all flying moths like a magnet as at least one reviewer has stated. In fact, if you snore through the lit, only male moths are snagged. Mommy moths are laying eggs all over the place. Yeaah, Grrrrrh.<br />You don't have to be a brain surgeon to notice that moths fly like drunken sailors. Amazingly, in the course of a week, two Propest tubes each caught a dozen moths. Two Safer tubes were almost useless. One caught 2 moths and the other caught none. I moved all of them around a little every day. The Propest tubes are twice as big as the Safer ones and I think this is a factor.<br />I, as a senior citizen, am on board to try to do the Green thing as much as possible. Clearly however , once moths are flying all over your house, you are not going to get rid of all traces and iterations of them with any shade of Green song and dance, pyramids, good vibrations, force of argument and certainly not the inevitable cursing. Very much alive female moths, now bigger, flew around my face annoying me and raising my blood pressure to dangerous levels.<br />Killing all the boy moths is productive and fine with me but leaves, presumably, an equal number of maybe pregnant and/or very horny mommy moths. Hmmm, maybe a plot for a Japanese horror flick.<br />The last time I had moths, 15 years ago, long and short, I used pesticides to finally rid myself of these pests. I cannot tolerate these pests, and now, regrettably, for practical reasons, I have decided to take the advice of my wool felt supplier: Raid Max Deep Penetrating Fogger. Stay tuned.

review/summary: Service to receipt
review/text: I believe these thing work, however only the male moths.  (so no reproduction)  The story to getting them is a pain...  I purchased them, they were sent, and I never got them UPS.  I contacted the seller and told him not to worry about sending them since it was a week and although I paid for expedited shipment, I still didn't have them.  He sent me the tracking # and told me UPS tried to deliver but I had "moved".  So I contacted UPS and gave them a piece of my mind.  He and I have still been in contact regarding receipt of them and he has ever offered to reimburse me the shipping, which I believe is UPS's responsibility.  He was a very professional and good person to deal with.  UPS, on the other hand, even sent me a postcard to the address of which they "tried" but discovered I'd "moved".  I've lived at the same place for 7 years and receive UPS / Amazon / missc shipments once a week at least.  Eric is a good business man and someone that if there were no product he'd sell, you'd still do business with him for his ethics.  GREAT company experience, HORRIBLE UPS experience.

review/summary: Works as advertised, isn't going to solve your moth problem on its own
review/text: I imagine the people giving this product low ratings either a. don't have clothes moths and expect it to catch all kinds of moths, b. didn't actually put the pheromone in the trap (you have to open the package and drop it in that hole in the top), or c. didn't read the package to see this only traps the MALE clothes moths and does not kill the larva which is what actually eats your clothes.<br /><br />First off, the type of moths that eat your clothes are very very small and very very fast. They also hate light so they are very hard to just spot. Most of the times I've seen them have been when I was watching TV in the dark and one fluttered by the front of the TV or I've found them hiding in cracks in my closet.<br /><br />I had a serious moth infestation in my clothes. I sorta ignored it until they ate about 10 of my sweaters. They were literally in shreds. When I threw all the wool clothes away they started eating the cotton stuff as well (although not as successfully) so I decided to get these traps because I didn't want to use poisons or whatever. They did a good job of trapping a lot of moths but like the packaging says, these basically will ALERT you that you have a problem they aren't going to totally solve it.<br /><br />Eventually I threw away a lot of old clothes and then washed everything else all at once and put anything wool into plastic bags. The moths WILL attempt to eat your cotton stuff but they don't tend to be as destructive to it (you'll see the cocoons on the clothes but they won't be all full of holes like the wool stuff) Vacumming in your closets will also help get rid of them. I then put cedar chips in my closet. Not quite sure how useful that is but I have definitely slowed them down and haven't seen any more destruction since.<br /><br />I uploaded a photo of one of my traps that caught about 20 moths to prove these do work. Just realize to get rid of your problem you're going to have to do more than just get these traps.

review/text: These moth traps really work.  I had a serious infestation of clothes moths in my apartment when I took my grandmother wool coat out of my closet and released a bunch of moths accidentally.  These few moths bred and then I had a moth problem. I didn't think I could get rid of them.  You have to give the product some time to work.  I set out 7 traps in my apartment.  I saw moths being caught little by little over a period of a few weeks.  I probably caught 60+ moths in these traps.  I think I finally have my apartment back under control with the help of these traps and extensive vacuuming and cleaning.

review/text: I bought both Safer and Pro-pest brands of moth traps for closet moths. Both are basically flypaper with a pheromone purported to attract male moths. I installed Safer moth traps in one closet and Pro-pest in a different closet. After 24 hours the Safer trap had caught NO moths while the Pro-pest trap had caught 12 moths. To make sure this was not due to location I switched the traps between closets. Again after 24 hours the Safer trap had caught NO moths while the Pro-pest trap had caught about 10 moths. It has now been a month and the Safer trap has still caught ZERO moths. I also have regular flypaper in both closets, which also catches moths in both closets. So to sum up ...... Don't buy the Safer traps.

review/summary: moth myths
review/text: These traps are part of a program of integrated pest managemnt...ipm.  They are doused with pheromones from female moths so that they attract male moths and break the breeding cycle.  They work extremely well on that part of the process.  In fact, the minute you open the little package with the trap male moths start fluttering at you like drunken frat boys!  The second part of the program involves repelling the moths from their furry dinners.  Lavender, bay and cedar in a closet help.  Bagging sweaters over the summer will also help.  Being green really is not easy.  It takes extra steps and some research.  This is the way natures works.  We have killed off whatever the predator was for the moths so now we have to figure out how we can manipulate the cycle.  If you think about it, however, the moths are actually kind of a good thing.  If it weren't for these hair/fur eating creatures the earth would be a giant hair ball hanging in space.  Now if safer would only make traps for those annoying people who drive thru my neighborhood with blasting stereos I would be a happy woman!

review/text: These do a great job of catching moths in my closet, but you have to assemble them properly. The traps come with little lure tabs -- when you're ready to place the trap, open a lure envelope and find the small lure square inside. Stick the lure square to the adhesive inside the trap. It's the lure that the moths find irresistible, and then they get stuck to the adhesive. My traps generally get full in about 2 months, and then I have to replace them.

review/summary: These really work!
review/text: I've had a really bad clothes moth infestation for over a year now. I have these little traps all over the house and they are all almost full. One way that I've been more successful with them lately is instead of folding the traps up in a little triangle like they're shown, I've been laying them flat under things. I discovered our infestation was the worst on my wool rug, right where the coffee table is over it (only about 1" apart). The larve were hanging from the bottom of the coffe table, which is so low that I couldn't see them. I opened a bunch of these traps up, slid them under the coffee table & the problem has almost disappeared. Each time I take them out to check, they're filled with not only the moths, but also the larvae (the real problem). As soon as they come out, they're trapped... this seems to be the key for us. Hope this helps someone!

review/summary: Safer versus Pro-Pest
review/text: Both this product and Pro-Pest Clothes Moth Ready-To-Use Traps appear to be somewhat effective.  Two traps, one of each brand, were placed in two different closets (a total of four traps) over a three-month period with an insignificant  difference between the two brands in the number of moths caught, eight for Pro-Pest and seven for Safer. Given the small number of individuals trapped, I've extended the experiment for another three months with four new traps, but at this point, Safer appears to be the better buy, costing roughly half of Pro-Pest at the time of this writing.<br /><br /> The low morals of female clothes moths (they are polyandrous!) and the fact that the attractant is the female pheromone means the traps will mostly collect adult males.  So, a few clever randy males can keep the population going. Although neither product is apt to eliminate all the clothes moths in your closets, they do seem to reduce the overall number.  If you have a sufficiently large freezer, placing your woolens in them for a week, combined with the traps, can be quite helpful.<br /><br />UPDATE: After another three months, using the same protocol and a total of eight traps, Safer appears to be the better choice, both by effectiveness and price.  The total number of moths trapped by brand were:<br />Safer -- 16<br />Pro-Pest -- 10

review/summary: If used properly, Safer Brand effectively controls moths
review/text: Not too long ago, our daughter arrived at our house after a year away from home with bags full of clothes that were full of moths. To this day, she rejects that notion that she brought such a scourge to our family home, but the facts speak for themselves. The day before our daughter arrived home, there was not a moth to be found. The day after she landed and unceremoniously dumped her bags in the front hall closet, I opened the door to that same closet and turned on the light only to be met by the frantic flutterings of a newly arrived population of moths that were scurrying as quickly as their little dusty wings could take them into the dark corners, away from my dropped jaw and curses. I took action immediately. First, I closed the door, hoping for containment. Second, I gently scolded my daughter with the reminder that, unlike her, we actually enjoyed the pleasure of a clean, vermin-free home. Third, I went online to check out the relative safety of the more toxic insecticides such as "moth crystals" that kill everything--adults, larva, and eggs. Fourth, I decided that I could not seal the hall closet tightly enough to prevent toxic fumes of the conventional insecticides from entering our living space; Fifth, I searched for safer alternatives and found...you guessed it...Safer Brand 7270 Clothes Moth Alert Trap. I read the mixed reviews for Safer Brand. Many were promising, but some were halfhearted. Having wrestled with all manner of crawling interlopers in my home (lice, fleas, etc.), I concluded that the less enthusiastic reviews were most likely a result of user error or, at the very least, the purchaser's own lack of diligence in follow through after correctly applying the product. I, on the other hand, am one of those classic obsessive compulsive types who takes on a challenge like this with the determination of a marathon runner (make that "triathlete"). My husband would smirk at such an analogy since the only experience I have that even approximates exercise is the vigorous typing I do on my computer; but, hey, one finds analogies where one can, right? So, on with the story. After reading the instructions and carefully positioning about three traps in every closet of my home, I also followed up with a thorough vacuuming of each closet and put the more seductive wool/silk items into thick, black, plastic bags (the kind you get at the hardware store that are usually called "Contractor's Bags"). I also installed a third tier of defense by placing a few bowls of cedar balls in each closet. Finally, I left one small wool scrap hanging in each closet to lure the moths. I am nothing if not devious. Then, I waited. In fact, I was gone for several weeks on vacation, and when I returned, much moth activity had occurred. The verdict? The traps worked wonderfully when combined with my other "moth attack" measures. The corpses of dead, desiccated moths littered the traps. There were no holes or visible eggs on the wool "lure," but I disposed of those scraps just to be safe. Then, I continued to search for moths in the less accessible parts of the closet--higher up on the walls, in the seams between carpet and baseboard, and in all the ceiling corners. I found no moth activity. I replaced the first batch of traps with a second round after a few months, and I continue to have zero moths to this day. End of story.

review/text: These are totally worthless.  After two weeks, I saw no moths in the traps, but plenty flying around.  I got another brand of traps and within a week, I had about 27 moths captured on them, but the SaferBrand was still mothless.  It's now been three months, and the other traps are totally covered in moths, but the SaferBrand still have caught no moths: only a couple of gnats on them. The other traps were cheaper and work much better.  Don't waste your money on these!

review/summary: Slow but effective
review/text: Clothing moths are almost impossible to get rid of. We bought an antique rug and it was infested, unbeknownst to us. Without noticing, the moths infested our house and sweater drawers!!! Horrible!! I called "bug companies", but I had more knowledge than the guys who wanted to come out here and SPRAY for them. I didn't want the chemicals in my house AND spraying is ineffective per what I had read on the internet.<br /><br />The Safer (good name) hormone tents did the trick. However, as it says, it lures the guys into the sticky trap. The females are left in the cold (ha!) and die without making eggs. It's the eggs in the sweaters that turn to larvae; the larvae eat the clothes. Not the moths. The larvae eat the clothes.<br /><br />In order to eradicate the moths, you need to continue to use the tents (I am on my fourth round) over a long period of time to make sure you catch all the males. My tents are out for three months, then I buy new ones and repeat. My last round had NO MOTHS CAUGHT. I'm still going to do it one more time.<br /><br />During the process you know where the moths tend to be more prevalent by the number caught in each trap. So I put more there, for instance, under the chairs in the living room, etc. Also, don't scrimp on your first purchase!!! You need a ton of them to figure out where the problem is. Do it right (lots) or you won't have a blueprint of where to put the next batch and you might be missing a room that is where the most are. etc etc etc.<br /><br />Yes, it's an investment, but it works. And much cheaper than the 20 cashmere sweaters that were wrecked because of the holes. &lt;sigh> And cheaper than the useless companies who want to spray for the moths. And just so you know... the moths don't "just go away."  They get worse which I learned the hard way.

review/text: I bought a box of these to take care of a clothes moth problem we had. The moths were the small clothes moths that this trap was supposed to attract. The only moths that were caught in this trap over 30 days were ones that landed elsewhere, and we manually put the trap over the moth so it had no choice but to fly through the trap. Even then, it took a couple of tries to get them to stick inside. Our cat killed 4 moths (that we know of) in the same period. Save your money and buy a cat instead.

review/text: We've used the "Safer" Moth Traps over a few years and consistently find that they attract and fill up with a noticeable number of adult moths. The aromatic lure is advertised as lasting 12 weeks. I believe the larval moths do the damage but our hope is that we reduce those numbers by trapping the adults before eggs are hatched. The product seems worth the price and effort.

review/summary: Absolutely does not work
review/text: I read the reviews and ordered five of these.  I had just moved the contents of a storage unit--furniture but very few clothes--into my home and started seeing the moths appear daily.  I did the research and determined that these were closet moths and not pantry moths (the culprit had been a wool rug that was in the storage unit).  I had the five traps overnighted for an extra $17.  I followed the directions and put them out.  Two days later the traps were as pristine as the day they arrived--not a moth anywhere inside.  Instead they were still fluttering through the air and lighting on the ceilings and walls.  I called an exterminator.  He came out and placed a couple of Russell XLURE - R.T.U. traps in the kitchen and den.  The first day there were five captured in one and three in the other.  As of today, they have been in place for 13 days and and there are at least 15 moths captured in each.  The Safer traps are still hanging and are still as clean as the day I put them up.  Either I got a faulty batch of Safer traps or the product is a ripoff.

review/text: Opened the box, inserted the pheremone tab (very small) into each trap and put one in a room with a large infestation and the other in a closet with a smaller infestation.  In the room, moths almost immediately came out and started flying near the trap.  Not sure if the trap would work, I vaccumed up as many as I saw then went to bed.  Next morning I found ONE in the trap.  Since then, I've seen about six moths flying around, but none in the trap.  They also don't seem to be that interested in the trap.  Same experience with the one in the closet (although that one hasn't caught any).  After the first day, I was going to give this five stars, but now it's down to three as this thing doesn't seem to work after the initial day (it claims to last 12 weeks).<br /><br />Pro - I can't smell it and as long as you're ready with your vaccum when you initially open it, you'll catch a bunch.<br /><br />Cons - 1. the moths don't seem to be able to smell it after day one. 2. Pricey for cardboard and a ver small pheremone tab

review/summary: Effective in trapping clothing moths
review/text: I purchased this product after hearing about it on NPR's "You Bet Your Garden." I was noticing holes in woolen clothing in my closets and drawers. I use these traps in the closets and cedar blocks in the drawers. The traps are effective in catching male moths and presumably preventing breeding, but the harm to clothing is from the larvae, so my understanding is the traps won't eliminate an existing situation but will prevent future harm by stopping the reproduction cycle. I've been replacing them every three months in my closets, as instructed and haven't had a problem since I started using the product about 8 months ago. I intend to continue using them and have encouraged friends to use them also. I like the fact that, unlike moth balls, they are non-toxic.

If you are considering trying them, this may help you:  the package notes that the main purpose of the traps is to alert you to the presence of moths.  These traps probably won't get rid of the problem - they don't claim to - thus, if you see moths in the trap, it's time to get a fogger or an exterminator.

review/text: If you go to the manufacturer's site for this product, you'll find nothing but five-star reviews.  Very suspicious, because this product DOES NOT WORK, as many other Amazon reviewers have pointed out.  If I could have given this product zero stars, I would have.<br /><br />After an infestation caused by a rolled-up wool rug that came back from the cleaner damp, I set out these traps. They did not trap a single moth--not one.  I went to Meijer's and purchased their traps, Enoz brand, and two of the traps were loaded with moths after two days. And they cost half as much as the Safer brand.<br /><br />Clothes moths are no joke.  They will destroy your carpets, drapes, linens, and clothing, and they breed unbelievably fast.  Don't waste your money on a product that doesn't work.  And keep in mind that traps are only one part of the solution. If the infestation is bad, you will need to spray; you can find sprays that are safe for children and pets at Loew's.  And, perhaps most importantly, vaccuum.  Vaccuum, vaccuum, VACCUUM! Do it daily, and if you have carpet, pay special attention to the area where the carpet hits the baseboard:  Moths love to breed in that area.

review/summary: Works as advertised - recommended
review/text: PROS<br />--Puts a significant dent in the problem.<br /><br />--Check out the "customer photos" section - I've uploaded a picture of a trap after 3+ months of use, and as you can see, they really attracted and trapped a ton of moths.  (Warning, it's a little gross.)<br /><br />CONS<br />--Doesn't eliminate the problem all on its own.<br /><br />--In fairness, though, the product is advertised as a moth "alert" - as in, it only "alerts" you to the problem, and right on the box it tells you to thoroughly clean your clothing, rugs, and furniture. The trap is designed to attract adult moths, not the larvae which cause damage to your clothes. As other reviewers have pointed out, these only attract some of the moths (the males I think?) and are designed to break the breeding cycle.<br /><br />Although they don't solve the entire problem all on their own, these traps did a  fantastic job for me.  I guess they trapped the adults well enough to prevent them from mating, because I've noticed a huge decrease in the moths I've seen flying around, and I actually think my moth infestation is almost gone.  I combined these "alerts" with other products, such as the herbal "moth away" packets and cedar hangups.  I also drycleaned or washed most of my clothes, and kept them in big plastic boxes temporarily. I've replaced my old traps with new ones, and so far - zilch.  I think the first set of traps really did a great job.<br /><br />GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE<br />One last note worth pointing out.  I just reordered a new set of traps (my old set had been out for over three months) and one of the lure packets arrived empty.  I called the company, and they were apologetic and volunteered to send me a replacement right away.

review/summary: Not worth the money
review/text: I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. It was all paper, do-it-yourself contraption. Cheap. Told to hang in area but nothing to hang it with.  Can't see how this is going to work.

review/summary: THESE THINGS WORK!
review/text: I'm on my second order of these.  With the first order earlier in the year it took a while, but the word finally got out in Mothtown and now these traps in my house are filled with male clothes moths looking for a hot Friday night on the town.<br /><br />Maybe the heat of summer has caused the second order to work faster, but one of the traps I received in early August caught no moths the first two nights, twelve on night three and ten more on night four.<br /><br />Order number three coming up.

review/summary: There are Two Types of Clothes Moths and This is Non-Specific
review/text: There are two different types of clothing moths. One is the webbing clothes moth and the other is the casemaking clothes moth.  Each is attracted by a different pheremone and trap.  This product does not specify which moth it traps. This is a big negative if you happen to have the other type of moth.  This is a hanging trap.  The webbing clothes moth, which seems to be more common, is not lured into a hanging trap. The trap for the webbing clothes moth should not be hung, but is placed on a shelf or on the floor. It is a rectangular type of box open at both ends, sticky inside with the lure placed in the center.

review/summary: A Bad Batch!!??  Very disappointing this time
review/text: I have purchased these several times over the past 5 or 6 years and have had great success at catching the critters.  This time, the eight traps that I placed where I have seen moths have barely caught anything, maybe one or two,  but I still see the moths flying around. At least 6 of them are still empty after several weeks.  I might have caught 3 flying moths altogether.<br /><br />I think that there is a bad batch of pheromes or bad traps and the next time I will try another brand instead of Safer..

review/summary: Worked for me
review/text: Other reviewers have written that using these traps instead of mothballs requires patience and extra effort (freezing and/or laundering your clothes, possibly repeatedly), and might require a long time - so I won't say too much about that.  I will mention that these aren't harmful to pets (search for "mothballs dogs cats" for more information).  Also, they have no nasty odor.<br /><br />After comparing the reviews for these with the Pro-Pest Traps, it seemed as if the Pro-Pest traps worked better for most folks.  So I ordered one 2-pack of the Safer Brand and two 3-packs of the Pro Pest.<br /><br />I put one of each brand in two of our closets. You can probably guess the result.  Wouldn't you know it, the Safer Brand drew in far more moths, at least at first.<br /><br />I suspect that the different brands use slightly different lures.  Maybe there's more than one breed of clothes moth and one lure works better than the other for some kinds, but that's just a guess.<br /><br />The two traps also differ in convenience (or rather its in-).  This one requires that you remove a tiny lure chip from its envelope without losing it, and drop it into the trap so it sticks to the gummy surface.  I wasn't sure whether it would harm its effectiveness if I touched the lure - the directions are kind of skimpy - so I used tweezers.  This process isn't really any harder or easier than removing the finicky release paper on the Pro-Pest traps, so take your pick.<br /><br />Unlike the Pro Pest traps, there's no obvious way to hang these.  I looped a string through the triangle and tied it to the clothes pole in some of our closets.  In others I used double-stick tape, which was a little easier.<br /><br />Although these Safer traps drew more moths sooner than the Pro-Pest, the latter eventually began to fill up too.  So while I suggest that you try both and see which works better for you, I doubt that you'll go very far wrong with either - just as long as you're patient.

review/summary: Moth trap
review/text: This product does not work.  We know we have a clothing moth problem.  We frequently kill the flying adults and vacuum the rugs, carpets, and other areas where the eggs are laid, but they are still not completely eradicated.  However, NONE of the traps ever contained anything.

review/summary: Total crap
review/text: I love Amazon, but these are CRAP!  I set them up according to the directions, and had moths buzzing around them, even saw one land on them.  After a week I sent them back--having not caught a single moth.
