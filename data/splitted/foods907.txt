review/summary: You can never go back
review/text: I like to drink just about anything wet that is called tea, Including Several Green teas. Some even unique teas that come people bring back from home fields in china. In Vietnam there were French tea plantations; I spent a year there with out sugar so I learned to not use it. And I even drink different Chai Teas. So I figured being eclectic I had no taste. However once I tried Twinings of London English Breakfast tea I found it to be full flavored and not one dimensional. I do not use any additives so the tea has to taste good without sugar, cream, or whatever.<br /><br />After slurping my way through several of these 50 bag boxes I had an opportunity to try that other stuff from Sir Thomas Lipton and had to spit it out I forgot what it used to taste like.  I cannot say it is the company or the tea mix but I find that I am now addicted to this tea. Even though I can still drink other types of tea that black and pekoe stuff just does not cut it. Strange the Twinings box also says black tea so I guess there is black tea and then again there is black tea. However this tea is so much richer.

review/summary: Extreme value
review/text: There are two kinds of tea: Twinings, and all others. Twinings English Breakfast Tea has a welcoming aroma and flavor that sets it apart from wannabee competitors.<br /><br />Amazon's price is amazing, which worked out to slightly less than 11 cents per tea bag. The next best price I've seen recently was closer to 15 cents at a DoD Commissary, with LA-area stores routinely in the 19-20 cent/bag range. My order was nicely packaged and arrived within 2 days of ordering. This is Extreme Value.

review/text: I've been using Twining's English Breakfast tea for lo, these many years, or so it seems.  Delighted to find it at a reasonable price at Amazon....I now have signed up for regular shipments so I no longer have to run the risk of a tealess morning....or rather, a Twining's Tea-less morning.  Not a coffee drinker in the a.m. nor do I ever drink de-caf tea.  This particular brand suits me quite well....I would probably enjoy loose tea but find it more expensive.  Try it - you'll like it.

review/text: I've been drinking this tea for years. It's the best on the market for a reasonable price.<br /><br />Since I drink a lot of this tea, I've always tried to buy this larger sized package to save a bit of money. But the larger size is not sold in very many places, so I end up buying the smaller size for what feels like too much money - plus I just have to buy a lot of them.<br /><br />Now I've hit upon the perfect formula: buy these larger boxes in bulk at super low prices on a regular basis. I was just reminded of what a great deal this is because I'm on vacation and had to buy the smaller packages here - for a package of 20, I paid almost what I pay here for 50.<br /><br />If you drink a lot of tea, you can go wrong here.

review/summary: The Best of the English Breakfast Teas
review/text: I'm a huge tea drinker and enjoy the English Breakfast style tea as my favorite overall daily drink of choice.  I've tried all the English Breakfast style teas by virtually every maker and then tried a 'taste off' between the teas.  I've tasted and compared the main brands to include Twinings, Bigelow, Ashby's, Celestial Seasonings, and a few other smaller brands.  Twinings was noticably the most flavorful, smooth, AND consistant.  The Celestial Seasonings offering was the most tangy and citrus tasting - more like an Earl Grey.  If you like English Breakfast style tea, go with the original British tea by Twinings, it's the best of the English Breakfast group. I've also tried the Twinings Irish Breakfast tea - it's too tangy and a bit bitter - I much prefer the taste of English Breakfast.  If you're wondering about choosing between the two, select the English Breakfast, you won't be disappointed.  I'm glad I found this on Amazon, what a savings over the local grocery store prices - if you find on 'sale', you'll get an average cost of around 8 cents a tea bag - compare that to your morning cup of Starbucks!

The individually wrapped tea bag preserves tea leaves flavor which is at its best with boiling water.

review/summary: English Breakfast in name only
review/text: This was once a very very good tea with lots of full bodied flavor and scent. Then a few years back the corporate suits looked at their bottom line and gambled that there are enough Americans who can't really distinguish good from mediocre, so why not cut back on quality and cruise on the Twinings name. Judging by the stellar reviews of their product, they made a smart business decision. They bought cheap leaves and dumbed down the taste to a brackish, uninteresting non-event.<br /><br />Compare this stuff with Tazo English Breakfast tea; you'll taste a hige difference. There are probably some other good E.B. teas out there, but Tazo is fairly widely available in my area. Sadly, Lipton followed the Twining trend toward mediocrity, so they're no better.

review/summary: The worst of the Breakfast teas
review/text: Twinings is one of the worst English breakfast teas you can buy.  Most serious tea drinkers know and understand that Twinings lacks aroma and strength, and if you open a tea back you'll find tea ground to the consistency of sawdust--terrible stuff.  I can't believe there are so many 5 star reviews.  I'll wager the Twinnings company mounted a campaign and got people to write favorable reviews.

review/text: I bought this tea before reading reviews here. Unfortunately, the box does NOT say what teas are in it - nor does it say that it's a blend of Assam and Kenyan teas. I like Ceylon Orange Pekoe teas and this tea is weak, tasteless and insipid by comparison. Some people might like the thin mouth feel it has, but for me, it's like drinking brown colored water.

review/text: Of course its good. Its Twinings English breakfast tea. Tastes more like a good Indian tea. maybe because it is blended with Kenyan and Assam tea.<br />I am never going to do business with USPS. The delivery attempt failed so I had to get that from their office and because government agency's policies are made by morons, I couldn't get the parcel because the name on the parcel is an abbreviation of my name. So I had to show them an ID that had my abbreviated name on it. They said my electricity bill (It comes on my roomie's name) is a proof of my address but not of my identity, so it wasnt enough.

review/text: I have used the berry flavor which tasted like medicine,so I decided to go with the mint flavor. I took one strip and gave me a kick for 4 hours. But the following day I decided to take 2 strips because I felt more tired than normal. I def had the energy,maybe too much?  I was at work moving faster than normal and started to sweat a bit because I was moving so fast. So I did have the shakes and sweat. Maybe a sheet and a half would suffice. Just be careful when and where you take it.

review/text: There were no cooking directions included. I put 1 1/2 cups of rice in 6 cups of water. Let it boil for 10 minutes then drained in a strainer. It came out fluffy and was not sticky at all. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is even after cooking the burlap smell from the bag the rice comes in is still distinct. It does go away after a few minutes and there is no after taste to the rice. My family loves the rice and it cooks up faster than other brands.

review/summary: DeMet's Chocolate Pecan Turtles
review/text: I loved this brand of candy as a kid.  The chocolates are relatively inexpensive for boxed chocolates. They are housed in a sturdy box with the traditional DeMet's turtles design.<br /><br />The candies are pecan and caramel delights coated with milk chocolate.  The candies are true to size as indicated on the package.<br /><br />The box intimates that there are whole pecans within each chocolate treat.  The package even shows four whole pecans giving the impression that perhaps each piece contains two whole pecans.<br /><br />This is a misconception as there are crushed pecan bits in each piece.  There are barely enough pecans to flavor each piece.<br /><br />The product is a bit skimpy on the pecans.  So if you like pecans or other nuts, this candy will not satisfy your craving.<br /><br />I have noticed that there is a change in the actual texture, appearance, and taste of this brand of chocolates.  As shown in the picture, there is suppose to be rich gooey caramel.<br /><br />However, the ingredients indicate that there is not.  Rather than using real caramel, they used caramel color and artificial flavors.  Caramel = cream or butter, sugar, and vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Instead, there is a corn syrup and a sugar syrup that can never be mistaken for caramel.  The product relies heavily on sugars for flavor, e.g., sugar, corn syrup, and invert sugar syrup.<br /><br />So when you chew into these, you won't get that chewy gooey nutty caramel flavor.  It's more like an icing.

review/summary: Great alternative to artificial dye
review/text: Some in my family are allergic to various artificial food colors, but my kids really didn't want a white birthday cake cause it is boring.  Beet powder is the perfect coloring for us.  I simply mix it with a small amount of hot water, let it sit a minute, then strain through cheesecloth.  I then use the liquid in making my frosting and it is a beautiful bright pink color--prettier than standard food coloring IMO, and a perfect color for little girls' birthdays.  I have also just added the powder directly to the frosting, which works but it takes a while for the color to appear full strenth and if you look closly you will see tiny dots of beet powder.<br /><br />I also use beet powder to make colored sugar, pouring a tiny amount of liquid on sugar, mixing well, letting it dry, and breaking up any clumps.  I then use that sugar to make homemade peeps that the whole family can eat (recipe at http://www.marthastewart.com/article/homemade-easter-treats).  Mine don't look nearly as good as Martha's, but they tase wonderful.<br /><br />I have even used beet powder to make candy canes (recipe at http://candy.about.com/od/hardcandyrecipes/r/candy_canes.htm).  Instead of adding food coloring, just add some beet liquid AFTER taking the candy off the heat and cooling slightly. I have also used it in other hard candies, the only problem is that if the candy hardens before you have shaped it  you can't reheat it on the stove or the beet stuff will burn, turn brown, and taste nasty.  That only happens at very high temperatures, however. You can add beet powder to baked goods without burning it.<br /><br />This stuff goes a long way as a food coloring.  One small package has lasted us a year and a half, using it a couple of times a month, and I am just now nearly done with it.  No one has ever noticed a beet flavor in the finished products because you only need a tiny amount.

I used a recipe from a good natural foods cookbook to make the frosting, and it tasted good before I added the beet powder.

review/text: I'm sorry, but these are horrible!  They taste burnt!  They are so bitter that neither my husband or I were able to eat them.  I tried them three different times because I didn't want to give up so easily, but they really are just awful.  It's not just a 'deep' flavor, they truly do taste burnt.  Won't buy again.

review/text: These are more like a chip, and I love the texture and the fact that the ingredients are actually good for me.  I eat them with hummus or straight out of the box.  The onion flavor does have a slightly burnt taste, but not enough to keep me from eating half a box at a time.  I also tried the caraway flavor and liked them even better.

review/summary: Can't get enough!
review/text: I started eating these out of desperation when I was put on an anti-candida diet---no gluten, no sugar, no yeast, etc.  I fell in love--they are and have been my gluten free go-to cracker ever since (though I got off the diet, I remained gluten and sugar free because I feel better that way.)  My husband tried one or two and has never looked back--we go through them like water so we signed up for subscribe and save.  We particularly like them with some goat cheese! It's hard to find a crunchy, rich tasting cracker when you're gluten free, but these really hit the mark!

review/text: I agree with at least one other reviewer here: these crackers taste burnt! Just simply awful. I don't see how anyone can honestly claim to love them. Makes me think that the positive reviews are by the company itself! I'll not be buying them again. If I could give them a zero, I would. Had to throw the whole box out after the first taste. My husband and son both agreed.

review/summary: Great Treats - Liver is Liver...
review/text: Our Shitzu is very picky when it comes to treats, which is good I guess.  Only puppy sized Milkbones and Dried Liver Treats.  We used a different brand in the past, but tried PureBites and he loves them, just as much.  The other brand sells them in a hard plastic (reusable)container and the PureBites are in a bag/pouch.  Not sure if that contributes to more breakage of pieces or if it's just they way they are processed.  Since our pooch is a small dog, he doesn't need "big bites", so these are just fine for him.  Price per ounce seems better on the PureBites too.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: These liver treats are awesome!! My dog loves them and they definitely make a nice reward especially after getting his nails cut. My dog is also kind of a picky eater and he doesn't really like his dog food, but since he's allergic to potatoes he doesn't have very many options to what kind of dog food he eats. To coax him to eat his food, sometimes I'll get a piece of these treats, crush it up and sprinkle it over his food. He seriously is the best eater after the liver treats are all over his kibbles. I also gave these treats to my cousins chihuahua whos also a really picky eater. She a little worse than my dog, she doesn't like any kind of treats, but she'll eat these! Yes, these are kind of expensive especially since I'm still in college, but it's so worth seeing my doggie happy :)

review/text: We purchase both the Chicken and the Beef Liver for our dogs...and the cats love the chicken.  Really, where else beside the butcher's shop can you get 100% meat with nothing added for your pet?  These are great for training and for an everyday treat.  I can't wait to try the Cheese product when it comes out.  HINT...to get the most for your money, sprinkle the dust at the bottom of the bag on top of their food.

review/summary: Great product -- reduced my dogs "emissions"
review/text: These treats truly are as pure as you can get -- 100% beef liver and nothing else.  This also means that they're grain free, which is fantastic for dogs with gas problems.  Switching from other (high-quality) treats to PureBites liver reduced the frequency and potency of my dog's rear-end emissions by about 90 percent.  Both my dogs love these treats.  The only, minor drawback is that the bottom of the bag tends to have a little pile of tiny bits and pieces of treats -- at that point, I'll pour out a little pile for each of my dogs and they lick them up like candy.

review/summary: All-time favorite snack for my babies!
review/text: My two finicky dogs just love, love this snack! They don't just eat any snack that comes their way, in fact, they usually turn their noses up when I try to give them other pretty darn good natural dog snacks, but this one is a winner! The bite-sized pieces are just the right size for them (they are slightly under medium-sized dogs, peke mixes) and although they have been eating this snack for years, they never grow tired of it. The 16 oz bag lasts us for about two months (two dogs), which is pretty darn good considering the price. I have tried the other flavors, but we stay away from chicken and cheese because of the allergy equation. The fish is also excellent, but the price is a bit steeper, so we pretty much stick to the liver. YUM YUM WOOF WOOF!

review/text: These treats are great for training our miniature poodle.  Who is very self willed.  He never seems to tire of these treats. But with that being said we dont give him a lot.  Only one when he does something we are trying to get him to do.<br /><br />I heard one pet owner makes her own.  Havent figured out how to do that yet.  So this is what we are doing now.<br /><br />The price is cheaper than our local pet store.<br /><br />But in my opinion, this company is make a boat load of money, hand over fist.  Knowing the price of liver, cheap, cheap, cheap.  I wish I had a freeze dry machine.<br /><br />Great item for those that are not the do it yourself freeze drier.
