review/summary: Not quite as long-lived as I hoped...
review/text: I bought this at my local high end pet food shop for $9.  I brought it home, and gave it to the pup on the patio.  My dog is a 70 lbs lab/pit mix around 1 year old.  The good: he loved it and didn't upset his stomach at all.  The not so great: lasted about 90 minutes, in two sessions.  I gave it to him on day one for an hour, and he finished about 30% of it, then I took it away and saved the rest for the next day, which only took him like half an hour to seal the deal (nothing left whatsoever).  It's fun for a try, but at $9, I think I won't buy too many more.

review/summary: Great all natural long lasting entertainment!
review/text: I am now on my third package of Himilayan dog chews from Amazon.  They are amazing and you can't beat the free shipping from the suppliers on Amazon!  My search for a long lasting chew started when our lab/doberman puppy was only about 3-4 months old.  I had read so many good things about bully sticks so I ordered them and then just about threw up when I smelled them!  I tried to look over it, gave it to our pup (who loved it) but then not only did it smell while he was eating it, but his breath was stinky for a while afterwards!  Plus, I'd say the bully stick didn't seem to last much longer than a regular (non-stinky) rawhide.  Then I ordered the Himilayan dog chew.  He wasn't sure how to approach it since it is literally rock hard.  But, then he started scrapping it with his teeth.  He isn't the type of dog to take big bites so he's never gotten any big hunks off of it.  One chew last weeks since we usually save it for an after dinner snack/entertainment (1-2 hours at a time).  Not only does the Himalyan dog chew last a really long time, it also barely smells at all unless you hold it to your nose!  And, at that, it's just a smoked gouda type smell so it's not repulsive like a bully stick.  Plus, it seems to keep our pups breath smelling much better than if he doesn't have it!  We had actually taken a Himalayan dog chew with us on a road trip to my parents house and their dog (9 year old lab mix) actually snuck into our bag and stole the cheese!  This is actually a very surprising thing because their dog has NEVER been a chewer.  If given something hard, she actually just hides it and never eats it.  So, to see her take the cheese and bite small pieces off, I knew she must have loved it!  On our next visit I made sure to have an extra piece of cheese just for her.  Needless to say, I cannot recommend trying this out enough!  If it ends up your dog didn't like it, you just tried one more item in an attempt to make them happy.  If they love it though, you will have found a great investment in your dogs health and happiness!  Our pup LOVES his cheese!

review/summary: Great clean treat
review/text: ATTENTION: Don't throw the treat away as others have, read below:<br /><br />I first learned of this treat from a booth at the Portland Pet Expo, and it has turned out to be an excellent, safe chew for our golden retriever puppy. When we first gave it to her, she absolutely loved it and chewed it for 15+ minutes straight, which was quite an attention span for our then 11 week old puppy. The pet expo sold samples at a discount, but said the retail price for this size chew was ~$24, so I was glad to find it on amazon for so much less.<br /><br />The himalayan chew is a combination of cow and goat cheeses, which is smoked for 7 months to produce a very hard chew which softens with puppy slobber. It does not stain, smell, or splinter. The only potential risk is a choking hazard as the chew gets small (what bone doesn't have this risk?). However, we learned a trick at the pet expo that most people here don't know:<br /><br />DON'T throw away the treat. When it gets so small you worry about choking, take it away and let it dry then microwave it for  10-15 seconds. The small chunck will get 3+ times larger, and will be less dense as a result. Now it is safe again to give to your pet as a quick treat. This way there is no waste, and your pet enjoys every last bit of it.<br /><br />Now that we have had two himalayan chews around the house for five weeks, our golden isn't quite as crazy about it as when we first got it, but she will still happily chew it over most of her toys and treats, and she hasn't finished either one yet. She still won't chew it for more than 15-20 minutes at a time, so it has time to dry out and harden again between chewing sessions. For larger dogs and more agressive chewers, I would expect that it wouldn't last nearly as long since it will stay softer as they keep chewing for longer times.

review/summary: Outstanding product for dogs with allergies
review/text: I did not purchase through this seller.  However, this product is a must have for anyone who has a dog with allergies.  We found our shepherd puppy that was allergic to any kinds of proteins in the meat family except fish.  Being a shepherd, he is an aggressive chewer and could not have any kind of chew treats; there are none with fish.  He had no interest in non-food chew toys, and was destroying our house until I found these.  He can tolerate the yak's milk they are made from just fine and he loves them.  He is a strong chewer and each large one lasts 2-3 days until completely gone.

review/text: My 35 pound mixed breed absolutely loves these things. They don't last as long as I'd like, but she's a very intense chewer. I've found that antlers are longer lasting natural chews, but this is a special treat I bring out once in a while for 30 minutes at a time. I'll continue buying them, but you shouldn't expect them to replace other stronger chews.

review/summary: Made my dog very happy
review/text: I have a pit girl who just had her first birthday and I got her one of these as her birthday present. The first thing she did when I handed it to her was run into her crate (which she NEVER uses anymore) so that, in her mind, we couldn't take it away from her. It lasted about 2 days, which honestly is longer than I expected because she can take down a bully stick in 10 minutes. Unfortunately these are too expensive to give to her all the time, so I'm still searching for the trifecta of durable + yummy + affordable. I will probably get these as occasional special treats.

review/summary: Your dog will love it but how long it lasts depends on YOUR dog
review/text: I bought a Himalayan Dog Chew locally for my Siberian Husky grandpuppy (next time it'll be via Amazon).  He LOVES it and it has lasted him for many, many months.<br /><br />I've read the reviews, including at the Himalayan Dog Chew website, and heard people talk about it at the high end pet food shop where I buy cat food for our in house 4 footed family member.  The reviews for how long it lasts are all across the board.  For some dogs these chews do last for a LONG time, for others, it's gone in a day.<br /><br />The chews are pricey, but if your dog is one of those that chomps it down in a day, it's not a bad treat to give when you have to leave him/her alone for longer than normal times.  It should keep him/her happy.  That wouldn't work for my grandpuppy because he doesn't spend his whole focus chewing on it; he just savors it periodically.<br /><br />Either way, it's a great chew.  Just choose the use depending on how quickly your dog eats it.

review/summary: OK, but kind of false advertising
review/text: I got these on a whim, mostly because they seemed like a really awesome specialty item, which my local pet store doesn't sell many of, since the owner (Chester Uphill) doesn't like buying stuff from "invading foreigners." I remember one time when I dressed as a Mexican mariachi for Halloween and he came at me with a gardening hoe. He chased me for hours and hours, screaming about green cards and taxes. Boy, was that fun.<br /><br />Anyway, this product is advertised as a "Himalayan Dog Chew," denoting not just something exotic, but also something slightly fringe. For years now, I've been purchasing similar products and have never had the opportunity to try one that claims to be influenced by the Himalayas.<br /><br />At $9, I have to say that this is hardly worth it. Sure, you get a full 3.5 oz chew, but it doesn't taste anything like the fresh, crisp mountain air of the mighty Himalayas, and it barely tastes like a dog from the region. Incredibly misleading name for a chew at this price.<br /><br />Despite being disappointing, the flavor is appetizing enough (more Scottish Terrier than Himalayan mountain dog), and it's a better alternative to fried chews from similar manufacturers.<br /><br />Plus, it really helps maintain healthy gums.

review/summary: Great Chew
review/text: I like this chew because it has limited ingredients, it is not an animal bone, and because my dog enjoys it and tolerates it well.  However, I had a similar experience to the poster who said that her dog finished the chew pretty quickly.  I have a Boxer mix and he devoured the chew in two sessions of approximately 1 hour each.  I also let my dog work through half the chew, took it away, and then gave him the remainder on a subsequent day. Because the chew is pretty hard, I assumed it would last much longer.  I have absolutely no other problem with this chew and I will buy it again, but I thought it was worth pointing out that it can go pretty quickly, depending on the type of dog you have.

review/text: I can't speak for how long they'll last for strong chewers or large dogs, but for my two pugs, these are awesome.  They absolutely love them.  They prefer the smokier ones, but attack them all regardless.<br /><br />One large cheese (per dog) will last for 2-4 days of fairly persistent chewing.<br /><br />Once the pieces are chewed down to a nub and I get concerned about the choking hazard, I nuke it on high for 30 seconds.  The cheese puffs up like a huge Cheeto, I cut it with a serrated knife before it cools, and the dogs finish it off.

review/summary: 5 out of 6 love them
review/text: We have 6 rescue dogs of all shapes and sizes and all but one love the Himalayan Chews.  I imagine even he does eat them but he just doesn't run me over when the box containing them arrives.  I have to always look for deals and bargins because they are a bit costly, but considering how much treats cost, and that I have had to stop giving chicken jerky, well in fact all treats from China that doesn't leave me with a lot of options. Plus it isn't calorie laden and one of our little guys has become pretty chubby since arriving at our house last year. I think the coolest thing though is how you just pop the little pieces that are left behind (little 1/2 inch pieces) in the microwave for 37 seconds and you have yourself a yaky puff.  I just have to save the puffs until I get at least 4 for the little dogs so we don't start anything.  The one downside, aside from the cost, is that they can be noisy when it is lights out. One of our guys decides he wants to go to town on one of the large ones just as we all get tucked in for the night. Then I have to get up and walk around and pick them all up so he can't get to any of them and put them up for the night or I would never get to sleep. Oh, one more con, if you step on them barefoot, ouch. But again, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. My little ones were all getting sick on bully sticks, vomiting, diarrhea, the whole nine yards, but nothing with the Himalayan Chews.

Initially, he liked the chew but after the novelty wore off, he stopped chewing it. I gave 4 stars because it does last pretty long, but lost a star because he stopped chewing it and it kind of leaves a mess from the bits that break off.. and it smells like new shoe rubber, which I guess is better than scent-less bully tricks.

review/text: I purchased a large dog size Himalayan Dog Chew and Esther, my 8lb Papillon, loves it.  She's a voracious chewer but has a tiny little throat so getting natural chews that don't pose a choking hazard has been a problem.  It's true, the chews don't last as long as I'd like.  I only give her a couple of hours with it at a time so we get about a week out of each chew.  If the maufacturer simply made these in XXXLarge size, they'd be fab for everyone!  One wee downside, pun intended, they seem to be a little salty and cause more drinking.  Best side effect?  Esther smells like smoked gouda after a long chew!

The other one went through the large size in 30 minutes.  It wasn't that he was so excited he demolished it, he just very calmly put the end in his molars and the thing just broke into chunks.  I was uncomfortable letting him eat the smaller chunks since I've read that these might not get digested entirely and result in surgery.  I've been looking for a longer lasting chew that's more exciting than antlers, and this is definitely not it.

review/summary: Best Chew Toy So Far
review/text: I adopted my dog a couple of months ago and have been trying to find a good chew for him. I wanted to stay away from rawhide because of it's somewhat dangerous reputation. I also wanted something that is completely edible and will last a good long while. So far out of everything we've tried this is the only treat that really fits all my needs. Nylabone-ish products generally aren't edible and the one's that are my dog devours in under an hour; other chews he just shows little to no interest in. This Himalayan Dog Chew has lasted him several days so far, he loves it and it's all natural. There are literally 4 ingredients. I've also noticed that after a good chew session his breath(not terrible in the first place) smells a bit less. Also, although I haven't tried it myself yet, the woman at the pet store where I bought this said that once it gets down to a little stump you can actually put it in the microwave for a minute or so and it will expand to give your dog a bit more to chew on before it gets to be a choking hazard. I'm going to have to do a bit more research on that, but just throwing it out there.

review/summary: Gone in 30 minutes!
review/text: I decided to pick up two of these after hearing some fantastic reviews of how long they last. I have intense chewers, but they are only a 40 lb elderly basset hound and a 40 lb lab/border collie mix. They both definitely loved the chew, however, they had them completely gone in 30 minutes. I timed it. For their price, they should be able to last much, much longer. In addition, they did not sit well with either dog, and both had extremely running stool the next day. We'll stick to antlers and compressed rawhide in this house.

review/summary: Great for teething puppies
review/text: I own a shetland sheepdog aka miniature Lassie dog. He is 16ish weeks old and has not lost his baby teeth yet. THis is great. I have a two year old and a 5 month old so I have small things around all the time and I'm trying to get him to chew on other things besides the toys. He loves them. the one stick I gave him he is still working on but loves it. IT doesnt make a mess and it doesnt get icky and wet. THey more like carve shavings off with their teeth. My sister who has a german shepard recommended it to me and I am SOOO glad I bought them. Plus he likes it in his kennel too.

review/summary: Not for agressive chewers
review/text: We bought these for our Grand-dog that is a 40 lbs Stratfordshire mix within 5 minutes we took it from because he was destroying it we are sure it would have been gone within 20 minutes and this was the LARGE size one. But he did enjoy it very much you just need to limit the time with the bone if you have a heavy chewer.Just an added note after having these chews for a week now we cannot recommend them because the dog was able to chew off rather large pieces and swallow them causing him to throw-up later that night.

review/summary: Great Big Chews for Tiny Little Dogs
review/text: I buy Himalayan Dog Chews for my Toy Rat Terriers, they LOVE it! I have "energetic" chewers and so they get eaten up pretty quickly. A medium sized bone lasted about two or three days with my two little nippers going at it pretty hard. I now save them as a treat for when I have to leave them at home. Even though it disolves, it doesn't get slimy or get all over their faces and paws like other disolving treats do, and it doesn't give them doggie breath. I get the biggest bone and its fun to watch my 6 pound dog carry a 1 pound bone looking for that perfect spot to chew (which is usually on my bed on my pillow... another reason I'm glad it isn't messy!). I've been buying them at a local groomer and paying almost $20.00 a piece for them... I'll be getting them from Amazon from now on!<br />Even at $9.00 a pop for the large ones here, I'd be hesitant about getting one of these for a large dog, it just seems like a lot of money for a treat that's going to be gone pretty quickly.

review/summary: My dog did not even touch it
review/text: I have a teething bullmastiff puppy who generally loves her bully sticks and antlers (I tend to give her natural things to chew on because she would each nylabones or anything like that).  I heard about these dog chews and thought I would give it a try.  They are very hard  which is great, I doubt she would get a piece off, but they smell worse than a bully stick and she was not even interested in chewing it.  She gave it a few licks the first night and now she doesnt even touch it.  Waste of money if you ask me and because of the fact that it is cheese I am afraid of antracting pests or of it spoiling or something.  Two other dogs I know had a similar reaction.

review/summary: excellent flavor
review/text: I bought this rose water to flavor frosting for a chocolate cake. At first I wasn't sure I wanted to spend this much to try flavoring something with rose, but I am glad I did. It was excellent. A little of this goes a long way and not only does rose make a very yummy and satisfying flavor for cakes and frosting, it also has great health benefits.<br /><br />Did you know rose is a soothing property to the nerves and emotional /psychological state of mind? "It is regarded as a mild sedative and anti-depressant. It is increasingly used in treatments for conditions of stress: nervous tension, peptic ulcers, heart disease, among others. There is indication that rose essence may also positively influence digestion, bile secretion, womb disorders and circulation. In addition, a tea made with rose petals (pour 150 ml of boiling water over 1 /2 grams of rose petals) often soothes a mild sore throat."  ... so perhaps my rose frosting is much more of a "comfort food"  than I initially thought!

review/summary: My favorite brand
review/text: I suspect most people do not use Rose Water often, but I use it at least once a week and have learned to appreciate the product quality of Al Wadi.<br /><br />Rose Water is a potent way to add a flavor many westerners are not familiar with.  You can fry many pastries, or add it to filo dough products, and enjoy something that just tastes right.<br /><br />It's essential to zulbia and it's a great enhancement to elephant ears (not literally ears... this is a crunchy Persian ear-shaped dessert called gosheefeel).  But I also wind up adding this to french toast and pancake batter when I want a change of pace.  I also have experimented with this in barbeque sauce, and it's not for everyone, but I think it's pretty tasty.<br /><br />It can overpower if you're not sparing, but if you've never tried it, this is a great item to pick up and experiment with.

review/summary: A great deal for organic maple syrup!
review/text: This is the best deal on maple syrup I have found so far.  This is cheaper than regular maple syrup (not organic) in the stores.  The only drawback is that the cap (pour spout) is usually broken in shipment.  It was broken in both of my shipments.  It doesn't leak everywhere because it has a seal, but you can't use it to pour out the syrup.  So, keep that in mind when you buy to have a separate syrup container to use and that this 32 oz. is used more for a refill.

review/summary: These are good.  Very, very good.
review/text: I don't mean "good for a gluten free cookie", or "almost like a normal cookie".  No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.  They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free.  No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also.  According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You're probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn't the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren't.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me.

review/text: Are these really gluten free, because they sure don't taste like it!  There are a few other cookies being marketed as "gluten free" or "diet" but there simply is no comparison to these nuggets of goodness.  Frankly, even given the choice between these and something like a Pillsbury or Toll House oven-baked cookie, I'd take Lucy's cookies in a heartbeat.  No guilt, no high glycemic index to make you feel like you just gained five pounds, no impulse to hibernate.  Just moist, sweet morsels that make you wonder why the bag isn't three inches deeper.  (Seriously, Lucy, you need to make them deeper.)  And the inspiring story behind the creation of Lucy's cookies will make you feel that much better, knowing that you're supporting a homegrown business, rather than a huge multi-national.  I can't recommend these enough.

review/summary: Used to own stock in the company, but changed their formulation, and get a much lower rating
review/text: I used to love EVERY flavor of these cokies. I was the one buying out the entire shelf at WFoods. I started ordering on amazon multiple 8 packs at a time.  I could easily eat 2 boxes a day by myself!  I eat really healthy and my sweets is the only thing I give myself what I want.  I am vegan and "prefer" to eat gluten free, as I am supposed to due to healh issues, but don't always because there are no other GF desserts that are vegan that I LOVE.  So BOY was I disappointed when I had to stop buying them very mcuh because they changed the fat and calories significantly.  I wonder i anyone else noticed.  I wrote to Dr. Lucy and she replied.  I asked if I could still order some from her int he original formulation, or where I could buy them like that, but she said no.  The only reasons she gave were some type of problem with the formulation and baking f the cookie, but I don't understand beacause they were perfect??!  A better explanation would have been nice.  So thus, I am very disappointed in this line, which was the ONLY GF, VEGAN, LOW FAT/LOW CAL, DELICIOUS!!! line of desserts I enjoyed, and now cannot eat them very often at all.  When I am consuming large amounts, I'm sorry but 25g of fat for a whole box vs. 7.5 g fat/box for the old cookies?  Can't do it. Dang Lucy....I miss my sweet yumminess.

review/summary: Dry with after taste
review/text: I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.  I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucy's.  Thanks for reading.

review/summary: Ecellent Vegan Gluten Free Cookies, No Tummy Aches
review/text: These cookies are very similar to garden variety wheat based chocolate chip cookies, they have similar texture and snap, but these are both vegan and gluten free, which matches my requirements.  My celiac disease makes me very sensitive to wheat and these cookies do not trigger any reaction.<br /><br />The cookies are if anything a little more crisp than most, but not at all hard or difficult to chew.  They certainly contain sugar.  I do not eat these everyday because they are so sweet, but I do like them and may very well subscribe to them.<br /><br />If I were rating these only on flavor and texture I'd give them 4 stars, but Lucy annoyed me by creating a bizzarre nutrition panel.  Each package contains 4 cookies.  They state it is 1.3 servings, then go on to say one serving has 130 calories.  So each package seems to contain 169 calories, possibly over some people's limit for a snack.  But let's be honest, these cookies with lots of organic cane sugar have a lot of calories.  Each cookie must weigh in at a bit over 40 calories.<br /><br />For years we have known that 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  Now we know it is a cookie worth of calories too, tasty calories.  Will buy again.

review/summary: nom, nom, nom!!! 4 stars from a  *non*-gluten free mom
review/text: While I am not gluten intolerant, I'm trying to reduce my gluten intake for health reasons and snacks seem to be the best way to to try and curb my intake. Since snacks of this type are not a dietary requirement (much as I'd wish they were) I have the ability to chose *any* cookie, gluten free or not, I am lucky in that I can afford to be a little picky. I had tried a few other weird/bland gluten free options and wow- these cookies really surprised me - the are actually very good! Crispy, no weird/off tastes, just like a "real" cookie. Nice size for dunking in a cold cup of lactose free milk without getting lost or soggy. I deducted one star because they could use a few more chips sprinkled in there.<br /><br />They are a little expensive but I don't mind the price point considering that the factory goes to great lengths to protect against cross contamination from allergens and gluten. Plus being a little pricey I am less likely to eat more than one pack at a time :) I'm looking forward to trying the four flavor combo pack next time.

review/summary: Delicious, but something is awry
review/text: These are very very good tasting. Crispy cookies, especially delicious when dipped in milk. They say gluten free, and I totally believe they are, because I did not have a wheat-type reaction. But, I have to say, I always feel MISERABLE after eating these cookies.<br />Someone else mentions how they are too sweet, etc etc. I don't think they taste too sweet, and they have 13g of sugar per serving which doesn't seem like it's that much, considering most other 'sweets' have more sugars per serving (take a look at Gatorade, for example).<br />That said, it does seem to be some kind of a reaction to the sugar, because immediately after eating them I feel like my body is dumping into some kind of sugar coma. I start to feel like lead, and lightheaded. They also mess up my tummy. Maybe it's the type of sugar they use? Evaporated cane juice is the 1st ingredient, and they also contain 2 kinds of cellulose, which I think are sugars also (but I could be wrong).<br />Anyhow, I gave 4 stars for taste, because they are THAT good, but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster they should do *something* about this ... I don't want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them, but maybe try using less sugar, or a different kind of sugar, like organic brown? I have no idea, but I would never let a kid eat more than 1 of these at a time, for fear it'd make them just pass out!<br />I eat other sweet stuff, and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over-sugared.<br /><br />I'm not even totally sure it's the sugar that makes you feel this way ... any ideas? It's a shame, because they are so delicious. I've tried them several times, and may keep them on hand for a once-in-a-blue-moon craving, but I definitely won't be eating them often.

review/summary: Just like Snickerdoodles!
review/text: This cookies are really tasty and I will definitely be reordering.  I ordered the package of 16 small bags to be able to have a snack to carry with me to places unlikely to have anything gluten free, and I'm glad I ordered this product. If one is signed up for the autodelivery program the price is pretty reasonable. The little bag of 4 cookies helps me with portion control because if I had the whole box I would probably plow right through them.  They are very flavorful and taste just like cinnamony Snickerdoodles; there is no weird aftertaste as with many GF foods. (I have also had the oatmeal cookies and found them crispy too but much more bland; they would be good with coffee.) I've even considered crushing the cinnamon thins to make a crust for cheesecake but haven't tried that yet (would buy a box to do so to avoid the need to open multiple bags).  The cookies are very crispy, so if that is an issue for you, take note. (I know my false-toothed father would have to soak these in milk to be able to eat them, but I believe he would think they were worth it!)

review/text: I went on a search for dairy free chocolate and found these great cookies!  We believed my breastfed son was sensitive to milk, and having to avoid dairy when you're a chocoholic is very difficult!  These cookies helped to feed my chocolate cravings, and helped keep my sanity in those difficult first weeks with a newborn.  At first, I thought they tasted just a bit different.  They're a lot crunchier than regular chocolate chip cookies and they don't taste exactly the same.  However, after being off of dairy and munching on these cookies, I began to not notice a difference.  My picky husband also said they were good!

Make sure that if you eat them while having coffee that you "dunk" quick (if you like to dunk your cookies).

review/summary: Yummy, little crunchy cookies
review/text: If you have serious food allergies or gluten intolerance, you probably bake your own (and aren't reading this review) -- but what a joy to find Dr. Lucy's cookies in Starbucks recently!  Yes, these are boxed cookies, not to be confused with homemade, which is the sterling standard for me.  But given that, they're lovely!  The body of the cookie is slightly bean-flavored, since that's what the flour blend relies on; but it's not an obtrusive flavor.  Just a bit tangy.  The milk-free chips are great:  nicely rounded flavor, not burnt or sharp.  The texture is pleasantly crisp & sandy; not tough, not hard, not chewy.  Great with coffee or tea. Our favorite is the chocolate chip variety, but the cinnamon and sugar cookies versions are delicious also.  If you're not allergic yourself, but considering buying some for guests or grandchildren who are, then I'd encourage you to go for it.  You'll find you munch on them, too, because they're just yummy, little crunchy cookies.

Boy was I pleased when I discovered they were as good as any cookie made with wheat and eggs. Not the bland, dry, grainy taste of most GF cookies. Also the price is much better than many of the other allergy friendly products I have tried.  You will not be disapointed in these.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: These are delicious! Discovered them while I was at Starbucks last week...I've tried the Cinnamon Thins and the Sugar Cookies and they're both great! A nice, healthier option even for people without food allergies. Now I'm just waiting for my local grocery stores to get in the game! Would love to be able to purchase these in stores.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: These cookies have a great flavor and no aftertaste that I can detect. I do not find them gritty at all. They are quite crispy, but I like that. I think they are as good as any regular sugar cookie I have ever had, and my non-GF friends agree!

review/summary: Light and crispy cookie
review/text: I am very pleased with the light crispy texture and sweet taste - so far the best GF oatmeal cookie I have found. It does not have a traditional chewy oatmeal texture, but still great and even better available through Amazon!

review/summary: Crispy Airy
review/text: These are fabulous! I saw in an online review of Dr. Lucy's cookies someone complaining about broken cookies when they arrived. Yes, some of the cookies will be broken, though not a lot. I think they break because of their unusual texture. I wish I knew the trick of making a cookie like this. They taste great, but a big part of what I just love about these cookies is their texture -- it's that airyness and crispness. Personally, they are addictive. I finished my first two boxes (I had bought, as a test, one of the 16 pack boxes in Cinnamon and one in Sugar) and sadly after a month or so I had eaten them all. I tried baking something simliar and couldn't do it -- though when I have mroe time, I'll give it many more tries. So just a couple days ago, I ordered a 16 pack box or cinnamon, sugar, and now I'm trying for the first time the oatmeal. I do recommend these cookies; they are my afternoon treat -- one pack of cookies (only 120 calories) and a good cup of decaf coffee and I'm fine till dinner!

review/text: These were wonderful. I don't know how they make these so crunchy and airy at the same time. I bought a 16 pack box of these and got in the habit of having a bag (only 120 calories for 4 good-sized cookies) of these every afternoon when I got sluggish. I began to look forward to their cinnamony taste and was bummed when I finally finished all of them. I tried to make some like them and it was a sad failure so just a couple of days ago, I ordered another box of these and the Sugar cookies (they are wonderful, too!) and I even ordered the Oatmeal ones so I can try those and see if they are as good as the others. I highly recommend these!

review/summary: Great cookies!
review/text: I absolutely love these cookies. I bought them when they orginally had a discount on them and at first bite I fell in love. Having Celiacs, it's really hard to find a good cookie but the oatmeal in these make them taste homemade. If the price was better, I would have give it 5 stars. Great for lunches or to send with kids when they can't have regular treats.

review/summary: Awesome Cookies and great package size!
review/text: My daughter tried these cookies at a celiac camp she was at and fell in love wih them.  In addition to her loving the cookies, what is great about them is their grab bag type.  Being gluten/dairy/perservative/dye free often she feels different (and a little embarrassed) with the types of foods she eats.  This size is like having something most of her peers eat but it's healthy.  Another benefit is her non-gluten sensitive brother also loves them.  That is the real test, if the gluten eating kids like it!

review/summary: Tasty, and sweet
review/text: When I first tried the cookie, I wasn't expecting it to be so crispy.  I didn't like it until after a few bites.  They definetly took care of my sweet tooth!  I would recommend these to any one with food allergies
