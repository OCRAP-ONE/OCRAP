review/text: All of the EDEN ethnic rice and bean combos are great! I always add something fresh to them to make a one-bowl meal. The Moroccan rice and beans has a hint of cinnamon, so I like to cook it with apple chunks or slices.

review/summary: Nasty sticks of wax.
review/text: I love licorice - usually.  The cherry flavor has very little, if any cherry flavor.  They taste like sticks of wax.  I don't think I'll be able to even give this nasty stuff away.  I'm really kind of angry that I paid this much for what I thought would be regular, delicious licorice.  It's not hard or stale, just has a horrible waxy type feel and flavor.  Maybe I can save it by melting it all together, adding a wick, and making candles out of it?  At least the color is pretty.

review/summary: Finest Basmati Rice
review/text: We have been eating this rice for past 8 years and the rice has absolute consistent quality and texure every time we make it. We have been buying this from an ethnic store but now Amazon has the rice at even a better price. Would recommend soaking the rice for 30 min or so for best results.<br /><br />This rice is grown in the foothills of Himalayas and is enriched with minerals and natural Aroma. We have cooked many dishes including some Tea Rice and they are to die for. We would highly recommend this brand of Rice for your entire family.

review/summary: Fantastic Rice....Love it !
review/text: We've been buying Arya Basmati rice for years and prefer it over any of the other varieties we have tried. We are thrilled for it to be available on Amazon and even more to find out that it is the best selling rice on Amazon. It is perfectly aged, quite fragrant, not sticky and lends itself to countless recipes and culinary applications. This is one of those rice that one can eat plain, without any seasoning or additional flavorings.<br /><br />We do not agree with the previous reviewer about the bag and packaging. All major Basmati brands come in this kind of packaging to avoid infestation by providing oxygen, cost of material, ease of storage and of course recycling of the bags to save natural resources. Plastic containers on the other hand pollute our system and add price without adding any value to the rice. The true Basmati rice is aged for a min 1 year to give a full flavor of aroma when cooked and they are stored in such bags, only in large quantities.<br /><br />Basmati can be cooked in many different ways with many many different dishes. One of our favorite and quick recipe for Basmati rice is below.<br /><br />Recipe for Peas Pulao:<br />Ingredients<br />2 cups water<br />2 tablespoon oil<br />1 cup Basmati rice<br />1/4 cup frozen green peas<br />1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds<br />Salt to taste<br /><br />Directions<br />Saut&eacute; cumin seeds in oil using a saucepan, until light brown.<br />Add rice, peas, water to the saucepan and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 12 minutes.<br />When rice is cooked, stir gently to fluff it up.  Cover and let stand for 5 minutes.

review/summary: Best Basmati Rice
review/text: We have tried several Basmati Rice over the years and finally settled on this brand. It really has full length grain and gives the aroma of a true basmati as it should. Most of the other brands we have tried are either blended rice or not real Basmati at all and were still called Basmati. It is on our regular buy cycle from Amazon. We highly recommend everyone to try it.<br /><br />The basmati rice should only be judged after it is cooked and tasted. We love the fact that this rice is packed in a jute bag which is bio-degradable and not packaged in some fancy plastic box or other material with is not good for our environment. The rice should be washed before it is cooked and soaked for 20-30 minutes for the best results after cooking. Amazon also sells a 2 lb version of this same rice but we like the 10 lb version as it is better price per oz and we consume a whole lot of rice.<br /><br />Update: August 14, 2010<br /><br />Still the same wonderful product and the same aromatic flavor of this perfect rice.

review/text: You'll love this best tasting rice on the market.  Don't forget to wash the rice before you put it in your rice cooker or if you prefer to boil and strain it. It makes a difference.  We also soak the rice for minimum 30 mins before cooking and be sure to add a tablespoon ofolive oil (Veg oil also ok) . The rice comes out outstanding and a real treat to eat. Buy this or the 2lb package they have to try it. Must try it to see the real difference.

review/summary: I like the rice, it's the packaging they need to work on
review/text: The rice is good.  We've been eating Basmati rice for a long time, and before finding this on Amazon we've purchased all our rice at the local grocery store in those small single meal packages.<br /><br />I read the reviews on here, so was aware of the packaging problem when I received my first order.  Just as everyone had written, packaging was very poor.  Due to the packaging issues, I decided to transfer the rice into a sealed container.  I recommend doing this for any bulk product, since you'll want to seal anything you'll be storing for more than a week.  However, even though I was aware of the packaging issues, I still accomplished to spill a couple ounces of rice all over the kitchen counter and floor.  That's how poor the packaging is!  It's almost as if someone was playing some trick on me, because I poored almost all the rice into the container and thought it went quite well.  No real problems, so I figure these other people probably just happened to get a bad bag.  So when I got down to the last couple ounces, I thought it would be easier to pull the plastic bag out (which is inside the mesh sack) and pour the remainder into the container.  Guess what?  A hole at the very BOTTOM of the plastic bag.  Believe me when I say, a couple ounces of rice is a lot of work to clean up.<br /><br />I must say, though, that after transferring the rice to the container, I smelled this wonderful aroma.  I've never actually smelled the scent of rice before, and this was pleasant.  The rice cooked just as well as any other rice we've prepared, and it had the same hint of taste as the aroma.  Very good rice for our common Indian curriies and Thai stir fry dishes.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the packaging.

review/text: This rice is a Himalaya Mt. range crop. It arrived in a hemp bag. It has nutrition information on a tag stringed to it. However, there is no instructions for preparation. It is wonderfully aromatic. It has taken some experimentation to cook it. At first I measured probably too much water and seemed flaky. However, by decreasing the measure of water to rice, I have found it best, because it tastes firm and somewhat chewy. Bon Appetite.

review/summary: Aroma overpowered by bag, rice stale
review/text: I should have listened to the negative reviews, but I thought they had experienced a fluke... perhaps the bags ruptured during transport and caused the problems they reported? Surely the positive reviews outweighed the negative. Well, my bag arrived intact and undamaged but the inner bag was, as stated by others, unsealed and exposed to the air. This might have been good rice when it originally shipped from the vendor, but by time it left the distribution center and arrived at my door the rice was stale, tainted by the odor of the bag, and inedible by my standards. I eat rice every day, but I will not be eating this rice.

review/summary: Ok quality basmati rice but poorly packaged
review/text: Ok quality, stadard basmati rice - But packaging is a problem. Comes in a hessian bag which is totally unnecessary - The plastic bag within the hessian (which holds the rice) was mostly open when the rice arrived (meaning that the rice was open to the air). The rice had taken on a smell from the hessian (which changed the taste even once it was cooked). The hessian smell was stronger than the usual (lovely) distinct basmati smell. After 2-3 weeks of storage the rice started to go stale and developed yellow/brownish patches on some grains.

I set it up on a regular refill schedule so I got a discount.  It comes to the door and I don't have to think about it.  I can cancel the refill schedule anytime I want.  Very cool.

review/text: I think this rice is fantastic.  I have not had any of the packaging problems some other people have mentioned (and I would not be happy if I did - I do hope that issue is resolved).  Mine arrived fully intact and the rice itself is of the highest quality I have ever seen.  This is a product from Pakistan as that is clearly marked on the bag I purchased.  I use a little less water than is recommended by my rice cooker and it has always come out absolutely perfectly.  Each rice kernal is separated and fluffy and perfect.  Flavorful and aromatic.  I just love it.  I also highly recommend the Aroma ARC-856 rice cooker that is sold by Amazon.<br /><br />Here is how I cook this rice.  Using the measuring cup from my rice cooker - 2 cups of rice, 2 and 1/3rd cups of water, a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil (I use extra virgin olive oil if out), a taste of butter, sea salt, a dash of cinamon and a fair amount of fresh ground black pepper.  My mouth is watering just typing this :)<br /><br />I would love to read your favorite recipe in my comments section.

review/summary: Best sausage ever.
review/text: Might not even be considered a sausage, whatever, don't care.  Best I've ever tasted, got it off of a deal site, ran low, looked around in stores for other dried sausages in a desperate attempt to find a replacement.  I tried about a dozen different brands from different parts of the country (I travel a lot), all of them tasted very greasy, just an oily, fat, near-seasonless mess.<br /><br />This company, and this dried sausage are de-friggin-licious.  It doesn't come off as "greasy" at all, and it has SO much flavor, and is so condensed it's hard to even compare it to anything else.  I've never had anything like it, and I eat less of it at a time because it's so flavorful.<br /><br />I will be buying more when I get low again, and I can't recommend it enough.

The first month we received dry brownies that were slightly smashed and crumbling. The second month was a small dry marble bundt cake (no way would it serve 8-12 even if you wanted to) and just now received white chocolate chip cookies that were (you guessed it) dry. Hard to believe that they are getting away with selling a dozen or so average-at-best brownies and a few more cookies for $28 a pop. This is a great racket for them, but hopefully I can post this review in enough places that they won't take anymore people in. Definitely NOT gourmet - do not order this.

review/text: The gift I received from Amazing Clubs was phenomenal. I got a shipment of dessert brownies and they were delicious. They were packed in a red tin and were kept incredibly fresh. I got two kinds, one seemed to be a coconut brownie and the other double chocolate. The coconut brownie was so fudgey and the coconut spread was prepared perfectly. It matched the fudgeyness of the brownie and had a great flavor. I thought that the double chocolate ones were going to be dry because I waited to eat them, but to my surprise they were just as good as the coconut ones. I received my shipment right on time and in perfect condition. I even called to inquire about when I would receive my gift, and customer service was able to track my order and give me a delivery date, not to mention they explained how my gift would be selected. I would highly recommend the brownies, they make a great gift and for someone looking for new gift ideas, Amazing Clubs is a great resource. Although most of these gifts I would probably take for myself before I could gift them. I cannot wait for my next shipment to see what I get next! Great gifts for a fair price.

review/summary: Disappointing Desserts
review/text: For Christmas, I was given the very generous gift of 6 months of Amazing Clubs "Dessert of the Month."  Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the professionalism of the company, particularly given how much my relative invested in what was truly a thoughtful and unique gift. The company does not provide either nutrition information or, perhaps more importantly, a list of ingredients, for most of their desserts. This can pose a serious risk to individuals with any food allergy.  Upon requesting such information,  I was simply told, and I quote: "We choose not to disclose our vendor's information to keep our clubs exclusive and a continuous surprise for our members." Of the six months of dessert we received, three desserts arrived with issues. We received a mango tart in dry ice that had clearly melted/evaporated. Since I didn't have the list of ingredients, nor any knowledge of how long it had been sitting "unrefrigerated," I had to throw the entire tart out. We received a cheese cake in the same state.  Cookies were shipped, one month, and upon receipt they were dry, and every one was broken and crumbling. This is not to say that every dessert was bad. We got two months of brownies (which were superb) and one month of a coffee cake (which did come with nutrition info/ingredients).  Dessert products aside, the shipments were always on time. While the company offers a wide variety of other clubs to try, given my experience with the Dessert of the Month club, I would be very hesitant to try any of the other options.

review/text: I have yet to try this product personally, because it is not currently available at our supermarket. But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/summary: No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts
review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

review/text: I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste. But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great.

review/summary: Yummy~My treat instead of High Sugar Cookies.
review/text: First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda.<br />I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.

review/text: Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a "sweet" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/summary: Fab, as long as you understand what's in them!
review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

review/summary: Good enough!
review/text: For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

review/text: I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!

review/text: My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/summary: Big Chocolate Taste
review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/text: I've really enjoyed these cookies, and came to Amazon as this one is hard to find. Much to my SHOCK the price is 60+ dollars.. and it shows they used to be 30.00 and some change? Huh?? Other cookies by Murray are more reasonable. No way will I buy them at this incredible markup :-P

review/summary: Disappointed with Amazon
review/text: Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite.

review/text: Have a family member that is diabetic, so I always keep some of these on hand for when we get together and standard sweets are not an option.  Very tasty.  They used Splenda, so that will be a pro or con to you, depending on if you like it.<br /><br />I am very thankful for these cookies for helping to provide a bit or normalcy for this family member.  Just like normal cookies, but sugar-free.  Several great varieties.  Worth a try if you are looking for a sugar-free cookie.

review/summary: This tea has a great maple taste
review/text: I am very into dessert teas and drink a good collection of them, both caffeinated and de-caffeinated.  One of my favorites was Celestial Seasonings Maple Vanilla Tea, but I can't get that tea these days.  So, I went looking for another brand with a maple flavor and decided to try this one.  I wasn't sure if the vanilla flavor not being there would be a detriment.  It turns out it's not necessary and I found another maple tea to enjoy.  It has a smooth and mile maple flavor.

Brewed a cup, took one sip and dumped out the rest of the cup.  It tasted of perfume.<br /><br />I brought the remaining bags to work and a couple months later there are still many left in the package and there are over 25 tea drinkers in the building.

review/summary: Love White House Coffee
review/text: We have been drinking White House Coffee for at least 30 years with the exception for about a year when we bought unroasted beans and roasted them ourselves. White House Coffee has been very consistent in quality and the vacuum pack with the nitrogen valve is a major factor in storage life. We have tried many varities but have always preferred Colombian Supremo. The 12 oz packs are very nice since they help keep the beans fresh and can be used up fairly quickly. We have relatives in Colombia and when we visited there we showed up with White House Colombian Supremo in our luggage! We even took our own Coffee Mate in one gallon plastic bags!!! We were probably the first people to bring a WHITE POWDER INTO COLOMBIA IN THEIR LUGGAGE :-) Luckily, our luggage was not searched in customs! Try White House Coffee and I think you will love it as we do. But if you visit Colombia leave the white powder at home - probably more prudent :-)

review/summary: I didn't receive WHITE coffee beans
review/text: I thought I was going to get a "light" coffee bean. When I got my items the roast degree indicator on all 3 of my bags have a circle in the middle of the indicator. So what I received and what I see in the picture are 2 different things. I am going to contact amazon and see if they actually have the "light" roast like I wanted. I haven't tasted it yet because I want to see what amazon tells me so for now I can't give a full review and real ratings. I will be updating my review soon as I hear something back.<br /><br />Update: Ok the same day I wrote this review (yesterday) amazon got back to me extremely fast and I wasn't able to get back into this review to update until now. Anyway, An Amazon customer service rep sent me a very detailed e-mail which I felt was very informative and show overall great customer service. To sum things up, they don't have this coffee in the "light" roast. So now the only thing left to do is taste the coffee. I bought a coffee grinder from Amazon and I am still waiting for it to arrive and when it does. I will be back to finish my review. i'm adding 2 more stars for the fabulous customer service I received.

review/summary: Quality food your dogs will love!
review/text: My mother feeds her 3 dogs all sorts of Merrick foods. (Grammy's Pot Pie, Turducken, etc.) Her dogs all love it & the vet says Merrick is one of the best, as all the ingredients are natural with no preservatives or (*gasp!) roadkill or dog/cat meat added, as is common in the cheaper brands.<br /> My one complaint with Merrick is that I have seen weight gain in all of the dogs, although they are being fed a little under the recommended amount. They receive dry food for lunch & some canned Merrick for dinner. I think because of some of the sugars found in the fruits used & how heavy some of the food appears it is sticking to their bones more, so to speak.<br /> On the other hand, I cook my own dog food for my little ones (brown rice, ground beef/turkey, homemade veggies like zucchini, spinach, corn, carrots, celery with water to boil) & their weight is maintained at a healthy 9 lbs. When I had surgery I put them on Merrick for two weeks & they both reached 11 lbs. Doesn't sound like a lot, but it could be for little dogs.<br /> In the end I recommend Merrick as it is all natural & dogs love it. Just keep your eye on their weight & all will go well.
