review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: We are always looking for GF products for our family since we have a son who has gluten sensitivities. Rarely we find a product that everyone in the family is willing to eat. These bread sticks are so yummy we all enjoy them! They're easy to prepare and versatile- They are delicious on their own but I do add additional ingredients (i.e. spices, or a little shredded cheese) to change things a bit from time to time, and still the bread sticks turn out perfect.

review/summary: Fantastic ingredients list, O.K. food
review/text: I bet you're wondering with such an ingredients list how a pet food could be less than exceptional. The truth is, Chicken Soup for the Cat Lovers' Soul is a great food to feed your cat, but maybe not ideal.<br /><br />I have tested several different pet foods on my felines (everything from Special Kitty to Innova). We have three beautiful cats, a Calico DSH, a Blue Russian, and a beautiful Persian. I have found some pros and cons to Chicken Soup.<br /><br />First off, the ingredients are fantastic, no doubt. From fresh Turkey to spinach and blueberries, the list is sure to impress any conscious shopper. I have no problem feeding this food, if it were simply for the ingredients alone, and at at least a dollar cheaper and a pound more than the nearest competition, it really seems like a great deal up front.<br /><br />Our cats love the taste of it and most any cat I've encountered has never refused this food. They love it.<br /><br />My cons with Chicken Soup is that all of our felines develop a deficiency of vitamin E, obviously noted in their coats. With other foods, their coat is silky, shiny, and just a joy to pet. When we switch to Chicken Soup, their coats feel firmer, rougher, and more matted. Their eyes are not as bright. We've tried this switch a couple of times and it happens each time we switch to Chicken Soup.<br /><br />And even though our cats adore the taste of Chicken Soup, their energy levels aren't quite as competent as normal, compared to when they are being fed holistic, grain-free foods (Taste Of The Wild, Blue, Innova)<br /><br />So to wrap it up,<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />Value<br />Wonderful, fresh ingredients<br />Cats love the taste<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Grains<br />Vitamin deficient<br />Decrease in energy level and coat texture<br /><br />Also, the ingredients list on Amazon.com is no longer applicable. Here is what the current product's ingredients are :<br /><br />Chicken, chicken meal, cracked pearled barley, turkey meal, powdered cellulose, white rice, potatoes, oatmeal, millet, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, salmon, turkey, duck, ocean fish meal, flaxseed, sodium bisulfate, egg product, potassium chloride, DL-methionine, choline chloride, dried chicory root, taurine, dried kelp, carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries, spinach, dried skim milk, cranberries, rosemary extract, parsley flake, yucca schidigera extract, L-Carnitine, dried fermentation products of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, dried Trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, zinc proteinate, vitamin E supplement, niacin, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, copper sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, vitamin A supplement, biotin, potassium iodide, calcium pantothenate, riboflavin, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, manganous oxide, sodium selenite, vitamin D supplement, folic acid.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

review/summary: Great cat food! All natural with wonderful ingrediants!
review/text: Just researched the best foods for my pets and this cat food is rated VERY highly so I've changed from Iams to it.  (Iams is not a good food in terms of ingrediants, nutrients etc. and I was shocked to find that out.)  This food is SO MUCH better and is packed with protien!  My cats eat a lot less of it because it has the right stuff instead of all those 'fillers' the other foods have!  It also has hair ball control (even though it doesn't state that it does) because I contacted this company for that info.  The lite version and the Senior variety both feature the hairball control.  So far my cats are loving it and I see less 'waste' in their litter boxes!  Still in transition though as you should take 1-2 weeks to change over food lines 100%.

review/summary: Dry Cat Food - Chicken Soup Soul
review/text: Delivery of this product was excellent and in a very timely manner, however my cats do not like the food. First they ate a few morsels, then they lost interest. This was all the food I had so they were stuck eating it until I gave in and bought their favorite (Science Diet). My cats are not picky eaters but with this food they were not happy at all. This food is to expensive to throw out to the birds so I will just keep it in my car and use it to feed stray dogs or cats. 5 stars for delivery and ease of ordering, 0 stars for the product itself.

review/summary: Great food at a great price
review/text: One of my cats is an extremely picky eater, and has a very weak stomach.  I tried various other "quality" foods, and she wouldn't touch them, or she'd throw up daily.  Finally this is one she seems to like, and she rarely throws up anymore.  Both of my cats seem very healthy and happy, and their fur is soft, shiny and luxurious after several months of eating this, plus one can of Fancy Feast canned food every day.  The ingredient list for "Chicken Soup" is actually better than Iams or Science Diet, neither of which Peaches liked, so, at roughly half the price, I think this one's a keeper.

review/text: The can of soup was $3.50 at my local co-op. It was not worth the money. It tasted like an instant potato flake soup you would get at a buffet. It had the consistency of baby food, a faint hint of garlic and one or two tiny pieces of potato in the whole can. I'm not picky when it comes to soup out of a can, but this was very disappointing. I just wanted a simple, chunky potato soup and got some bland puree. Save your money.

review/summary: Vegan Natural Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Incredibly wonderful aroma from the moment you carefully open the pop-top can. Huge bouquet of India spices. Very spicy. Very hot. 100% authentic. "A ticket to India" in every can. Not for those without a sense of adventure or experience with intensely full flavor Indian cuisine. My first spoonful by chance (and luck because I enjoy them) had a whole green chili. The fresh ginger shreds are divine. Unbelievably delicious. Great with whole wheat vegan tortillas if don't have chapatis or naan [Indian breads] available. Also great with organic white or brown rice. A new top shelf spicy standard for prepared Indian. Another warning (and kudo) that this recipe pulls no punches. "Truly Indian." Some of my friends in India do not normally make food this hot in their own homes [which is not to say that there also are not incredibly delicious recipes that are no so far up on the hotness scale.] A jewel for those looking for this type of food experience! I still can't believe it. Choley or chole along with chana are Indian words for chickpea which are some of my very favorites dishes in Indian cuisine. Eleven stars. Made with chickpeas, tomato, onion, water, cottonseed oil, ginger, garlic, coriander, salt, green chilis, melon seeds, tamarind, cumin, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, poppy seeds, nutmeg, bay leaf, and fenugreek. 600 calories and 20g protein per 15.8 oz/450g can. Product of India. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

review/summary: Good But Different
review/text: I must agree with the first reviewer that it didn't spread as easily as the CheezWhiz in the jar.  It is a lot thicker than it used to be.  At one time we could buy the cans in our local Cubs stores in the Twin Cities, but they have since stopped carrying them.  Then, it was exactly the same as the CheezWhiz in the jars, and very spreadable.  Now I have to scoop a little out to soften in the microwave before I use it, if I want to spread it on a sandwich or crackers.  The taste is about right to me and I do use this product on everything: sandwiches, sauces, casseroles, you name it.  I really love CheezWhiz and I will purchase the can again when I run out of the other one.  It would be handy to store if they still came with the big plastic lid.  I have made my own CheezWhiz in the past, and if you make your own you can control how thin or thick it is.  If you want to make your own, cube a two pound log of Velveeta, and add it to the top of a double boiler, along with a cup of milk, a stick of butter or margarine, a pinch of sugar, and that's it.  You cook it on low heat, give it a stir now and then, and at the end you have a CheezWhiz like product.  I generally used more than one cup of milk when I made it.  When my kids were small, it was cheaper to make it, now it's about the same price, so I just buy it.

It has that smokey taste that one wants with burgers, fries, little smokies, and chicken strips that most folks like, without the hurt on the pocket book. This is a great dipping flavor, and is thicker than the orignial, great on wings, just a hint of sweet.  A universal versitle brand and flavor for most consumers.

I did try in the last part of the bottle to mix it with some sparkling water, it changed the taste to a more sour/tart flavor, that was so much less refreshing.<br /><br />I would like to try this over ice as well some time.

review/text: I've been a green tea drinker for many years, and I've enjoyed aloe vera drinks from my local Asian food market, as well. I believe pretty strongly in the health aspects of both. So I was looking forward to seeing how the two combined in this drink.<br /><br />The green tea taste comes through pretty well, though sweetened a lot (I tend to drink my green tea hot and plain). I'm not too familiar with passion fruit, so I cannot gauge the strength of that flavor, other than that there's a tiny hint of tart in there. I found the aloe vera bits -- just like in those drinks I enjoy at the Asian market -- delightful and authentic, not gross at all.<br /><br />The ingredient list is pretty simple -- and natural, which I appreciate: really just water, cane sugar, green tea leaves, aloe vera, citric acid and natural flavor. I would love to see this drink unsweetened (or artificially sweetened, though I'm often torn about the value of artificial sweeteners), as I'm trying to cut out the sugar. But overall, it's a pleasant-tasting drink.

review/summary: Weird, medicinal, and not very healthy considering it's so excited about its "green tea infusion"
review/text: This is the newest aloe-based tea entry from Chantea. It's a "health drink" that touts its green tea component prominently on its label, which wisely is a wraparound given that its inclusion of tons of little pulpy bits is going to put many drinkers off. Except for orange juice and the like, most people don't have a lot of experience with non-smooth clear drinks--this looks and feels in the mouth a lot more like bubble tea or mega-pulpy orange juice.<br /><br />The taste: oddly medicinal, with the passionfruit carrying the tone of the drink and a strange astringent aftertaste that lingers way too long on the tongue. I didn't taste much green tea in this, but that's not a huge shock given that the first two ingredients on the label are water and sugar. The main flavors are "sweet" and "strange fruity sensation." Indeed, this tiny little 11.5oz container is apparently considered 1.5 servings (another thing that will put off American drinkers at least, who are accustomed to consuming a bottled drink at one go and certainly won't pour out only 2/3 of the drink and save the rest for later), which makes it possible for the manufacturer to put its carb count at 20g rather than the 30g it probably should get--which makes it pretty much an uncarbonated soda. I'm very put off by the fast-and-loose game played with the nutritional label.<br /><br />The texture was also unpalatable. I'm no stranger to pulpy bits in my drinks, but these were as numerous as they were undefinable. Were they aloe bits (doubtful but possible, but they looked precisely like an orange's pulp)? Were they passionfruit (way more likely but passionfruit pulp is not in the ingredient list)? The ingredient list gave no indication whatsoever what I was tasting.<br /><br />I think this drink would appeal way more to consumers who are used to pulpy drinks like bubble tea and who don't mind drinking that much sugar water--and who are way way into passionfruit. For me, as much as I'd looked forward to trying it, I couldn't finish the bottle.

review/summary: Tasty textured tea
review/text: This green tea is much more sweet in the vein of Asian "bubble tea" (minus the tapioca pearls, of course) than the fake-tasting cloying sweetness of American teas like Arizona.  The floating bits of fruit pulp and the distinct aftertaste of passion fruit also make it clear this is something unusual.  I couldn't taste the aloe vera, but the tea is a little "heavier" than one would expect if used to plain green tea.<br /><br />I found it refreshing with spicy food but a bit too substantial to drink by itself.<br /><br />The bright packaging and Asian-looking design invoke Japanese design, and the taste is similar to drinks I've had on my travels as well as in Asian restaurants in the US.  Recommended.

review/text: The Chantea Aloe Vera Green tea, Passion Fruit is delicious, however I could have done without the bits of fruit floating through the drink and into my mouth.  Just not a feature of a drink I prefer.  I probably won't buy it because of the bits of fruit, which is disappointing because I really enjoyed the taste of the tea overall and would have liked to gotten the benefits offered of the Aloe vera and Passion Fruit.

review/summary: Ok, taste, but too many calories  and too expensive
review/text: In the past I've enjoyed drinks with Aloe Vera. And I love green tea, so I had high hopes for this drink.  The taste is ok, though the bits of passion fruit make give it a texture that is rather slimy. That combined with the fact a one cup serving has 80 calories, makes this a drink I would have to pass up.  This might not be a problem for green tea drinkers that are not worried about calories, but they might be turned off by the bits of passion fruit floating around in the drink.  Also the price is a bit prohibitive.  It works out to $2.08 per bottle, which seems a bit much for an 11.5 oz drink.

review/summary: Your enoyment may depend on how much you like the pulp
review/text: There are a great many green tea products available to the consumer, to say the least. I think what distinguishes this from the others is that this one really has a lot of pulp in it. The taste is pleasant and similar to others but the pulp does give it a bit of a different taste and one that is not common in green teas.<br />I'm not a huge green tea drinker but I thought it was pretty good, my son the green tea drinker was less of a fan. Average it to 3.5 stars then. I think this may appeal to some and not to others- you'll have to try it and see what you think.

review/summary: If you love aloe vera, this is the drink for you!
review/text: First of all, I am a big fan of both tea and aloe vera so when I saw the combination of the two, I had to try it. And I am so glad I did. This drink is absolutely delicious! You will get more of the aloe vera flavor than any green tea. I only got a slight taste of the green tea but that's all right.<br /><br />This is a great drink if you love aloe vera. If you're not sure if you would like it, be warned that the drink is very true to aloe vera drinks and there are little bits of it in it. So if you are willing to give it a try, you won't be disappointed, just know that there are little bits of it in there. Both my husband and I loved this and will be getting more!

At first I thought the product was bad but upon futher investigation realized that it was slivers of some sort of fleshy fruit or vegetable possibly aloe vera.  My husband refused to try it and so did every one else that I offered it too.  If you like this type of beverege you will most likely enjoy this one.  Not my kind of tea.

review/summary: Interesting flavor and texture
review/text: The Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea was interesting.  It had a pleasant and mild flavor, which wasn't too sweet.  The passion fruit flavor was very refreshing, but the tea itself didn't appeal to us very much.  The tea felt slightly thick from the aloe vera juice, and the passion fruit bits felt weird in our mouth.  It was more than just pulp, as you'd find in orange juice.  The passion fruit bits were like little bubbles of fruit in the tea.  Though my husband, two teen daughters and myself all said we liked the flavor, none of us cared for the texture.  We each drank a few sips, but none of them wanted to finish off the bottle.  I finished it, but it probably isn't something our family will ever choose to buy.

This is not really a healthy drink either, it has too much sugar which makes the drink too sweet, and from the label it appears to be watered down tea? I don't like it and it is definitely not worth paying the price. I wouldn't buy this if it was going for a quarter.

review/summary: Yummy--A Bit Like Exotic Lemonade
review/text: Here's what I like about Chantea:<br /><br />I love most of the ingredients, including the aloe, green tea, and passion fruit.<br />I love the color.<br />I like the bottle shape.<br />I like the graphic colors (though I think the logo/branding could be better).<br />I love how the bits of passion fruit (or aloe) remind me of real, homemade lemonade.<br /><br />Here's what I don't like:<br /><br />It's too sweet for my taste (though I do appreciate that if one must sweeten something that would taste good without it, that they used cane sugar!)<br /><br />Sugar is the second ingredient after water. How about more passion fruit to make it sweeter and less sugar? How about no added sugar at all. Or how about making one drink sweetened and one unsweetened.  I'd drink a lot of the latter. I'll rarely drink the former. Here's the thing. It seems to me that anyone interested in aloe and green tea is interested at least in part for health reasons. So what's this with the sugar thing?<br />----<br />The reviewer is a health fanatic, author, and marketer.

review/summary: Not my type of drink
review/text: I have to say that I was pretty excited about getting this tea.  The name and description sounded wonderfully healthy and quite tasty.  I am a big proponent of Green Tea and Aloe Vera juice, but this drink has way to many sugars.  19 grams of sugar is quite a bit of sugar to qualify as a healthy drink.  In all honesty, though, this company hasn't touted this as a "healthy" drink, but the inclusion of Aloe Vera made me assume that it was.  Its ingredients are water, cane sugar, green tea infusion, aloe vera, citric acid and passion fruit flavor.  It has a sweet flavor and added pulp of some sort.  I don't taste the tea at all, but rather it tastes like sugar water with pulp.  I just don't care for it at all.  Maybe it is just my taste buds, but this didn't do it for me at all.

review/summary: Pleasant flavor, but the floating chunks are definitely an acquired taste
review/text: Who knew that aloe vera would make a good drink flavor?  Surprisingly, it works well with the green tea and passion fruit in this non-carbonated cold tea drink. It's more subtle than a soda or sweetened iced tea, but still has enough flavor to be worth tasting. Health nuts will be pleased to see the first ingredient is water and there's no high fructose corn syrup, but it does still have a fairly high amount of sugar.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is a major downside here: there are disconcerting floating chunks of a jelly-like substance all throughout the entire bottle.  It doesn't matter how much or how little you shake it, every gulp will still have chunks in it. Anyone who regularly drinks kombucha or other non-standard health food store type drinks may not be bothered, but people who don't like large chunks floating in their drink can safely skip this one altogether.

review/summary: Not Bad At All...
review/text: I'm a big fan of brewed teas (I have a huge collection of tea herbs and spices) and I regularly brew up my own tea blends.  I don't normally buy the sort of "ready-made" tea that comes in individual serving size bottles.  I also don't usually care much for green tea.  Despite all that, when I saw this product, I just had to try it.  I was really intrigued by the bits of aloe vera, something I've never eaten before.  So, I went ahead and ordered one.<br /><br />First off, I really like pulpy drinks (like the Sac Sac Grape Pulp Drinks from Asian stores), so I knew that the bits of aloe vera in this drink wouldn't bug me at all.  And indeed, I did enjoy them.  However, if you don't like pulp, you'll really not like this drink.  As for the flavor...  It's not bad.  I've had things that had a bit more interesting flavors to them, but this one is a bit bland/mild tasting.  It's not terrible or anything though, just that I felt like the passion fruit maybe could've been a little stronger.  As for the green tea, I could hardly tell this had green tea in it.  That's great for people who don't like green tea (like myself) but not so great if that was what you were wanting from it.  As for the aloe vera, I'm not sure it really had a flavor at all, as all the bits in here seem to have simply absorbed the flavor from the tea, and thus I can't tell what they would've originally tasted like.  Oh well, the whole thing isn't bad though.<br /><br />As for nutritional content, well, this is mostly sugar and it tastes like the green tea is pretty weak, so I can't pretend that it's terribly healthy or anything.  To be fair, though, the product never claimed to be a health drink.  So, would I recommend this?  Well, I don't know.  I don't really like it enough to want to run out and buy more, but it's not bad, so I guess you'd just have to try one and see if you fall in love with it or not...

review/summary: Tasted the passion fruit, had the pulps, and had the refreshing effetc, but..
review/text: The taste does have a hint of passion fruit, but more sweet than fruit.  If you like a `fruity' tea without the heavy doses of fruit flavor then this could work for you; unless you do not like pulps.  You cant avoid the pulp texture in every gulp and what is a little interesting is the suspension of these pulps even when the bottle is rested for a while: real fruit related drinks you will find the heavier pulps separate and sits in the lower half of the container.  For the conscious eater, I am unlikely to purchase this item as part of my healthier eating plan, but rated on the ability of the drink to provide a `refreshing' sensation, then it does the trick.

review/text: When I open the bottle and took a sip, like others, I was startled by the little chicks of aloe vera in the drink. The green tea definitely had the fruity taste of the passion fruit and to me was a little sweet. Then I checked the label and saw that cane sugar was the second ingredient after water. To me, the passion fruit taste and the aloe vera pulp were the positives to this drink. The cane sugar amount was the negative.

review/summary: So It Turns Out I Do Not Like Chunks of Aloe In My Drink
review/text: I drink green tea every day, and I love any fruit flavor, so I figured this would be a good fit-- plus I was curious what it would be like to have pieces of aloe vera in a drink. Here is the play-by-play of how it went:<br /><br />Hey! My drink is here. This looks interesting. I'm going to drink it right now. Down the hatch!<br /><br />First sip: What the...? These chunks are in my way. They're, like, blocking the entrance of my drink. Fine, fine, maybe I shouldn't have shaken it up so hard. Maybe if I wait for the chunks to settle to the bottom, it won't be so weird.<br /><br />Five minutes later<br /><br />These chunks don't settle. They're in suspended animation. There are a million of them and they aren't going anywhere, so I guess I should just take another sip and see if I get used to it.<br /><br />Second sip: Nnnnnope, still gross. I hate these chunks. I don't mind pulp in my orange juice, but this is just bizarre and wrong. Also, it has a nasty aftertaste. Man, I have to review this. I can't review two sips. I'm going to have to force myself to keep going, in the name of science.<br /><br />Third sip: Why, God, why? Make this drink stop!<br /><br />Fourth: This is horrifying. Maybe I can foist this upon my unsuspecting 5-year-old. Maybe she'll like it and then I can report that 5-year-olds like it better than 36-year-olds.<br /><br />Daughter's first sip: "WHY DID SOMEONE MAKE THIS DRINK?"<br /><br />That about sums it up. Together, we managed to get through half the bottle before I gave up and flushed it. Two stars for creativity.

review/summary: Lots of pulp
review/text: From the hexagonal bottle shape to the pulpy liquid, Chantea is pretty interesting even before you open the bottle. The liquid is clear with a yellow-tint, and it definitely looks tasty. It's scent is nice; a typical green tea aroma with a hint of passion fruit.<br /><br />It doesn't have a strong taste. I'd say it's even a bit more mild than other chilled green-tea I've had. In fact, I'd compare it more closely with flavored water. The really novel part about this drink, however, is the pulp. Pulp is definitely not something you see in most bottled drinks, and it really adds a lot to the drink. The texture is very pleasant and juicy. I quite enjoyed it.<br /><br />The nutritional content is pretty typical of this type of drink. There are 120 calories total in the bottle (80 calories per serving, 1.5 servings per bottle). There's no fat, but there's not much in the way of vitamins either.

review/summary: Gooey, but Good
review/text: The Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea (Passion Fruit) was simply delicious, but its texture at first was off-putting.  This beverage differs from most green teas as it includes solid aloe vera, a slimey, jello-like product. Although as you continue to drink the tea, the aloe vera texture soon becomes entertaining as it squishes around your mouth.<br /><br />In all, it was refreshing drink and probably the best commercial green tea I've ever had. I'd buy it again and highly recommend it. The solid aloe vera adds health and an unique aspect to the drink that separates it from the pack.

review/summary: Very Interesting, Takes Some Getting Used To
review/text: I really enjoyed this drink, for a couple of reasons. First off, Chantea has a really nice taste. The texture of the liquid is very smooth, and while it's a little sweeter than I would have liked, it isn't cloying, and there isn't any of that artificial sweetener tang. You can definitely taste the tea, too.<br /><br /> To my surprise, the aloe vera pulp really helped make the drink. It was a little bit startling at first, mostly because the pulp was really more like chunks. But again, it was good. The nutrition isn't too bad (heavy on the sugar, though, take note) and it's very refreshing. I'd recommend it.

review/summary: I'm surprised, but I like it
review/text: When this arrived I held it up to the light, and saw pulp floating in the tea.  I've never been a fan of drinks with stuff floating in them, so I really thought I wouldn't like this.  I was wrong.<br /><br />I didn't like my first sip, either, since my first thought was that it was too sweet.  I'd just eaten a fairly strongly flavored dinner, and so I ate a couple of crackers to get rid of the taste of dinner.  Then I tried the tea again.<br /><br />It is sweet, but not too sweet to me, even though I usually drink green tea unsweetened.  The passion fruit flavor is just right--it's definitely there, but not too strong.  The aloe pulp was actually kind of fun.  It was very similar to drinking pulp in orange juice, but the pieces of pulp are a little larger than the ones in OJ.<br /><br />I like the bottle shape and design, too.  The slender shape is easy to hold, even with a hand that aches from too much keyboard and mouse work lately.  The threaded top of the bottle is a white plastic with a rounded rim, which feels better than a regular plastic bottle top, but even though I like it I wouldn't pay extra for it.<br /><br />I like this tea, and even though I won't be drinking it daily (since I need to cut back a bit on sugar,) it will be an occasional treat around here.

review/summary: There are solids in the tea
review/text: I really love hot tea, though I've not yet found a commercial iced tea that is to my liking.  Chantea has won awards, so I gave it a shot.  This beverage is basically a mix of green tea, sugar, a bit of passion fruit flavoring, and hunks of aloe vera.  Seriously, there are large and slimy solids in this tea.  I was expecting something more along the lines of pulp in orange juice.  Live and learn.  Aside from the chunks, I think many people will enjoy the flavor of this tea.  The balance of passion fruit flavoring is just right- not too overpowering, not too fake.  I am not a fan of sweetened tea, but many people are, and I did appreciate that this was sweetened with real sugar instead of some fake sweetener.  What really gets me is the aloe vera chunks.  They seem like a gimmick.  If I want to enjoy the health benefits of tea I'll brew my own without processing, bottling, and without sweeteners.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: I feel bad writing a completely negative review, but there was nothing that I liked about this drink.  The liquid portion was overly sweet (and I have a powerful sweet tooth, so it takes a lot to surpass my limit of acceptable sweetness), but that might have been alright if the drink had been smooth.  The vile part of this beverage, though, is that it has chunks of pulp floating throughout it, so you have to strain it through your teeth.  When I was a teenager, I bought a couple of bottles of a soft drink called Orbitz because it looked cool - it was an overly sweet liquid with tiny gummy spheres floating throughout, and after the cool factor wore off, I never bought another bottle.  This Chantea has almost exactly the same effect on me - from the outside, it looks cool, like an ordinary trendy healthy beverage, but the experience of drinking it is almost nauseating.  I do not recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Love this! Very refreshing.
review/text: The passion fruit flavor comes out loud and clear and the chunks of aloe vera added a pleasant textural variety. My only preferance would be a little less of the cane sugar sweetener, but most people won't have a problem with this as they prefer sweeter drinks.

review/summary: Mild but Satisfying
review/text: Chantea's Aloe Vera Green Tea (Passion Fruit) is a mildly flavored sweetened green tea with passion fruit flavor and bits of aloe vera.  The chunks of aloe vera are big enough to chew and add both texture and flavor to what would otherwise be a very bland drink.  The green tea flavor is too mild for me and the sweetness is restrained but I could do with a little less in a drink that aims to be healthy.  Overall, I really liked this drink.

review/summary: Super Refreshing
review/text: I was surprised, I actually liked this drink. I'm not a huge green tea fan (it often tastes a little flowery to me). I had seen drinks infused with aloe on my last trip to the local Korean market and was too timid to actually buy one, so I was happily surprised to see this as an option on the Vine program.  I would totally buy this drink now, though drinking it in February--I think it is better as a warm weather drink. It is really, really refreshing, the little aloe bits and an extra burst of cool (they are sort of like little pieces of peeled grape).  The flavor is subtle.  A good drink.

review/summary: Good flavor but too sweet
review/text: When I first looked at the contents of the bottle I wondered if it had actually survived the shipping without being contaminated.  The contents looked "thick" with bits of slimy looking things floating around in it.  However, the bottle was sealed and I decided the bits were the aloe floating around.  The taste is a pleasant fruity flavor that is not overly strong.  It is light and refreshing except for one small problem - it is very sweet.  There is a lot of sugar in this small drink, more sugar than I am allowed in a give day if I want to eat anything else.  There are 18 grams of sugar per serving and there are 1.5 servings in this little bottle.  Also, the bits of aloe are a little odd and, as I stated earlier, slimy.  They don't taste bad though and if you are someone who enjoys bubble tea, you will probably like these bits.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this tea to any of my calorie counting/diabetic friends, but those who have no issues with large quantities of sugar might really enjoy it.  Thus, I give it three stars.

review/summary: A little too sweet for me
review/text: I am reviewing this product for Amazon, I received it as a gift for that purpose. After examining the ingredients list I noticed this has an awful lot of sugar, the first ingredient is Water, then Cane Sugar, do not let that make you think of wow that is good sugar. Sugar is sugar. Yes sugar is sugar but it tastes good and yes it has calories but how many really? there are 80 cals per serving in this bottle. This product used real sugar and yes it is over processed but it tastes good. It aids in the flavor of this drink.<br /><br />As I opened this chilled drink I was mindful of the aroma. Grapefruit, that is what it was screaming to me but there was a more complex scent, passion fruit maybe? Yes indeed it is flavored with passion fruit and very nicely, I am drinking the second half of the bottle right now and I can tell you I love it.<br /><br />I just cannot seem to wrap my mind around the fact it has so much sugar, with that much sugar anything would taste this good. Ok so I am testing it, (right now as I write this review) it says it has 19 grams of sugar per serving.<br />Wait a minute, I just checked the label again, it is very hard to see letters since they are so small and the ingredients list is written in an obscure font and made a little hazy, to hide the fact is has 19 grams of sugar per serving? Hmm what is this, it is not one serving per bottle, it is 1.5 servings per bottle,why do they give you 1.5 servings are you going to share it with 1.5 people? So that means this entire bottle (only 11.5 oz.) has not just 19 grams of sugar but a hefty 27 plus grams of sugar.<br /><br />Do you know what 27 grams of sugar equates to in teaspoons?<br />Now this is not a scientific experiment by any means but I just used a very reliable scale and found that it takes 7 tsp. of sugar to come up with 27 grams of sugar and that is what is in this drink I just consumed. Wait let me reduce the stars on my rating to 3.....<br /><br />When I need a magnifying glass to see the ingredients list that makes me pause, and ask why? I guess we now know why, I never use more that about 3 tsp. sugar in any form per day I just used up my next few days.<br /><br />Let's see a cola drink has less sugar than this drink, why would I drink this, for a sugar high? not likely. I would give more comparisons but I do not used many processed foods to look on the labels.<br /><br />Diabetics stay away, this is not for you, in fact it is not for me, is this your kind of drink that you would want or better still, give to your children?<br /><br />The only thing right now that has anything going for it is the taste, so if you don't mind the 27 grams of sugar per bottle then be my guest you will enjoy it, it has a wonderful bright light flavor. Know that it also has a lot of pulp going through it, and according to the label it has natural flavors and not real fruit, so what is that stuff floating in it, it is not real fruit hmmm...<br /><br />The aftertaste is not so bad, I guess you can just cover that up by drinking another bottle of this sugar water.<br /><br />I am sorry folks but this review went down very fast, I am sorry I cannot recommend this drink due to it's over use of sweetener. In fact I will not be finishing it myself.

review/summary: Aloe pulp?  OK
review/text: I was not expecting the pulp, but it wasn't bad.  Just odd.  I don't think I've drunk aloe before, so I didn't know what to expect, but this was pretty good!  It's sweet (probably because cane sugar is the second ingredient after water), but not overly sweet.  The passion fruit flavor was good, and it didn't taste overly of green tea.  (I like flavored green tea, but I don't like it plain.)  It's healthier than a soda or many other "juice" drinks, and the price isn't too bad, especially if you subscribe and save.<br /><br />I checked Wikipedia (the repository of all accurate knowledge on the internet) and it mentioned that aloe vera has been used for digestive health, but there aren't a lot of studies supporting any of it.  (From personal experience, I can tell you it's great for minor burns - but only topically.  This probably won't help your sunburn.)  It also mentions that aloe vera can be toxic in high doses.  So drinking the entire 8-pack in one sitting might not be super smart.  At the very least, you might find out why some people swear by it as a laxitive.<br /><br />But for drinking one at a time - this is very tasty and might even be good for you.

review/summary: Beware of First Swallow And Then Enjoy a Tasty Cold Green Tea Drink
review/text: Some people will be turned off by ChanTea Green Tea & Aloe Vera with passion fruit flavor because of the particles that will enter their mouth when taking their first swig.<br /><br />In fact, without any warning, the first-time user might spit out the first drink not knowing what was entering their mouth. The particles, which have the texture of small, damp pieces of rice, actually are Aloe Vera pulp. I was not troubled by these rice-like particles entering my mouth but some will be.<br /><br />This Chantea Passion Fruit product is a ready-to-drink chilled green team beverage with Aloe Vera and all-natural ingredients. The passion fruit, native to South America, has a tart flavor that sweetens as the fruit ripens. The passion fruit combined with Taiwanese provides a tasty duo which is pleasant when chilled.<br /><br />My knowledge of Aloe Vera is that it might offer protection from the sun and/or help sunburn heal - either or both. Some believe Aloe Vera is a beauty enhancer. What I learned though is that Aloe Vera is a natural ingredient that contains helpful vitamins and minerals. Aloe Vera is said to detoxify the body and cleanse the colon, and specifically might help with digestive problems. Aloe Vera juice acts as an antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agent. And so the combination of Aloe Vera and passion fruit aims to provide a healthy yet tasty refreshing drink.<br /><br />I hesitate to affirm any of the health benefits but will recommend it as a tasty beverage for those, like myself, who enjoy green tea and cold beverages.

review/summary: Great taste, but pulpy...
review/text: Chantea Aloe Vera Passion Fruit is a medium-sweetness tea with about 120 calories per bottle. The first thing most people will notice about it (even before the flavor) is the pulp floating in the bottle. Slightly disconcerting, I never the less took a long swig.. and was pleasantly surprised. The taste was sweet but not overpowering; the tea and passion fruit have a nice mellow balance that would be great for dessert or sipping on a warm day. The pulp both adds and detracts from the experience - it tends to have both a sharp and sweet flavor when bitten into. When I am just relaxing and drinking slowly, that's fine - if I'm trying to drink too quickly or quench a deep thirst, the pulp gets in the way and is annoying.<br /><br />Rating: 4/5 Stars (served cold). I highly recommend it for those times people want a flavorful experience, but not for those when you just want to guzzle down a glass of something wet.

review/summary: Tasty, great if you like pulp. Small.
review/text: UPDATE: I will admit, I have been keeping my eyes open for this at the grocery stores and have not found it yet. I think back and admit I love the pulp! If this was a larger bottle and cheaper, I would keep some in my house! Thus, I've given it another star ;)<br /><br />This is my first aloe drink. To me there are two distinct aspects to this particular drink. First, most notably the pulp. There is lots of pulp. I had some with every sip, but it was never too much pulp. It made it a fun drink for me! Also,  I totally disagree with another reviewer, the pulp is not slimy. I guess that if you consider lemon pulp or orange (fresh) to be slimy, then you might not love this. I yhought that the pulp texture was nice. Secondly, the flavor itself. That was three stars to me. Not great, not bad, but not fresh or juicy..just a prefab juice flavor. Lastly, this is not a big drink, not enough to enjoy for long. Overall, three stars based on flavor and price value to me.

review/summary: Different yet delicious
review/text: In the spirit of Linsanity, I notice this is a product from Taiwan. Packaged attractively, the bottle is slightly smaller than I was expecting but the product inside surely makes up for it. I wasn't too sure about the Aloe Vera bits floating around....and it does feel a little wierd as I'm drinking it. But I was forewarned so it's actually quite pleasant ....a little like pulp in orange juice. The taste is wonderful - the slight bitterness of the green tea softened by the sweetness of the passion fruit. How healthy is it? It's hard to tell but I can certainly see why it won awards. If you care what goes in your body and you don't mind paying a little extra, this is an excellent product. Taste and see for yourself!

If there ever was a wonder plant with so many uses, it has to be aloe vera.  I have tasted a lot of aloe vera drinks over the years and I have to say that this is one of the best.  The mixture of passion fruit , aloe vera and green tea make this one a highly recommended beverage.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a healthy drink that is not only good for you but great tasting then you will want to try Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea (flavored with Passion Fruit) today!

review/summary: A little lumpy but overall pretty tasty...
review/text: I love tea.  I especially love green tea.  I also love passion fruit (they flavor everything with that these days, don't they) and I really love the soothing pallet cleansing quality of aloe vera.  So, I was particularly pleased to get to try this Chan Tea product; this green tea infusion.  I'll start by warning that this looks really unappealing upon receipt and that judging from the large amount of floating debris (pulp) and the murky green color one may be almost repulsed by the presence of this product.  That said; I had to try it, so I did and I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  First off, this really doesn't taste anything like green tea or passion fruit, but there is a familiarity to the flavoring so maybe the subtle hints are sparking memories on my tongue.  What I will say is that the flavor is solid, with no aftertaste at all and the sweet levels are balanced to the point where this tastes fresh and authentic and organic and, well, sort of delicious.  The texture of the drink can be a little off putting, considering that there is so much pulp your constantly rolling balls off the roof of your mouth.  Still, there is substantial flavor here so give it a whirl and see what you think.

review/summary: Too many flavors
review/text: Aloe. Green Tea. Passion Fruit.<br /><br />Choose any two. (Also, make the Passion Fruit less dominant than it is.) By combining all three flavors, it becomes too much. Especially since the passion fruit flavor is so overwhelming. Despite that, the aloe and green tea flavors are still discernible. (And the aloe obviously has aloe texture.)<br /><br />With regard to ingredients, it is apparently made with "all natural ingredients". There's no high-fructose corn syrup, for those of you who are into that sort of thing. The flavors are purportedly all natural. There's nothing on the ingredient label that an eleven-year old couldn't pronounce, so there's that.<br /><br />As a side note, and warning to anyone who might not know, aloe, while really good for your skin, should be consumed internally with moderation. For one thing, it's an allergen. So, before you buy a case of this stuff, buy a small sample and find out if you're going to be allergic. There is also a long history of aloe being used as a laxative. So...moderation.

review/text: Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit: This green tea and passion fruit drink was not my favorite. I did not like the pieces of pulp (made from what, nobody says) mixed in the tea. It had a distinct odor and taste that I did not like. The drink is basically sugar water. The first ingredient listed is water and the second ingredient listed is cane sugar. What is "Green Tea Infusion"?  Does passion fruit flavor mean that there is not real passion fruit in the drink? The calories per serving are listed as 80, but the total servings size is listed as 1 1/2 servings so you have to count the bottle as 120 calories instead of 80. I cannot recommend this Green Tea drink to anyone

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: When I tried this for the first time, I was mostly just intrigued by the idea of something different. I wasn't disappointed. The flavor of the aloe is mild, but distinct, accompanied well by the green tea and passion fruit flavors. The glassiness of the tea goes surprisingly well with cool, fresh taste of the aloe and the slightly tart passion fruit. The drink is sweet--not overly sweet, but I wish it was a little less sweet for my tastes. The biggest surprise was the mouth-feel or body of the drink, which has a viscous quality, reminiscent of very thin jelly. There's a good amount of pulp and little clumpiness to it that could turn some people off. I like it. It's very refreshing and perfect on a hot day or after a hard workout. It has a really hydrating quality to it and quenches my thirst quickly.<br /><br />Aloe is usually the kind of thing I would put on a burn, not something I would want to drink. It turns out, however, that the aloe plant is a traditional tonic for digestion problems. There have also been some evidence suggesting (though not yet strongly supporting) the hypothesis that aloe may help control blood sugar and have anti-carcinogenic properties. I don't know that I would think of this as a health drink based on that alone, but it is interesting.<br /><br />The Chantea drinks are made from real ingredients and are sweetened with real cane sugar and not corn syrup, which I greatly appreciate. The green tea is actually green tea made from tea leaves and water, not powder, extract, or anything like that. The passion fruit breaks the trend: it's "natural passion fruit flavor", whatever that means (I know it doesn't mean passion fruit juice/fruit or even concentrate). On the whole, not bad at all. Still, the two main ingredients are water and sugar, and at 120 calories for a bottle it's still pretty close to Kool Aid.<br /><br />I would definitely buy some more of these, but it won't be for everyone.

review/summary: surprisingly refreshing.....
review/text: I tried this Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea with a bit of trepidation.  First off, have you ever accidentally tasted aloe vera?  I put it on burns and the liquid is beyond horrible, but I was a bit intrigued with the idea of this tea so I thought why not give it a try....so glad I did.<br /><br />Likes: a really pleasant taste, that is not too sweet, just nicely so, it would be very refreshing over ice. I wasn't quite sure about the idea of little chunks of aloe and they are good.  Now, I do like pulpy orange juice and bubble teas though, so a little chewy stuff in my beverage is not a problem for me.  If you don't like that whole "texture" in your beverage thing, you might want to pass, but I really liked it. No preservatives, real green tea infusion....all pluses in my book.<br /><br />Dislikes: It has 120 calories per bottle....that's really all I can come up with.  I wish they had a diet version, maybe flavored with stevia for us calorie watchers.  Because it is 120 calories I won't indulge daily, but that is really the only drawback for me.<br /><br />Overall, the passionfruit flavor was delicious and I would definitely purchase this and also be open to trying new flavors.

review/summary: an odd combo -- sweet and bitter and lumpy
review/text: I fancy myself as a somewhat curious and adventuresome eater and was delighted to give this a try.  Hmm.  It is difficult to describe.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  It's too sweet to chug, though, and seems to invite sipping.  It has an oddly bitter, though not unpleasant, taste that lingers in the mouth.  But the strangest sensation comes from the little pieces of pulp suspended throughout the beverage.  They're larger that pieces of of pulp one would find in orange or grapefruit juice.  And they're more gelatinous.  Kind of like little blobs of jello suspended throughout.  Not chewy like tapioca or boba, but just gelatinous. And the little pulp pieces don't settle to the bottom.  Regardless of whether you shake the drink or not, the pulp stays suspended throughout.  It's kind of fun and kind of odd. After drinking this, though, I want to have a drink of water to clear my palate.<br /><br />I found ChanTea to be interesting, unusual, and refreshing.  Not sure it is particularly healthful -- and given that the #2 ingredient, after water, is cane sugar, I'm doubtful that it is -- or nutritious, but it is a fun novelty appropriate for an occasional indulgence when cost and calories aren't major concerns.

review/text: The flavor of the juice in this bottle is quite pleasant -- lightly sweet, with just a hint of green tea and passionfruit flavors. The chunks of aloe vera taste the way they always do in these drinks -- they're also lightly sweet and retain their coolness even when the juice has gotten warm. The marketing of this as a health drink seems somewhat misleading -- there are about 30 grams of sugar in one 11.5 ounce bottle, and it is not a significant source of any vitamin or mineral (at least according to the packaging). My main problem is that it is about double the price of virtually identical drinks that I can buy at my local Mexican market, in a wider variety of flavors.

review/summary: Really not bad!
review/text: Ok..  first, there is stuff floating in it.  And it's not quite like orange juice where it will all sift to the bottom, it's more like it is in suspension in it.  I'm guessing it's the passion fruit stuff...  If you are the type that sifts orange juice through a coffee strainer.. don't bother with this tea.  On the other hand, if you like your OJ with "stuff" you may very well like this tea.  The taste is sweet and very smooth.  It has a bit of a twang to it, but it's not unpleasant.  The stuff floating around kind of caught me off guard, but I'm not going to have any trouble at all finishing off the bottle.  If you buy, I hope you enjoy and thanks for taking the time to read my review.

review/summary: Taste's good
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker; drinking at least one cup a day. I was excited to try this product because of the passion fruit and aloe vera additions. I also appreciate the fact that I don't have to brew it, I can just remove from the refrigerator and enjoy.<br /><br />I liked the flavor of the drink. I even liked the aloe vera pulp, the consistency did not bother me, but I can see how it could be a deal-breaker for some. The tea-flavor was very light, as it is green  tea; if I did not know tea was the third ingredient, I never would have guessed. With cane sugar as the second ingredient, I could definitely taste that flavor and it left an after-taste in my mouth.<br /><br />I think the price is a little high for this product, when I can home-brew regular tea for pennies. While this does have the added health benefits, I can see buying occasionally, but not as a daily or even weekly drink. I did not like that it is packaged in a plastic bottle, I did not factor that into my rating, but usually I do not buy any drinks that come in plastic bottles.

review/summary: Richer in flavor, but a bit pricey.
review/text: CHANTEA ALOE VERA GREEN TEA, Passion fruit 11.5 ounce.<br /><br />I loved the taste of this tea, but you must drink it very cold, and make sure you really shake the bottle before you drink it as the tea is at the bottom of the bottle.<br /><br />I buy Lipton green tea with citrus for my teenage daughter and this product is very comparable.  They both have almost the same ingredients (citrus vs passion fruit in this case) and have almost the exact number of carbs and sugar.  The differences between them are the CHANTEA has a much richer tea flavor vs the Lipton.  If you are a green tea lover you would certainly prefer this over the other brands. The aloe pulp may put people off but, I liked it.  I also drink orange juice with pulp so maybe thats why. I didnt love the passion fruit but will definitely try the other flavors. The other major difference is the price.  A 24 pack of Lipton green tea with citrus is about .50 a bottle (16.9oz) vs the CHANTEA which comes in 8 packs at about 2.00 each (11.5oz).<br /><br />Pros- The flavor is much richer and closer to real green tea. I would classify this as a more grown up tea drink.<br />Cons- The price is much higher than other comparable brands.<br /><br />If you go to Starbucks for your daily iced tea this would be a value for you.  If, like me, you buy a case of a similar product and are ok with the taste, this probably would not appeal to you.

review/summary: Interesting
review/text: This tea isn't what I expected when I ordered it. What I expected was a simple fruit flavored green tea, but this has actual bits of aloe vera in it. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but it gives it an interesting texture and a cool, almost minty aftertaste. Apparently, this kind of tea is popular in Korea.<br /><br />The taste is fine, but overall too sweet for me. There are 19g sugar in each serving, and each bottle has 1.5 servings. I do like that they use cane sugar. The bottle is a little small, but I prefer small servings, so that was fine with me.<br /><br />I don't think I'd try this tea again since it's too sweet for me, but if you like really sweet tea, you'll probably like this.

review/summary: Could prove unpalatable to some.
review/text: This isn't a bad tasting product all things considered.  It's reasonably refreshing, and the ingredients all look fairly healthy.  However what startled me, and may actually put off a lot of people, are the bits of passion fruit floating in the tea.  I realize it's a sign that they're using real fruit for their fruit flavor, but to be honest, if you've got a problem with pulp in your orange juice, you really need to steer clear of this drink.<br /><br />Other than that, and without commenting on any possible health benefits from the green tea or aloe (None are made on the bottle) at 80 calories per bottle it looks like a reasonably decent alternative to soda.  It's sweetened with cane sugar for those of you who are particular about your sweeteners.  I'm thinking that it would make a nice summer drink for anyone who doesn't mind stray bits of fruit in their glass.

review/summary: Refreshing tea
review/text: I tried this product because I like the taste of passion fruit and because of the health benefits associated with aloe vera and green tea.  The aloe vera pulp is fresh and even somewhat crunchy yet entirely drinkable.  The ingredients list reveals that there is very little to this drink - basically water, green tea, a non-HFCS sweetener, aloe vera, passion fruit flavor and some citric acid.<br /><br />I was less enticed by the combination of green tea and aloe as I was by the combination of passion fruit and aloe.  I like to drink Alo Exposed Aloe Vera Drink, and the consistency of the aloe in this drink is similar.  The added flavor of passion fruit makes this tea more enjoyable.  The flavor is somewhat floral.  I am not bothered by the aloe chunks, and I find this tea quite refreshing.  However, if you are the type that is bothered by pulpy type drinks, this may not appeal to you.  Would I order it again?  Yes.

review/summary: Too Chunky
review/text: I enjoy drinking a variety of teas - green, black, fruit, etc - and I thought the combination of Passion Fruit, Aloe and Green Tea would be a good one. Unfortunately there was far too much pulpy material to make drinking the tea enjoyable. The flavor was good, but I found myself wanting to strain it, in order to drink it from the bottle. It almost reminded of a bubble tea because the chunks of Aloe were so thick and numerous. If the pulpy material won't bother you this tea is fine, otherwise I'd avoid it.

review/text: I got my sample bottle of the Chantea in the mail today and drank it right out of the package.  I thought it was good, so I know it would be even better chilled.  It was fruity, but not too sweet, so it was truly refreshing.  It did have little chunks of pulp that gave it some bite, but they were not overwhelming.  It is currently a little over $2 a bottle, so it is priced competitively with other drinks of its kind.  However, please be aware that this is not a diet drink, since it has approximately 120 calories per bottle (11.5 fluid ounces).

review/text: I have alwyas been interested in trying new drinks that have been quite appealing. That was the case with Chantea, and their Alone Vera Green Tea & Passion Fruit drink. The taste of the tea isn't so bad, yet I was honestly hoping for a little more zing into each and every drop I had drunk. It wasn't bad for a trial, yet I was hoping for a bit more essence of the passion fruit to blend in well. I have had a few aloe vera drinks before, but all I could honestly say is that it isn't bad, but honestly there just should've been more for its price that comes into mind. Chantea isn't well-known as Lipton would be, but honestly needs more to make a better aloe vera drink to stand out better.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Taste: B-<br /><br />Overall: B-

review/text: I am very picky when it comes to my liquids.  After recently wondering why my gums were bothering me after drinking Mountain Dew and Mello Yello, I did some research and decided I didn't want to drink products with certain ingredients.  With nothing to drink, I decided to reach for this product.  It is not sweet and it is not sour; it has a "just right" taste for tea.  I personally don't like passion fruit but it tastes fine in this tea.  The tea has pieces of the actual fruit in it which makes drinking the tea seem more substantive.  The only bad thing is that there does seem like some sort of after taste if you drink the whole bottle at one sitting. The ingredients are water, citric acid, Green Tea, Aloe Vera, and passion fruit.  I think the after taste is coming from the ALOE VERA.

review/summary: A tarty full-bodied and tasty nutritious drink
review/text: Chantea Green Tea and Aloe Vera, passion fruit flavor is bottled, ready-to-drink (preferably chilled), nutritious and tasty. It contains Taiwanese green tea, aloe vera, citric acid, water, cane sugar and natural passion fruit, although the quantity of each ingredient is not specified.<br /><br />This fruity drink fulfills 38% of the daily requirement for vitamin C, but no significant amount of any other vitamin. No preservatives have been added. The label indicates 80 calories per serving, but defines a serving as 8 ounces. Because the bottle is 11.5 ounces, drinking a full bottle means an intake of 115 calories.<br /><br />Chantea won the Best New Product award in 2011 at the World Tea Trade Show. It also won Buyers' Choice and 2nd place Ready to Drink tea awards at the North American Tea Championship.<br /><br />Of the four available Chantea flavors (original, peach, lemon, passion fruit) I only tried passion fruit. My first reaction was surprise at the amount of pulp it contained. My second and sustained reaction was that the drink was tangy and tart - more than I would have liked. The taste is pleasant but rich and full-bodied - it reminded me of fresh grapefruit juice, but is a little sweeter.<br /><br />Although I may recommend it to friends and try another flavor, I am more inclined to drink acai blueberry vitamin water zero, which I find particularly delicious. However, these Chantea drinks offer a considerable additional benefit related to their aloe vera and green tea ingredients.<br /><br />Aloe vera is a succulent plant originating in Africa but now cultivated worldwide. Egyptian papyri reveal that it was used for healing as early as 16th century B.C.  Sources dating back to 1st century A.D. refer to its use in herbal medicine.<br /><br />Although no scientific evidence yet attests to its medicinal properties, aloe vera is widely associated with helping diabetes and elevated blood lipids, and improving glucose levels. It is most recommended for reducing symptoms of heartburn, irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and ulcerative colitis. It is an ingredient in yoghurt, and has no known side effects.<br /><br />Green tea, in contrast, has been the focus of dozens of scientific studies, although it has not been reviewed by the FDA. Made from the leaves of camellia senensis, which originated in China but is now cultivated worldwide, it contains antioxidative and anticarcinogenic flavonoids, as well as caffeine.<br /><br />Many studies suggest that:<br />a) Lowers the risk of heart disease, cancer (breast, prostrate, colon), kidney stones, arthritis and dental cavities<br />b) Boosts the metabolic rate 4-17%, helping reduce body fat<br />c) Strengthens the immune system, and improves bone density<br />d) Reduces blood pressure and symptoms of depression<br />e) Helps rescue damaged neurons and prevent brain cells from dying.<br /><br />Note however that the U.S. Pharmacopeia has warned that green tea in quantity does increase the risk of liver damage, especially when taken on an empty stomach. It is also contraindicated for use with the anti-cancer drug bortezomib, and it may reduce the effectiveness of anticoagulants.<br /><br />Those of you wanting a healthy, immune-boosting chilled fruity drink are likely to benefit from this product. However, taste is a very individual preference. If you like tart, full-bodied flavors, you may really enjoy Chantea's passion fruit green tea aloe vera drink. As for myself, I prefer a blander fruit drink.

review/text: Once I got this and saw the chunks of aloe floating inside, I sort of dreaded trying it. It just seemed too weird. But I'm glad I took a chance on it because it's fabulous stuff.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of green tea but find most of the bottled stuff too sweet. This was right-on perfect for my tastes. Having real sugar is a huge plus. And the passion fruit flavor is notable without tasting artificial. A great flavor blend. Chantea really nailed it.<br /><br />The aloe pieces are small and chunky yet soft like pieces of fruit. That's probably the best analogy. They're infused with the flavor of passion fruit. They do require a bit of chewing but can easily be swallowed if it's preferred. I can understand why some people might be put off by this, but I really liked this aspect of the tea. It's wonderfully unique. If it didn't have the aloe, I would've still liked it but not enough to consider getting another. And to me, the aloe chunks really make this special.<br /><br />In conclusion, this tea surpassed all my expectations. If you like green tea and would like to try something truly different and fruity, get this stuff. It really is wonderful!

review/summary: Refreshing tea, but with slugs.
review/text: I think Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea taste great. The predominate taste is that of Passion Fruit, and the flavor seems authentic to me and downright refreshing. Along with that there is the hint of green tea flavor. Again, refreshing and to be expected.<br /><br />What I didn't expect were the slug-like deposits on the side of my glass. At first I thought it was because I'd put the drink on ice, but other reviews seem to suggest that the slugs are either from the aloe vera or the passion fruit. I have no idea, just that it was a surprise.  The slugs don't taste bad, and clearly aren't harmful. It would just be nice if the package had a warning so one knows what to expect. Otherwise, you think you got a bad bottle.<br /><br />Others have commented that there is a lot of sugar in this beverage. I even saw one listing claiming 38 g of sugar. I don't think that claim is correct, however. My bottle lists 19g of sugar per serving, and that there are 1.5 servings per bottle. Compare that with a can of Pepsi, which has 28g of sugar per serving and this tea isn't all that bad. (It has 80 calories per serving versus 100 for a Pepsi). Also, this tea uses cane sugar for sweetener, versus high fructose corn syrup used in soda. Cane sugar is generally thought to be better for you. Something to be aware of.

review/text: The tea and the passion fruit flavor were good, a little on the sweet side for me. Plus it left an aftertaste that was a bit too intense. It didn't have a refreshing feel to it like I usually get from tea or fruit drinks. Also, there was a lot of pulp in the bottle. It was thick, plump, big and chunky. I tried shaking the bottle vigorously but that didn't help break it up. The pulp stayed consistently firm. It ruined the drink for me. You might like this if you enjoy lots of pulp and in fairly large pieces but it wasn't right for me.

review/summary: Really Sweet and Syrupy
review/text: This is a review for ChanTea Green Tea and Aloe Vera Passion Fruit flavor.  This is actually the first food or beverage product offered for review by Amazon that I was actually afraid to try.  I did do it however because I made a commitment to review.<br /><br />This beverage comes in a very thin plastic hexagon shaped 11.5 fl. oz bottle.  My product arrived on the first of March and sports an expiration date of 12/25/2012.  The product is made in Taiwan but has Spanish wording on one side of the bottle.<br /><br />I will talk to you about why I was afraid to try it.  First of all because it is made in Taiwan.  I am not too keen on food products that are not USA made but am especially leary of those that are Asian.  I am not sure about their safety standards and won't even eat the packaged tuna and other fish that comes from there.  I put the bottle in the fridge for a good two hours to get it cold as I didn't want to add ice to the beverage before trying it because I wanted to get a true idea of the taste, texture, etc.<br /><br />I shook the bottle up before pouring the contents into a glass.  I noticed these little gelatinous globs as I was shaking.  I poured half of the bottle into the glass.  The mixture was somewhat thick.  Those little gelatinous globs looked really gross and I couldn't bring myself to drink the beverage with them in the glass so I strained them out.  I inspected them by hand in the strainer and not being familiar with the actual Passion Fruit (I have only had Passion Fruit flavored things in the past) I figured they must be the pulp of the Passion Fruit.  They were very fragrant (overly so) but I didn't like the way they looked or felt.  I tasted the drink and it was extremely sweet.  The consistency was very syrupy-like.  The ingredients are as follows:<br /><br />Water<br />Cane Sugar<br />Green Tea Infusion (watered down green tea)<br />Aloe Vera<br />Citric Acid<br />Natural Passion Fruit Flavor<br /><br />Now, in its defense you have to like that the ingredients don't contain HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) or anything you cannot pronounce.  However, this drink left a really thick coating on my tongue.  I have have had pure Aloe Vera juice before and I really could not detect any of that flavor in this beverage.  I really couldn't tell it was green tea either except for a slight bitter aftertaste.  To me it was really just a sweet Passion Fruit syrup.  I would not call this a beverage as it is not refreshing in any way.  I would consider reducing it in a pan and then pouring it over a nice stack of pancakes.<br /><br />There are 80 calories per serving and the servings per bottle are 1.5 so total calories for the entire 11.5 ozs is 120.  I can think of better ways to spend those beverage calories.

review/summary: Sweet and thirst-quenching, perhaps too sweet
review/text: Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea Passion Fruit, a mouthful of a name, is an 11.5 ounce thirst-quenching drink. But the full bottle, which represents 1.5 servings but will probably be finished off by a single person in a single sitting, has 120 calories and nearly 30 grams of sugar. Ingredients start off with water and cane sugar. Though thankfully not high fructose corn syrup, the product is primarily sugar water combined with the taste of green tea (not enough to be bitter), the tropical smell of passion fruit (a flavoring, not actual fruit juice), and some aloe vera bits. I enjoyed the drink and found it pleasant. The aloe vera bits were a bit disconcerting - they are somewhat larger than pulp bits in orange juice and left me uncertain: do I chew them or simply swallow?<br /><br />The product is VERY similar to Alo Allure Aloe + Mangosteen + Mango in terms of taste. The Alo Allure product, however, is a bit sweeter in taste. It has roughly the same amount of sugar per sip, but no green tea to offset the sweetness. The Alo product claims to be 25% aloe vera juice and as a result has 35% of the recommended daily Vitamin C per serving. The Chantea product has no significant Vitamin content.<br /><br />If you want the putative health benefits of green tea, fruit juice, and aloe vera, I'd look elsewhere. If you want a quick tasty sugar water concoction, there are worse choices than Chantea. As I said, it tastes good. But the bottom line is that these are empty calories that you're drinking.

review/summary: Delicious and chewy!
review/text: Maybe I am biased because I am from its producing country, and that I grew up on this stuff, but it's so delicious! It doesn't feel at all artificial (maybe except the citrus acid). I love the pieces of chewy aloe vera inside. I know some people do not enjoy "chewing" their drinks, such as bubble tea drinks or jelly drinks. If you are one of those people, I don't think you would enjoy it very much. However, if you enjoy drinks that are natural tasting, without any high fructose corn syrup, and has pieces of real fruits and vegetables (think of this not as a "drink" but a "snack") I think you will really enjoy it.<br /><br />I do wish it comes in a larger quantity, such as 16 oz instead of 11.5.

review/summary: Like Chewing Guppies
review/text: O.k., this is just weird.  It's green tea with aloe vera pieces in the tea.  (Not pureed passion fruit, not essence of passion fruit, just aloe vera pieces.)<br /><br />When I first started drinking it I thought I'd gotten a contaminated bottle.  This is one of the strangest things I've ever had to drink. It tastes good, but I can't get past the fact that every mouthful reminds me of chewing small fish in water.  No.

review/text: Oh, I guess it is tolerable, but just about any normal drink would be more pleasing and certainly many, just as nutritious, like orange juice, especially fresh-squeezed orange juice. The only good use for this drink is maybe for a diet-conscious person since, at least for me, reduced my desire for anything to eat or drink.

review/summary: An Acquired Taste - Maybe...
review/text: The first taste of Chantea, a beverage with Aloe Vera and passion fruit flavor, is surprising.  The tea tastes like grapefruit juice but with a sweeter flavor.  I found the passion flower seeds to be somewhat annoying and possibly slimy.  However, I like it in a reserved way.  It may be very refreshing in the summer.

review/summary: Pretty good, if you don't mind the chunks of aloe
review/text: If you're the kind of person who can't stand bits of stuff in their drink, you won't enjoy this. It does have little bits of aloe pulp floating in it.<br /><br />If that doesn't bother you, then give it a try. While perhaps a shade too sweet, the taste is pleasant - not too blah, not too strong. The passion fruit flavor is dominant, but if you pay attention you'll notice a little bit of green tea flavor too. It's fine for drinking on its own or with a meal or snack.<br /><br />(While some will surely play up the healthy nature of this drink, given all the great things green tea can do for you and that one can never go wrong with aloe, don't mistake this for a 'health' drink. The first non-water ingredient is good old-fashioned sugar.)
