review/summary: Only received one worn packet
review/text: Although the description said 3 large packets, I only received one.  It was wrinkled and worn; I would not feel good about giving it as a gift. I contacted the supplier directly to try and resolve the issue, and never received a response.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed with this purchase, and would never buy from this supplier again.

review/text: For some reason my husband ordered a TON of this stuff for me for Christmas.  We live in Chicago & it's cold so I didn't try it right away.  I was craving something sweet so I finally made some tonight.  It tastes like icy chocolate, & it's a bit chalky.  To be honest it reminds me of the old powdered slimfast.  I've got a whole canister and 5 packets of this stuff & I don't know what I'm going to do with it.

review/text: I visited NY for the first time last summer, and after trying the Frozen Hot Chocolate at Serendipity, my boyfriend and I decided we could not live without it. We bought three packs of the mix to bring back home to LA. After running out, we immediately purchased the 3 pack from Serendipity via Amazon. It shipped quickly and painlessly. They are just as delicious as we remembered them! I would recommend this mix to anyone with a sweet tooth or someone who is just plain missing the city.

review/text: I have worked with 10 packets of the stuff over 3 months, different blenders, differnt types ice and I Cannot get it to the consistency/flavor of what I had in the store. It's tasty and is the best I can do, as I MISS the real thing. One tip: If you put the amount of ice it says on package it is way too watered down. Next time in Vegas or NY I will go get dessert MANY times as the home package just doesn't do it.

review/text: Saw these on Oprah and ordered them for Christmas gifts.  The packages are really ugly and cheap looking which didn't help when giving as gifts.  Saved 2 packages for our family Christmas Eve treats. I can't say they are horrible but it tasted like any old chocolate shake.  It has a very strong chocolate taste so I added more milk to tame the taste.  These are pretty exprensive so we expected better.

review/text: I was absolutely thrilled to be able order these as unique stocking stuffers this year. But, was I the only one who saw the movie "Serendipity" in my family? These packets of "Frozen Hot Chocolate" are just as delicious as everyone (in the other reviews) says they are. (Which makes me doubly happy that I ordered them!) Before they even arrived, I thought how silly I was to only order one set and went back and ordered more. My son and I just had to try it out before we gave these away for the holidays. It is even great mixed with ice cream. My only complaint is that the shipping is quite steep for these lightweight packets. Otherwise, I am a very happy customer!

review/text: It was pretty good the customer service was just bad, 3 of the 5 packs were broken and i got cut by the broken glass sent with it *nothing major* took 3 weeks and 130 cellphone minutes for them to tell me i will get free shipping on my next order. I tried the mix after that because they wouldint refund me anything and i am not allergic to chocolate but after drinking this product maybe 5 minutes after i started vomiting horridly. I let a friend try the other pack*he is also not allergic* He broke out so bad and started swellewing we had to bring him to the hospital. After 15 minutes on hold (at first the lady forgot to hit hold apparently they were very confused) i spoke with a manager and the only thing they could say was a simple sorry and they would send me another half off. I figured hey maybe it was just bad luck so i ordered another and this time instead of broken packets it was missing 3 packets and both spoons. I am really never ordering from this company again.

review/summary: Health Inspectors Close Restaurant
review/text: Serendipity 3 Frrrozen Hot Chcolate Mix Gift Package and several packs of the hot chocolate mix.<br />  In October, 2007 I purchased the gift set along with several packs of the hot chocolate mix to be used as stocking stuffers at Christmas.  Sometime in late November or early December I read a very short article in our local paper that read:<br />"Health inspectors close restaurant"<br />  "While serendipity may be the art of finding pleasant things by chance, what health inspectors found at celebrated eatery Serendipity 3 was not very agreeable."<br />  "Officials closed the restaurant Wednesday night after it failed its second inspection in a month.  An inspector spotted a live mouse and mouse droppings, fruit flies, house flies and more than 100 live cockroaches."<br />  "Both inspections revealed rodent and fly infestation and conditions conducive to pest infestation, including stagnant water in the basement, the department said."<br />  Needless to say, approximately $60 of hot chocolate mix was thrown away.  I would never purchase any products from Serendipity 3 again, even if it was a "must have" by Oprah. If there were a half star or less, it would be rated for this product.

review/summary: Great for mochas and hot chocolate!
review/text: I looked everywhere for this when I heard this flavor was coming out.  I get the peppermint mochas at Starbucks during the holidays so I was very excited when I got the Tassimo email that this flavor was available for the holidays.  Of course when I went to buy it, the Tassimo site had these on backorder and even Amazon.com didn't have them available.  I finally found some at my local Bed, Bath, & Beyond and bought every package they had (only 3).  These are sooo delicious and I plan to look for more so I can stock up and have them even after the holidays are over.  This can be made with other variations as well.  I made it as a mocha with the chocolate and espresso discs but then also added a milk disc to it.  It was delicious and more of a latte with the chocolate peppermint flavor.  I used it as a hot chocolate for my kids by leaving out the espresso disc and only using the chocolate peppermint one included in this package and a milk disc from a different package I had.  It was so good and the kids loved it.  If you like the peppermint mochas at Starbucks, then get this limited edition set. This is one of my favorites now and I wish they offered it year round.

review/summary: Excellent, Robust taste
review/text: I originally purchased the plain Rooibos from Davidson.  It had an odor I didn't really like.  To mask the odor, I began using it mixed with some Earl Grey from Stash.  This worked well and I really enjoy the mix.  However, when I found that Davidson had a Rooibos with a Chai mix, I decided to try that.  I found I liked it very much and didn't notice any unusual odor.<br />Others have commented on the tea being very finely ground and that is true.  I make a lot of ice tea using a West Bend 68303 machine.  It has a very fine screen that should handle Rooibos very well.  However, coffee filters are cheap.  I put in a coffee filter in the tea holder before filling it with tea and that works very well.  Also, it's a snap to clean later for you just dump the filter and grounds all at once.<br />I'm not very good at describing the taste.  I drink about 2 quarts a day of ice tea and can only say I really love the flavor of Masala Chai Rooibos.  I also love Davidson's packaging.  I find myself using this tea every day.  Sometimes I mix a bag or two of something else with it, but it is always the foundation of whatever I brew.  I also sometimes add a flavored sweetener like vanilla or caramel.  All in all this is an excellent and economical tea.  I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Fine Tea Experience, With Caveats
review/text: ****<br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to "Weightless" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: "For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming." So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: "Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs."<br />****

It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: "For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br /><br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming." So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: "Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs."<br /><br />****

review/summary: POOR PACKAGING, QUANTITY INCORRECT & AMAZON SELLER FEEDBACK
review/text: POOR PACKAGING:  The product arrived in one giant plastic pouch, of poor quality plastic, which ripped in transit and some of the dal escaped.  The packaging needs improvement.  The dal looks OK, tho I haven't cooked it up yet.<br /><br />QUANTITY INCORRECT/UNIT PRICING:  The product which arrived was ONE 64-ounce pouch, NOT a pack of four 64-ounce pouches, which is what the website said:  "Spicy World Chana Dal, 64-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 4)."  This makes it $5.72/pound, not $1.42/pound.  Amazon should correct this and should post the price per pound or per ounce for grocery items, like the stores do - "unit pricing."  This would help us compare prices on these items.<br /><br />AMAZON SELLER FEEDBACK:  Because amazon.com is the "seller" I can't leave "seller feedback" from my order on the amazon website!  Amazon should allow for "seller feedback" re amazon as the seller.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I finally found how to email Amazon Customer Service through the "Help" link, upper right of the webpage.  I was fairly impressed with their prompt response to my concerns.  I hope they will fix the incorrect pricing info & start doing "unit pricing" on grocery items.

review/text: Lavazza offer several variations on their espresso beans. Of those that I have tried - I don't recall Pienaroma as being great; Top Class is good; Super Crema is tasty (and produces good crema) but not high on aroma; Crema E Aroma retains its aroma very well but is the most acidic of the Lavazzas; Tierra appears to be the hardest to find in the US but - in my opinion - combines the good aspects of all. So far, I've found it only on Amazon. Amazon also has the best prices on Crema E Aroma.

review/summary: Good, Solid Espresso
review/text: Complex, maybe more nasal than some of the coffees I use in my Gaggia Classic.  There's almost none of the Ethiopian velvety-slick feel, it's almost all European in taste, meaning the flavor tones are more coffee and less fruit and chocolate, the mouthfeel is clean and not coating/cloying.  Great aroma from the crema, and great aftertaste, lasts twenty minutes or more easily.<br /><br />This makes a great straight doubleshot. I don't mix this one with milk/foam, it's good enough on it's own.  I never have an issue with grind, pour/pull rate, or crema production.<br /><br />Not overly caffeinated, it doesn't have Robusta, causes very little 'over the temple' headache when overpulled/thin/underdosed, it's pretty temperature-insensitive.<br /><br />While I do appreciate some other coffees with thicker mouthfeel and darker flavors (Klatch Belle Espresso, Black Cat), this coffee is lighter and more 'focused' in flavor than those.  I find I pull shots of this LaVazza about twice as often as I pull 'boutique' shots.<br /><br />Just solid coffee, and sets the bar for the standard bean I keep in my kitchen.

review/text: My husband and I are big fans of Lavazza's Super Crema coffee, but got a bag of the Tierra blend recently while the Super Crema was out of stock. While the smell and color are wonderful, we found the Tierra 100% arabica blend to be much more bitter than our regular blend, and even after we added cream or milk to our coffee we felt unable to continue to drink it, so we gave it away after only a few brews (we are straight espresso drinkers otherwise). We have now received our regular Super Crema again and couldn't be happier.

review/summary: Very similar to Supercrema, but a little better in my opinion
review/text: I am still trying to find the perfect bean for making espresso. This is probably the closest I have come yet, at least to making espresso shots for lattes and cappuccinos. I have used the crema e aroma and the Supercrema. I like the Supercrema a lot, and this is very similar, but in my hands came out a little more smooth and a little less bitter. I grind with a LeLit Pl53 and brew on a Rancilio Silvia. My final verdict is that these shots are smooth enough to make milk-based drinks that need little-to no sweetener, as the shots (done properly) have very little or no bitterness. As far as drinking them as straight espresso, I would still like a little more body to each shot and maybe a little more complexity. However, as I am constantly refining my brew methods, it would not surprise me at all if I was still not reaching the full potential of these beans. Delicious!

review/summary: Mediocre shots, good milk drinks
review/text: I just got these beans and have pulled a couple dozen shots, trying out different permutations of amount, grind, tamp.<br /><br />I'm disappointed as I expected a better flavor from the beans.<br /><br />The beans have a strong midrange coffee flavor and a strong sharp lemon note. The midrange coffee flavor is uncomplicated but good. A little chocolaty perhaps The lemon note is unpleasant for my taste which makes the beans go from a four star to a three star.<br /><br />When you pull a good espresso shot it tastes smooth for about 10 seconds, then the lemony taste creeps in and makes it unpleasant.<br /><br />The lemony taste is good in milk drinks however, it provides some character and interesting flavor. The strong coffee flavor also stands up to the milk and gives it a good flavor. I like lattes with these beans.<br /><br />The overall verdict is meh. If you only want milk drinks then these beans might suit you. If you like shots, I'd advise you to look elsewhere.

review/text: I was excited to buy a larger bag of organic Lavazza beans at a good price. While not a coffee / espresso snob, I do like coffee and have lived and imbibed in enough coffee-centric countries to have some points of comparison. This is a good coffee, but not a flavorful or very distinctive coffee. I bought it to use in a stove top espresso maker - not a pulled shot - where it did well as the base for a nice cappuccino or latte...but not exceptional. As an Americano or in a Bodum, it didn't work for me. Just strong, a little bitter...someone here mentions a lemon overtone and while I don't normally go for the descriptive terms, I think the lemon overtone is a problem for me too. It's a strong coffee, a little bitter, not smooth, lemon acidic overtone, verging on dark roast, not too oily...serviceable, but not in anyway distinctive in its flavors. So I am moving on.

review/text: I have purchased this brand of Lavazza, as well as the Super Crema and Gran Riserva.  I use them in my Alex Duetto Espresso Machine (which I couldn't recommend more).  Of these three options, most of which I've tried from several orders, I find the Top Class and Tierra to be the best.  The Super Crema has been the least enjoyable for me, mostly it has been bland.  It's possible I have always received stale Super Crema beans.  I usually make Latte's. I have also had Chris Black Pearl espresso beans and they are quite good for a nice change.

review/summary: Its OK, but not nearly as good as the Super Crema
review/text: I had the Lavazza Super Crema and loved it but I wanted to give this a try for my espresso.  I really like the Super Cremas flavor, it was nutty, fruity, and a bit of chocolate.  This just tastes like any coffee you get at any gas station to me, at least when making espresso.  Its not bad, but to me its just ordinary. I guess purists may like it, I dunno, when it comes to coffee I may not be as sophisticated as some.  Kinda like wine, I like it sweet and red, not so dry.  I don't want my coffee to taste like coffee, I want it to be a treat.

review/summary: Coffee Good, but vacuum seals broken on bags
review/text: I love Lavazza Tierra! I make it with a French press every morning, and it is superb. However, I have been very disappointed to receive 2 out of 3 bags recently from Amazon with broken vacuum seals. When you order great coffee, you expect to get quality shipping and handling! What's up Amazon?!

review/summary: Old coffee
review/text: So when you purchase beans of a reputable brand you would expect to get fresh beans. They tasted old from the opening of the bag and so even if the date was well in advance of it's expiration I can only surmise that quality control was an issue in the storage or shipping of the beans. But I won't be ordering any more espresso beans from this company unless they can correct this.

review/summary: Not for household consumption
review/text: Lavazza Super Crema in this configuration made terrible esspresso, terrible french press, terrible moka pot and the worst (outside of Folgers) drip coffee I've ever paid for.  At $30 per bag on average I thought I'd get a deal with the great reputation and taste of Lavazza that I'd experienced in restaurants and coffee shops.  Something must have happened to this shipment to ruin the flavor of this coffee.  I could not get a crema on any of the preparations I used, despite using a burr grinder, spice-grinder etc. I feel as though I tried everything but a $2000 espresso machine and grinder to get a good cup...to no avail.  DO NOT BUY this product.  Stick to store-bought Lavazza or the great reliability (albiet more expensive) Starbucks etc.  If I could get my money back, I would.  I bought three bags with a grand total of $91 invested thinking it would be a great hedge against rising coffee prices.  I reapeat, DO NOT BUY this product.

review/summary: The healthier ones
review/text: These are a healthier version of Craisins, and to my mind much better tasting.  They are super moist and slightly less sweet. Eden adds no refined sugar;  instead, these cranberries are sweetened with organic apple juice concentrate.  (Don't allow yourself to think that they are "sugar-free," however. The juice concentrate is still a strong source of natural sugars, which for a 1/3 cup serving of cranberries total 25 grams.) All that being said, if you are looking for a healthier, moist, good-tasting dried cranberry (and organic, to boot,) this is it.

And the Amazon price is the best I've found too.

review/summary: Tasty and rather plump (in comparison)!
review/text: The reason I bought these besides being organic, was due to them being sweetened w/ apple juice. They are moist,fairly plump not dehydrated looking and not too sweet. I also like that it comes in a 5 pack vs. a 12 pack. Although I was happy w/ the Pavich brand (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMZXL4/ref=ox_ya_os_product), they came in a pack of 12 and used organic evaporated cane juice as the sweetener. I don't see how anyone would be disappointed in this product. I've also bought organic canned beans,popcorn and other foodstuffs from Eden Organic and have consistently been pleased w/ their quality. These will be great for fall and holiday baking.

review/text: This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The "hot chocolate" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if you're expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere.
