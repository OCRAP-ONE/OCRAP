review/text: This is not a bad apple snack - definitely not crispy, but not rubbery like dried apples. I thought the taste and texture were quite nice. My problem, like many others, is that the product comes from China. The various scandals involving the use of toxic or otherwise harmful chemicals (most notably in baby formula scandal) has shown that the country's regulatory system is simply not up to guaranteeing the safety of their products.<br /><br />Therefore, while I did like this product, I will not eat it again, and I definitely do not recommend it to anyone. Check the back of your food's packaging, and avoid products made by countries who do not ensure the safety of their products.<br /><br />(Review of Brothers-ALL-Natural Fuji Apple Crisps)

review/summary: made in china :(
review/text: I've had several of the brothers all natural products and purchased several cases after reading that they are a company in western ny. I liked supporting what I assumed was a small business operating in a big apple growing area of the country. It turns out that they just repackage a product that comes to them from china. I emailed the company and they tried to assure me that they are positive their chinese product is of the highest quality and the reason for the apples coming from china when there are apple orchards in their backyard (I've driven by the plant and apples grow all over around there) is because there are no freeze drying facilities in the us. This doesn't make any sense because I checked a package of mountain house freeze dried apples and they are made in the us from us produce.<br /><br />If buying chinese produce doesn't bother you then these are for you, they do taste good but if you're concerned with the huge amounts of less safe pesticides used in china and with the questionable quality of chinese food products then steer clear.

review/summary: My babies love them!
review/text: Oddly enough, I found these at Old Navy. We were leaving and my 1 year old twins were cranky so I bought these hoping they were something they could eat. The texture is perfect for babies, I think they could have eaten these from about 6 months. It's getting harder to find them fruit that they will eat now that they will not allow me to feed them purees.<br /><br />As for them being manfactured in China, I went to the company's website to study up and I am confident that they are a responsible company that tests their products thuroughly, or at least as thouroughly as any US company. The ones I got at Old Navy were Disney's Mickey Mouse Clubhouse ones and I'm pretty sure that Disney wouldn't put their tail on the line unless they were confident that it was a safe, sound product.<br /><br />I have 5 kids, the oldest being 15, and none of them have ever been poisioned by any food products from China, or anywhere else for that matter, and I have never paid any attention to where a product was manufactured. Oddly, I'm 34 years old and have never been poisioned either! I must have some sting of luck!

review/summary: Great Apple Snacks - Highly Recommended!
review/text: A friend recommended these Brothers Crisps and I am very pleased that we took her advice! Being a type 2 diabetic and trying to watch my carbs and calories, these are good snacks that satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings without overly spiking up my blood sugar levels. The real test with any "good for you" snacks is if my teens will eat them, and they also love them!<br /><br />These are made from real fruit (and nothing else) that has been sliced and freeze dried, making them crispy (exactly like "Astronaut Ice Cream") but they will reconstitute in your mouth if you leave them in long enough. This process also makes them very flavorful.<br /><br />Each pack contains -<br /><br />Fuji Apple:<br />About 1 1/2 Apples per pack<br />39 Calories<br />7 NET Carbs (6 from sugar)<br /><br />These are a good tasting healthy snack alternative that, if it wasn't for the fairly high cost, I would keep on hand all of the time!<br /><br />Highly Recommended! We bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027IACXI">Brothers ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps, Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana - 20 Count Bags</a> and like all three types!<br /><br />Note: These are made in China<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I have a 17 month old who is allergic to peanuts and a 4 year old. Both love this snack. It is a very convenient alternative to crackers. My only complaint is that I find them expensive, particularly since I find the pouches small -- my kids typically want more than one as a snack. that is the only reason I give it 4 rather than 5 stars. I brought a box of apples and pears (which I got at my local Costco) to my son's preschool for snacktime, and the teacher said the kids liked them. There were 1 or 2 who weren't big fans, but I can't think of any snack that every kid would like. I have also brought them to playtime with my younger son -- the little ones there love them too and the moms are always asking where they can get them.

review/summary: China? Or has anybody not read this company's food/safety report?
review/text: Here is Brothers All Natural food and safety report.  It sounds better than our own food guidelines. :-(<br /><br />Here is an small excerpt from their report:<br /><br />"Our product is freeze-dried and is made without any preservatives or chemicals using our own internal safe inspections and 3rd party inspections to make absolutely sure that our process is secure and safe.  In fact we go well above and beyond any US company that we know in regards to food safety and quality.  We test all our raw material and finished products 4 times so that all our customers have peace of mind.  Pesticides, heavy metals, allergens, extraneous material and many other items are all checked on every single batch.<br /><br />Our product is pure and safe.  We are a very responsible company.  What we are suggesting is that when it comes to food safety and quality it all comes down to the company and the brand, not just the country of origin.  There have been so many recent recalls on food products produced in the USA and unfortunately even deaths that have happened due to the sloppy and total lack of concern from USA food producers...peanut butter, beef, eggs, and so many more prove that product of USA does not ensure safe food products.  You do not have that concern with Brothers-All-Natural products."<br /><br />So let's give this company the benefit of the doubt since they make such a good product. "USA" was included in this line up along with China on the back of the package; they were even first in line. Was that overlooked or what? People are so quick to judge but then turn around and still eat tons of chicken and have no idea what is given to the chicken or how the chicken lives.  We think it's great but we aren't allowed by Tyson (the largest chicken supplier in our country) to see the chickens living conditions. I wonder why? Are they hiding something. Obviously they are because the chicken farmers tell us that if they say or let anyone look at the chickens, they are OUT. How do we know what is going into our chickens or how they live? Check this out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Foods. Maybe they eat other dead chickens or droppings from other chickens. We don't know because our great USA Tyson chicken company won't let us see....it's all a big dark secret. One chicken farmer got tired of keeping the public in suspense (it just made her sick, so she gave up) so she showed what the chickens went through. It was HORRIBLE! Dead and sick chickens all over the place because they cram them up so tight and feed them corn and who knows what else, to make them fat fast. Some chickens can't walk because they are so big that they just lay there until someone takes it away to be slaughtered. They are kicked and thrown when they are going to the slaughter house. It's awful to see. But I am greatful to that farmer for showing the public what Tyson chicken is doing.<br /><br />And we're concerned about this apple treat? Let's try to be fair to this company. At least they claim to be on the legit. Maybe,  have the dried fruit checked out if if there is that much concern. :-/<br /><br />The only thing I wonder about is why isn't there more vitamins in the package or fiber if it's 2 fruit servings?<br /><br />I hope that this company survives because they do make a good product.<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: Brothers Fuji Apples ROCK!!!
review/text: I normally buy stuff like this for my nephew, who is a Marine at Camp Pendleton, to give him a little goodie to snack in the field or on at the end of the day. BUT, I mistakenly shipped this one to my home and OMG! They're AWESOME!!! Other than chocolate eclairs, I'd have to say this is probably the BEST snack I've come across...and thank goodness this one is HEALTHY!!! The only bummer about them is that the rest of the family knows I've got 'em, so I can't keep them all to myself!!!

review/text: Unlike other dried apples I've tried, these are crunchy. Bag says each bag is equivalent to 1.5 fuji apples but doesn't feel like it. Better to eat fresh but if you don't have access to fresh, better to much on these than chips.

review/summary: just ok
review/text: These taste fine, but they are sliced oddly (not into wedge like slices as I expected them to be). Since the slices are so thin, they crush easily and every package I've opened has been at least 1/2 crushed up little bits of fruit. This is great if you're adding them to something, such as oatmeal, but not so good for eating out of hand. I will not order these again, as I had purchased them for my baby and they are too small for his little fingers. Overall, I'm disappointed in this product and will not reorder.

review/summary: WeightWatchers best friend!
review/text: Unlike most dried fruit (sticky, chewy, artificial tasting, ugly gummy messes), Crisps are delightfully crunchy, surprisingly filling, and very WW Points Plus friendly.  With about 1 1/2 apples in a package, it's a great way to help anyone get more fruit in their diet, but I bet kids would really love it. The texture is crisp and airy, not hard - so fun to eat! No washing, no chopping, no mess, no bruised fruit, just open pack and snack away. They would be great for business travel - it's so hard to get healthy food on the road.  There are probably a lot of wonderful things you can do with them, (like dipping in chocolate or yogurt, adding to cereal/salads/granola/chex mix,etc.) but they're so yummy I eat them all up before I get to experiment.  I've tried Fuji Apple, Apple Cinnamon, and Pineapple, and you just can't get any purer fruit flavor without buying fresh fruit!

review/summary: The best dried apples and no sulfer dioxide to make you burp or toot!
review/text: We have tried many different dried fruits. The sulfer dioxide is an old way of drying fruit that causes internal gas. Okay I don't need it and neither do my kids and my husband. My 3 year old loves these. My husband found them at costco's and of course he tries to eat them even if they expire. Costco's doesn't carry them...or at least the one near our house doesn't anymore. So I am going to order them on here. I think they taste great too. They aren't hard either...no breaking your teeth..nor are they soft...which would be gross for dried apples. Seriously, these are the best dried apples we have tried and I love the easy to carry bag they are in too.

review/text: I am a college student.  I am lazy and I like to have things shipped to my door.  I also don't get enough fruits in my diet 'cause of a hectic schedule so a bag of these are perfect.  I grab one to go in the morning sometimes just to have something light before class, in case I don't get a legit meal for a while.  It's a great and mess-free studying snack.  The chips are BIG and fluffy, but brittle such that you can still snap a bit of it off to savour.  I've tried all three major brands that Amazon has to offer and these are by far the best overall.  There aren't many in a bag, probably ~10 but they are sweet and delicious so give them a try first!

review/text: With 2 toddlers at home these are great healthy snacks for breakfast or on-the-go.  Each pouch is the perfect size for 1 snack.  We love the apple kind - a big box retailer around us started selling these with other varieties (like strawberry-banana) that wasn't as popular in our house so I love that we can get just apple from Amazon.  We also like the Asian pear so we may alternate orders.<br /><br />I only gave 4 stars because a real apple would also have water in it (which is the whole point of the Brother's All Natural process) but this is much more portable and less messy for small kids.

review/summary: An Apple A Day? Actually 1 1/2 apples
review/text: I have a sulfite allergy and was tremendously excited when I discovered these a couple of years ago when visiting my sister in California. What was even more exciting was rediscovering them when Amazon began carrying them. For me, the greatest benefit is that they are sulfite-free, since I have a serious sulfite allergy.<br /><br />The Fuji Apples are gently sweet, and fun to eat. I love carrying them with me, and enjoy them even more as an evening treat. In fact, with these, it would be easy to overdo your daily requirement of fruit! Each package contains only freeze-dried apples, 1 1/2 apples to be exact, and weighs in at 39 calories.<br /><br />Quite honestly, I would personally choose these over chips any day of the week. My sister has several grandchildren who enjoy raiding these from her cupboard, so I can certify that they are also child-approved.<br /><br />I purchased these as part of a variety pack from Amazon, and enjoy all three varieties that came in the package. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001942GAI">Brothers-ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps, Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana, 24-Count  Bags</a> Of the three varieties, this particular one is the one I think kids would enjoy the most because of the apple flavor.

review/summary: Wonderful for Babies Just Starting on Solids!!
review/text: These are wonderful snacks...I like them, but I buy them for my 1 year old son.<br /><br />These are a little expensive and hard to find (reason for 4 stars), but compare the price to Gerber or even store brand freeze dried fruits made for babies...you definitely get more for your money here. Plus the kind packaged for babies are such tiny pieces, my son's outgrown them, and the bottom is filled with fruit dust...and you don't get much more than what's in one of these single serve packs anyway.<br /><br />These do crisp (for those of us with a mouth full of teeth), but they melt away just like the baby ones do, so they are awesome for new self feeders (with just a few teeth or none at all). And I love that there's no added sugar. I used to break them up into bite size pieces for my son, but now he's figured out how to use those front teeth--they're really airy so easy for him to bite.<br /><br />The packets work great for me! I can throw 1 or 2 in the diaper bag and go. If you have left overs, they tend to get a little soggy (reabsorb some humidity from the air) so it's much better to keep the servings packaged separately.<br /><br />Love these, wish they were easier to find.

review/summary: Luscious 100% pork hide treat
review/text: It has been very difficult to find thick, 100% pork hide rolls for a couple of years now. Most companies that used to make them now instead use a thin shell of pork hide around a filling of sweet potato or liver paste, but I prefer the ones that are 100%  pork hide. I give one to my Lab after his dinner and it takes him10-15 min to finish chewing it. I credit his after-dinner chews with his excellent dental health. (He's 9 years old.) These chews are even better than the ones I used to buy from Hartz Mountain-- thicker, longer, and heavier. I prefer pork hide to rawhide because is it is safer, doesn't leave goo all over his paws and the carpet, and doesn't upset his stomach, unlike rawhide. He also greatly prefers these to rawhide, even flavored rawhide. These are a great bargain, too! I'm so glad to have finally found them.

review/summary: Great for large dogs
review/text: I purchased these chews for my 2 pit bulls.  They love to chew and go through an ordinary chew REALLY fast.  These chews keep them busy for at least 15 minutes and they LOVE them.  The only problem is that one of them was putting on too much weight after eating one every day.  Other than that, these are a terrific product.  Good value.

review/text: My dog loves these.  Been trying to find a good rawhide twist for my dog on here for a while, and I think I found it.  All the other ones are either too expensive for only 4 twists or the big bags are full of cheap quality rawhides.  This package comes with 40 pieces which my dog loves and actually gives him something to chew for a little while, not something he would be finished with in less than a minute.

review/summary: None stop chewing
review/text: I first bought a simular item from the store and my little toy poodle Trustie loved it.  So when I saw this offered in a much larger amount and for the price I had to give it a try.  Well I am glad I did and Trustie is even more so.  When I gave him his first one I found out they are a slight larger than the ones I had bought before.  The thing is after I gave it I was shocked by his excitement because he started chewing and didn't stop but only to go for water and then when it was almost gone.  He then finished it the next night in front of me while I watched TV he chewed.  So all in all I would give these an A+ and I am sure Trustie would agree.

review/summary: The "Green Pearl" of Tea.
review/text: Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the "green pearl" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself "home of silk and tea" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name "gunpowder" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.

review/summary: a great bang for the buck
review/text: This was the first loose leaf tea I ever tried, the directions said a teaspoon for the cup and one for the pot, it may be too much.  A teaspoon of this tea expands to about a quarter of a cup of leaf.  I really enjoyed this and for my two teaspoons made about six cups of tea.  The tea has a nice flavor that I usually do not locate in green teas.  It has as described earlier a smoky quality to it that gives your mouth a taste of the green tea that lasts but doesn't disturb.  I have enjoyed using this in my teapot and adding water through the day until I wear the leaves thin.  If you like green tea try this.  I enjoy it with honey and milk.

review/text: I ordered a couple boxes of this Kataifi Dough from Parthenon Foods. I don't think they were shipped in dry ice, as they were thawed by the time they arrived at our doorstep. Nevertheless, they were well packed and the delivery was very quick, so they were still in good condition. We put them in the freezer and used the first pack about ten days later. My dad says the quality of the dough was impressive compared to the fresh ones he could get at the local stores and the dessert came out very nicely. Still, I don't think I would order them during summer, especially if there is a chance for the delivered boxes to wait for hours under the sun. Order a few boxes during winter and enjoy them throughout the year. :)

review/text: I read about Kataifi Dough in Martha Stewart's Living magazine a couple of months ago.  I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting 'pie' recipes.  This shredded phyllo was easy (however messy) to use.  I followed the package directions, using a glass pie plate, baked the 'crust' and then filled it with a wonderfully rich coconut cream pie filling, homemade of course!  I topped it with toasted coconut and refrigerated it for a couple of hours before presenting it to the hostess of this year's Thanksgiving dinner party, in addition to my regular pumpkin, apple and pecan pies.  The Kataifi crust was beautiful, tasted great with the coconut cream and was a definite hit.  I've sent for the free recipe books to continue this culinary adventure.  And, I'm sure a rendition Baklava would be fabulous using Kataifi.

The first piece is always the best.  I have been chewing this flavor for five years, almost since it was introduced in 2005.  I am upset that it has been discontinued.

review/text: I like orange flavor that is why I prefer this new Citrusmint from Orbit. Just like other chewing gums, I have to open two everytime. One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle. But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out. What more, it cleans your teeth. No calorie and no sugar.<br /><br />Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the make of "Juicy Fruit". Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war.<br />It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health. It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States.

When citrus and mint get together it tastes a bit too much like a dentist's office for my taste.  This gum tastes like the paste they use to polish teeth at the dentist's office, and that's just not what I'm looking for in a chewing gum.  I'll be sticking with sangria and melon mint.

I'm hoping to use it to replace sugar in my baking because i can't eat it dried like that.  =)  I soaked it in water then cook it to reduce the water into a syrup.  works pretty well i think you can replace simple syrup with theses.

review/summary: good chili, but a little sweet
review/text: This is the spicy version of the Amy's chili line, and it is pretty tasty. Soy "beef" makes it look as hearty as "real" chili, and the taste is decent. The beans are perfectly cooked, and the sauce is a great consistency, not as thick as paste or thin as soup broth. This is a good chili to have with grated cheese, onions, and a side of cornbread. The only thing I'd change is make it less sweet. It's like someone thought, "hey, we've gotta keep this from being TOO spicy. What can we do? Oh, yeah! Make it sweeter!" Not my idea of top-notch, but it's not terrible. I add a pinch of salt to mine, and it's perfect.<br /><br />Enjoy!
