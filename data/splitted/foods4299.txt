I tried one, and while they do not taste bad, they are a long way from real blueberries, especially if you are on a strick acide free diet.

review/text: That this is just the regular old horseradish and not REAL Japanese horseradish. But then, I spent a couple of decades in the sushi bars in NYC choking down wonderful, wonderful Cali rolls with exactly this horseradish, so naturally, I don't give a &lt;cough cough> if it's the real gourmet action, I just want my well- and fondly-remembered wasabi.<br /><br />I strongly suggest mixing it with distilled water, as opposed to any sort of spring or tap water. Some hard waters will react with the horseradish and produce some very unpleasant aftertastes.<br /><br />Don't just use it on sushi - you can clear your sinuses when you eat a soy burger too, or sprinkle it on popcorn...

review/summary: Herbal Tea That Is Mind-Enhancing
review/text: *****<br />This Ginkgo IQ Tea from Yogi Tea is a delicious herbal blend of mind-enhancing ingredients. It has a slightly sweet taste, due to organic licorice root, and is herb-y and complex. Ginkgo IQ Tea is formulated for "Clarity of Mind", or, in other words, "to help stimulate cerebral function by refreshing brain cells with an abundance or blood and oxygen", according to the manufacturer. I'm not sure if it does this for me; however, it certainly is refreshing. My husband likes it too, and his tastes are away from healthy-type drinks, preferring high fructose corn syrup sweetened juices and aspartame (which he adds to Ginkgo IQ Tea) sweetened sodas; still he will drink this tea, which is saying something.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginkgo IQ Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea is another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Although the seller's description lists the ingredients, above, I'll review some of them here in case they change it. The ingredients in this herbal teasan are: organic ginkgo leaf, organic ginkgo leaf extract, organic rhodiola rosea extract, and 14 additional organic herbs. It also contains organic lemon flavor and ascorbic acid. Altogether, the tea is 98% organic.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially as an alternative to caffeine.<br />*****

Quite frankly, I expected a whole lot better, coming from Pennsylvania Dutch country. If you're seriously hankerin' fer birch, try Sioux City, it's truly excellent!

review/text: These are insanely addicting. We had an assortment of about a hundred pieces in our candy dish at the office, they were gone in one day, with everyone  coming back for more. the mango were the first to go, then strawberry then it was down to the grape and green apple. the mango flavor tastes like the sugar crusted dried mango slices at costco, you will not stop until you run out. mmmmmm. need more. I have a greater appreciation for them now that i've learned of the history of the company and that one of the main reasons for these is that taking anything OUT of one's mouth ( like gum) is taboo in japan. they make more sense to me now. and they melt in your mouth at a rate that makes you need another one way before you would need another piece of gum. smart...

review/text: I've had quite a few different candies from the Asian world over the past few years, and this has got to be the strangest. I normally buy Kasugai Gummy candy, but thought I'd try these. My first reaction to them was "Is this Gum?" since it really feels like it in your mouth. It's thick and hard to chew I can see why it has so much fat in it...it's like you're eating a little block of fat! My suggestion would be to stick with the Kasugai candies if you want something gummy, or go get a box of Pocky. If you absolutely must have this I'd suggest steering towards the apple or grape flavors as they're easiest to handle.

Pit's have gas like rotten eggs... or worse!! And they tend to pass it many, many times a day...  She's been eating it for about a month and has been pretty much GAS-FREE!  (You know if she has bad gas, her gut can't feel too good, either, so not only are we enjoying fresh air, she probably feels a lot better, too!

review/summary: Heavenly Oil
review/text: A chance introduction to Savini Tartufi White Truffle oil has become one our delightful pasta experiences. A light dribble of oil, with a sliver of goat cheese, and our pasta is complete.<br />Heavenly!<br /><br />This Savini oil has the aroma and the finish of a great flavored oil, with the sophisticated delicacy to warrant the price.<br /><br />Other domestic oils finish so harshly as to be distasteful and disagreeable. Having experienced this oil, we know what good food may be experienced,<br /><br />We discovered this oil upon the learning our previous oil was no longer being imported. It too was wonderful, but our need to have a replacement, a superior truffle oil, sent us searching, and we found this Italian export through Amazon.com.<br /><br />For those enjoying truffles, I heartily recommend this oil for eggs, pasta, salads, where ever a premium oil would add a delicate note to the flavors of the dish.

review/summary: Savini Tartufi White Truffle Oil-OMG THIS IS AMAZING!
review/text: Just received my order today. I immediately tasted the oil & it is amazing! Anyone that cooks can improve their dishes with a small splash of this product! I had a rather common appetizer last weekend until my host poured a little bit of this oil on the hummus. OMG, nectar of the Gods! I ate all of the dip myself. Probably would have snarled at anyone who dared to touch it!<br /><br />I was also very impressed with this company, their responsiveness, the speed of delivery, and their packaging. Seriously, this oil could have been tossed under the wheel of a truck & it could not have been broken. I will absolutely use this company again & refer all my foodie friends!

review/summary: OK White Truffle Oil
review/text: Recently purchased through Amazon and delivery arrived promptly and beautifully packaged inside the box - and was a decent sized bottle. Both my wife and I love real white and black truffles, and we thought the oil smelled wonderful, but to be honest we are somewhat disappointed with the flavor, which was metallic and overly "meaty" in taste. Also, the bottle opening does not have a flow drip control, so instead of using a few drops/drizzle, it tends to pour out and you need to be very careful not to use too much or it ruins/overwhelms the food dish. Maybe we got a funky bottle but we were hoping for a better gourmet experience.

review/summary: Good but inconsistent
review/text: I have been a fan of the Millstone Hazelnut coffee bean for a number of years and as its popularity has grown, the price has gone up and availability diminished.  I ordered this two bag set from Amazon because it was cheaper than I can get locally.  One bag was as expected and the second bag had a very small bean and only a hint of hazelnut.  Nut sure if it was a production error or what but the second bag was not good.  First time this has happened, if it happens again, I will find a new brand of Hazelnut beans.

review/summary: Good Coffee Gone Bad
review/text: We love love getting our Millstone coffee from Amazon, they have timely delivery and it is $8 cheaper per pound than in the grocery store. However, this was a bad experience! When we started using the beans that we ordered our coffee started tasting funny, we had "bad" coffee for a week until I went to the store and bought new beans. The minute we used (same brand, same flavor coffee) the new beans, our coffee was back to normal, AKA Yummy. Our guess is that the beans weren't vacuum sealed, but sadly now we cannot order this item online anymore. And now we have to toss 1.5 pounds of coffee beans.

review/text: I have tried all sorts of different Hazelnut coffee, and this is, by far, my favorite.  I was recently drinking Dunkin Donuts Hazelnut and found myself not wanting to drink it because it was not the Millstone brand.  There's just something about how the flavor is so much richer and the tastes so much fuller with this brand, and I've tried everything from Starbucks to Dunkin Donuts to find anything that would be similar, but alas, it's not the case.  I just feel that it's become expensive and I was trying to save money, but I can see that I am going to switch back!

review/text: The tree is lovely and has many branches to train and many buds, and was a good price.  The subject I want to complain about is how it was packed for shipping:  The potting dish sat in a styrofoam base which held the tree up fairly well and then the box was stuffed with "peanuts".  However, the dish was not secured to the box and neither was the tree!  Knowing how the mail deliverers handle packages, I'm not surprised that five WHOLE branches had been broken off because the tree bounced against the sides and most likely the top of the box!!  There MUST be a better way to ship live plants!  Valerie Foyle

review/text: I had planned to present this flowering bonsai to the doctors and hospital staff who preformed and cared for me during a major surgery. When it arrived it was a wilted, brown and broken mess. Totally unpresentable. It appeared to me and to my wife (a master gardener) that the plant possibly had been subjected to freezing temperatures along with some rough handling. With dead blooms and brownish tone (lacking the rich green in the leaves) its future is very uncertain. I have a digital image of the plant as it looked upon arrival before it was to be transfered to the hospital and is available if a way to send. This is certainly not the quality I have come to expect of an Amazon product. Richard Wilson, Ph.D.

I am not an expert or collector of Bonsai so I am not presenting an expert opinion here.

But the tree arrived in good health and none the worse for wear, it is currently doing well and it has been over a week.  A day or two after the I received the bonsai it began to lose some leaves and I was afraid it might go south, but it pulled through (no thanks to me but thanks to a friend with a green thumb).  I still would use this vendor again as the price of the tree was outstanding.

review/summary: Great buy!
review/text: I first purchased a multi-pack of Dentyne Fire Spicy gum over a year ago.  When I was nearing the end, I immediately returned to Amazon to purchase another multi-pack.  It is the only gum I chew, and the Amazon.com price is much less than in my local store, plus I am not always running out and having to remember to buy more.  Highly recommended if you like "hot" gum!

review/summary: Gum,fine; price,not.
review/text: I was disappointed in the price, once I called and found out the company had just changed the packaging,because I could have bought it locally for a third of the price, but I had already ordered it from amazon. Bummer.<br />And when I got the product in the mail, it was the new packaging, so I think they should change their picture, because it is misleading.<br />Like I said, the gum is fine, I was mislead by the picture in the ad. Because I received a different package in the mail.

review/summary: Good but very sweet
review/text: Basically these are large fig newtons, cherry flavored. They're also small sized, good for toddlers and calorie-conscious adults, but be aware that they are less than 1/2 the size of an average cereal bar. I bought these thinking "healthy snack", but really I'd be better off giving my child some whole grain toast w/ jam and nut butter. These are convenient, though, but very crumbly/messy--not good car seat food IMO.

review/summary: Best Cereal Bar
review/text: This product is very healthy for babies and toddlers since it uses whole wheat flour and cane sugar (instead of high fructose corn syrup like other cereal bars). The only problem with these is that they are smaller than other cereal bars so my toddler has to eat two for breakfast instead of one.

review/text: I got these at snacks for my toddler (20 months). They're pretty convenient, but I don't love the taste of them, and neither does my daughter. She'll usually eat them, but sometimes won't (unlike other fruit bars I've given her). I find them too sweet.

review/summary: OK, but expensive, quite small, and overly sweet
review/text: I ordered these for my daughter when she was about 7 or 8 months old.  They are quite similar to a Nutrigrain cereal bar, but I wanted to avoid the processed sugars that are in Nutrigrain.  My daughter loves cereal bars, including this one, and it is a very convenient food to bring on the go.  However, I found these Earth Best bars to be expensive and quite small (although my daughter does tend to have a large appetite!) and overly sweet.  I prefer the TLC Cereal Bars (found in the snack section of y grocery store rather than baby food section).  They are less expensive and larger than Earth's Best, but are made of whole grains and avoid a lot of the processed ingredients found in Nutrigrain bars.

review/summary: great bar, just a bit sweet
review/text: My child loved these bars for a while but then got burned out on them. They are a bit sweet and I didn't realize that until I tried to eat one to get rid of the last few. It was my mistake to buy so many before tasting them myself, so I hope other people try them out first. It did serve as a healthier snack for my child for several months so I am grateful for the product.<br /><br />The expiration date is a great indication that they are all natural and do not have a bunch of preservatives in them, so I threw the leftovers in the compost.

review/text: There are other brands out there that are natural or organic for toddlers that provide a little more per bar, either in quanity or ingredients.  They aren't bad, they just aren't the best.  They also tend to fall apart very easily and that will make your kid frustrated.

review/summary: Organic Cereal Bars
review/text: Our 2.5 year old son loves these cereal bars.  I love that they are organic.  They are a bit small, but I feel confident when I give them to him that he is getting a relatively healthy snack to which he will not have an allergic reaction.  (He broke out in mild hives when given a Nutragrain cereal bar.)  He enjoys them, and they are a good go-to snack when we are short on time.

review/text: I have a 15 month old son and he just loves these cereal bars!  He prefers these to a cup of yogurt, or any other food that may have him sitting for more than 30 seconds!  He loves to grab them and snack while exploring the kitchen in the morning.  I also throw one into the diaper bag for a snack in the afternoon (for him or me).  They are a fun way to get calories into your active kiddo.

review/summary: Great Breakfast Addition For Tots
review/text: I LOVE these organic cereal bars and I love giving them to my daughter. I usually couple one of these bars with a banana and some yogurt for her breakfast, and she always goes for the bar first (she LOVES bananas, so that's definitely saying a lot). Definitely preferable to the breakfast bars laden with HFCS and ingredients whose names you cannot even pronounce. The only reason I am giving these 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a tad on the small side. Would be nice if there were just a little bit bigger! (My tot is a lean one, but when she finds a food she likes, she could eat it all day - I wish one of these would last her a little bit longer!)

review/summary: Great breakfast bar for toddlers!
review/text: My son loves these breakfast bars and I love that he eats them.  They are lower in sugar than some of the other options out there and higher in dietary fiber.  They still have the added vitamins of other toddler cereal bars.  Overall he could eat worse things for breakfast :-)  We use it as a snack on the way to daycare in the morning, he eats his full breakfast later at daycare.<br /><br />I guess my only complaint would be that the bars do break apart pretty easy.  This has lead to tears a few times in the mornings when my toddler is sad that his cereal bar broke.  They also don't stand up to being thrown into the diaper bag very well.<br /><br />Other than that we love these bars!

review/text: My daughter loves this product and it becomes a little treat.<br />The only reason I give only three stars here is because of the expiration date. When I ordered (April 09), the expiration date was about the end of July 09 (About 3 months away). I called the customer service but they said it is "the freshest" one. I don't know whether it is because they don't use preservetives or that is the freshest one in the Amazon warehouse.  My husband helps eating them out now.

I could have bought this across the street from my house for less money.<br />For 16 oz. of mints this would have been a good deal. As it is, it was just a waste of time and money.<br />I now understand why ConsumerCrafts has a legal disclaimer on the product page.  Caveat emptor.<br /><br />Update:<br />The vendor corrected the weight on the page and removed the ambiguity.<br /><br />The mints themselves are fine.<br /><br />I was told that the legal disclaimer was related to certain food items sold by count, although I had never seen this before.<br /><br />I appreciate that they made it right.
