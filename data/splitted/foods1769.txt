review/text: I am very happy with this product.  I ordered it for my wedding to have as favors and put bows on them and they look like they will work perfect.  They actually come in sealed gold foil bags which is nice so they will stay fresh, so I am not going to open them until right before the wedding.  It looks like the wrapper they come in is a clear wrapper with nothing on it so it will work great!

review/summary: Lifesaver!
review/text: Just started using this formula a couple weeks ago, can already tell a difference in my baby's fussiness.  She has bad bouts with gas and tummy upset, so I was looking for a miracle.  This stuff has a probiotic in it that is supposed to aid in digestion.  We were using the probiotic drops from the pharmacy, but it's so much easier to just buy a formula with them already in it.<br /><br />PRO's<br />eases my baby's difficult feeding sessions<br />reduces her gassy/crying episodes<br /><br />CON's<br />still very new so no one really has bundle values on it yet, nor can you find at all stores.  Too expensive on all the websites, I used my coupons and got it at Babies R us, which currently has the best price.  Hoping for multi-canister bundle discounts soon.

review/text: Just had my second child 1 month ago today and I have not been able to sleep. I researched and found that this new formula has a probiotic that could help my baby. Within 5 days my baby is crying so much less and will actually take a bottle. I wish they had this formula for my first.  Gerber really has the best product for baby!

review/summary: wow! couldnt ask for better!
review/text: My one month old has already been on four formulas. This is the one that works! She started at the hospital on good start gentle. It progressively caused more and more gas. We tried the good start protect and that made it worse. Found out she has a lactose sensitivity so we put her on similac sensitive. That seemed to work for a bit until it constipated her TERRIBLY and eventually caused even more painful gas. We put her on this and she's has less gas and its no longer painful. And she can actually poop more than once every 1-2 days! She feels so much better. Im so thankful to have my happy baby back!! :)

review/summary: Worked Great for VERY Sensitive Son
review/text: Our son had a lot of problems with GERD (reflux) and pain and crying day and night.  The doctor believed it had to do with protein sensitivity (probably milk and/or soy).  So we first tried this for a week and we had a COMPLETELY new baby.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is simply because, while we were giving him only this along with rice cereal (to thicken...pretty common for reflux), his poop literally became the consistency (and look) of guacamole -> which led to some pain for him in the pooping department.<br />This is probably not fair to solely blame on Gerber Soothe, since we were the ones adding rice and I am assuming the rice did this.  But hey, 4 out of 5 ain't bad.<br /><br />I would highly recommend trying this for at least 1-2 weeks before going to the seriously expensive Enfamil stuff.

review/summary: Awesome colic/reflux formula
review/text: My LO has had reflux and fussiness since about his first week.  He was having difficulty nursing, wouldn't take a bottle and would throw up what he did get down.  He was prescribed Prevacid, which helped but he cried for 6 hours straight after having it so we stopped and just dealt with the fussiness and crying.  He was on BM and Nutramigen from about 3 weeks old until 6 weeks, when he then refused to eat.  We researched and switched to GS Soothe, and within 24 hours he was a changed baby!  He still refluxes and has sour burps on occasion, but overall it is way more manageable. His awake times are much more interactive, he smiles and talks and doesn't cry abnormally.  We love this formula, and use it along with BM.

review/summary: It's Working Great for Us
review/text: My little man had bad colic.  Screaming from morning to night colic.  I can't say that this formula cured his colic because Pediatric GI put him on the same probiotic that is featured in this product and my baby is happy.  I use this formula because it contains the same probiotic so it's just a little extra for my son's system.  My son has much less gas on this formula.  He can tolerate the Gerber Protect but not as well as this product.  I am keeping my son on this, hands down.<br /><br />I wouldn't look to this product to "cure" bad colic, you might need more probiotics but I am a strong supporter of this formula and glad it came out when it did.

review/text: This formula was the only one the market, after trying many, that made our twin sons stop fighting the bottle.  Before, they would arch their backs, and scream when we gave them the bottle.  They would only drink a little and be irritable from hunger all day long.  We were told they suffered from reflux.  After only 3 days, we have happy babies again.  They are eating well, and not irritable at all. Thank you Gerber!

review/text: We have been feeding Wysong to our cats for many years. It is a wonderful food, with no animal by-products(which research shows is very bad for your pets). We had a middle-aged cat in kidney failure who was given a 5% chance of surviving; we took a chance with the Wysong, and it turned her kidney values around to normal!The vet couldn't believe it and wanted to know what we were feeding her.We currently give Uretic to one of our male cats who had cystitis (the other cats can eat it as well). It is a wondferul food with no preservatives. We have a pet-sitting service and highly recommend it to our customers. It is so much healthier than the grocery store foods and even some of the foods available at pet stores.

review/summary: Miracle!
review/text: We started with this food with a female cat that had issues with Science Diet. We got a kitten and he insisted on eating the same food. Turned out that we were treating him for a condition we'd not expected. After the female cat was gone we chose to switch to a different Wysong formula. That resulted in his first blockage. My husband didn't pick up a bag soon enough and had to resort to a small bag of grocery store food. 24 hours later we were in the emergency room with another blockage. We got another kitten. Our older male got in to the kitten food. My husband is at the emergency room again . . . I was out of town and he didn't keep a close enough eye on what the cat was eating. As long as the cat is on the Wysong Uretic he's fine. If we can't keep him out of the kitten food, we'll have to resort to a PU. If your cat has urinary tract issues, this is a great non-surgical solution. We always get compliments on his beautiful coat from the techs and vets. I have a B.S. Animal Science, Pre-Vet and studied animal nutrition to extremes. Wysong is a fantastic brand of food that puts the animals first!

review/summary: Great natural alternative to prescription diets.
review/text: Are you looking for a more natural alternative to Hill's or other veterinary prescription diets?  If you are, you may have found the answer.  I either use this brand or Royal Canin's Urinary S/O for my cats.  My cats prefer the Wysong and my cats have not developed problems or blockages due to struvite crystal development since being on this diet.<br /><br />However, before you go replacing your veterinary diet, know what type of crystals your cats develop.  This diet, IMHO, is very appropriate for cats that develop struvite crystals and require a more acidic urine.  I cannot speak about this diet for cats that develop oxalate crystals.  Talk to Wysong and your vet before making the switch if your cat tends to develops only oxalate crystals or both struvite and oxalate crystals.

Now we are stuck with a month's worth of wet cat food that we can only be re-inbursed if we ship back.In a time of a recession when every dollar counts and I myself am working two jobs this company is horrible.Not to mention my cat is still sick.<br />Buyer beware if you love you cats do not buy this.

review/summary: Harleys MaMade
review/text: I have used MaMade as the basis for my home made Marmalade ever since I discovered it in the UK years ago. Thick cut (my preference)is harder to find than the thin cut. The way I use MaMade eliminates the difference anyway. I buy 2 large Navel Oranges, 4 large Lemons, and 1 Pink Grapefruit. I then use a paring knife to remove the outer skin of this fresh fruit and chop it all into small pieces. I then extract all the juice I can from this fruit and usually it is more than the 425ml called for in the MaMade recipe. I then boil the skin pieces in the about 500ml of combined juice to soften them up then add sugar to raise the boiling temperature to speed up the cooking process. After about 30 minutes of boiling I add the Mamade and rest of the 4lb of sugar. Because there is too much liquid in the mix to allow the marmalade to set without hours of boiling I add Pectin to the mix. MaMade already has Pectin in its ingredients but not enough if one adds more than 425ml of water. The added juice and pieces makes this the best marmalade you have ever tasted, plus you get more than 6lb of marmalade promised on the can.

It's easier not to scorch when making marmalade using this product than by cooking down raw fruit and grated peel.<br /><br />The product tolerates improvisation well, I've added shredded lemon peel, fresh ginger or finely chopped candied ginger or additional fresh lemon juice, or used demerara or other flavorful sugars as variations and been very happy with the results.<br /><br />You can tailor how firmly you want the jell set by using the cold plate method of testing during cooking. I prefer mine of a softer set but you can continue to cook it following instructions until it's quite firm.<br /><br />Keeps well when packed in sterile jars and processed in boiling water.

review/summary: Great marmalade
review/text: This mix makes great marmalade easily and quickly.  You just add sugar and water,cook it briefly, and pour into sterilized jars.  We were completely done (except for letting the filled jars cool) in about an hour start to finish.  The marmalade is better than even most of the imported marmalades, and equaled by only a couple.<br /><br />Our only issue was that the can arrived badly dented.  Since it was not leaking, etc, and processing includes boiling, we went ahead and used it.

review/summary: The Jam What Am From Amazon
review/text: With Ma Made marmalade mix making  eight 8-0z. size jars of wonderful marmalade is a cinch.  I use a le Creuset pot (an item I also highly recommend) dump the mixture in the pot, add the water indicated on the can, add four pounds of sugar, cook until a bit of the mixture on a cold plate is tested by seeing if it jells, then adding the jam to canning jars, wiping the rims carefully, putting new canning lids that have been kept in boiling water before using, then carefully putting rings around the lids and screwing them odd.  The jars are then placed on the rack in a canning kettle and boiled for at least ten minutes until they seal. Remove the rack from the canning kettle and, using a pot holder, remove the jars from the rack and place them on a wooden bread board.  Let them sit until the jar lids pop, indicating that they have sealed.  Store in a cool place, I have shelves in my basement.  I make other jams as well, but none are as easy as MaMade.<br /><br />A note of caution: one must be careful when making jams.  The mixtures are VERY hot so use proper precautions.<br /><br />This is one of the many useful items that Amazon sells.

review/summary: Brilliant
review/text: This year was the first year I have tried this product.  Now I am not a newcomer to canning.  In a given season I will prepare 72 cases of jams and jellies for sale.  But living in the North East trying to get seville oranges is like pulling teeth.  That was the inspiration  behind ordering Hartleys Orange Ma Made to begin with. So I thought, the worst thing that can happen is that it just doesn't taste like anything. This is a wonderful alternative to working with the real product.  I make other marmalades so I am familiar with the technique and work involved. My only criticism is that I was not able to order the "thick cut", so I added some of my own citrus to give it more texture.  Will order this again, but make sure I get the thick cut.

It was a big hit. My friends loved it and asked for the recipe. Fresh kumquats enhanced the flavor and fragrance.<br /><br />My friends couldn't believe it took only 30 minutes to make. They thought I spent hours boiling and stirring the syrup.<br /><br />Home made orange marmalade is one of the gifts to my friends in this Holiday and it will be every year.  Thanks to Harley's.....

review/text: I've been using this wonderful product for decades. It's quick, easy, foolproof and produces marmalade as good as any ready-made genuine Scottish marmalade. It's all about the Seville oranges. If, like some reviewers, you prefer a more chunky texture, sign up to be notified when Amazon has the Thick Cut version in stock, and Google it. Personally speaking, I wouldn't pollute either with non-Seville fruit (it absolutely ain't broke!).

review/summary: Best Marmalade You Can Make Yourself
review/text: We have used Hartleys Ma Made Seville Orange to make our own marmalade for many years.  Prior to discovering it, we had tried making marmalade from real Seville Oranges.  The big problems with that was not only the work involved in cutting up the oranges but, more importantly, if you can really find Seville Oranges at any grocery store, they usually appear only once a year and if you miss them, well too bad for another year.<br /><br />Hartley's Ma Made eliminates both those problems, although there are certain times of the year when it too seems to be unavailable for a while - presumably because the manufacturer is awaiting the oranges to come into season.  No problem though, because you can sign up at Amazon to be informed by email when it becomes available, which is what happened with our latest order.  After placing the order online, we received it (from California) about a week later.<br /><br />If you haven't tried making your own marmalade, let me encourage you to give it a try with this product.  We find it much tangier and tastier (and cheaper) than store-bought marmalade, which is often so sweet it masks the intended taste.  With Ma Made, you can add sugar to taste - we prefer the less-sweetened variety.<br /><br />My only regret is that the same company used to make both the thin- and thick-cut-peel varieties and we used to make a batch of each: I preferring the thick-cut and my wife the thin-cut.  Alas for me, the thick-cut variety seems to have been discontinued, at least for North American purchasers.

review/text: This is the fourth or fifth time I've made this marmalade and it has never failed.  It's even better if you add some additional rind to the mixture.  Use a potato peeler to cut the rind from 6 or more oranges, boil the rind for about 20 minutes and add to the marmalade.  But even without this extra rind it makes excellent marmalade.

AND it's organic to boot? How can you go wrong?  I think eating healthy soups like this for lunch will really help me on my "diet" since the healthy ingredients and fiber will keep me from craving more food (which is often one's body in search of more nutrition).  I hope Amazon offers the chicken soup soon. And free shipping - thank you Amazon.com for making my life easier and giving me more value!  I'd be lost without you.

review/text: I love icing, but I get so sick of the same old blah flavoring.  So when I was recently making cupcakes, I decided to mix things up a bit and get strawberry icing instead, and let me tell you, I am so glad that I did!  I had never tried Pillsbury's strawberry icing, therefore, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect.  I opened up the container and tasted it...it was sugary strawberry heaven!  Nearly everyone who ate a cupcake applied so much icing onto their cupcake that I ran out of icing before the cupcakes were finished, and I had to buy more!  I am assuming, of course, that people were heaping on the icing because it tasted good and not because the cupcakes were horrible and they were masking the taste.  ;)  The texture is just as the container says: creamy.  It is so easy to spread on a cupcake, and it just melts in your mouth.<br /><br />Obviously, there is pretty much nothing nutritious about this sugar-filled icing, and there are 150 calories in every serving size which is about 2 tablespoons.  Also in a serving size is 22 grams sugar and 6 grams fat.<br /><br />All in all, I am VERY pleased with this icing, and I will probably buy it the next time I make a cake or cupcakes.  I recommend it to anyone looking for good strawberry icing or someone looking for something other than the regular, boring cake frosting.

That type of tapioca doesn't fall into the "small pearl/large pearl" distinction.<br /><br />I found this tapioca to be nice, large and with a good texture when cooked with the package directions (soaked in milk, rather than water.)  It was the best deal I could find on tapioca.

review/summary: WORKS! They ALL like it; no force feeding here!!!!
review/text: With 7 large Greyhounds of my own plus fostering new Greys from the track all the time, this house has a minimum of 10 Greys in it at all times. I own and foster only special needs Greyhounds (never a shortage of them),  mostly due to broken legs and hocks at the track. I make glucosamine a daily staple in their morning meals (with my Vet's approval of course), regardless of their ages. I've tried countless products, some they liked and some they turned their snouts up in rebellion. Even my 3 older ones who have about 7 teeth total among them like these. (For my toothless wonders, I crush them before adding to their  bowl-break into pieces in my hands then use a small 'smack and chop' chopper on the cutting board and scoop the small pieces into individual bowls). My other 4 who still have most of their teeth wait for me at the top of the cellar stairs while I'm filling their bowls and placing one of these peanut butter biscuits on the top of each. While 1-2 try to distract me as I'm hauling all these bowls up the stairs, the others bob and weave in attempts to steal the treats out of the bowls as I near the top of the steps. Have to admit defeat on occasion when I'm not paying attention :(<br /><br />In any event, haven't met a Greyhound yet who does not love these. Not only that, I have seen remarkable improvement in agility, desire to play and romp, renewed interest in toys, consistent improvement in ease in pouncing on the beds, serious athleticism in swiping the tomatoes from my topsy turvys in the yard, even stealing a 3 lb pumpkin off the back step to munch on behind the tree in the back yard. The younger ones have resumed 'running laps' around the yard while the older ones (2 are 11, 9, 8, 5 and 2 are 4) seem younger and instigate play more often than before. They are energetic, not as stiff after a nap or nighttime, want to do more, play more, walk more/further and, while it may be my imagination, the older ones seem to be eating better. (They had gotten to a point where sometimes they would eat, sometimes not, sometimes just nibble a few bites and walk away).<br /><br />All in all, they like this product and I am thrilled already with the positive changes I see in my 'kids' who are always with me and the fosters who arrive in rough shape but leave for happy, responsible homes upon adoption. I dislike pumping meds into any pet when something else will help. I'm sticking with this product. It works for me and mine. I wouldn't purchase 7-10 6 lb bags of this product at a time if my pups weren't exhibiting such remarkable improvements. Their quality of life has definitely improved. Packaging says to allow 4-6 weeks for best results but it took less than 3 weeks for me to begin seeing significant changes in all of my guys and gals. Can't wait to see what 6+ weeks of using this product will produce!<br /><br />Each ALL NATURAL biscuit contains 500 mg glucosamine and is a substantial 'treat'. Biscuits are approx. 3-4" long and perhaps .75" high and quite crunchy to promote strong teeth and healthy gums. They are a bit difficult to break other than in halves. After that initial break, they are too tough to break into smaller chunks, thus the need for my abovementioned 'chopper'. Each bag purchased to date has arrived in excellent condition. Out of 14 6-lb bags to date (2 separate orders), only 2 biscuits were broken in half; nothing was crushed or broken into small chunks. Very little residue at bottom of resealable bags. Unfortunately, I did count the biscuits in the first 2 (original order) bags to determine whether or not I would stick with this product pricewise, but I've forgotten now what that count was so I cannot share that at this time. And because I'm back to order more, if I remember, I'll update this review when I count them again. Directions for use: 1/2 wafer/biscuit per 40 lbs body weight twice daily.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: Some (not all) of the statements on the reverse of package - thought I'd share before you buy:<br /><br />- Administer during or after the animal has eaten to reduce potential incidence of gastrointestinal upset.<br />- An exam from a vet is recommended prior to using this product.<br />- Keep out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, contact a health professional immediately.<br />- Safe use in pregnant animals or animals intended for breeding is not recommended.<br />- Consult with your vet before using this product in animals with clotting disorders, being treated with anticoagulant medications, diabetes, or any metabolic disorder causing hyperglycemia, history of urinary tract stones, and known allergies to shellfish.

review/summary: easy way to help doggie's joints
review/text: Force-feeding my dog glucosamine tablets got old pretty quickly. I bought a nice bag of these biscuits and the whole problem went away.  Based on my dog's size (90 lbs), my vet recommended 1000 mg of glucosamine -- just 2 biscuits a day.<br /><br />Almost all of the biscuits arrived whole and they stay fresh in the sealable bag.<br /><br />These definitely aren't gourmet treats so if your dog is finicky, you may want to use caution; mine ate them up with no problem.

review/text: This is a great product.  We have a large mixed breed dog who needs help with her joints.  She loves these biscuits. They also seem to do the trick for her joints.  I prefer the ones that are more of a bone shaped treat.  They give her more of a tooth work out. We have not been able to find the "bones" treats since we first stumbled across them at a local pet food supply store.  These are peanut shaped biscuits.  The price from Amazon was great too.

review/text: One problem I've experienced in caring for an older dog is finding a glucosamine supplement that our 65 lb., 15 year old Akita/Chow-chow mix would really like eating.  Finding one that our dog, Kuma-chan liked eating was a challenge.  We've tried tablets in her food and she would smell it mixed in and not eat until the next day.  Other biscuit type supplements were left uneaten.  Sometimes the gel capsule would be left at the bottom of her dinner bowl.<br /><br />As soon as the Nutri-Vet Hip & Joint Peanut Butter Large Dog Biscuits arrived, I offered a biscuit to Kuma.  She took it, wagged her tail and came back for another one!  Now, she knows that she only gets one every morning before her chicken jerky treats!  It's great when you don't have to force feed your best friend!  What a relief to see Kuma walk with minimal stiffness or pain in her hips after a couple of weeks.

review/summary: Horrible Packing
review/text: Glucosamine was highly recommended by a number of friends who own older dogs.  After reviewing most of the glucosamine dog products offered through Amazon, I decided on this one.  The cardboard box containing the 20 lbs. of "wafers" (actually a dog bone) was tightly sealed with packing tape when it arrived.  When I turned the box over to find the correct side to open, I could hear the contents inside tumbling around.  Much to my displeasure, when I opened the box the "wafers" were just thrown inside... much like a bag of pretzels or chips.  The box was about 2/3s full... I will have to take their word that there was 20 lbs inside.  Approx. half of the "wafers" were broken or shredded.  It was so bad that when I emptied the "wafers" into a plastic container, I was able to fill a 16oz. paper cup with the dust/particles found at the bottom of the box. (and that did not include the broken pieces!)<br /><br />The shipper didn't wrap the "wafers" in a plastic bag.  The shipper didn't make any attempt to protect or bubble-wrap the contents.  I'm not in a position to report the effectiveness of the glucosamine; but I can tell you I am extremely disappointed in the way it was packaged and shipped.  If you plan to order any of Amazon's glucosamine products; I strongly urge you to check the way in which it will be packaged.  Thumbs down to Amazon for this product!!!

And they seem to do the trick since she is a very 13 yr old with no noticeable joint pain.

I can honestly say, I saw the effects wear off the few days he was off then between shipments. We also saw him struggle when we had to have him fast before vet appointments.

review/summary: Seems to work
review/text: I have a year old Mastiff who came from a pretty bad situation when he was just 2 months old resulting in bad genetics and just overall he is a bit less healthy than a normal dog. I bought a small bag of these when they were on sale because it's pretty well known that Mastiff's have hip dysplasia issues as they age but unfortunately he has been showing symptoms (bunny hopping and some stiffness in the morning mainly) since 6 months... all that fast growing mixed with how large they get is a pretty bad combo for joints then a slow start and bad genetics on top of it can really mess up a Mastiff.... Because of this he has always been on glucosamine of some sort so I had no idea if these were working or not until I ran out and didn't bother buying more for a couple months.. I was thinking he was a pup, he wouldn't get much worse if I saved the money this month and just started back up when I had the extra money to buy the huge box again... I've seen HUGE changes in him since he has been off of these. I don't want to say it's the best source of glucosamine out there, but he LOVES the taste of them and it really does seem that he's been a bit more sore since he hasn't had them. I'm going to buy another box and see if he improves. I'll update my review after a month or so.

review/summary: Excellent Product Especially for Large Dogs
review/text: What better way to provide your dog with the potential benefits of Glucosamine?  Although the benefits for animals, such as dogs (and the jury is still out on humans too), are still argued, there are no drawbacks to providing your dog with Glucosamine.  If your dog loves peanut butter, then he or she will love these biscuits.  I selected this brand due to the natural ingredients as well as limited ingredients - there are no fillers, etc. in these biscuits.  Each biscuits contains 500mg of Glucosamine.  I provide my dog with two a day for his size (he is a large black lab, who often runs with me, as well as is an avid swimmer and walks an average of 3 miles a day).  All I have to do is say "biscuit" and he knows what he is getting.  Although if it is past his usually treat time, my dog is sure to remind me!<br /><br />I first purchased these biscuits at PetSmart about 6 months ago when I noticed my dog limping here and there - primarily after a lot of exercise.  He was approaching 7 years of age so I thought it was time to provide preventative measures for his hips and joints.  I found this item to be very expensive in PetSmart ($26.99 for one bag, so I decided to check Amazon when I was almost out of the biscuits.  I was able to purchase them for $17.99 a bag - almost a $10 difference!  Being a Prime member, I received free shipping.  Excellent deal all around.<br /><br />I am extremely picky with what my dogs eats, and I would highly recommend this product.  There is also a smaller biscuits size for small and medium dogs.

review/summary: Always reliably effective - and healthful too!  :)
review/text: Our 9 year old ~50lb blue heeler/border collie cross girl dog shows a near immediate difference between orders of these.  Yeah, I know, it is completely my fault not hers for not ordering the next couple of bags before the current one runs out.  She'd be right on top of it if she could. Anyway... she has had a broken front leg most of her life, and is showing a little soreness once in a while in her rear right hip without these biscuits.  Several days off of these biscuits is too long.<br /><br />But within a day or two of feeding these to her, she's back to walking normal again.  I know I know.  some of you might be calling BS on that, but I know our little girl dog here and how sensitive she is to any change in nutrition.  Just a few kibbles make a difference with her weight.  she's fed twice a day, about a cup or a little less each time, and one of these biscuits with her supper.<br /><br />Nutri-Vet did a very good job with these.  If I liked peanut butter flavor, I'd eat'em too for my bad joints.  You definitely can't beat the mg/biscuit for the price.<br /><br />In short, I'd most definitely recommend these for any dog who needs 'em.  They work.<br />And of course, Amazon always has the best price - even though several other places try to undercut amazon by a few bucks, they kill the deal with their shipping costs.  One thing that cracks me up though about Amazon, is the big box of these is, per biscuit or per pound, MORE expensive than buying a few 6lb'ers.  so watch that.  Bulk is not always in your favor.  If it is the box convenience you're after, use a plastic tub at home 'n empty the bags into it.  Oh, the bags also reseal to keep these from drying out - they're alreay crumbly crunchy texture, but I guess it makes us people feel better to think our dog(s) are getting the most fresh they can.<br /><br />Good luck, and remember - always do your best to be the great person your dog figures you are - it helps.<br /><br />Chuck

review/text: Our four dogs love these.<br />It appears that these no longer get put into a plastic bag before being put into the box. This allows all sorts of mishaps.<br />The first box we got this way had mostly broken bits and appeared to be stale. (No, the puppies did not complain)<br />Amazon.com send out a replacement box. This one was full of little bugs. Grose. It got tossed into the trash. (Puppies were sad...)<br /><br />So I called the company, spoke to a very nice person who said they would look into it, and get back to me.<br />Less then a week later, a box arrived, and in it were four 6lbs bags of these treats! These 6lbs bags are heavy duty and re-sealable.<br /><br />Although I am not sure why they do not seal the 20lbs boxes as they used to, the company did a very nice CS fix, and I will continue to support them by buying the 6lbs bags.

review/text: My dog routinely spits out the chewable tablets and/or manages to eat around them when I try to hide them in her meals.  I mash the tablets and mix them into her meals and she ddoesn't seem to notice, however mashing the tablets and dosing the food, although not a huge effort, was quickly replaced with these biscuits once I found my dog actually likes the biscuits.<br /><br />I too found many broken biscuits, however I toss the broken bits into a meal and my dog thinks she's struck gold (she'll dig the bit out from the bowl, race down the hallway as if to hide the find from me while she gobbles it up, then return to finish her meal).<br /><br />My vet recommended glucosamine as a preventive measure for my dog (a seven year old SPCA-special, mini Aussie/Border Collie mix), coupled with the need to shave a few pounds from her as an added preventive measure - ultimately, these biscuits, bits and pieces included, have replaced many of the more caloric treats I was giving my dog - that's why I don't mind the broken bit (yes, I was guilty of providing too many treats, hence the need for her to drop a bit of weight).  Although my dog doesn't have joint issues, she has dropped two pounds and if that's all the biscuits do for her at this stage, well, I still think we're both ahead of the game :)<br /><br />Here's hoping my dog doesn't tire of these biscuits :)

She's still incredibly active, but isn't as quick out of the gates as she used to be.  I figured that I would start her on some hip and joint meds, so I bought some pills to put in her food.  Then I found these, which she loves.  She's definitely not finicky, but she won't eat just anything either, and she gobbles these up.  I've given her 2 a day for about 3+ months, and I've found 3 broken biscuits.  Living in Colorado, nothing really goes stale out here, so I can't speak to that.  She loves them, and they seem to be working.

review/summary: Broken pieces, some dogs don't like them
review/text: About 80% of the biscuits were broken, clearly not the cause of shipping since the box is strong and undamaged.  Some of our dogs eat them, others won't.  Considering they all like to browse the kitty litter, that's saying a lot.  I'll probably switch back to the treat version made by another brand.  The expiration date was fairly close at 04/10, though not a problem.  I purchased two boxes.<br /><br />3 stars, one less for too many broken biscuits, another for some dogs preferring kitty cat 'tootsie rolls' over these biscuits.

review/summary: EXCELLENT QUALITY DOG BISCUITS ~ MY DOGS LOVE THEM & FREE PRIORITY SHIPPING FROM AMAZON!!!!!
review/text: This is a wonderful deal on these super fine quality dog biscuits.  Certainly not made like the typical ones you find in stores.  They are not only made of the finest ingredients, but have added nutrients for their joints.  They are medium size, smooth and solid ~ not crumby like all the others.  My dogs love these Peanut Butter Biscuits.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE VERY FAST AND FREE PRIORITY SHIPPING AMAZON!!!!!

review/summary: Don't  Get Too Excited About Ice Cream of the Month Club
review/text: I received 3 months of Ice Cream from this Club as a gift. I was very disappointed with the Ice Cream I received and the giver was unhappy after seeing the choices I was sent each month. The first 2 months included a duplication of black walnut, a very bland vanilla frozen yogurt, some type of caramel,that didn't taste at all like caramel(I tried,but couldn't give it away), also 2 peppermint in one month. I emailed them after the 2nd month with my complaint,thinking they might want to take a second look at what was being sent. I did receive an immediate response, with an apology and an offer of an extra month of ice cream. They also told me they spoke with their shipper and was told my 3rd month was really going to be scrumptous. I just received it. May be somewhat better, but there is only one pint with higher butterfat then the average grocery store brand, 2 frozen custards, and 1 "neopolitan"(how exciting)in a square cardboard carton and from a company not even mentioned in their ad. We have a number of Ice Cream stores in our city and thus far I have only received 1 pint each month that might compare. I felt I should write this review because the person who sent this gift had no reviews to read and had no idea that I might receive duplicates, along with the vanilla custard and neopolitan.

review/summary: REVOLTING!!! I took two bites and scraped it into the trash.
review/text: Two bites because the first bite was so horrible I couldn't believe anything could really be that bad.<br /><br />How a reputable company can put its name to a product like this defies credulity.  Dinty Moore Beef Stew is bad but edible as a last resort to avoid starvation; they should have left bad-enough alone.<br /><br />I'm a good cook and buy almost no pre-made foods like this, but there are a handful I think worth keeping on hand for emergencies. One of them has long been Sweet Sue's Chicken & Dumplings; perfectly edible heated right out of the can, but w/the addition of a poached & shredded chicken breast and its reduced broth, a splash of white wine, a shake of Penzey's Fox Point seasoning, some minced parsley,  it is quite presentable in a pinch and my grandchildren love it. (I once took a tweaked batch of it--6 big cans--to a church potluck, and one of the best cooks in the church (NC girl)  said, "Good job on the C&D!" :o)<br /><br />Compared to Dinty Moore's abomination, Sweet Sue's is 3 star Michelin.  Let me try to describe the former.  What you see first when you open the can is a translucent gelatinous sludge (thickened w/potato starch, I read).  If you move it around you see it envelops certain solids.  The almost non-existent chicken is pulpy, like ground chicken paste reformed in small lumps. The dumplings are hard, tough as shoe leather!  (How did they manage THAT?)  The taste I can't begin to describe.  A blindfolded person would never in a million years connect it with chicken.<br /><br />If you think I exaggerate, waste ~$14 (incl. shipping) on a can  (FOURTEEN DOLLARS????) and chalk it up as preventive health care.

review/summary: Great sauce for combination
review/text: I eat couscous as my main carb staple daily and i always use Jyoti sauces like this to prepare it. For one bowl of couscous you will need about 1/3rd can of this to have a hearty filling meal. The saffron in this and other Jyoti sauces (all of them have it and taste almost similar) makes up for a special addictive taste that you will keep coming back to regularly.<br />To make a tasty bowl of couscous that will feed 1-2 person, use the following below.<br /><br />1/3rd can of one of the Jyoti sauces below.

review/summary: Nothing beats Coffee-Mate regular powder!
review/text: I'm so happy Amazon got this in again, finally! Coming in a 12 pack sold by Amazon itself, eligible for free super saver shipping, and shipped in a firmly packaged plastic wrap covering all 12 canisters, it just makes it so convenient to have it shipped to me in bulk and I know I have plenty on hand for a while. I've been a fan of the regular Coffee-mate powder since the early 1970's and nothing seems to be able to compete with it. Even though I've tried the other flavors and the liquids Nestle also makes, and likewise tried other brands, I always come back to this Original Regular Coffee-Mate Powder and believe it will always be my preference for a really rich and flavorful addition to my coffee. Very smooth and blends well, and is shelf stable, which means less trips to the grocery store for me. One of my favorite products that makes for a happy life!

review/summary: Hydrogenated oils are poison
review/text: Any product with hydrogenated vegetable oils isn't worth buying.  The fact that they are pretending not do have any by using a low serving size and rounding down to get to "0" grams, makes this a scam.  Shame on you Nestle.<br /><br />Hydrogenated oils have been banned in NY for a reason - they are poison for the human body. See the Wikipedia article on trans fats for more information.  Here is a clip : "Because of these facts and concerns, the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption. There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats. This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease.[2] "

review/summary: Contains trans-fat, although the law lets them claim 500 milligrams = 0 grams
review/text: The product is labeled as having "zero grams" trans fat, but it also has "partially-hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel" [sic] on the online ingredient list as of Nov 2007.  Note that "Partially-hydrogenated oil" is "trans-fat".<br /><br />The law in the united states allows them to claim "zero grams" if they have 500 milligrams or less.<br /><br />I will quote from the following article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al "Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354, pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />to explain why this is really terrible:<br /><br />I quote from page 1609 of this article:<br /><br />"However, the producers of foods that contain less<br />than 500 mg of trans fatty acids per serving will<br />be allowed to list the content of trans fatty acids<br />as 0 on the packaging, so even consumers who<br />read the labels might unwittingly consume substantial<br />amounts of trans fats in multiple servings<br />(for example, several pats of margarine or<br />several cookies per day)."<br /><br />Here are a few more quotations from this article:<br /><br />"given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from<br />CHD ["coronary heart disease"] in the United States,82 near-elimination of<br />industrially produced trans fats might avert between<br />72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent)<br />CHD events [i.e. "heart attacks"] each year.<br />These estimates are based on the replacement<br />of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however,<br />trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils<br />would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated<br />(cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have<br />additional potential benefits as compared with<br />carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit<br />is considered, greater proportions of CHD<br />events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only 2-3% of the american diet in terms of calories (and fat is high in calories!):<br /><br />"The average consumption of industrially produced trans<br />fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental<br />studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational<br />studies, the consumption of trans fatty<br />acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides<br />no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable<br />potential for harm."<br /><br />Professor Willett has also written extensively about trans-fat for a general audience in his book "Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."
