review/summary: A new favorite!
review/text: I have been on a beef jerky kick lately, and this is one of my new favorites. It starts with the tenderness of the meat. The meat is on the soft side but still has a nice chew to it. It's real pieces as apposed to the artificial looking variety. The flavor has a nice smoky BBQ base and the sweetness of the honey and the mild heat from the chipolte is perfect. I've tried multiple Sweet Baby Ray products and have yet to be disappointed. Grab a bag or two, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Outstanding
review/text: They carry this at Walmart and it's outstanding.  It tastes just like sweet baby rays.  I especially like it because the jerky is on the softer end... none of those endlessly chewy pieces.  It has a really great after taste too. Try it out!

review/summary: Best jerky you can buy
review/text: This is the best jerky I have ever tasted!  To the guy who gave this a two star rating because they changed the flavor from the 80s?  They didn't mass produce Sweet Baby Rays until the mid 90's so your product review is based on a completely different product or you clicked on the wrong link/product to review.

review/summary: Unexpected surprise - makes great appreciation gift!
review/text: Each year there are 20 or so people I like to give a little gift at Christmas time to people like ballet teachers, daycare workers, etc.  The costs add up pretty quickly at a time of year when there are lots of other costs, so I am always on the look-out for something that is nice, and affordable.  I came across the Davidson's Holiday Tea 4-pack and thought I would give them a try this year.<br /><br />I was expecting a pack of 4 in a clear plastic box with a gold elastic bow tied to it as in the picture above.  I opened the box and could immediately smell Christmas!  Looking in, I quizzically lifted 3 beautiful little maroon burlap bags out of the box.  Each maroon burlap bag holds 4 boxes of tea with 8 tea bags in it, and is approximately 8.5" x 7" with a clear window in the front and a handle made of  bamboo cane.  Additionally there is red, green and gold raffia which ties a teapot cookie cutter to the bag.  What an unexpected and delightful surprise!<br /><br />Wanted to update:  I placed two more orders and one came in the bags as described above, and the other looked more like the picture- my guess is that these must be coming from two different distributors.  Still lovely and a good buy.

review/text: Before I tried Yamasa soy sauce I was kind of meh about soy sauce in general. I started purchasing sushi from a store where the soy sauce they used was Yamasa, I couldn't believe how fantastic it was! I wanted to drench my sushi in it and make all kinds of dishes with it. After searching high and low in all kinds of grocery stores (including the one I purchased the sushi from) I decided to order it online and I'm not sorry! The 3 pack is totally worth it and I've been enjoying it immensely every since it arrived. Yamasa is the BEST soy sauce out there today!

review/summary: I am an Americolor convert!
review/text: When I learned to decorate cakes over 10 years ago, I learned using Wilton.  I love Wilton, I'm a big advocate for all things Wilton.  Until now.  I am officially an Americolor convert.  These colors are so amazingly vibrant!  And using them to make paint (with clear vanilla), to paint on fondant and gumpaste is a TREAT.  They are some much smoother and easier to use and the colors are so brilliant I doubt I will ever buy Wilton color again.  I still love many, many things Wilton - but for color I'm hooked on Americolor!

review/summary: Really, REALLY black!
review/text: I read the previous reviews of AmeriColor's Super Black icing coloring and decided to give it a try to make my daughter's zebra-striped birthday cake. I wanted a black that I could use without having to start with chocolate icing (birthday girl does not like chocolate!). It turned snow-white marshmallow fondant BLACK, with very little of the gel and no noticeable taste difference. I was afraid that the coloring would leave my hands purple or blue, but the only place I noticed a stain was where I touched the full-strength coloring directly--once I mixed it in with the melted marshmallow before mixing the powdered sugar in to make the fondant, there were not problems with stains. I can't say if it would stain stone counters, though--I was not brave enough to test it on my granite, and so I kneaded the fondant on wax paper. Like other reviewers, I was a Wilton fan for years, but love this new alternative and will definitely be using AmeriColor from now on.

review/summary: Does the job as far as frosting goes...
review/text: I ordered this in anticipation of making my son an x-box cake for his 8th birthday.  The cake did indeed look black after mixing this coloring with the chocolate frosting, so I'd say it works.  It will also color your tongue bluish but that's just par for the course.  My son was happy so even if I wouldn't eat the final product, I'd say it was a success.

review/text: Ok, now I understand why so many people online recommend using AmeriColor brand for my icing and fondant-coloring needs. I bought the black, and the color was super strong. Worked really well. I'll probably buy one of their color kits now that I know it's a great brand.<br /><br />The only thing I haven't tried yet is using it to color melted chocolate - I've been told that water-based dyes like this one will make the chocolate crumble. But *shrug* it doesn't hurt to try. I will give an update when I do!

review/summary: Be aware that the photo is NOT what you will get
review/text: I finally received the color that I ordered - there was a mixup on the seller's end, but they did<br />get right on it and send out the right color.  I have not used it yet - I bought it for special cupcakes<br />for an event in a few days. I'll add to the review when we have actually used the product.<br /><br />I did want to mention, though, for those who think this might be a really great deal - the bottle<br />you see in the photo is NOT the bottle you are purchasing. You are getting one of the very small (under 3" tall)<br />drop bottles, not one of the large ones shown in the photograph. I wanted to point that out, because for people who<br />are only looking at the photos, it is misleading. Not sure why some sellers feel the need to be sneaky, but<br />I guess they try for more sales that way.<br /><br />I'll be back to review the actual gel once we are done with the project.<br />Just don't expect the big bottle when you purchase from this listing.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Well, I am now a HUGE fan of the gel coloring!<br />It worked like a dream, gave us a beautiful frosting that looked like black leather (but soft).<br />No purples or blues, no weird shades - just great color.<br />Now I will probably have to get more colors, because with these, I might start decorating cupcakes again!<br />I am adding a photo of our cookout cupcakes that we used the frosting for... it all looked great!

review/summary: Meth
review/text: I used this to make rocky candy as meth for a costume prop. I dressed as Hiesenburg from Breaking Bad. It does work, I used two drops, but you have to be careful. Because boiling sugar, corn syrup and hot water makes a yellowish color, adding too little, too much or stirring too much can change to a green color. Took me three tries (first Americolor Sky Blue, second McKormick Neon Blue and third Americolor Sky Blue again), but I got it eventually.

review/summary: Total sham...not great coffee...not like Kona
review/text: I tried this blend for the value. It wasn't rank, but it wasn't great...nor did it taste like Kona. My biggest concern is their labeling this as "Kona," when it's really not. Apparently it has some Kona beans in there, but nowhere do they state how much. Online they say their blend is "private." I get the notion that we have a sort of Cracker Jack situation here, with a package full 'o cheap beans and a single little Kona bean waaaaaaaaayyyyyyy down in the bottom like a toy prize.<br /><br />I would give this coffee 2.5 stars based solely on taste and dollar value (compared to plain coffee). I drop it to one star because I don't like companies scamming me. If they want to use a luxury name like Kona, they absolutely need to disclose how much is in there. Ask yourself...does a corporation use a name like Kona and mix it with inferior beans because they want to offer Kona taste at a fair price to you, or is it more likely they're using the Kona name to get more money per pound for the 95%+ other, cheaper beans in the mix? I'm no cynic, but...<br /><br />I would not pay $60,000 for a Ford Taurus with 2% BMW parts...I would not pay $1,000 for a Senseo just because it has a Rancilio drip tray...I would not pay $30 per lb for prosciutto that was mostly Safeway deli ham. Why would I pay anything for a coffee that is some unknown percent Kona and the rest beans they got from a pickup on the side of the road?

review/text: I love Kopali.  But i especially love what Kopali is about.  Sustainability, fair trade, everything any company selling food should be about.  I love spending my dollars here.  This chocolate tastes great, and is great.  I cannot ask for more when it comes to food, and chocolate!

review/summary: I love Kopali Products!!!
review/text: After purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUHG">Kopali goldenberries</a>, I tried a few other Kopali snacks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIRCZ6">chocolate covered cacao nibs</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUTE">chocolate covered banana</a>.<br /><br />The goldenberries are the best dried fruit I have ever had. They are bursts of sweet and tangy flavor and achieve the same satisfaction as sour gummies. Grown in Columbia, goldenberries are high in antioxidants, bioflavonoids, fiber, and even contain protein. They are a great snack and are somewhat filling.<br /><br />The dark chocolate covered nibs are also good. The small package contains a lot more nibs than it seems at first. The nibs are crunchy, high in antioxidants, and a little bit bitter, but the dark chocolate balances the bitterness nicely.<br /><br /> The chocolate covered bananas were also delicious. I expected them to be crispy, but instead they were chewy and a bit zesty. Each of the Kopali Organics products is a healthy and satisfying snack. You should try them (especially the goldenberries)!

review/summary: Try a little before you buy a lot.
review/text: This is a really good product for what it is. Let me start by telling you what it isn't. It is not rice nor even a close substitute. The only reason this is considered a rice substitute is the size of a single piece of the product. They are small (round in fact usually) and if you are looking for something to use instead of carb rich rice this is a good product if you know what you are getting. I say try a package before you commit to a case.<br />If you are wanting something with the texture and/or taste of rice, this product is not for you.<br /><br />Now I will go over what this product is. It is a very filling, fairly tasteless filler or bed for a dish you are cooking. I use it for the "bed" for my families stir fry. I knew what to expect and realize it isn't anything like rice so I liked it.<br />I don't do the boil and dry method. I will open the bag and drain the HORRIBLE smelling water. Rinse the product thoroughly (I recommend a wire strainer). The smell will mostly dissipate with rinsing, but the final cooking method took care of the last of it for me. After rinsing I will put the product in a coated (stick free) skillet and cook it over medium heat until all of the water has evaporated. This gives you a dry product and improves the texture over just straight boiling and patting. It is pretty quick to prepare in this method (5-8 minutes).<br /><br />Also, from my diabetic experiences, you can use a blender or food processor and chop fresh cauliflower (I suppose frozen would work too). This gives a slightly more rice like texture and with a bit more taste, but you have to like cauliflower. Still not a rice substitute.<br /><br />Over-all the miracle rice is a really good product and it is quite a good addition to healthy diets. Just know what you are getting into and don't be discouraged by the smell of the product when first opened. Bon Appetit!

review/summary: not good at all
review/text: I tried the shirataki noodles and the rice is no different.  However, since they are small little "dots" similar to pastina or orzo they are easier to eat but they don't hold any sauce or gravy.  Its a shame because they are so healthy.  The texture is not good.  They are slippery.  Once you rinse both the noodles and rice at least 5 times in cold water, there is no smell but I just can't get past the texture.  Unfortunately for me, I bought 6 packages.  Can't waste my money so they will be a good filler to add to my dog's food.

review/summary: One of the best dry dog foods.
review/text: I have two terrier mixed breeds and have been feeding them Acana for years. Acana and Orijen are made by the same company, but because Acana is a little cheaper, I go with that. People may scoff at the prices, but when it comes down to it, a 30 lb bag of your everyday dog food costs almost the same as Acana or Orijen but does NOT compare in quality and nutrient availability. One of my dogs has terrible allergies and if I feed her "normal" food, she gets terrible dandruff. However, when I bring her out, everyone mentions how soft and shiny her coat is. My vet remarks that her teeth are in amazing shape (no plaque). She has never had bad breath one day in her life nor has she ever been overweight! I attribute this to her diet. She is 49 lbs and she gets two cups per day of Acana, any type, though Grasslands, Pacifica and this have been the best (the others I admit are too expensive for me, and I don't feed chicken). I don't feed wet food, but she does get one or two treats per day as well. My other dog is 30 lbs and she gets 1.5 cups per day as she is a little porker and will find scraps around the house wherever she can. This dog does have bad breath, which we are realize is likely due to digestion. We have switched from Pacifica (which is very high in Omega oils) to this one and her breath has vastly improved. My vet said that terrier breeds usually have poorer digestion, and high fats can cause some bad breath. I am buying Lamb & Okanagan Apple from now on. I trust this company and appreciate the efforts they put into their product. I have also e-mailed the company to ask about digestibility and they took the time to e-mail me back with thoughtful insight. I hope you try this brand and like it as much as I do!<br /><br />On a side note, I also have a cat. I feed him Acana dry as well as Tiki Cat wet at night. I have gone through FAR less dry food with the cat than I have with any other brand as he seems fuller from it through the day. What a great buy!

review/summary: Great nutrition for your pet!
review/text: I have a miniature Australian Shepherd who has allergies, and a sensitive stomach. We tried many foods for her before we got Acana, and we haven't left since. She no longer gets an upset tummy after eating, and she has normal digestion with no issues. Acana is a higher protein dog food without all of the soy, corn, and meat "byproducts" most mass produced foods have. This food is more expensive than some foods out there, but it's worth it to keep our little lady healthy and happy. The lamb and apple flavor is her favorite ever, and it has nothing but great ingredients. There isn't anything on the label that is unidentifiable or questionable. Definitely worth the price!

review/summary: Dogs Love Dingos
review/text: I have yet to encouter a dog that doesn't enjoy Dingos. From the youngest puppy to the oldest senior, they all have loved the various Dingo bones and treat.<br /><br />The biggest challenge is buying a size big enough to prevent the dog from eating it rather than chewing it.  This is not true of all dogs, but if the dog has food or treat issues it can be a consideration.  They really lovethese treats and seem to not want to be patient or risk not getting the entire bone. And most of the dogs I have given these to also tend to want to chew them from start to finish, so I do have to take the treat away from a dog occasionally.<br /><br />There are Dingo imitators out there that cost less, but I have yet to find one that is of similar quality. I have tried a couple and will continue to sample others, but so far there is not a generic Dingo equivalent.

review/text: All my dogs love these bones. They won't touch regular rawhide.I have three small dogs and I get these big dingo bones because only the largest one (a cockapoo) can actually make any noticeable headway in chewing them. So she starts them and the other two finish them over the course of a few weeks. This way, they are not so pricey and they are large enough that the choking concern is diminished. But because of other reviews, I still am in the room when they are chewing them.

review/summary: My son loves this Mac & Cheese
review/text: My son is now 14 months old. The first 2 times I tried to feed him the Butternut Squash and Mac & Cheese he wouldn't have anything to do with it.  He was about 10 months old then. Now that he's older, he loves this and it's a great addition to his diet.  I read that you are supposed to try several times with foods that babies reject and not to give up.  That's what I did and it paid off.  Not only does he eat this now, he also eats the black beans and sweet corn too.  The texture is a little dry but my son doesn't seem to mind at all.  Sprout is definitely the best baby food on the market.  I've tried all of the other brands and they go from average to really bad.  I like knowing that all Sprout meals are organic and prepared to bring out the natural flavors of food.  And the best way to get all of the food out is to squeeze the package from the bottom.  I also bought some longer baby spoons which makes it much easier to feed him right from the package.

review/text: I was worried after seeing some negative reviews here and on another site but I got a few packages of this macaroni and cheese from our local drugstore anyway. My son had tried and liked a lot of other Sprout flavors -- basically, everything except the creamy chicken with mixed veggies was a hit, including the lasagna, the holiday turkey with veggies and the minestrone with beans and greens -- but this one is by far his favorite. He will inhale a whole pouch happily. I would rather make him my own mac and cheese but as a working mom I just don't always have the time, and the Sprout pouches are super convenient to throw in the diaper bag. This one is a winner!

review/summary: Nice flavor, but might be too thick/chunky for babies new to textured foods.
review/text: My baby girl absolutely adores Sprout stage 1 and 2 pureed baby foods, so I was really looking forward to giving her Sprout stage 3 foods when she turned 8 months old and was ready for an introduction to textured solids.  The first time we tried this Sprout stage 3 Butternut Squash Mac & Cheese, my little-one gagged so hard that her eyes watered!  (And she also panicked a little ... very scary for Mom & Dad!)  I know that a bit of gagging is to be expected when introducing a baby to textured solids, but this was well beyond the norm.  I then tried some of the Mac & Cheese myself, and while it was certainly flavorful, it contained pretty large chunks of food, like whole pieces of elbow macaroni.  Plus, it was so thick that you could barely stir it with a spoon.  Definitely too much for my baby, who'd only had smooth purees up to that point.  Sprout is definitely the thickest and chunkiest of the organic stage 3 baby foods that I've tried.  The stage 3 training dinners from Plum Organics and Ella's Kitchen are textured, but they contain very small, soft bits of meat, vegetables and rice/pasta that were much easier for my baby to manage (i.e., little or no gagging).<br /><br />Once your baby is comfortable eating chunky textured solids, Sprout stage 3 baby foods are bound to become a favorite.  The Mac & Cheese (and the other flavors) are very tasty and well-seasoned, minus the added salt and sugar, which babies don't need.  And Sprout baby food is certified organic to boot.  Therefore, I'll be storing these stage 3 pouches in the back of my pantry for a few weeks until my baby girl is ready for them.<br /><br />For advanced textured solid-eaters: A<br />For newbies: C

He would gag even when the spoon got close to his mouth.<br /><br />I have 11 more pouches so I'll try again in a couple of weeks but my husband (who loves to taste-test my son's food) also said it was yucky.

review/summary: These Mangoes has become my favorite dried fruit
review/text: I like dried fruit. Ever since I discovered these dried Mangoes they have become my favorite dried fruit.  They are a blend of sweet and sour taste, that leaves a wonderful complex flavor in your mouth. I have tried other Mangos that have additional sugar added to them, and the ones with extra sugar are too sweet for me.  This variety, however, is perfect! They are also rather soft as far as dried fruits go.  The only problem with them I have is stopping after just one piece!<br /><br />I found the best price for these Mangoes at Costco. Amazon price fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  "Online Price Alert".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful.

review/summary: Excellent Treat!
review/text: A couple years ago I picked up a bag of Philippine Dried Mangos and I can still remember how much I liked them. I found them at Costco, but when I returned to pick up another bag they were gone. I wanted to write a review telling others how good they were, but Amazon didn't carry them at the time. Well, today I visited Costco again and they were back. Yum. I just had to pick up a 30-ounce bag. And they're just as delicious as I remembered.<br /><br />I use these dried mangos as a snack, as an item I put into my bagged lunch and I like to take them and other dried fruits and nuts along on camping trips. The only problem I have with them is that they're hard to stay away from. Excellent treat!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Great if you want it as candy!!!
review/text: I am a health food nut. I discovered dried mangos in my local nature/organic food store. They were bulk quantity by the scoop around 9-10/lb. I LOVED THEM so much and soo much healthier as a substitute for a sweet snack, that I wanted to find a better price. After reading reviews about this brand I went to Costco and bought the 30 ounce bag... HERE ARE MY THOUGHT<br /><br />IT CANNOT EVEN COMPARE TO THE NATURAL literally RAW pieces of dried Mango in the organic store WITH NO ADDITIVES!!!! We are talking about DRY pieces of real fruit<br /><br />This AS I SUSPECTED (but nevertheless bought the bag) IS MORE LIKE CANDY!!!!<br />Ingredients list: Dry Mango, SUGAR, Sulfur Dioxide (for preservative)<br /><br />The pieces of mango are COATED with something like powdery SUGAR!!! It is very sweet. 31g of Sugar per serving of ~42g. ALSO the inside part is sort of still juicy EXACTLY LIKE A CANDY. And dont get me even started on the Sulfur Dioxide. I bought grapes that said: "Treated with SO2 PLEASE RINSE THOROUGHLY!!"<br /><br />SO HOW DO I RINSE THIS MANGO!!!<br /><br />SUMMARY: If you want candy-like stuff, buy it. GREAT PRICE. If you want REAL RAW amazing dry mango with no sugar and no chemicals go to a organic health store. My store recently had a sale I got 3 pounds at 7$, which is just as low as the costco one. I will finish this bag that I bought from Philippines and never buy it again.<br /><br />P.s. My first amazon review JUST because I knew that I will be tricked into getting this candy but went ahead anyway to prove my initial worries.

review/summary: Special Needs/Picky Cat LOVES These!
review/text: Since I have never had a cat before adopting Lulu,  I didn't know what would taste good to her when I first shopped for treats, let along healthy ones.  I decided from the beginning that I wouldn't feed her junk foods out of concern for her overall well-being, and because I had to be careful not to do more damage to her teeth: she came to me with advanced dental decay that required surgery, and now only has 3 teeth left, so she prefers treats that are easier to chew (on top of being too hard for her to chew, some pet foods and treats contain sugar, grains, and other ingredients that could promote further tooth decay).<br /><br />I bought the PureBites Turkey treats on a whim because they are straightforward and don't have any by-products or grains: they are just turkey!  I have also tried giving her Blue Buffalo jerky-type treats, and while I think she would also have liked the flavor of those, she prefers the PureBites because I think these melt in her mouth and are easier to chew.  So, from my experience, these treats have been great for a cat with special dental needs!  I will be buying these from Amazon more often because, as with most things, they are cheaper on here than in the pet store.<br /><br />As for the taste, even though she is usually cautious with new foods, she LOVES these: one night I forgot to put them away where she can't reach them, and I woke up to her bringing me the pouch lol.  I have to say after going through that experience, it's an added bonus that it's a more-or-less cat-proof pouch and she couldn't really open it on her own.  They work well as a motivation tool: she gets in her carrier by herself if I put a few in the back, reducing stress of going to the vet for both of us.  When she needed surgery and was fasting, these treats are really convenient because I could break off a tiny piece or use just the powder at the bottom to get her to go in without actually feeding her a whole treat.<br /><br />They won't fatten your cat up if you give the treats out sparingly (which is easy to do with the PureBites because you can break off smaller chunks of the treats if you need to), she is motivated by them because they taste so good to her, and they don't seem to agitate her gums when she eats them.  This is our go-to treat!

review/summary: Not as good as Godiva Hot Cocao
review/text: I bought this for the price.  I have been a fan of Godiva's Hot Cocoa (Dark and Milk) for about a year.  While much better than those instant hot cocoa (Swiss Miss, Carnation etc) that are made with water - it leaves a slight aftertaste that I do not like.  Also, it did not mix as easily (dissolve) as the Godiva did.  I think it (like wine and food) is just a personal taste.  Try both brands and see for yourself.

review/summary: Absolutely the best sipping chocolate!
review/text: I am incredibly picky when it comes to chocolate, and most chocolate mixes are simply sugar with a few specks of chocolate.  Bellagio sipping chocolate is by far the BEST chocolate mix I have ever tried...and I've tried many!  It is a little more expensive than other brands of cocoa mix, but you definitely get what you pay for.  A little goes a long way, and you can make anything from hot cocoa to thick sipping chocolate to "spoon" chocolate to chocolate mousse....the list goes on and on.  I even made a great "chocolate emergency" frosting by simply mixing some of the chocolate in with a bowl of whipped cream.  And as an added bonus, the tin the chocolate comes in is super cute and makes a wonderful gift.

You can follow the directions on the package for a 4 oz. thick, rich and robust sipping chocolate, or add more milk to make more of a hot chocolate/cocoa consistency.  Either way, it is delicious!  It melts very well into the milk, it is not bitter or chalky as other cocoas tend to be.  Top quality and yummy!

review/text: This is great hot chocolate! I looked up European sipping chocolate after trying it at a local chocolate store, and I love it. It's not just the regular hot chocolate you find at grocery stores...it's very rich. I follow the instructions except I substitute whole milk with straight heavy whipping cream, which is what the chocolate store uses. It tastes like a melted candy bar. The one ounce packets are the perfect portion too. Will definitely be getting this again!<br /><br />Update: I tried this with skim milk, which I usually drink, because I wanted something lighter. It was only ok with skim. It tastes a lot better with heavy cream, where the flavors just seem to blend better. It's also good with a dash of Irish cream.

review/summary: I used it for hot chocolate and it was great!
review/text: I used this sipping chocolate for hot chocolate and I enjoyed a wonderful experience. I have grown up on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JJRS6K">Swiss Miss Milk Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix 80 Ounce Value Cannister</a> and Bellagio blows Swiss Miss out of the water. I do recommend adding sugar, because like others have said it is dark chocolate and it can taste bitter to your palette. I mix it with hot water because I find it to be too rich for my taste using milk. My own recipe involves water, sugar, a splash of real vanilla, and sometimes cinnamon and chili powder. I then add a large dollop of milk to bring it to a nice drinking temperature and then it is perfect for immediate consumption. The reason I gave this product a four star rating was due to the fact that I had lots of trouble mixing it with cold ingredients. At first, I tried soy milk and I got left with little bits of mix that would not dissolve. Thinking the soy milk was the problem, I tried whole milk and got the same results. So don't expect <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M050T8">Ovaltine Chocolate Drink Mix, Rich Chocolate, 12-Ounce Container (Pack of 4)</a>! Anyway, this is a great product for the dark hot chocolate lover in your life, so mix it up and enjoy!

review/summary: Beautiful for a gift presentation...excellent cocoa!
review/text: First off, the tin is gorgeous.  You would be hard-pressed to find a more artful tin of cocoa for gift giving.  I wouldn't feel bad to gift one tin of this wrapped in a beautiful paper as a birthday or holiday present - unwrapped it could be given as a hostess gift without worries of looking 'cheap'.  Careful thought was taken on the container this cocoa would be housed in.  A fine gift for a man, too, as it's not 'foo-foo' looking.<br /><br />Upon opening the tin, there is a silver packet of cocoa, sealed tightly.  Expiration date is 2 years from now (as IF it will last that long).  On the first cut of the packet, the aroma of chocolate filled my senses.  Deep, rich, pleasant chocolaty promises of tastes yet to come. I will be keeping the cocoa inside the silver packet as opposed to pouring it into the tin directly.<br /><br />Now, on to the best part ... the taste of the cocoa.  I licked the cocoa off the silver packet top that I cut off and wow, what an impact.  The first taste to hit was definitely chocolate - and not overly sweet chocolate I might add; was a bit bitter at full strength but expectations of my first mug of cocoa were pressing at this point.  I put 8 oz milk, 1 oz half and half, and 1 oz heavy cream into my Back to Basics Cocoa/Latte maker, then added 3 heaping teaspoons of Bellagio Sipping Chocolate, a splash of vanilla, and a spoon of sweetened condensed milk, then turned the machine on.  Within minutes a rich, well blended, decadent cocoa was soon at hand.  Poured it into a 16 oz mug, (nuked it for 20 seconds since the cocoa/latte maker doesn't make it as hot as I like it) and topped with fresh whipped cream. Realizing that it wasn't 'plain' cocoa at this point, the resulting flavor  was still utterly delicious.  The cocoa taste was still the star and rang through even with the add-ins, the flavor of chocolate was pronounced: strong and bold, yet smooth with a slight 'fruitiness' was to be discovered.<br /><br />Now for the final merits: YUM!

review/summary: OMG!  TO DIE FOR!!!  PEANUT BUTTER CHEETOS!!
review/text: This is an addictive treat that is given to babies in Israel.  It is vegan, preservative-free, wheat-free, gluten-free, and food coloring-free.  And not as many calories as I expected.  SO DELICIOUS!!  It's like peanut butter Cheetos!!  Brilliant and yummy idea!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

review/summary: Be warned of the Nutrition label
review/text: Although I instantly took a liking to the Osem Bamba, i realized on receipt of a large order that the product you find in the supermarket and via amazon are not exactly same, particular the nutritional value.<br /><br />For example, the Bamba marketed in Israel and in the local store was fortified with vitamins, the one i received via Amazon, indicated Vit. A. as 0% and C as 0% with none of the others even mentioned on the label. Even the sodium content is a little higher. Its a great snack but i suppose one feels a little cheated for you dont get a great healthy snack...
