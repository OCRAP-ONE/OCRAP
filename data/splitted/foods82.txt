review/summary: Unique different great GF alternative to mac & cheese
review/text: This is a great product for those who need gluten, dairy & casein free foods.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't taste like REAL macaroni and cheese! Geez - do you really think shelled hemp nuts and other things are going to give you a creamy cheesey texture or taste? If you're looking for something to replicate annies GF mac and cheese (which DOES contain dairy) then you will search in vain. You cannot get real cheese flavor from non-cheese products.<br /><br />However, if you're realistic and are aware that non cheese stuff won't actually taste like cheese yet you want something similar to mac & cheese then this is a great option! We really like this mix. It has a unique taste. We tend to alternate this stuff with Road's End Organics GF Cheddar Penne & Chreese� <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FJYCZS">Road's End Organics GF Cheddar Penne & Chreese� 6 oz. (Pack of 24)</a> The Road's end is closer to cheese but again, those who want a real cheese flavor/consistency will be sorely disappointed. However, for those of us who cannot have real cheese this stuff is great.<br /><br />We mix in veggies with ours (you know the ones that are little squares of carrots, peas, corn, etc.) and I use hemp milk when mixing for a bit more substance and flavor. Also if you add a bit of trocomare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL3FA">A. Vogel Trocomare, Organic Spicy Herb Seasoning Salt, 8.8-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 3)</a> it makes a huge difference in flavor (actually trocomare makes a huge difference in the flavor of everything! We love it and use it on just about everything.<br /><br />So - for those who expect a real cheese flavor - don't even bother and stick with real cheese or change your expectations.<br /><br />For those who realize it won't taste like real cheese but who want something different and unique (and gluten, dairy, casein free) - buy this, it's great!!!

review/summary: NOT Macaroni and Cheese
review/text: I thought this would be a good gluten free replacement for Annie's mac n' cheese, but this was not really macaroni and cheese. The sauce was not smooth and was spicy (not hot-spicy, but strong-flavored spicy). My kids were appalled by it and while my husband and I could eat it, we didn't really like it. Since I bought a case, we threw away the rest of the spice packets and made our own cheese blend for the rest of the pasta. I would suggest trying one bag from a local store first if you can, otherwise be aware that you may just be buying expensive pasta with useless spice packets if your family doesn't like this unusual flavor.

review/summary: Thank you, Namaste!
review/text: Suprisingly, I LOVE this pasta dish. When it comes to vegan macaroni and cheez products, some are delicious and others are totally not. Well, at first I wasn't sure about this one but as soon as I looked at the ingredients list and recognized EVERY item and seasoning I instantly became comfortable with the idea of this being edible; turmeric, onion powder, garlic powder, rice milk powder, etc. This may not be macaroni and cheez but Namaste is a great tasting pasta meal so Im glad I chose to try it because I love it and maybe you will, too.

review/summary: Should have a 6 Star Option
review/text: I'm about 6 months in to my transition to becomming vegan.  Every once in a while I think of something that I "miss".  All week I was craving Mac and Cheese but since I stopped eating the meat and dairy, my body has stopped knowing how to process those foods.  Soooo, I couldn't "cheat" and eat Mac and Cheese.  I was in the Gluten Free aisle at Central Market searching for pastas when I stumbled upon this.  I took it home and after about 25 minutes of my husband picking on me, I tried it out.  Ooooh Eeeeem Gheeee was it incredible!<br />I even stuffed some in my husband's mouth...he promptly requested more - to which I replied, Absolutely not :)<br />I had to come on Amazon and buy a whole set so going forward I am never without :)<br />Seriously, the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had!

review/text: If you are looking for a good pasta alternative this one is great! If you are looking for a Mac & Cheese replacement keep looking. We are celiacs who have caesin intollerance so our taste have changed over the years. This is a very healthy yummy alternative for those living a minimally processed lifestyle. It does not have a cheese taste. We ate it mixed with broccoli. My 2 year old and his little buddy had 5 (child sized) helpings! They have not had much grain recently and demolished everything on their plates. I added the little bit leftover to my evening salad for a different texture. Was still very tasty.

review/summary: Great Option for Allergy Sufferers!
review/text: Just tried this for the first time today.  To be honest it's been years since I've had a "real" mac and cheese from the box.  However I thought this was great.  I adjusted the ratio for the sauce, using 1 tablespoon of oil instead of 3, 2 tablespoons of water and adding 1 heaping tablespoon of Tofutti sour cream to powdered sauce mixture.  This worked great for me, and made it seem much creamier than I had expected from other reviews.  I also kept out a little of the starchy pasta liquid before I drained it to help coat the pasta with the sauce.  Added in some cooked chicken, fresh tomato and parsley.  It was delicious,  I'll definitely do this again!

review/text: My 6 year old is on the GFCF diet and is picky. This is definitely not mac & cheese, but the flavor is similar and he gobbled it up. He can have ghee because it's casein free & I think that made a big difference in the flavor. I'm happy to have another thermos meal for his school lunches.

review/summary: Great, as long as you completely forget about cheese!
review/text: The first time I tried this, I thought it was beyond hideous. I was expecting something that tasted vaguely like pasta with cheese sauce. I had only recently developed a total dairy intolerance on top of the gluten problem, so was having very bad experiences with "cheez" & cheese subsitutes. Every one I've tried has been uniformly hideous, so it's not like I had high hopes for this dish. It is not even remotely cheese-like (or even "cheez-like"), and hoping for something that tastes within screaming distance of cheese messes up one's expectations something awful. However, I found if I approach this dish after erasing all thoughts of 'cheesishness' from my mind & tastebuds, it's quite good. Actually describing the taste is a bit of a challenge...it's got tons of flavor, not hot-spicy but turmeric/onion/garlic/paprica/butterish/something... maybe it's the hemp seed that gives it the indescribable yumminess I can't begin to compare with anything I'm familiar with. Whatever the heck it is, I find myself madly craving it quite often.<br /><br />As it comes out of the package, it's not creamy at all , though one can up the creaminess by adding whatever milk substitute you prefer, & I've also added 'fake cream cheese' to it with decent creamy results.<br /><br />Still, I wish they'd get rid of the 'cheeselike' claims & call it something else; it seems to me it'd better prepare folks for liking it, thus increasing the sales, thus BRINGING DOWN THE PRICE, which is my main complaint with this & all the Namaste foods. I really feel like too often those of us with real, severe, dietary restrictions --who have no choice in a specialty diet as opposed to those who are "going gluten free" as a way of jumping on a fad bandwagon-- are being budgetarily scr....er, shafted by specialty food makers.<br /><br />If anyone has been introduced to Cincinnati chili as an adult without adequate prior preparation, the shock experience of this pasta mix is something akin to that. I grew up on Cinci chili & have a lifelong addiction, but if you approach it expecting something like good ole texas chili with meat 'n' tomato 'n' beans, your taste buds are in for one heckuva shock. Those with no preconceived notions frequently love the stuff, but it is very, very different from traditional chili, having been concocted by Greeks.

review/text: I bought this because I am vegan and not because the product is gluten-free. The only other vegan Mac n' cheese substitute I have found/ tried are the Roads End products. My husband is hard to please when it comes to vegan cheese, and he hated the Roads End stuff but loved this. I do too--it's way better than Roads End stuff. It has a delicious flavor that is not at all spicy. Also much easier to mix up than the Roads End.<br /><br />Not that expensive at all. I'll definitely be buying more. Love it!<br /><br />Btw the people adding tuna and chicken are missing the point of eating a vegan meal!

They do a great job with packaging and shipping!  Most of my orders have shipped the same day I ordered.<br /><br />I have tried most of their coffees and have yet to be disappointed.  If you are looking for a good mid priced coffee I would recommend La Minita Tarrazu de Costa Rica.<br /><br />I highly recommend you check out U-Roast-Em for all your coffee needs!

review/summary: Goodbye York, hello Honey Acres!
review/text: I am, well was... a York pep patty addict but after reading the ingredients(sugar, semisweet chocolate (chocolate, sugar, lactose, cocoa, cocoa butter, milk fat, soy lecithin and PGPR, emulsifiers, and vanillin,. artificial flavor), corn syrup, invert sugar, egg whites, and oil of peppermint)I realized I did not want to eat corn syrup, which I avoid and why is it now in there when years ago, it wasn't.  I mean the first ingredient is sugar.  Then there's PGPR, I believe a preservative, that also, was never an ingredient, years ago.  Soy which is an  allergen to many as well as eggs.<br /><br />Ok, enough of that rant.<br /><br />I have been trying to find a substitute and you can see a review of another honey mint I recently tried. I wasn't totally thrilled.<br /><br />So yesterday while at my health food store I bought one Honey Acre mint and gave it a try and wow, so yummy!!!  The filling is creamy and the chocolate a velvet consistency and the mint, well minty!  Had I known, I would have bought more than 1.<br /><br />Sooooo, I just ordered a box of these and they will be my official peppermint patty addiction. :O)

review/summary: Romantic, Natural, Unique Tea Experience
review/text: *****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: "Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair." I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

Cooks well; no more smoke than cooking on any high heat setting, and I had some left over. I think maybe you should use less than you originally use of other oils as this does not evaporate the same. Really cool stuff, and no additional taste of french fries, or other stir-fried items. Coolness!!

Now I've discovered on my own how to do it RIGHT.<br /><br />  If you want perfect popcorn, here's my secret:<br />- Add 2-3 ounces of oil in popper + 3 kernels;<br />- On electric stove (yeah, I know) set burner between 8 and 9 on scale of 1 to 10. (If you set it for 10, you'll have small, lousy, and even unpopped results. Who knew!)<br />- When the 3 kernels pop, add 1/3 cup of kernels (any more than this and they'll spill over)<br />- Meanwhile, melt 1/4 to 1/3 of ONE cube of butter in microwave for 35 seconds.<br />- When popped, (turn the whirley handle to prevent popped corn from overheating / or shake your pot (the one on the stove) if you lack this popper) and pour into your favorite bowl, (don't put butter into your popcorn cooker) drizzling butter and sprinkling a smidgen of salt.<br /><br />  The very best you've ever had . . . true?<br /><br />Another Tip: I deliberately make extra, putting the rest into a FoodSaver airtight canister. It stays genuinely fresh throughout the week.<br /><br />  P.S. I'm just a happy customer. I don't sell popcorn. (But now I eat too much of it.)

review/summary: Good noodles but incredibly high sodium content
review/text: The good news:  Very easy to make, tasty good noodles, a few veggies<br /><br />The bad news: 1130 mg of sodium (about half your daily allowance) -- Yikes!<br /><br />Notes: 290 calories, 0 mg Cholesterol, 2g fiber, 2g sugar, 7g protein, 11g fat (6g saturated fat)<br /><br />These noodles are tasty, the broth is OK, there are a few veggies sprinkled on top.  Pour in boiling water wait 3 minutes (or longer) and you're done.  A good, quick, hot lunch when you're in a hurry.  But don't eat too often as the sodium content is incredibly high and would not be good for you.  OK once in awhile, though, unless you're on a sodium restricted diet, in which case, why are you even reading this far? ;)<br /><br />Tip:  You can probably reduce the sodium content by pouring off the liquid after preparing and eating just the noodles and veggies.  Or add your own healthier liquid broth, even, if you wish.<br /><br />Also, you can let this sit for 6-8 minutes of even longer and it will be good and still very hot.

review/summary: Okay
review/text: I would have liked to give these 2 and a half stars, because they're basically middle-of-the-road. They taste more or less like a Fig Newton, and you won't miss the fat at all. They are not as soft as Fig Newtons.<br /><br />These cookies are great if you're on a diet because two of them are only 100 calories, however they are on the small side so you may end up eating more.<br /><br />I would say that overall, the taste is comparable to a Fig Newton, but slightly more firm in texture and a smaller size. With all things considered, if a box of Fig Newtons and Fig Newmans were sitting on the shelf together, I would probably just go by price and get the cheaper item and not think about the brand.

review/text: I buy this coffee from a Japanese grocery store. (Though I would happily buy it from Amazon if the price were similar.) I prepare it by heating a mug of equal quantities of milk and water in the microwave, then adding a tablespoon of this coffee and some sugar. I imagine, like all instant coffee, it would taste pretty nasty without the milk, but with milk it actually is good. This is the fastest way to obtain a cup of tolerable coffee that I know of, short of buying it already made.

review/summary: NOW foods organic quinoa is great
review/text: I had been looking for an affordable priced quinoa since it is pretty expensive in my store. I noticed Amamzon.com had a sale on quinoa and took a chance on buying it since we had never tried it before. The NOW brand of quinoa is organic which is a HUGE plus. The grains are pretty clean already but I still rinse before using. The qunioa is great, so very healthy and cooks in around 20 minutes (even though the pacakge states 15 minutes). I will be definitly be buying this brand again from Amazon.com as it arrived in excellent condition within 5 days.<br /><br />If you are thinking about trying/buying quinoa, I highly recommend the NOW organic quinoa.

review/summary: Very Happy!
review/text: I love quinoa for its delicious taste, texture, and nutritional benefits. This NOW brand as sold on Amazon is a great bargain. I do a lot of research before I purchase items and feel satisfied that this is a good deal. There is no need to soak this quinoa. The bag tells you to rinse it before using, but I never have and we love the taste. Quinoa can be used in a variety of ways, but one of our favorites is to make Quinoa Pilaf, the same way you would make rice pilaf. (Simply chop onions, carrots, and celery and saute in olive oil. Then add the quinoa and substitute chicken broth for the water and cook as per directions.) Quinoa is a great substitute for rice in general. This brand provides consistent results, always cooking evenly.<br /><br />TIP: When I open a bag and use a bit, I store the rest in a glass mason jar to keep it fresh. That way it's easy to scoop out what you need and stores beautifully in the pantry/cabinet.

review/summary: very clean; organic; cooks evenly
review/text: I consider myself a fanatical quinoa connoisseur, having enjoyed many varieties over several decades. NOW Foods Organic Quinoa is by far the best quinoa I have ever purchased. First, the quinoa seeds themselves are thoroughly pre-rinsed. There is no acrid flavor whatsoever. There is no impurity in this product. It is 100% quinoa. I do not know what NOW has done differently, but this quinoa cooks more evenly than any other quinoa. I mean, the seeds all cook about the same -- not mushy, not too sticky. It's about 90 cents per lb more than the cheapest quinoa, but remember that it is organic, while the other quinoa is not. I highly recommend this quinoa.

review/summary: A hearty delicious soup
review/text: I love Amy's because you can actually pronounce all the ingredients she uses--no chemicals, no preservatives, nothing you need a chemistry degree to decipher--and she makes pretty tasty food.  Normally, I'm not a big fan of canned soups, but the Alphabet Soup is an exception.  It's a rich tomatoey broth with a few vegetables and pasta alphabets.  I like soup without a lot of "clutter," so to speak.  My sole complaint is that the alphabet noodles are a bit mushy, but then what do you expect in a canned soup?  Still, if you're looking for something to warm you on a chilly or rainy day, Amy's Fat Free Alphabet Soup fits the bill.

review/text: As I am writing this review, I am sitting here, at my computer, wolfing down the food because I'm starving.<br /><br />I heated product in a saucepan over high heat for 5 minutes until boiling. Base tastes like regular tomato soup. Better than Campbell's tomato soup, I would say. There are vegetables mixed in: corn, green beans, and carrots. Green beans and carrots basically turn to mush in my mouth, and I can barely taste them. Corn isn't mushy, but doesn't taste sweet. I suspect this has something to do with being canned in a tomato base. Alphabet noodles have a nice texture. Smooth, and not too mushy.<br /><br />I love this soup. Very satisfying for something that is fat-free. Will re-purchase many times. I'm sure this would also make excellent kids' food.

This soup has a very similar taste to certain canned pasta product. It totally brought me back to my childhood. It is extremely delicious, low in fat and calories. It is a quick and healthy alternative to the old stand-bys we are used to. Whether to give your child a better lunch or a trip down memory lane for yourself please give this soup a chance.

review/text: This is my 7 year old son's absolute favorite soup that he takes to school almost every day.  Despite my attempts to broaden his taste buds he continues to insist that he wants this "red" soup every day with crackers.  My husband and I have also tried it and it is quite delicious.  Like all Amy's products you can feel good about giving your child this soup.  The ingredients are all organic and tasty.  I have offered my son Campbell's soups in a pinch when I have run out of the Amy's Alphabet soup but he really doesn't care for them.  If you read the label on Campbell's soup you will realize that they are loaded with junk.<br /><br />Amy's soups cost a bit more than traditional canned soup but I think the extra cost is justified in higher quality ingredients and delicious taste.

review/text: I'm used to overly sweet granola bars, so when I first had these it seemed like they needed some sugar. But by the time I got through the first box, I adjusted to the lower sugar content and found myself thoroughly addicted. They have a lovely chewy texture with plenty of huge chunks of almond for added crunch. These are GOOD! I would love to buy them in bulk and have them shipped automatically, but I wouldn't pay more than the three dollars or so a box (of six) that Wal Mart or Target charges. So a box of 24 should really be about $12. Even at grocery store prices, we would be talking about $16...we'll see how they're priced when they come in!

I really am grateful Kashi makes this bar.  It has 19 g of carb, 7g pro, 4 g fiber, 5 g fat (mostly from nuts and seeds).  It's fairly balanced, has no artificial ingredients or sugar alcohols, and really hits the spot.  I've tried all the Kashi varieties, and this remains my favorite.  My mother agrees.  If you're looking for a sweeter treat, this is not the Kashi for you, however. My brother thinks they taste like cardboard.  In any rate, the Amazon price is still higher than the grocery store price.  I'm hoping it will drop soon.

review/summary: There are still shells/husks in the bag
review/text: I bought these based on another review from the other product, the Nutiva hempseeds 3 pack stating that those hempseeds have crunchy husks in it and these do not.  I also based my purchase on all the great reviews on this product here.  I was expecting just the white hearts of the hempseeds, sort of like when you buy shelled sunflower seeds.  When I opened the package I was severely disappointed.  It was white with black bits all over the place.  I'll upload a picture when I get the chance, it looked like dirt.  I gave it a taste and it felt like small bits of glass crunching in my mouth, it was absolutely repugnant.  Maybe I received a bad batch, who knows?  I am not here to put off other potential buyers, just telling my story on my purchase.  I'm going to try another product because I really want to add Hempseeds to my diet.

review/summary: Way to go Amazon with this Amazing Price
review/text: Nutiva Organic Hemp Seeds are so good for you.  They are 33% protein, 9% Omega 3, and GLA.  I think the MSRP on these bags is $14 each so Amazon has these priced at almost half-price!  This is a great affordable way to get some healthy proteins and fats.<br /><br />Amazon sent me very fresh product.  I subscribed-n-saved on July 22nd and it arrived via OnTrac on July 24th.  The Nutiva Hempseed package says it was packed on may 19, 2012 and is best before may 18, 2013.  Pretty fresh product and tastes fresh, too.<br /><br />Sprinkle on top of your  cereal, omelets, yogurt, soups, salads, and veggies.<br /><br />Hemp seeds require no advance soaking to derive optimal nutritional benefit.<br /><br />Here is a great way to enjoy Hemp:<br />1cup hemp seeds<br />1 cup spring water<br />1Tbsp maple syrup, honey, stevia, or your favorite sweetneer<br />dash himalyan salt<br />optional flavoriing = cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, cardamom<br /><br />Combine all in a blender and blend well until a creamy white milk forms.  Pour through a strainer to remove any husk residue.  Will keep in refrigerator for 4-5 days but I recommend preparing small batches right when you want to drink them as fresh is the most tasty and most nutritious.  You could also make a great milk out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084QP4T4">Cinnamon Red Maca Almond Butter</a>

review/text: I read a lot of the [mixed] reviews here, and I ordered the product.  I actually tried a small bag at the local Co-op.  I absolutely love them.  They are very tasty and have a not-too sweet nutty flavor.  Yes, there are some color variations in the bag, but it doesn't change the texture or flavor.  I eat them in salads, smoothies, with oatmeal, made chocolate candy with them, and eat them straight out of the bag!  I have not found a negative thing about them.  You should try them, you might like them as much as I do!  And, they are organic which is important to me.

review/text: I love this product and order it frequently.  Usually it arrives in a timely manner and in good condition.  When I opened this last shipment I found some hemp seed scattered throughout the box.  I carefully removed the first of two pouches and found a 1" rip in the middle of the front of the bag.  Most of the product was still in the pouch and appeared fresh and undamaged so I transferred it to a container.  The other pouch was intact.  I hope this is a one-time occurrence, and I will be ordering this again when I need more.  More care needs to be taken to assure that the pouches are handled properly and that they are all in good condition when packed.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: It's sad that most food based Hemp products come from outside the USA. But this is not a political review, but rather a quality review of a very enjoyable product. Since I eat a very strict Paleo eating regimen seeds and nuts are a large part of my daily routine. When I bake chicken, or make a big salad I always sprinkle on Hemp Seeds. The taste is not overpowering and it seems that Nutiva's quality is by far the best and most consistent. Another great selling point is that it is available through Prime. I'm not going to get on a soap box about the health benefits of Hemp, go look it up and do your own research. I enjoy this food and have for many years.

review/text: I can't sleep past 6 AM anymore because of this food.  One of my cats sits on my face, attempting to suffocate me into consciousness (cats aren't very good at biology..), while the other kneads every bare spot of flesh he can find with his claws of "love" until I get up.  If I stop in the bathroom between stumbling out of bed and into the kitchen, I'm treated to a rousing refrain of "MROW MROW SCRATCH YOWL" outside of the door--and that's if they don't follow me into the bathroom and circle around my legs like they're caught in my gravitational pull, all the while insisting can opening is a far better use of my thumbs than anything else.<br /><br />The only cons, really.  And they're cute cons, so I let it slide.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, my cats love this stuff.  They eat it, rocket around the house for 45 minutes like they've just done some meth (oh, the power of organic ingredients!), then collapse in the sunspot on my vacated bed and sleep until I get home from work.<br /><br />Cat win?

review/summary: Cat didn't like flavor
review/text: Oddly, I have given the cats Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size and they seemed to like it. I bought 2 cases of this 3oz and they only touch it after realizing that I will not give them more food.<br /><br />It may be because I gave them Turkey & Seafood for a while in between. It's odd because they scarf up that flavor, and they would scarf up the Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size. WEIRD.<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars for the ingredients and quality. I always feed them Castor & Pollux. However, as always, test not only the flavor but also the size of the can. When I scoop the food out of the can the consistency in the 3oz cans seems somewhat thicker than the 5.5oz (in all flavors I have tried). This may be a contributing factor to their distaste for this particular combination.<br /><br />Great product, just verify kitty flavor approval.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good if Still Keebler Level
review/text: I generally consider Keebler products to be definitely designed for children, and not appealing to adult sensibilities.  I bought these on chance because I love mint flavored products and they were on sale.  I fully expected to find them gagging and that I would have to give them away.<br /><br />Surprisingly they aren't bad.  I wouldn't buy them again, since there are so many similar products which are better.  But they have good points.  Each bar is large, not as big as a candy bar, but close.  Each bar is individually wrapped, which I thought was overkill for a box of cookies, but that makes it easy to throw one into a lunch box or purse.  Note that you only get six cookies in the whole box.  The cookies are surprisingly light and crispy.  Definitely sweet, but not overly so, unlike many other Keebler products.  The mint flavor is fresh and not wimpy, and the chocolate flavor is mild but still pleasant.  The flavors overall are well balanced with emphasis on the mint, as it should be.<br /><br />I'm not sure if these are designed for children or adults.  They seem much too large to be meant for children, and I'm not sure if kids would enjoy this combination of flavors in this configuration.

These are a good source for this. It is only natural fat and no added salt. I wish I could get them even at a bigger savings with the 15% savings by "Subscribe and Save".<br /><br />My husband carries these in his pocket as a mid-day snack and I have my daily dose that my MD orders.

review/summary: Excellent source of Protein--especially when you're Away from Home.
review/text: I first bought the small, 100-calorie pack box in my local store.  They are a wonderful source of protein without the carbs, salt, and extra sugar that come with other snacks or with roasted nuts (e.g., especially honey-roasted nuts).<br /><br />These whole, raw almonds are great for anyone with a blood sugar issue.  The raw almonds won't make your blood sugar spike; are handy if your blood sugar has dropped and you need a quick source of food; and, the 1.5-ounce bags are sturdy and won't rip--or haven't yet in my overly packed and oft-mangled bag.<br /><br />As the previous reviewer mentioned, once you start eating these, you won't miss the added fat and salt of any distributor's "roasted" nuts.  Since eating these natural almonds, I haven't missed the traditional "roasted" nut taste.  I grew up on the usual nuts, but now I find I really look forward to this new, clean taste.  For all these reasons, I recommend Blue Diamond's raw almonds.<br /><br />(However, if you still think that these almonds aren't crunchy enough for you--especially if you bought the canned nuts--you could always roast them yourself.  Put the raw almonds on a cookie sheet [you may want to line your sheet with foil or parchment paper] in a pre-heated oven at 350 degree F.  Stir them a few times to ensure they don't scorch (I would check around 6 minutes--especially if your oven is a bit temperamental [like mine]; and stir and check again before 10 minutes [because it's amazing how fast nuts can go from 'almost done' to 'scorched'--or worse--'burnt'].  Roasting them yourself still has to be much healthier than any nuts that are cooked in oil.  Remember also, if you do roast the raw almonds in the oven, please cool them completely and then refrigerate them afterward.)

review/text: When I was told by my nutritionist that eating a handful of whole, natural almonds a day would help me to lose weight and get the right kind of fats and proteins implemented into my diet, I was a bit skeptical.  I was not a huge almond fan to begin with.  I don't particularly enjoy salted or roasted almonds.  Usually only the kind that come surrounded with coconut and chocolate or the kind that you get out of the nut bowl to shell around the holidays.  The Whole Natural almonds by Blue Diamond taste like they came right out of the shell and boy are they yummy.<br /><br />I like that they are a satisfying snack and I like the taste of them.  These are the ones I buy ... no added salt or anything.  Nice and fresh right out of the shell.<br /><br />5 stars.

review/text: Whom ever came up with the idea to dip pretzels in yogurt, was either high, a genious, or the devil himself..probably all.<br /><br />Point is, these things are so freaking good! The right amount of salt and sweet on each pretzel, it's hard to stop eating them, so a word of caution, for every 8 pretzels you eat, you get 11gm of sugar, and so people trying to lose weight or in any sort of special diet, should pay extra attention when or before eating these.<br /><br />There's absolutely nothing negative to say about this product. The bags (6 of them) came well packaged and the pretzels taste fresh. I can't really give this product a low score due to its sugar content, etc., because I knew what I was buying and expected it to be this way. Hope this helps.

review/text: My basenji, Lily, loves Rawhide Munchy Sticks Beef 5" 100 Pack and Chicken, 5" 100 Pack best, but these are a great deal and she will chew happily on these as well.  I guess she is not too picky.

review/summary: Black ants don't even get close to it
review/text: I bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house. It did not help at all. I even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go, well they just don't go anywhere close to it, it really looks like it repels the ants, instead of attracting them. I have not found yet a product that work for my ants, except the spray that kills them instantly (but I cannot spray it in the kitchen, and I have ants all around the counter top, even if it is cleaned to perfection).

review/summary: Finally the Ants Are Gone!
review/text: For years, I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJBKMQ">SENORET CHEMICAL 300 "TERRO" LIQUID ANT BAITS BX6</a>. It worked extremely well. Within 12 hours, all ants were gone. However, my latest infestation was not responding to Terro, in fact, they were eating the liquid up, but it wasn't killing the ants. My neighborhood Hardware Supply store told me that insects could become tolerant to certain pesticides. I found the "Safer" product, but was skeptical. Take off the spout cover and blast a fine white powder into the cracks or places where the ants are coming through. For me, it was under two long baseboards in the kitchen. Then I swept up the excess white powder into the cracks some more and cleaned the tile of any powder. It worked instantly. Any ants that even touched the powder immediately started to wiggle and die. I have a cat, so I cleaned any excess up carefully, so she cannot get any on her paws, as it is very toxic. It's as good as Boric Acid.<br /><br />This powder claims to kills Ants, Cockroaches, Earwigs, Silverfish, Crickets, Millipedes and Centipedes. I did notice that immediately after applying this product, Silverfish started to appear, evidently sensing the chemicals. Soon, they will be gone. Do check it out. I am SO glad to be rid of those ants (they even got into my freezer where I had chocolate!).

review/summary: Knorr Soups and Mixes Are The Best - And So Is Amazon's Price
review/text: I love this gravy mix - much easier and less fat than making from scratch and not as salty as McCormick's or other brands.<br /><br />I use non-fat milk instead of water to make a cream gravy.  This is good stuff.  And by time you order this set of 24 and other items, there is no shipping and no tax.  The price is much less than I could get when on sale at my local supermarket.

review/summary: A Little Disappointed
review/text: The Grape Jam, itself, is of the highest quality, and it tastes great, so I have absolutely no complaints there. However, the glass jars were poorly packaged (it was very heavy and fragile, and was insulated with just two small pillow puffs), and two of the twelve jars arrived with the seals already broken. Since I could not be sure if the food was safe to eat, I had to throw away the two jars. I would not order this product again(or anything else that comes in jars) for that reason.

review/summary: Awful.  How can they sell this in good conscience?
review/text: This tin must have been sitting on the shelf for a decade; it was totally dried out when I opened it.  When treacle sponge pudding dries, it smells nasty and can't be reconstituted, even with water and some heat.<br /><br />Total waste of money.

review/text: These are, hands-down, my favorite potato chips.  They are very light and flaky with a hint of vinegar that make them simply irresistible.

review/text: Several people recommended this tea to me when I was on a high protein diet and things got stopped up.  I do not love the taste (sort of licorice) but after adding a sweetener I liked it better.  It is effective.  Sip it in the evening.

review/summary: Fantastic Rub - nothing better in the market
review/text: Ok Folks - listen up. For special occasions, we'll spend the big bucks and get a rack of lamb.  You're lucky today if you can even find it in the stores - it's so expensive - often at $20-40 per pound.  So, the very last thing you want to do, after spending all that money, is ruin it with the wrong flavoring. Colorado Spices, New Zealand Lamb Rub has the right blend of herbs that goes well on just about any meat.  We just used it on some fresh bluefin and yellowfin tuna and it was FANTASTIC. My 88 year old Mother, who cooks every day and is not a huge spice fan (she's used to plain, New England cooking) loves and uses the rub on chicken, lamb, and fish.  She's having me order another case and loves the individual packets - as the rub does not lose its taste or flavor and stays fresh.  This is a great product!

review/summary: Average
review/text: Is this hot chocolate....yes<br />Is this good hot chocolate....um, sorta<br />Is this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K-cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove-top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.<br /><br />Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.<br /><br />3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping.
