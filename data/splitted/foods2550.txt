review/summary: Protein ok, crude fat too high
review/text: My vet ordered new cat food with high protein and low crude fat, specially for senior cats and cats with blood in their stool. I ordered this item and was surprised about the high fat content which is not specified on Amazon sites.<br />But my cats like it and never leave rests on their plates...<br />My next order will be the classic pate whitefish and tuna for my kids. This product contains 11% protein but only 4% of crude fat, which comes close to the PurinaOne canned foods which are more expensive

review/summary: Pleasant soft lavender scent
review/text: I Have burned about 60 sticks so far.<br /><br />Hem Lavender can be described as smooth, deep, and peaceful.  It has a lavender scent but does not have the sharp edge that lavender usually carries.  I do like the edge, therefore I give this item 4 not 5 stars.  If you had not seen the package, you might not guess it was lavender, but it is a very nice scent without being overly floral.<br /><br />This can be described as an "all audiences" type of lavender.  The males and females of my home enjoy this scent.<br />This scent is good enough to be part of my standard stock.  I enjoy it in the morning since it is peaceful without being sleepy.<br /><br />If you are looking to add calm to your chaotic home, try this lavender.

review/summary: Worst smelling incense ever...
review/text: I love the smell of lavender, it has a herbal and floral scent while still remaining masculine. I've used "Yardley's of London Lavender Soap" daily for years, I even use lavender fabric softener and washing detergent. And this incense smells good in the box... but when it's burnt it reminds me of the smell of a nursing home. You ever visited that old lady's apartment who sits by the window and smokes cigarettes? I have a great-aunt like that and her place has a very distinct smell... and that's exactly what "HEM Precious Lavender" smells like. It's just plain gross. Although I can see others may enjoy this scent, it's definitely a "love or hate" type thing. There's no middle ground here. One star because it has no redeeming value.

review/summary: Phenomenal flavoring
review/text: When I try to describe the taste and sensation to friends, the best I can come up with is that it tastes like lime and molasses. Wonderful flavoring agent for broths, and I also use it quite a bit with sweet potatoes, tomato dishes and anything with chicken. I use it in much higher concentrations than what they suggest. There are some instant soup mixes using tamarind, and if you are new to the condiment, you may want to try them to experiment with how best to use it. I also looked to Madhur Jaffrey's excellent "World of the East Vegetarian Cooking" for inspiration.

review/summary: Ethnic foods for all!
review/text: This paste was an item I needed to make chili sauce. I cannot comment on the quality of the paste, I have not tasted it any where else.  It was perfect for my recipe and provided a unique tartness I expected from the tamarind.  It is thick, quite thick, as I would think a paste should be.  I will always keep it on hand, now that I found it.  I can think of several uses for it.  Thanks for the product and for the large list of specialty ingredients available on Amazon.com.  Tamarind is not to be found in my small town in any medium.  Rather than travel to the nearest city and find an ethnic grocer, I chose to buy it here.  Shipping costs are always a concern, so I looked for the item with Super Saver Shipping and grouped this item with others.  Free shipping makes ordering grocery items on-line a pleasant experience.

review/summary: Swiss Knight is GREAT !!!
review/text: I have been eating Swiss Cheese Fondue since the mid-seventies when it was "in vogue".  Swiss Knight Fondue is one of the two premier fondues that has survived the "test of time" and is of the highest quality.<br /><br />I am in my sixties now but still enjoy this premiere fondue as long as I exercise to get the calories off and the LDLs out of my system!!!  That aside, I truly look forward to having this savory dish at least once every several weeks.<br /><br />Back in the seventies, a lot of New York restaurants (especially those that were Swiss, of course) offered fondue. The prices rose from the tens to the twenties for a delicious pot of fondue and bread as the time expanded from the seventies into the eighties and eventually the nineties.<br /><br />The price that Amazon offers is on the low-end and allows one to savor the exquisite taste of a marvelous meal for a fraction of what it would cost at any restaurant on the East or West Coast, or, for that matter, in-between.<br /><br />I live in the Central States now but I can attest to the fact that a pot of Swiss Cheese Fondue in lower Wisconsin at a popular Swiss restaurant costs $22+ ... twice the purchase price of Swiss Knight fondue from Amazon !!!

review/summary: Excellent fondue, but not inexpensive
review/text: Swiss Knight Fondue is something I remember fondly from when I was a kid--fondue was popular in the 70s and 80s, and we had this from time to time.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found it's still available--it even still has the same packaging it used to!  But best of all, Swiss Knight turns out to be one of those few things you remember from your childhood that turn out to be just as good as they seemed at the time.  It's not cheap, especially when ordered online with shipping charges--but you'd be hard-pressed to find a substitute of equal quality.<br /><br />The fondue pack is also easy to use.  Cut up some bread, maybe steam some vegetables for better variety--and nutrition--in dipping (I find broccoli works very well for this, as it absorbs the cheese and goes well with the flavor).  Then empty the packet into your chafing dish if you have one (use a small saucepan if you don't have one), and melt the cheese at low heat directly on the stovetop.  That may sound wrong, but I've found if I use the fondue set's built-in burner to melt the cheese, some of it burns to the bottom, whereas the stovetop gives better control and allows a lower heat.  Then transfer to your fondue set (or a hot plate), and dip away.

review/summary: Don't  Get Too Excited About Ice Cream of the Month Club
review/text: I received 3 months of Ice Cream from this Club as a gift. I was very disappointed with the Ice Cream I received and the giver was unhappy after seeing the choices I was sent each month. The first 2 months included a duplication of black walnut, a very bland vanilla frozen yogurt, some type of caramel,that didn't taste at all like caramel(I tried,but couldn't give it away), also 2 peppermint in one month. I emailed them after the 2nd month with my complaint,thinking they might want to take a second look at what was being sent. I did receive an immediate response, with an apology and an offer of an extra month of ice cream. They also told me they spoke with their shipper and was told my 3rd month was really going to be scrumptous. I just received it. May be somewhat better, but there is only one pint with higher butterfat then the average grocery store brand, 2 frozen custards, and 1 "neopolitan"(how exciting)in a square cardboard carton and from a company not even mentioned in their ad. We have a number of Ice Cream stores in our city and thus far I have only received 1 pint each month that might compare. I felt I should write this review because the person who sent this gift had no reviews to read and had no idea that I might receive duplicates, along with the vanilla custard and neopolitan.

I bought this "variety pack" because I'd never tried the orange or melon flavors.  I didn't think they had as good a flavor and the flavor wasn't as intense as the strawberry or grape. Anyways, I think y'all should try this at least once in your life!

review/summary: No better salsa in the world
review/text: I love salsa and chips.  I don't like sweat salse.  Love the flavor of Habanero.  My test for a good salsa is if you can dip the chip in the salsa and take it out without scooping, just that salsa that's left on the chip, and if that has enough flavor to hold its own, that's a great salsa.  Most salsa's seem like they start with ketchup, yuck.<br /><br />Mrs. Renfro's Habanero Salsa is the most perfect salsa on the market.  Salty and tangy, tangy is the word.  Full of flavor.<br /><br />As to the heat, Habanero can be very hot.  My tolerance is very high.  This is not a very hot Habanero salsa.  It's probably closer to a medium for those of us that like a good burn.  My kids can eat this and that's proof enough.  Even so, it has the Habanero flavor and is just exceptional.<br /><br />Thank you Mrs. Renfro!

And it is shelf stable, so even if our store doesn't stock it, ordering it online is quite manageable in bulk.  Taste?  Well it isn't a bagette in in the sun on the Cote d'Azur, but few things are.  Well toasted, with butter, jelly, or in a sandwich - great.  (Especially when compared to air - also gluten and yeast free.)

review/summary: Spinach Linguine- DELICIOUS
review/text: This is the best spinach linguine that I have ever eaten.  I ordered 12 packages and will send some to my Grandson that is a sophmore at WVU along with my recipe.  I also gave my neighbor a package and will share some more with my daughter.  This is how I like it and you are welcome to try my recipe.<br /><br />2 zuccnini<br />2 carrots<br />1 package of spinach linguine<br />salt to taste<br />chives<br />Kraft Parmesan & Romano cheese<br />Mushrooms- optional<br />Canned breast of chicken- optional<br />Onion - chopped - optional<br /><br />With a slicer-(I use a hand two inch slicer) slice the zucchini and carrots in long thin strips-down the length of each.  Bring the water to a broil, add a touch of oil, salt to taste.  Drop the thin slices of zucchini, the carrots, and the spinach linguine and broil FOR THREE MINUTES ONLY.  Drain, place on a serving dish, sprinkle with the chives and cheese-mix.  ENJOY!  If you use the mushrooms and chicken, I like to braise a chopped onion, add the mushrooms and chicken just until hot and then add to the linguine.  This truly makes a striking meal.<br /><br />If you like pasta- then try this one.  You will not be sorry!

review/summary: Excellent Pasta!
review/text: This is truly a light pasta that tastes like something you would eat at a very good restaurant! And "the price is right"! In fact, it is an excellent buy. I agree with the other reviewer, even though this has real spinach in it,it doesn't taste strongly like spinach. While it was cooking, the aroma seemed to indicate the opposite. Nutritionally, you have a top notch pasta,with restaurant quality that is very easy to cook.<br />The only thing I would ask for is the packaging to be changed. I haven't found a way yet, to cook only a part of the bag at once. As good as it is, I am only one person. Amazingly, it reheated very well.

review/summary: Excellent Maldon quality enhanced with delicate smoke flavor
review/text: Having used Maldon salt flakes for many years; I was intrigued with the idea of smoke flavoring added in. I was hopeful the flavor would not be overwhelming as so many smoked seasonings and salts are. Maldon did not disappoint me; the smoke flavor is very light; perfect for some dishes which need just that extra "something".<br /><br />I find it enhances grilled Salmon and Tilapia (I use a gas grill and don't always want to use a smoke box or wood plank). It also does well with bone-in chicken breasts (takes longer to cook so more flavor absorbed) poached on top of the stove or baked in the oven. Excellent tossed in with vegetables being served with grilled foods, etc. The uses are limited only to the imagination.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to add a lot of smoke flavor, this is not the product for you. You might look into Liquid Smoke or Spice Islands Old Hickory Smoked Salt.

review/summary: Smoked salt:  doesn't deliver
review/text: I'm a big fan of smokey foods, so I was eager to try smoked salt, hoping it would add complexity and intrigue to food that isn't, itself, smoked.  When I opened the pack and a lovely, subtle wave of smokey scent rose up, I was optimistic.  Sadly, the salt itself does not actually taste that smokey.  I have tried it along with olive oil as an accent on ciabatta, and on vegetables, and in soup. If the smoke taste was even there, it was essentially overwhelmed by anything else in the same mouthful.  Even bread.  Desperate for smokiness, I even tried a few grains directly on my tongue.  Too subtle for me -- that smokey punch just wasn't there.<br /><br />Still, the salt itself is Maldon, which is lovely. And it smells terrific.  If your tastebuds are more discerning than mine (and they very well may be), you might find the degree of smokiness to your taste.  Me, I'm still looking for my Perfect Smoked Salt.

review/text: I can't believe the couple of negative reviews!  Of course I would go for a juicy brownie or a cheesecake instead if I didn't care about the calories, sugar etc.  But for a healthy snack, this is very good.  I ate it in the car and had no problems with crumbles; just open your mouth and stop eating like a fish.  Take a couple of good bites and be done with it.  Besides, eating with a glass of milk would be even better.

review/summary: Yes it's chocolatey, but the texture is awful, nearly inedible!
review/text: I like a lot of the kashi line,but these new soft baked chocolate squares are less than appealing. The chocolatey flavor is there, but no matter how badly you may want a chocolate treat, I doubt anyone would really find this satisfying because it's impossible to move past the grainy/gritty texture. This tastes nothing like a traditional brownie, and is unbelievably dry. It falls apart so much that you can barely eat it, and when you do it's like sandpaper in your mouth. Sadly, I would stay clear of this item unless you actually like very, very grainy/dry food.

review/text: Yes, these are healthy, they're Kashi for heaven's sake. So obviously they are not going to taste like a gourmet brownie. However, these little squares do fill a need for me. Often halfway through the morning I get a little craving for chocolate. Instead of wasting my allowance of snack fat grams/calories for the day on a mid-morning indulgence, I have been trying these. They are pretty tasty and not overly sweet. They seem to satisfy my chocolate need until I can chow down on some real dessert after dinner time. My kids think they are great and love having one for a little dessert with their lunch. Yes, they are a little dry feeling in the mouth but have it with a glass of water or milk or some hot tea. These little squares serve a purpose for me and my kids and that's good enough for us.

If you are like me and prefer brownies a little mushy and moist, you will NOT like these.  Sure, they have natural ingredients but they are not much healthier than other BETTER brownies on the market. If you are gonna eat a brownie, eat a brownie for God's sake! They just aren't meant to be anywhere close to health food.

review/summary: DISGUSTING!!
review/text: I picked these up in the store a few weeks ago thinking that maybe they would be a decent healthy snack for the whole family.  We normally eat healthy anyways; we rarely indulge in sweets or junk foods so I wasn't expecting to compare this to a box of Ghiradelli brownies or even the cheap dollar mixes for that matter.  I had bought them during my lunch hour and decided to try one while still at work.  I cannot describe how horrible this product is.  First, like others have mentioned, they are very dry and crumbly so be prepared to make a mess. Secondly, the flavor is very odd... not even a hint of chocolate, but more like cardboard mixed with something I cannot put my finger on. As you're chewing the brownie (or whatever it's supposed to be) it dissolves and leaves a weird film across the roof of your mouth, and I had to drink lots of water since I couldn't remove it with just my tongue. And be prepared to chase away the awful after taste with a big piece of gum.  I would never buy this product again, there are too many other healthy things out there that taste way better than this.  Even my co-workers, all 12 of them, tried this and agreed that these aren't worth wasting money on.  Sorry Kashi, but your mission has failed.  I don't want to eat this.

review/summary: Ordering more
review/text: Purchased these in March and they went pretty fast, eating and giving some away.  These were great, water sprouted and were delicious when dehydrated both peeled and with the skins left on (prefer peeled).  Compared to almonds ordered from another California farm (Fancy Grade #1, size 22-27 nonpareil) there really is no noticeable difference other than they are slightly smaller in size.  On a side note, the almonds I purchased elsewhere were very hard to peel once sprouted.  Being hard to peel might be an indication of freshness or lack of, I don't know and if anyone does, please tell?<br /><br />Bottom line, aside from the slightly smaller size compared to a more pricey raw almond, these almonds are a great deal even with shipping, have a great taste, water sprout, consistent in quality, and are an overall great almond!<br /><br />I'm ordering more, don't hesitate to purchase.

review/summary: Almonds
review/text: Well... they're almonds; nothing special there. I don't really know how 'bad almonds' or 'good almonds' taste, but these taste like the generic almonds I've had all my life. They are split up into smaller bags, which makes it really convenient- I can keep a small bag at the office, one next to the bed, etc. Paying extra for shipping makes me sad, but as far as I could see, they were still the cheapest ones on amazon. I've just been eating them raw, so I guess I'll try cooking with them and see how that ends up.

review/summary: Raw Almonds from California
review/text: I am just learning about raw foods and in a workshop I went to, we were told that ALL almonds from California do have to be pasturized by law, but that it is only in California.  We were told that you can buy truly raw almonds from out of state, which of course means buying online.  They also do not have to lable the package that the almonds, or any other nut from California, are pasturized.  We were also told that you cannot buy directly from the grower because they cannot sell nuts without going thru their process.

review/summary: Senses are overwhelmed
review/text: For a few years, I have been buying the Numi Golden Chai in individual bags and just recently went looking on here for bulk teas. I was pleased to find my favorite tea, and Chai tea, in bulk. The price seems a lot for tea, but compared to what I paid for the bags, it's a bargain. Plus I'm not throwing away anything (until I kill the bag) each time I make a cup. The bag is the standard foil interior bag, and seems to keep well, and has a ziplock top.<br /><br />As for the tea, it smells so good, and I love the blend. Some chai that uses green tea adds pepper, and is a bit "spicy," so on most occasions I prefer a black leaf chai. It has a stronger taste, but isn't overwhelming since it only adds cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and anise. I can go through 3 cups/day and will vary how much I use depending on how strong I want it (1.5-2tsp), but I could still see one pound lasting me close to two months.<br /><br />Like all Numi teas, it's Fair Trade, which is a big plus for me. Organic ingredients is good too.<br /><br />If you like Chai, you should be pleased with Numi's Golden Chai, whether or not you prefer green tea or black tea. Buy a box of bags first before you invest in the 2 pound package though.

review/summary: Preparation Instructions
review/text: This is one of my favorite chai teas!  Since I hadn't seen preparation instructions either here or on Numi's website, I thought I would leave mine as a guide for first time chai preparers.<br /><br />Makes 1 cup in less than 10 minutes:<br /><br />1. Add 1 tsp of this tea to 4/5 of a cup of water.  Slowly bring to a boil (medium-high heat, should take a few minutes).<br />2. Add 2 Tbsp of sugar which should lower the temperature a bit, allow tea to come back to a boil for another minute or so.<br />3. Add 2/5 cup of milk (I use 2%, but whole is the best), allow tea to return to a boil (should take several more minutes).  NOTE: Keep an eye on this part, if the temperature is too high, the tea will easily rise up out of the container and make a giant mess when it returns to boiling :-).<br />4. Turn off the heat just as the tea starts to rise, and allow the contents to simmer for another minute or so.<br />5. Using the finest strainer you can find (there are some excellent stainless steel ones here on amazon), strain the loose tea from the drink and serve.<br /><br />There are all kinds of tricks to getting chai tea to taste the way you want ranging from adding fresh grated ginger during preparation to a little honey just prior to serving.  It's awfully hard to go wrong when you start with this tea but if it doesn't turn out exactly like you want, just tweak the ratios until it suits your tastes.

review/summary: A lot of cinnamon
review/text: Unlike other chai teas, you can see the spices are plentyfull.  When you look at the loose tea it seems to be at least 25% spice.  The tea tastes good assuming you like a lot of cinnamon since that's the predominate flavor.  Personally, I like it but I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016ATBS">Tazo Tea Chai Organic 20 Bags</a> better but I can't find it loose.  Numi's chai is very good and reasonably priced considering the high quality.  You can probably make a couple of hundred cups of tea instead of paying $4/cup at Starbucks.  The next tea I'm going to try is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIL61Q">Harney & Sons Fine Teas Chai, Indian Spice - 20 Tea bags</a>.

review/summary: Your coffee will be heavenly with this extract in it!
review/text: Fact #1: I looove toasted marshmallows.  I keep a bag of marshmallows in my kitchen, pop one on a metal skewer and toast it to golden perfection over my stove's gas flame.  I eat it, then repeat the process.<br /><br />Fact #2: Toasted marshmallows are heaven in a cup of coffee.  With cream.  And sugar.  Ain't really proper coffee at that point, but if you're reading this review on marshmallow extract, I'll bet you probably like your coffee the same way. :-)<br /><br />Fact #3: As of this writing, all the toasted marshmallow syrups available on Amazon were too expensive to bother with.  Monin, Torani, DaVinci, I checked them all and nothing was under $9.  Plus I wanted the option of flavoring my coffee without adding sugar.<br /><br />Then I found this marshmallow extract for $3 with free shipping, so I took the plunge.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It tastes and smells like marshmallow.  It's exactly what I wanted.<br />- Great if you want to add marshmallow flavor without a syrup<br />- It's efficient: in 6 oz of coffee, I'd suggest about 3-4 drops.  This bottle will last long enough.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I was hoping for more of a "toasted" marshmallow, but for the price, I'll live.<br />- Don't add too much or you'll feel the extract dry out your mouth.  I used about 5-6 drops and it was too much.  I got greedy. *hanging my head sadly*

I think it is a little expensive, but maybe it will go a long way. I tried for the first time this morning, and it took just a little maybe a teaspoon. It was really tasty. Also I have been told that honey is a lot better for us than white sugar. So, so far I am happy.

review/summary: Buyer beware, Proctor & Gamble has ruined this food!
review/text: My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years.  We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy.  So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods.  The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!<br /><br />We had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NCJX1Q">Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food</a> for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients.  Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.<br /><br />Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months.  We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others.  Proctor & Gamble reputedly still funds experimentation on domestic dogs and cats, so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way.  So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.<br /><br />Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed.  The food is much more "crumbly", i.e. there is a lot more "food dust" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different.  We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it.  In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind.  Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY.  Well, it ISN'T anymore!  We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.<br /><br />So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again.  In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural.  We did find a good quality alternative cat food called "Simply Nourish", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it.  There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.<br /><br />WARNING:  For anyone currently purchasing "Innova Cat & Kitten", or planning to buy it in the future, P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse.  We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market.  AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!

review/summary: Cats Loved Innova - I Didn't
review/text: Before I embarked on (frozen) raw food and grain free wet/dry, my cats enjoyed a bag of Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food. P & G had just acquired Natrua Pet about the time of purchase and I was very impressed with how much my cats seemed to like this stuff until I noticed the kibble was turning to dust - literally disintegrating - in the food bowl within just a few hours of being poured in. I've never seen anything like it before. I switched out the glass dish for a Durapet stainless bowl and I still had the same problem. The kibble was whole coming out of the bag, but exposed to air in just a few hours it turned to dust. I never considered the food to be bad, only extremely dry. I'd recommend this food for good nutitional content, but I'd also keep an eye out that P & G didn't change the formula resulting in a ready-to-crumble kibble. You can't do much with kibble dust other than sprinkle it on wet or raw food.

review/summary: Watch out for my Ninja Kitties!!!
review/text: A couple of years ago I found some little gray babies while cleaning out the boat for the season.  They weren't even two weeks old. At the time I was just breaking in a new puppy and feeding him Innova dog food.  I have followed suit with the kitties with awesome results.  For one, everyone asks if my boys are Prussian Blues.  Now I'm not much of a snob when it comes to animals (mostly saved strays when we were children) but apparently my little rescues resemble some elitist thorough-breds!  They're coats are nothing short of spectacular.  Smooth, sleek, shiny.  I attribute all of this and the rest of their excellent health to the food they eat.  They're also extremely athletic.  Most cats are, I know, but I have grown up with cats for my entire life and I can say of the multitude of cats I been around and helped take care of these guys are ninjas!  I also give a large amount of that credit to the food that they eat.  Most folks probably are reluctant to try feeding their animals the "healthy" food because their little friends might not like the taste.  Not to worry, because it seems my ninja boys can't get enough of this food.  I have to measure out what I feed them so they don't gorge themselves to the bursting point.  They would eat this all day if they were allowed.  Wouldn't imagine this to be the case if it didn't taste well.  Needless to say I am keeping the boys on this regiment.  They have responded beyond my expectations on this diet!

The only thing that I can say is that the price here on amazon for a 15lb is ridiculous. It's over $44 and the pet place I buy it from(in Culver City, California)is about $30.99 plus tax, around $34. I end up saving around $10 per bag by buying it there and not here. Great product equal to and cheaper than Lotus which is what I was feeding them before and could only buy at Centinela Pet &  feed.

review/text: I am the loving owner of seven indoor cats and take care of one feral.  My cats love this food!!  I started second guessing myself when I heard about grain-free being better and decided to incorporate Halo brand to gradually switch them.  They HATED the HALO!! It was so obvious that towards the last of the Innova I couldn't believe how they almost stopped eating the dry completely and were sustaining themselves on their morning wet food.  After requesting my PETCO store to stock Innova Prime, which is grain-free, I was able to give my five younger cats the grain-free which they ate gratefully and left the others on the original Innova.  This is wonderful food and I have seen my cats enjoy it, that's enough for me.

review/text: I stopped buying grocery store cat food after several experiences that happened nearly simultaneously: I learned what is contained in them (what is actually in fish meal, for example). I learned about other additives- that are not food- and how they effect an animals organs. I learned about the recall of foods from China killing pets nationwide, if not worldwide. I learned about the national recall lists of pet foods and all kinds of foods and products published online everyday of the week. So I made the switch to organics with ingredients labels that will make you smile instead of shutter. These foods are more expensive, but you love your pets so you'll be buying peace of mind and their continued health.<br /><br />This food can also be purchased in pet stores, dry, low-fat, senior, and canned are all available.

review/summary: Like this flavor
review/text: I'm surprised this flavor has so many negative reviews.  This is one of my favorite flavors, it's not overly rich like some of the others.  I love the coffee flavoring, it seems to mellow these cookies out.

review/summary: Caffeine!
review/text: I looked at the ingredients of this mocha cappucino breakfast cookie, and saw that it is made with ground espresso. You can taste it as well. Depending on whether you like espresso or not, that's either a good thing or a bad thing. I call these "caffeine patties", because they certainly perk me up after eating one. Just keep in mind if you do not like coffee, you probably won't like these very much.

review/summary: Very different from other Erin Baker Breakfast cookie flavors
review/text: Let me start with:  this is one of my favorite flavors of Erin Baker's Breakfast cookies.  That said, my daughter disagrees with me 100%.<br /><br />The flavor of the mocha cappuccino in the cookie is distinctive.  You will either love it or hate it.<br /><br />If you are a sweet chocolate lover and a sweets lover, this might not 'row your boat'.  If on the other hand, you enjoy your cappuccino without sugar and like dark chocolate, you will find that this cookie is THAT flavor combination in solid form.  Not too sweet, not too moist, very flavor-ful and excellent when eaten with a cup of coffee.

review/summary: Tastes EXACTLY like coffee
review/text: I love Erin Baker's and decided to try this mocha flavor. The taste is strong, exactly like eating coffee. At first I hated it but it grew on me as i eat it pre early morning workout. But I think I'll stick to the normal floors from now on

review/summary: Very Dry
review/text: I purchased these for hubby for the times when he doesn't find a few minutes to be able to eat lunch or breakfast. I don't drink coffee but tried a bite of one of these and didn't find any strong coffee flavor. We both agree that the cookies are very dry tasting. They will work for what he needed them for but they aren't something he would enjoy just to have a snack, just too dry.

review/summary: Dry and chalky
review/text: I love mocha, cappuccino, coffee, chocolate and everything that I think went into making these cookies - but was dissatisfied with these cookies.  They were dry and just a bit chalky - that's the best word I can think of to describe the texture and mouthfeel.  If you want to try Erin Baker's breakfast cookies, go for the Chocolate Chunk, Double Chocolate, or Oatmeal Raisin (or the peanut butter minis!).

review/summary: Delicious AND nutritious?
review/text: Yep!  Wow, I was really impressed with these cookies.  I was afraid when I bought them they would taste extremely "meh".  But wow.  I look FORWARD to getting to eat one for lunch or breakfast.  I'm impressed w/ the truly delicious taste and w/ all the nutrition it packs.  15% of your daily iron, 4% of your calcium, 6 grams of protein, plus vitamins A & C.  I can't believe healthy tastes SO yummy, is made with whole grains, and ISN'T made with anything you can't pronounce.  Everything in here is natural!  I'm totally sold. This will become a staple in my household!

review/summary: Love them!
review/text: These taste great and are super easy and healthy. I pop one in the toaster before I head off to work and I have a nice breakfast on the go. These were also great right after I had my babies because I didn't have time to make any meals. Cappuccino is one of my favorite flavors!
