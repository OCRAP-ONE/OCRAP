review/text: Best coffee ever. Still haven't found anything I like better. I have never tasted coffee this strong that wasn't bitter at all. Kind of pricey when you start working out what it is costing you per pound but cheaper than buying directly from Gevalia. If this company started opening stores, Starbucks and their bitter brews would go bye bye.

review/text: If I drank more than one commuter cup in the morning I'd probably need to back off the caffeine a notch or two, but this espresso (made in my stove-top espresso maker) is delicious and (almost) worth getting out of bed for.

review/summary: Some of the best coffee I have had
review/text: I was given a pack of this coffee as a gift and it had been sitting around for quite a while (over a year) when I decided to try it.  It was without a doubt one of the best coffees that I have tasted.  Very smooth and flavorful.  I would highly recommend this.  After that I ordered a supply from Amazon. They are vacuum packed (I believe much better than store bought coffee).  I may try the decaf version of this to see how that tastes.

review/text: I bought this for my husband who has been drinking espresso all his life. On a recent trip to Italy we bought the lavazza rosa espresso and I was able to find it and order it on amazon. I bought the gevalia just to try something new and based on the reviews I thought it might be a good idea. My husband loves it and actually prefers it to the Lavazza.  I just bought another 3 pack. we use a stove top Bialetti and this is fine for that type of maker. Highly recommend!!!

review/summary: Perfect for car trips!
review/text: I keep these on hand for car trips with the grandkids. You can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful Kool-Aid drink by just adding a single packet to it. Just open the bottle, pour in the contents of one packet, then close and shake. Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid.<br /><br />They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size. These single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one, and end up pouring half of it out. These were such a great idea!

review/text: ...however, for the price and additional shipping cost (if not receiving that free), I would not say this is a such a good value. Not sure what makes the tuna more pricey than something like the freeze-dried salmon. If these were the only treats available to the cats, they likely would not last even one week in this small amount. In the future, I'd be more apt to open up a 69-cent can of tuna, which they are just as fine with.

review/summary: Good for dry skin
review/text: If you have dry skin, give this a try. A doctor recommended I try this when I complained of itchy skin due to dryness. It's definitely more moisturizing than the bar soaps I used to use.<br /><br />As someone already mentioned, the packaging design is horrible. I used to keep almost empty bottles propped upside-down in my shower caddy, but then decided to use a pump bottle instead, which I refill.<br /><br />Dove -<br />If you're reading this, please redesign these bottles so that they are more user-friendly. In Japan, you sell liquid Dove soap in pump bottles, and you even sell refills packaged in plastic bag, which are far more eco-friendly and less expensive. Please consider doing the same for the North American market.

review/text: I love the product.  But, the bottle design is terrible.  In order to get the last 1/3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down.  With the pointy top that is impossible.  So, you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out.  This takes much more time that you'll want it to take.  Redesign the bottle with a flat top...please.

review/text: I'm a guy with hairy arms and hairy legs. Until I found this stuff, I was using various other body washes with my loofah. I always felt like I could never get enough suds and that the application seemed rough and difficult to quickly spread the body wash all over. Since I started using this stuff (for a few years now), I haven't looked back. This stuff is nice and soft and can create a decent amount of suds with somewhat minimal amounts of application on the loofah. It goes on smooth and ends up making my skin nice and smooth. And it rinses off nice, without leaving my skin rough. It works well, has a nice subtle smell, and I won't use anything else.

review/summary: Thick body wash that lathers easily--sometimes I use it for bubble bath (Deep Moisture)
review/text: High quality body wash that is very thick and lathers quickly and easily. It has a very pleasant, flowery smell that lasts for hours after you get out of the shower. You only have to use a small amount about the size of a quarter to last your entire shower. So even though the product is expensive, you will get a lot of use out of it. It seems that the cheaper, dollar a bottle kind I sometimes use only lasts a week or 2 because I have to use more of the product to last throughout a shower.<br /><br />I would say the smell lasts for around 6 hours or so so it's almost like perfume. My sister-in-law asked me yesterday, "You always smell so good. What do you wear?" I wasn't wearing any perfume of any kind at the time because it was very early in the morning before I had done my morning routine and I had to run something over there to her. I told her that it must just be the body wash. If you have ever used Dove shampoo or conditioners, it is almost the same smell.<br /><br />I am looking forward to trying the cucumber/green tea kind when I run out of these 4 bottles. I would totally recommend this for yourself or for any woman in your life: aunt, mother, girlfriend, wife. I know many women who would never buy this Dove product because they always choose their children and families over themselves, ie buying themselves whatever is cheapest. I intend on buying some of this for my mom and aunt to maybe put in a gift basket or care package for them.<br /><br />I also use this as bubble bath when I take a nice hot bath. Excellent product. A+ from me.

review/text: yes, i have bought this before. i like the smell and detest the bottle design. i do agree with one of the reviewers that the Dove does sell their liquid soaps in pump form in Asian countries and sell the refills for them as well. i would like it if they have that... but i must make due with what i CAN get at this point in time.<br /><br />i decided to redo the way i do my bath routine the way i currently do is so time consuming. it takes almost an hour to take a shower.<br />so i'm on amazon finding things to aid in my new innovated routine.<br /><br />like i said before, i have bought this product in Walmart but only the single bottles or double bottles that happened to be on sale. i love the product it makes me feel soft and silky. the scent is pleasant. not over powering at all. light.<br /><br />i don't buy lotion, they're often heavy and make me feel greasy or they feel weird on my skin. i am of the chocolate complexion so i tend to get extremely ashy because i don't like the way i feel after putting on lotion, so i buy dove body wash, deep moisture. i get clean, moisturized and don't feel greasy after i get out the shower.<br /><br />**EdIt!**<br /><br />i have solved the oddly shaped bottle problem, buy or find one lying around the house, a soap pump for hand soap.<br />i recommend the ones that have had hand soap in them as they are conditioned for everyday use and can hold a thicker capacity soap like this the manufacturer had the bottles made specifically for their product, their product is thick. i've read and heard that the ones you buy empty are for thin lotions and what not.<br /><br />if you use an old soap bottle clean it out first and fill with the Dove soap, and use in the shower, if you can find a 24 oz bottle (maybe from one of doves hair pumps rinsed out,) they're 25oz, big enough to fit all of it and strong enough for thick products such as this. (25oz eliminates the frustrating last bit at the bottom, anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much, by the time you get to that second half in the bottle it'll be where you want it and you don't come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a Dove Soap Deep Moistruizing Body wash bottle...

review/text: I don't enjoy giving products a bad review but I was so disappointed I had to.  I've tried quite a few teas and I've been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so I can get down some pretty harsh teas.  I usually don't use any type of sweeteners either because I drink my tea right before bed.  I've tried to give this tea a chance.  Ive tried it with sugar, honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk.  To me, this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too.  I've also tried straight chamomile teas before too so I know it's not that.  I would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea.  I haven't tried any other Twinings products so this review is strictly for this product.

review/text: I was introduced to the Blair chips by a friend. I mostly ignore potato chips because I really don't like them. However, these I like the most among all the chips in the Blair line. They are savory and can be eaten rapidly. The hot chips are good because they are so hot, I cannot eat them fast. I am so happy I cannot get them at local stores because I would eat them all the time.

review/summary: ADD SKIM MILK - BANANA - BLUEBERRIES  -  WHEAT GERM + MULTI-VITAMIN for A HEALTHIER CHOICE
review/text: SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,<br /><br />What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? "Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt." Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.<br /><br />If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness? After all, it's in the same price range!<br /><br />So if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff. SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU ARE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO OTHER HUNGRY PEOPLE PLEASE!

review/summary: Are We Reviewing Our Mistakes Or These Cookies?
review/text: Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of "calms" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not "crispy" cookies, or the blurb would say "crispy," rather than "chewy."  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.

review/text: Sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. I like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. The skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion--regular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. They are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile--I sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. Although I think these from Roland are very good, I liked the Seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by Amazon, even better for flavor and texture.

review/text: This is a very tasty product. Tastes more like tuna. However I believe the 35mg of salt listed on the indgredients for a 1/4 cup serving is much lower than the actual salt content. I use very little salt and these are somewhat salty. I also opened a can of Crown Prince natural brisling sardines in water which has a salt content of about 45 mg. The crown prince tasted much less salty than the Roland sardines. So I think Roland needs to be a little more careful about their packaging and list of ingredients. My guess is the salt content is comparable to a can of water packed tuna, maybe 210 mg or higher per 1/4 cup serving.

It is a toss up for me as to skinned and boneless opposed to the skin on with bones - I like both - there are probally more nutrients in the ones with bones, which, along with the omega 3s is the plus factor for sardines.  They work for me.  I have eaten them since I  was a kid - I'll turn 80 in July. Incidentally, my cat is crazy about them too.

review/summary: An excellent item for an excellent price
review/text: Sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits... and that they aren't so stinky after all (especially less so after cooking!).<br /><br />I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil, s&b in olive oil, tomato sauce, etc.  The S&B version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation/preference: a great value for the money, and practically a steal when you compare -per ounce- the price with other brands.  Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another.  Why?  Many other brands charge the same price as -or more than Roland- with only a 3.5-oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin.  The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir-fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I was half-mindful when perusing a semi-local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.  I was looking to make some lower-cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time (not expecting to find these, of course, but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud I saw stocked there) when I accidentally stumbled across them.  At $1 per tin, it was a huge buy, so I tried a few.  The rest, as they say, is history as aforementioned.

review/text: I've eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best. The extra cost of boneless/skinless is worth it cos there is more to eat and less waste.  Love the water packed instead of the gooeyness of oil. Excellent

review/summary: I like these!
review/text: 4.5. Just water and large pieces of sardines. Open for all types of combinations of which I find the old whole grain crackers, quality cheese, a particle of mayo and mustard and a hot cup of tea, the most appealing. They do lunch in a hurry and snack times as well. Solid product. Even drank the water in which they are laid to rest and not too shabby. Sardines are good for a person, everyone agrees on that. Even a Sardine sandwich sounds about right in the next few minutes (the better the bread the better the sandwich...) so yes, 4 Solid Stars and I am hungry for the product right now, come to think of it!

review/summary: Roland Sardines are Healthy and Good
review/text: I buy skinless sardines packed in water to keep my intake of sodium and chloresterol down.  For about $2 a can including tax and delivery I feel I am getting my money's worth.  I cannot get these kinds of sardines at the local supermarket.<br /><br />Sardines are somewhat tasteless.  I put the sardines on salad and top the salad with olive oil and red wine vinegar.  If I eat the sardines as a sandwich, I used mustard, which also has no salt and chloresterol.

review/summary: mild, firm and inexpensive
review/text: These are the best skinless boneless sardines that I've tried and they are very reasonably priced.  They remind me a little more of tuna fish than sardines, but in a mild, rather than bad, way and are very firm for water-packed fish.  I especially like these mixed with salsa. They work out to $1.57/can or .36/oz if you choose the longer, but free, shipping.

review/summary: low calorie cocktail idea Fresca Peach Spritzer
review/text: I was looking for a low calorie cocktail and mixed a Rose wine with the Fresca Peach and it was delicious and I am not a regualar soda drinker and don't normally drink Rose wine. Make sure to get a Rose that is not sweet or you might as well drink Kool-aid. Look for off-dry or bone dry Rose's, maybe made with a Syrah, Cabernet, Merlot, Tempranillo, Sangiovese. Zinfandels tend to be too sweet for my taste, but you might like it. A sparkling rose would be great too. You can serve this with ice in a cocktail glass  or without ice in a martini glass.

review/summary: Packaged Red Wheat Seeds
review/text: I was looking for a healthy alternative to regular wheat grass which is becoming harder to find in health stores... and this is not just for me! I also grow this in trays for my 2 cats who live indoors, deprived of valuable natural chlorophyll. All mammals need it, and we are now enjoying a strong, healthy organically grown variety which is easy to grow and lasts a long time. Wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not induce the cats to being sick. They crave it and are very healthy with glossy soft coats, their energy levels are better, and they are playing more. Both are perfectly healthy. Chlorophyll is kind of like eating liquid sunshine mixed in with vegetation. It does a body good! If you care about your (or other) bodies, then get this very nice product. The shipping is fast and it is packaged well. The cans are sealed well with a tight-fitting lid. Yes, I am going to continue ordering from this vendor again. They have exactly what I am looking for.

review/summary: Reboot your snack processors
review/text: I wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars (and ordering them all the time).  I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food.  I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right?  So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged.  How could this be BBQ?  They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything.  I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed.  (I know..."I thought you said 5 stars."  It gets better.)<br /><br />Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps.  I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again.  What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps.  I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder.  I polished the next bags off in three days.<br /><br />Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food).  My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful.  Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips.  You'll feel better about snacking!

review/text: I love light crispy salty snacks, and Soy Crisps is the best one of those I've found.  At only 100 calories per serving/350 calories for the bag, you could literally eat the entire bag (which I do on a regular basis) and not feel bad about it.<br /><br />There are several flavors but Deep Sea Salt is my favorite because it is subtle and just enhances the natural flavor of the rice and soy.<br /><br />So delish!  Shipped fast with all crisps in tact.  Great purchase, re-ordering.

review/text: I love this flavor of Soy Crisps...Deep Sea Salted. However, they are not available in the smaller individual size like most of the other flavors are. My husband prefers the lightly salted ones because they are crispier that the sea salted ones. He's right, but I do like this softer crunch too. It sort of reminds me of popcorn. In fact, I don't mind the big bag on occasions...for example if it is a replacement for a big bag of popcorn while watching a movie! What a nice healthy treat!

But soon it started to grow on me. It's very crispy, without being a deep fried potato chip. It's lightly salted, and doesn't have 12 different fattening, unhealthy seasonings and flavorings. One entire bag is only like 350 calories. It's actually quite good. I really like it now, and I find myeslf reaching for a bag of GenSoy before any type of chip.

review/text: I bought these because I had decided I wanted to eat, and even snack, healthier.  These had so many good reviews, so I decided to try them.  I admit, it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first.  When I opened them, they looked totally unappetizing and then I tasted them......it tasted just like a rice cake/styrofoam with salt on it.  They also have a very unusual texture.  The combination of taste and texture was very disappointing.  My teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way - not even the dog would eat them.  We tried them with a variety of dips and couldn't come up with a tolerable way to choke them down.<br /><br />Luckily, I have a niece that is newly vegetarian, hungry all the time, and she took these off my hands.  I am still out $25 for buying the case of these to begin with...what a waste!
