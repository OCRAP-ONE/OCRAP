review/summary: Everything my little guy needs
review/text: I can't say enough good things about this food.  I have a � Pomeranian � Yorkie mix.  I don't feed Jake human food and his meals are measured according to his size.  As he matured into an adult he started to get blocky looking.  His stools were loose and he was constantly eating grass and even other animals fecies.  After much research on line I determined that though I thought I was giving him good dog food, I in fact was not.  I narrowed it down to this as being the food that I was going to switch him to.  The difference is like night and day.  He now has the shape that he should  Broad in the chest and narrow down through his belly and hind end.  He no longer eats grass or other fecies.  His coat is softer and his eyes do not water near as much.<br /><br />I highly recommend this food.  As an aside, Holistic bought Wellness.  Once I finish this bag of food I am going to switch Jake to Holistic, not because Wellness is not excellent but because Holistic is one step above and they now have Small Breed food.  It is important if you have a small dog that you feed them food specially for small breeds.  The little ones need more protein and fiber because of the energy that they expend.<br /><br />Switch your dog to this or Holistic and you will not regret it.  You will see a change in less than a week.

review/summary: Havanese is a happy camper!
review/text: We have had our little guy on Purina Pro Small breed since we got him as a 1 year old. We are having some issues with him in regards to weight. He was getting far less than the recommended amount, but still within what our vet thought was OK. This was the same food he had been on at his breeder. I was reading labels and have never been happy that the Purina had such a large % as corn.<br /><br />We tried going with Orijen. That eliminated the objectionable grains, but doubled the protein %. He did not handle it well, even with a slow transition period. Stools changed to more greenish and became much larger, then eventually much less formed. He seemed happy to eat it, but apparently his GI tract did not agree. Back to reading labels.<br /><br /> I had used Wellness with cats before and had good response. Then I checked to see if it appeared on animal food recall lists during the 2007 rice gluten (melamine) scare - it was never recalled. The label guarantees no wheat, soy or corn. He transitioned amazingly well and is behaving very puppy-like. It will take months to see if this is going to be a good weight control choice, but in the mean time I feel better he is not getting any corn or soy.

review/text: I have two small dogs one weighing almost 20lbs and the other 7lbs.  They both like this food. At first I fed it dry but they like it much better in warm water which makes it like gravy.  They go crazy over it like that. Sometimes I top it with Wellness can food for a change.  I'm pleased because they are pleased. I like the size of the food because it seems that they can chew it easily and and it digests well making their bowl movments healthy.

review/summary: Wellness Super5Mix Adult Health Small Breed Formula Dry Dog Food
review/text: Great dog food for the smaller dog.  I have two very picky Shih Tzus and they loved this kibble right from the start.  The kibbles are small, which are easier for the little dogs to eat.  My dogs both suffer from itching allergies.  These have all stopped since changing to this dog food.  I also have purchased the Wellness brand treats too and my dogs love them also.  I highly recommend this dog food!  Pet Food Direct is pretty fast on their shipping also when you buy through Amazon.

This is much better than my previous brand, Eukanuba.

review/text: I started my dog (daschund) on this food because of a skin problem.  Since changing (I had used Purina One for sensitive systems), she has had no problems with scaling and redness on her back and legs.  She has had no issues with liver but does drink more water which is probably a plus for her skin as well.  I will be using Wellness Small Breed from now on.

review/summary: The best!!
review/text: I have a 3 yr old toy poodle that has never been able to gain weight due to a liver disorder the vet has never been able to pinpoint. No matter what I tried to feed him,  he has never weighed more than 2.5 lbs, no energy, listless, thin coat and no matter how interested he seemed at first to diet changes or supplements, he quickly lost interest and barely ate. Being an extremely gentle and friendly dog, I feared he would not live a happy, normal life. Wellness small breed has been my dog's life saver!! He just finished the first bag and the change is remarkable! He now weighs almost 4 lbs, his coat is fuller, he is spunky and energetic like the young 3 yr old he is. It is not often one tries a new product and sees such obvious positive results. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Wellness!

Nice small kibbles for even the smallest of mouths, and my dogs went for it right away without having to doctor it up with broth's or any taste/smell enhancements. There poo is nicely formed, too.

review/summary: One of the best out there, and great for picky eaters!
review/text: As the proud owner of a very picky Jack Russell/Chihuahua mix, I feel it's my duty to share my dog food success story with others who have also struggled to find a quality food that their dog(s) will eat.  We have tried so many different foods, including expensive grain free formulas, with no luck.  Even if we could get Bandit to eat, he was bored with each brand within a few weeks, or sometimes even within a few days.  I started to become very concerned that we weren't ever going to find a food that he would be happy with, and then we found Wellness Small Breed.  This is the only food he's accepted and consistently eaten!  He usually gobbles it right up, and his coat is soooo shiny!  The smaller kibble is perfect for his little mouth... I think part of the problem with other brands was the kibble size.  He seemed to actually tire of chewing the bigger pieces.  This formula has tiny pieces that he can easily crunch, and he finishes the whole bowl! :)<br /><br />We LOVE Wellness in our house... currently in the process of using up the remainder of another brand so we can switch our 8 yr old Miniature Schnauzer over to a Wellness formula too!

review/text: This is a very good product.  My little dog realy enjoys it and he bounces around like a puppy with all his new found energy (He is over 4 years old).  His fur looks great and even though it is expensive, because he is so small, the amount he needs to eat each day is just about a cup, which means the bag will certainly last a while. It is not a hardship for me to purchase this food.

review/summary: Just good food for my dog
review/text: For the last five years I have been lucky enough to own an unknown age rescue dog that is part Mexican dog and part English dog -- my guess.  About two years ago she started to have upset tummy/loose bowel problems and was constantly on vet medications and eating grass.<br /><br />While on a shopping trip with my daughter to get her pet food I talked with the (Austin, TX) Tomlinson's pet store stocker and she recommended Wellness Small Breed adult health.  Within three days my dog's health was fine.  This food has no corn and weird ingredients so I think this dog food is the reason she is completely off all vet medications and has her health back.<br /><br />I'm ready to buy this Wellness brand forever.

review/summary: Finally!!!
review/text: I went online and did some research on dry dog foods.  I thought of course that I just had to have a 5 star food.  What I now know is that  tons of protein is not always the best for every breed.  I started my three little dogs cavapoo 15 lbs cavachon 12 lb yorkie 5 lbs on Wellness Core which is I'm sure a wonderful food but the protein is rated at 36% which turned out to be far to rich for my little dogs. After talking with the breeder of my yorkie she explained that too much protein in some breeds can be taxing on the liver and kidneys. I saw this in my dogs right away so I knew I had to make a quick change.  I definately wanted to eliminate the gas and copious amount of poop do to the protein content so I checked with the other foods made by Wellness and found that the simple five mix has a lot of the same wonderful ingredients as the Core but with a much more practical protein content for my dogs life style at 28%.  The results were amazing, immediately I saw a reduction in the amount of poop fewer times outside as well.  Everybody seems happier and life is easier with all three dogs on the same kibble.  I'm THRILLED.  Thank You WELLNESS.  I would strongly recommend this product.  One more side note...I really appreciate the promise made by Wellness on the front of the bag.  IT STATES: NO meat by products corn or soy  and so on.  Check it out for yourself you will be glad you did:)

review/text: My little terrier mix is certainly a picky eater - unless we're out on the sidewalk - where there is nothing, NOTHING he won't turn his nose up at!<br /><br />I've discovered he will gobble this up if I mix a handful of this dry mix with a tablespoon of the wet food also by Wellness <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFRYWU">Wellness Canned Dog Food for Adult Dogs, Turkey and Sweet Potato Recipe, 12-Pack of 12-1/2-Ounce Cans</a>... and maybe as a special little treat some cooked chicken or ham. It sometimes helps to give it 15 seconds in the microwave to release some of the smells and its seems to stimulate his appetite somewhat.<br /><br />It definitely feels like it's good for his energy and digestion. We were having problems with his previous diet - without being too graphic - to our GREAT relief, he's now never gassy and it's much easier to pick up after he's 'done his business'.

review/text: I purchased this food to give my shih tzu. We slowly introduced it by mixing it into his old food. Unfortunately my doggie can't tolerate it even though he loves it. We found that he'd vomit it up.<br /><br />So we switched to using this as a treat. He gets 5 to 10 little bits a few times a day as a reward. We still need to be careful. If we give him too many of the bits, he throws them up. But in the long run, a bag of this will last us a very long time and we will end up saving money on treats. And he loves the flavor!

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I have a very picky Chiweenie (chihuahua/mini-dachshund) that loves this food! I tried a few Purina varieties, the Petco brand, several flavors of Blue Buffalo, canned foods - you name it. Finally we have a winner with Wellness! She's maintained perfect weight/health since the switch, has more energy and I've even noticed her coat being extra shiny. I would recommend this to the pickiest of eaters. No more tricks getting her to eat, she literally eats the minute I fill her bowl and wants more. So glad we found this stuff!

review/summary: small kibble size --- to high in protein for schnauzer mix
review/text: This food may be very high in quality, but not all dogs can tolerate the high protein content.  Our Schnauzer / Lasa Ahpso mix was drinking water all the time and urinating frequently.  We looked on the bag and noticed the protein level was much higher than the old dog food (which was 21.5% protein, 13% fat) .<br /><br />To be fair: this is one of the few dog foods that is made in the U.S. and they do have another version (purple bag) with less protein.  We may try that some time.

review/summary: Going back to Stella & Chewys, PawNaturaw and Nature'sVariety
review/text: I guess everyone has to do their own trial and error to see what works for their little fur friends. After researching alot about the best thing for dogs to eat, Wellness is one of the brands that has my respect... but...<br />it makes our little BOM (beagle/pomeranian) & our rough coated jack russell mix<br /> THIRSTY, FARTY & WEEPY. (that sounds like a bad mix of creepy dwarf names)<br /><br />To be fair, THEY LIKE IT... This small breed kibble is happily gobbled,then they insist on drinking aLOT! and then they fart a little bit, too....and it makes my terrier's eyes weepy, too... with those icky rust stains, and she NEVER has had that problem.<br /><br />So, we are back to our other favorites, which is the rabbit kibble from Nature's Variety Instinct, and the frozen PawNaturaw beef medallions, and of course, their fav breakfast is<br />a Stella and Chewy's Dandy Lamb dehydrated steak. (those don't make the girls thirsty!)<br />These choices are a little closer to the raw diet which I prefer to feed when I can.<br /><br />So, sorry, Wellness, we tried ya! We will finish the bag, but won't be buying any more...<br />I figure we got about a week of dog farts to suffer through yet.

review/summary: Wellness by Diamond Pets RECALLED
review/text: I do not know if this exact type of Wellness has been recalled. But I do know that Wellness which is made by Diamond Pet Foods....are now being recalled.<br />This is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br />I loved this company's Grain Free dog food.<br />I loved that the first ingredient is actually the real meat.<br />My baby girl loved the food, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison mainly.<br />I searched relentlessly for a reasonable priced food that has no by-products, dyes and are grain free.<br />Which my lil' white Maltese needed for her horrible allergies and out of control tear stains.<br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

review/summary: Low low marks for seller, love Wellness brand
review/text: The package had 2" cuts down the center of the bag. The bag was also wrinkly. When I purchase this dog food at local stores the bags never look in bad condition as this one did. Some kibble had come through the cuts and spilled in the amazon packaging box. Not pleased, who knows how sanitary the food is anymore with the bag  broken. Love wellness brand dog food, but not the seller.<br />About wellness small breed- my toy poodle I was told was underweight even with free feed on  eukanuba  but know is a health weight due to the good taste and small kibble size. After disc surgery I soaked his food and he ate on own, big accomplishment for a picky eater who is in post surgery discomfort.

review/summary: Much better than Splenda
review/text: My son cannot have ANY sugar due to a metabolic disorder.  Sugar Twin has been good for baking ... I have noticed a better leavening response (although not as completely responsive as real sugar) than Splenda and we have not noticed the after taste that is so prevalent in Splenda.  To encourage the leavening in baking cookies and breads and such, I use a blend of Sugar Twin and dextrose.  The dextrose works like sugar in leavening.  Instead of a cup of sugar, I'll use 3/4 or more cup Sugar Twin for the sweetness and 1/4 cup dextrose for leavening.<br />The main ingredient, maltodextrin, is a sweetener used frequently in commercial products.  It is nice to have it available for home use.<br />They also carry a brown sugar substitute that we have used before and love.  It is difficult to find in stores so here I am on Amazon, stocking up.  Make sure you get it when it qualifies for Free Shipping!

review/text: Having used almost every sugar substitute on the market, I have to say this is the best!<br />Not only as sweet as sugar but so simple to bake with and gets great results.  Measures just like sugar so no guess work needed.  Price is good also but you have to want to have 12 boxes in your cupboard because that's the way it is sold.  Does have a 2 year shelf life so that is no problem.  Perfect for diabetics.

review/summary: Seems otherwise good - but apparently not gluten-free?
review/text: The cake I made using Sugar Twin really did taste good - like sugar without the sugar rush that follows.  The saccharine bitter aftertaste was there when I tasted the batter, but not in the finished cake.  I'm on a gluten-free diet, however, and had a reaction after eating it that can't have been caused by anything else.  So I've shipped the other boxes of Sugar Twin went off to the local food bank, and I'm back to using Splenda (which is gluten-free), without having tried Sugar Twin long enough to know which I'd really prefer.  If you're not on a gluten-free diet, this is probably great stuff.  If you are, beware!

review/text: I wanted to try the Miracle Noodles after seeing them on the Dr. Oz show.  I looked for them in health food stores and went to some major grocery stores, no one sold them.  I found them on Amazon and took a chance and purchased a 24 pack.  I was a little concerned about all the reviews that said they had a fish smell and taste.  Also I was concerned about the texture, having read that they are rubbery. When they arrived I was surprised that the packages are so small. One pack will satisfy one person if it is meant as the main dish, however as a side it will be alright for two people.  I found that if you follow the directions on the package(which I did) there is no fishy taste or smell.  The product gets its flavor from the sauce you put on it.  As for the texture it is definitlty different.  It is a little rubbery and difficult to eat or seperate into servings unless I cut them into smaller sizes first.  It does fill you up as it is soluable fiber, it has no other nutritional benefits.  However I will continue to use this product as it is a great way to get additional fiber into the diet.  Also once you get use to the texture it is nice to be able to eat a bowl full with no worries about calories, fat, or cholesterol.  I just put a little spaghetti sauce on it.

review/summary: you have to know how to cook them properly!
review/text: These noodles are fantastic!  I've ordered the 24 pack 3 times bc i go through them so fast!  the best way to cook these noodles is very simple.<br />take a frying pan with terriaki or some kind of other than tomato or alfredo.  While you rinse the noodles in a strainer, let the frying pan start to simmer.  Set the noodles out for a while to dry a bit.  Add the noodles to the pan and let them fry for a few minutes while they absorb the flavor.  if there is still sauce in the pan- drain it!  and let these noodles 'dry' fry for a bit.  This while thicken the texture of the noodles and also allow the soaked flavor to be sealed in.  I usually stirfry Shrimp or chicken, broccoli, mushrooms, peppers and onions, and cabbage into EVOO with garlic and a little salt- then add the FULLY sauteed mixture into the now 'dry' frying noodles...and let it sit.  the taste is out of this world- it's so good that my friends thought i'd made rice noodles!<br /><br />To add tomoto sauce or alfredo you must first put a frying pan of extra virgin olive oil on the stove and let simmer while you rinse your noodles.  let them dry just like before- then add the noodles to the EVOO on the stove.  The EVOO makes the noodles thicker- they soak up the oil and become thick like angel hair.  rinse any excess oil and let the noodles 'dry' fry for a few minutes.  Once you done this- you will see and feel the texture change- now go ahead and add sauce to this mix- it sticks perfectly to the noodles and tastes just like the original recipe.  You just have to know how to get those lil noodles texturized and they will do what you want! :)<br />These recipes are fool proof- i've done them many many times and taught my roomate- who doesn't know to cook, how to properly cook these!  they are always a big hit!!!  If you want more recipes that i've come up with for these noodles- let me know, i'd be happy to send them to you!

review/text: These are the perfect noodle for peoe wanting to diet without having to keep a diet appealing to them.  The noodles are very easy to prepare.  They already come "cooked.". All I did was drain then rinse them and then heat them for a couple of minutes in whatever flavor I wanted them to be.  I did not have an issue with them feeling or tasting like slime, as another reviewer stated.  They have a similar texture to rice noodles.  They are perfect for my currrent diet of no carbs, no sugar, and no added fat.  This way I can stick to my diet and still keep it exciting enough to stick to.

review/text: These ZERO calorie noodles are the answer to every no-carb dieters prayer. The liquid they are packed in has a distinct fermented odour and they recommend rinsing them well. This doesn't really get rid of the smell but, after some experimentation, I found that drizzling vinegar over them and letting them sit for a minute, then rinsing again, removes all trace. After they are rinsed, fry them with a bit of cooking spray to dry them, this gives a better texture, then add your favorite sauce or just stirfry veggies, noodles and soy for an almost no-cal snack anytime.

I did notice the funky fishy smell when I opened the package and dumped the noodles into the strainer.  I rinsed them and gave it another sniff and couldn't smell it anymore.  I let them drain for a few while I made my sauce. Then I tossed the noodles in the sause to coat them and gave it a try.  I was suprised to say the least.  The noodles taste like nothing!  All I could taste was the sauce.  The texture isn't bad at all; I like rice noodles and these are similar in appearance and texture.  I am very pleased and will make these a regular ingredient in my meals.  To cut a bowl of pasta from 300-400 calories down to 30-60 is just awesome.  I usually eat Ancient Harvest Quinona products but will make the switch to the Miracle products.  They are ready to eat which makes them even more appealing.

review/summary: The best alternative to regular noodles
review/text: Miracle noodles are the best alternatives for having noodles without the calories.  Granted, it takes more than a minute to get used to that initial smell when you open them up.  Just follow the instructions for rinsing and preparing for use.<br /><br />The noodles are quick to absorb the flavor of whatever you choose to mix with it.  For ZERO calories, it is the absolute ideal method for snacking on something that tastes great and working for you.

review/summary: They made me sick
review/text: These noodles just arrived yesterday and I now know the secret of their weight loss properties: they will have you throwing up all night. I ate some of these for dinner last night and though I didn't really like them I thought I could at least tolerate them but I started feeling very full after I'd eaten a small ammount (which I thought was a good thing at the time) and ended up waking up at 2am this morning with intense stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. I have never had stomach pain this intense in my life and I have a very strong stomach so this was a horrible shock. I would NEVER buy or reccomend this to anyone ever.

review/text: 15 second rinse, one minute blanch into boiling water. They taste like nothing, and are almost calorie free. I make my own random dressing concoctions to flavor them, eat two or three packages as on-the-go meal at work, and they are filling. The 24 pack is the most economic for sure! I plan to continue them into my diet and therefore replace as I run out.

review/summary: Great noodles!
review/text: Some people don't like these, but I found them to be very good. If you don't smell them before rinsing and blanching, you would never know they had an odd scent. One review said they were fishy smelling, but I thought it was closer to ammonia than fish. Either way, the smell disappears when they are prepared exactly as the package instructs. If you are looking for a wheat or grain pasta-type substitute, this is not it. But, if you like cellophane noodles and similar Japanese 'pastas' then this is your zero calorie version. They don't have any of their own flavor, so you will have to mix them with something obviously.

It's great for throwing in a kid's lunchbox or for when you just want a little non-guilt inducing treat for yourself.  I recommend these and plan on trying their other flavors soon.

review/summary: Product of China
review/text: As a general rule, I hesitate to order food products for my kids that are made in China.  This, after the recent melamine-laced baby formula scandal in China.<br /><br />When I received my two boxes of this item, I was surprised and dismayed to see "Product of China" printed on the box. When I tried to return, Amazon refused because according to Amazon policy, grocery items cannot be returned.  The Amazon site for this item does not specify country of origin as China, or I would not have ordered it in the first place.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I am not generally against products of China. These banana chips may end up being a very fine product (I did not open the box and even try it yet), and I will probably end up eating it myself.<br /><br />But I cannot recommend it if you, like me, are concerned about Product of China food products for your kids, because it is from China, according to the box.

review/summary: Gourmet chocolate from Belgium
review/text: I have not purchased Gudrun from Amazon but have locally at another large retailer that brings it in annually for Christmas/holidays.  I used to have my own retail shop and I actually put in refrigerated cases and storage in order to import this line from Belgium.  I was a candy/gourmet buyer for 16 years.  When I bought Gudrun for resale, they were so concerned about quality control that I was told by the vendor in order to make the mocha cream for the Zebra piece, they bought the coffee beans, had their own grinding equipment and developed the chocolate from A to Z in house.  I had one customer come to my store before hurricane Kate, hoping to get a couple Zebras to get her through the storm.  So, not high school chocolate, which is waxy.  However, it is vital that this product be handled appropriately and not outdated.  Any chocolate, if mishandled and old, will not taste as the manufacturer intended.  If it has whitish discoloration on the surface, it has gone through a temperature flux, separating the oils.  Incidentally, the Zebra was my favorite.  Very hard to find now.  It was a mocha cream on a burned sugar/croquant base with white chocolate coating (yellowish-cream colored, very rich) and dark chocolate zig-zagged across the top to make the "Zebra."  Apparently now made in a dark chocolate as well.  HTH.

review/text: These are pricey, but make for a great gift because (1) they're beautifully packaged and (2) they are excellent chocolates. When I was in Brussels I sampled chocolates from many different chocolatiers, and I think Gudrun represents Belgian chocolate well: creamy & smooth, rich and distinct flavors, and good consistency. I wouldn't buy a box of these for myself because there are probably better values for comparable haut chocolat, but these are impressively packaged and would make a distinctive gift for a client or associate.

review/text: I am a big fan of Dave's Gourmet sauces and condiments, but not this one.  If I was just rating it as a mustard alone I would give it 3 stars for taste, 1 for value.  There are much better, brighter and fresher tasting mustards available at half the cost of this one.<br /><br />However, this is a Dave's Gourmet product and as such I am looking for not just a good mustard but but one that makes a good use of a variety of heat producing, tongue scorching peppers, like Serrano or maybe even Habanero.  What we get instead is a mediocre Dijon-style mustard spiced up with "hot pepper extract".  This is a commercial additive of pure (or close to pure) capsicum, which is used for riot control and to add heat to an otherwise bland product.  In my humble opinion hot pepper extract adds "hotness" without adding to the flavor.  Dave's has some great products, I just don't think that this is one of them.

But I'm afraid that on the last order we had the same experience as "Thomas A. Oehser " , not once but twice. Received beans that appeared to have already been roasted except they had a bad strong chemical smell. Contacted Amazon's great customer service department and they immediately sent a replacement order via 1 day shipping. Received the replacement beans today but they had the exact same problem. Unusable. Contacted Amazon customer service and they immediately refunded our full purchase price plus shipping. We thern cancelled our subscription to Coffee Bean Direct for future orders. Apparently Coffee Bean Direct has significant quality control problems.

review/summary: Don't like thin spaghetti
review/text: I've ordered this before and was good. This time the spaghetti was thin and the page for ordering didn't say thin. The box says "cooks in 2 minutes" but doesn't say "thin." It cooks faster of course and tastes good, but I like the standard, normal thickness of spaghetti.

review/summary: If You Like Spicy Sprouts, Try This
review/text: I like spicy sprouts like radish sprouts, and this one is even better. There are just enough mustard seeds in the mix to kick up the heat "just a notch." I'll be buying these seeds again.

review/summary: Good product, not for newbies
review/text: The seeds contained in this mix seem to be sprouting reliably, but you'll have to turn to your favorite sprout guide for suggested amounts and times - there is almost nothing besides the main label you can see in the images provided by Sprout House. Possibly they have a growing guide they want you to buy. The back label simply includes a bar code and list of the seeds contained.<br /><br />Because seeds go through a complicated change during the sprouting process, there can be some slight danger associated with consuming certain seeds too early. Particularly with seed mixes, you would expect to see some suggestions as to how long they should sprout before you start sampling to see exactly where you like them; how many table/teaspoons of seed produce a pint, quart, etc.-sized container.<br /><br />Additionally, the listings on Amazon sometimes come with warnings that particular sprouts do well or poorly with a jar, tray, or bag type of sprouter, but the products themselves don't. There is also no suggestion for how to store the remaining majority of the half-pound container after you pull 1-4 tablespoons out for your tray. Seeds are as different as people and some store best in a freezer, others the fridge, and some a 70-degree space. I would expect some further clarification about storing their seeds from Sprout House.<br /><br />As I said, the seeds seem to be reliable, but if it's your first time out of the gate, you might want to pick up a unit with complete directions. I also like the ability to spice up salads, sandwiches and stir fry with fresh options, know that I like the spicy sprouts, and was delighted to see them in a mix that will save me time. I will buy these again, but I think there are better places for people to start sprouting
