review/summary: Great tasting and convenient energy drink
review/text: This powdered energy drink is both a great value and a delicious tasting and taurine-filled bevvy. The flavor is sort of a blueberry-esque sweetness but it has a lot of fizzling to it, especially after just adding water. The energy I feel after drinking it is a good balance between lukewarm and overly jolting. The energy levels are comparable to Red Bull. With fourteen packets per box, this 4C product offers a lot of bang for your buck. It is worth trying out for yourself.

review/summary: Great energy drink with fantastic taste
review/text: I love the berry flavor and the great blue color which reminds me - and I am showing my age here - of Romulan Ale the popular blue alcoholic beverage from Star Trek - the origional series.  ironically I think this drink packs a better punch than the fictional beverage.  I work nights notice great mental clarity with this energy drink.  My only real complaint is that the price here is simply too high - my local market has it for $4.49 each(not on sale regular price - one sale I got it for 2.89) and that is well under the price here - so for now this is one product it may pay to look for at your local grocery store to compare prices

review/text: Really good for the price, I'm starting to like this more than other energy drinks. Being that I can buy these for about 50 cents a pop verses, a buck for other  generics, or 2 to 3 bucks for name brand stuff, these are a steal. Dig it. This is the best flavor most definitely, but if you want them cheaper get the multiple flavor pack.

review/summary: Berry-licious!!
review/text: I always hated the after taste of drinks with artificial sweeteners, but this stuff is different even though it is sweetened with Splenda.  The box says to mix with 16 oz of water, but I find that mixing it with 20 oz is less tangy.  These things contain caffeine and several B vitamins, therefore you feel an energy boost after drinking them.  The best of all is that each 20 oz serving is only 5 calories, vs the 140 calories in each cola pop that i used to drink.

I don't think that the difference  is all that great and personally I enjoy the convenience of the individual packets.<br /><br />Would I buy this again? Yes.

review/summary: great for on-the-go mom!
review/text: I bought these for easy-to-pack and difficult-to-spoil lunches on-the-go with my two young kids. No more worrying about soggy sandwiches! Now I just throw a couple of slices of bread, a single serve peanut butter and a few of these in a bag and we're out the door. These also came in handy on our recent vacation & have also been there to rescue us when we ran out of jam in the house one or two times. This isn't gourmet jam but it is regular ol' strawberry jam and it is tasty and convenient. I like the more spreadable jam texture better than the jelly texture of some single serve packets.

review/summary: A better PB&J Sandwich?
review/text: Who makes the kids lunches in your house?<br /><br />In my house its me.<br /><br />And it ain't easy. No matter what you do-- you cannot seem to please everyone.<br /><br />One complaint I got a lot was that the PB&J sandwich ended up being soggy by the time they ate it.<br /><br />The solution? Rather than assemble the sandwich and stick it in a baggie-- give the kids the ingredients and let them make it fresh themselves!<br /><br />THE FIX: Take two (2) slices of their favorite braed and wrap it up in a baggie. Add this single serve jam -- (add a single serve peanut butter-- also available on amazon)-- a plastic knife so they can spread it on the bread themselves-- and voila--- the kids get a healthy, freshly made sandwich that is not soggy.<br /><br />This is a winner!

review/text: With all the hype about starbucks ... I would have thought this coffee would have tasted better. The smell was the first hint that this coffee would not measure up. Then the taste confirmed that fact. The extra fine grind may contribute to the slightly bitter taste. I'm a "Chock full O' nuts" drinker, and have been for years. After being accustomed to hearing constant compliments about my coffee from guests at my home, I'd be embarrassed to serve this nasty stuff. I'm pleasantly surprised that I can find my FAVORITE coffee on Amazon. I'll certainly not be ordering this overhyped coffee again!

I'd recommend them; my children even like to eat these kidney beans cold as a snack!

review/summary: More like the other kind of Rocks
review/text: Trolli has outdone itself with this product!! I consider myself a candy connoisseur and have tried almost every type of candy there is to offer. My favorite types of candy are by far chewy, fruity and gummy candies. I can't deny that Haribo Gummy Bears have been at the top of my list for some time now due to the originality of the gummy bear and the consistency/chewiness of the bears. Yet, I can no longer deny that these gummy bears have handed the title over to Trolli Sour Brite Rocks. The consistency/chewiness and taste of the Trolli Sour Brite Rocks is the perfect combination. The outside shell provides you with a nice sour taste followed by the inner sweet chewy center. The center of these rocks has the best consistency/chewiness I have ever come across, even better than the Haribo Gummy Bears. Once I open a bag of these Rocks I can't stop eating them until the bag is gone. If you love candy or even just like candy this is a must have!! The only bad thing about this candy is the lack of availability of them in stores, which is what led me to search them out and buy them on Amazon, and how addictive they are.

Its all salmon and organic brown rice. They don't smell like traditional dog snacks, they Smell So Good that you may want to try them. Best of all your pup will love them and you're doing something good for him. My pup recognizes the bag and knows that a treat is coming.

review/summary: nice jerky treats
review/text: I picked these up since I was out of lakse kronch treats. honestly I think my dogs preffer these to the Lakse Kronch treats; they seem to like jerky treats better than the crunchy kind. since I can pick these up locally and not have to order them from amazon I will probably stick w/ these. they also make a couple of different kinds (duck, chicken, kangaroo) and I can't wait to try them.

review/summary: Favorite Treat
review/text: My Boston Terrier LOVES these.  He can be asleep in the upstairs bedroom and come running if he even hears me even touch the bag!  They are smelly, but totally worth it because he loves them so much.  He is normally picky about treats because he is so spoiled, and I make him so many homemade ones (milkbones? he won't put the things in his mouth), but he cannot get enough of these.  It is a plus that they are made in America and healthier for him than other treats.  My boyfriends family also has two Dachshunds and they go insane over these as well.  Also, my roommate's Shihpoo goes crazy when he smells them.

They were actually recommended to me since I have a Husky and he has skin problems, as most Huskies do. They don't seem to cure the problem areas of his skin, however, they do help a little.

Strong smell (expected with salmon), but odor does not transfer to your hands too badly.

I just re-ordered these treats. They are pure salmon with no filler, no corn product, no beef/chicken product...very healthy and they have nice shiny coats from the salmon oil.

review/text: I love Indian food. I own two Indian food cookbooks, but find the list of spices so daunting that I've never tried any of their recipes. I heard from a coworker that prepared Indian curry pastes were available at specialty stores, so I looked for them here at Amazon and was delighted to find Patak's curry pastes. The spice level is nice, for those of us who like our food hot and spicy, and you can always add more paste if you want more kick.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Vegetable oil, cilantro, salt, tamarind, water, cumin, turmeric, chile pepper, ground ginger, garlic powder, maize flour, spices, acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid.<br /><br />And here is a basic recipe from the label:<br /><br />Shrimp Vindaloo, serves 2<br /><br />1 medium onion, diced<br />2 tbsp vegetable oil<br />8 oz. fresh shrimp, peeled (or any other meat)<br />3/4 cup water<br />4 tbsp Patak's hot vindaloo curry paste<br />1/2 cup diced canned tomatoes<br />hot, cooked rice<br /><br />Saute onion in oil. Add shrimp and saute until pink. Stir in curry paste and cook about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and water. Simmer, uncovered until the shrimp is cooked, about 5 minutes. Serve over hot, cooked rice.<br /><br />I tried it with beef (which you'd never be able to order at an Indian restaurant) and simmered for 25 minutes, and it turned out pretty well. Not exactly restaurant quality, but very good for a prepared paste. I now keep Patak's paste and some tomatoes on hand, in case I want to whip up a quick, spicy dish using leftover roast chicken or beef. I look forward to trying the other Patak's pastes.

review/summary: I love this stuff
review/text: When I began cooking for myself about 6 years ago, I tried five or six different recipes for chicken vindaloo, from Madhur Jaffrey's classic recipe to actor Anthony Hopkins' "healthful" one (which I found on some entertainment Web site).<br /><br />Most were good, with Jaffrey's being the best of the bunch, Hopkins' the worst (Hannibal's take on vindaloo was surprisingly bland). None of the recipes were nearly as good, however, as the spiced-just-right vindaloo I used to order at least once a week from Baluchi's when I lived in New York City.<br /><br />During my recipe experimentation, I visited a local Asian grocery store and asked the clerk for some advice. He recommended trying Patak's paste. I was dubious, but I did. It was absolutely great. And the bonus: The Patak's recipe is much easier to fix than the various recipes I had been collecting.<br /><br />I've cooked with this paste so often now, I've learned to make a few alterations to the recipe. I basically follow the directions on the jar (substituting chicken for shrimp), but add a 1/4 cup of yogurt and about a tablespoon of fresh minced cilantro at the end of the cooking process. If I have some lemon juice around, I put in a couple of squirts just before serving. (I usually cook the dish with two to two-and-a-half pounds of chicken and freeze the leftovers. It reheats well.)<br /><br />If you're using chicken breasts rather than dark meat, make sure not to overcook and dry out the chicken. That's about the only thing you'll need to guard against. (A friend told me to marinate the chicken bits in yogurt and then cook them under a broiler, separate from the sauce but adding them to the sauce once they're cooked through. He says this locks in the moistness and adds a little flavor to the meat via the slight charring/carmelization that results. I haven't tried it, but it sounds good.)<br /><br />By the way, I'm not sure how healthy this paste is; don't overuse the paste or the dish can get a bit greasy, for example. (There must be a fair amount of oil in the paste.) Just use the amount recommended on the jar and you should be fine.<br /><br />Patak's doesn't beat Baluchi's chicken vindaloo, but for a home cook looking to make fast and tasty vindaloos, this paste can't be beat.<br /><br />Now if I could just learn to make a quick-and-easy naan, I'd really be in business...

review/text: Vindaloo Curry paste is so great! The flavor is amazing, I add coconut milk to mine when I make it because my fiance can't handle the heat like I can. It's the perfect sauce to cook your meat in, and just put a scoop of the meat/sauce over rice, I usually have corn on the side. And of course a tall glass of milk, as it has a slight zing to it, depending on your heat-tollerance of course. :)

review/text: I love Indian food and when I discovered Patak's cooking sauces it al-lowed me have delicious Indian food at home with very little effort.  I am am able to get 3 or 4 dinners out of one jar container.<br /><br />I use this Vindaloo paste as a base and add the following ingredients: coconut milk, fresh cilantro, and garlic.<br />I typically make either chicken or lamb cut up in small pieces.  I also often add vegetable into the same pan, potatoes and onions work very well.  Sometimes I also like adding broccoli, cauliflower or chickpeas for variety.<br /><br />The best price for this sauce I found in a local Indian store.  They have a very large variety of Patak's sauces: different flavors and different hotness. I usually buy a large variety and store unopened jars in the basement. They keeps very well for a long time.<br /><br />I have tried a variety of Indian cooking sauces and Patak's is my favorite.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

Tea's Ect 1000 Cranes White TEA is a pretty good White tea.  I bought this purely based on the price to size ratio.  I was surprised by how large the 8oz bag actually was.  I was also happy with the contents there were plenty of large tea leaves and few stems.  When I first smelled the tea in the bag I was concerned it would be too sweet, as the Strawberry & Rose smelled powerful, but after brewing the taste is that of a mild white tea.  I'm using this tea as a replacment for my daily 2pm cup of coffee and am quite pleased.

Nourishing goodness - the way food should be.<br /><br />The cookies are tiny & crisp/chewy.  You are forced to slow down when you eat them or you may end up with a tired jaw.  These need to be nibbled at.  If find you ate an entire bag it's not all bad.  The whole bag contains way less fat & calories regular cookies.

review/summary: Not terrific tasting, but good for you
review/text: I can honestly only give these "cookies" 3 stars. They are certainly healthy for you (love that they only have 4 ingredients!), and I would love to love them...BUT...<br />They are more like small, thin, crispy crackers. Definitely not a traditional cookie, but not bad. Also, the lemon taste is so strong (astringent) that it tastes like furniture polish. But that fades, the more you eat. But it is difficult to eat more than 2 or 3.<br />Like I said, I *want* to love them....but can't.

review/summary: More chips than cookie
review/text: If you asked me what these were without me knowing first I would've said they were some sort of sweet chips. I don't know how you could label these as cookies in my opinion.<br /><br />They have the texture of dried banana chips and are tasty and all but quite honestly they aren't that healthy for you and have the equivalent calories/healthiness to a serving of potato chips.<br /><br />They are tasty for chips but they aren't cookies.

review/text: Intense, pure lemon flavor in these cookies will satisfy any lemon lover. Keep plenty on hand, not only because they are a healthy, low calorie way to deal with "weak" moments but they are one of the best crackers I've found to carry little bites of chevre or Dafinois cheese.<br /><br />Also great for kids because they are small, taste good, and are devoid of sugar and flour.

review/summary: Fantastic blend of Amaretto flavor and Coffee but not available in a bag - huge disappointment.
review/text: I purchased this at my local Food World Grocery Store. I thought since it was a pack I would just try it. I have always loved Amaretto flavor but I don't like to use creamer in my coffee. I prefer to drink it black (no sugar and no cream). This was the best tasting coffee I have ever had and I am a coffee conisure from way back. I generally don't even like flavored coffees but the amaretto was tasty without being overpowering. The coffee let no bitter after taste and I began purchasing this. Unfortunatly, my local grocery store stopped selling it. I did go online to Black Mountain Gold's [...] website because I wanted to purchase a whole bag of this coffee instead of a pod as I am single and rareley make 10-12 cups of coffee at a time. Plus you are paying a premium for the individual packets. However, I did find everywhere I looked that the Amaretto was not available in bags. However, you can get French Vanilla, Hazlenut Creme, Cinnamon Crumb Cake, Hawiian Kona Blend, Southern Pecan, and Swiss Chocolate Almond [...]. I don't understand why the coffee maker does not make the bags of Amaretto. With this being the case, I am certain I will have to find another Amaretto that is more economical and in my case usuable since I don't make a pack of coffee at one time. The flavor is divine but the packaging is a huge disappointment.

review/summary: Warning: Contains menadione
review/text: According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione "produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung." Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.

If you buy one of Blair's other hotter sauces you can add a bit of them to increase this sauces heat to your liking.  It is about the same heat level as Tabasco but it has 100 times the flavor.

review/summary: Excellent chipotle hot sauce--but could be a bit hotter
review/text: I'm a big fan of Blair's original Original Death Sauce, but I thought I'd give the chipotle version a try since I love that smokey chipotle flavor. This is one awesome sauce. It was instantly my favorite chipotle sauce, with just the right level of smokiness.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it's not quite as hot as the original Death Sauce. On my own personal hotness scale, I rate the original Death Sauce at 4-alarm on a 5-alarm scale. Dave's Insanity Sauce comes in at 5-alarm, and for me it's just pure pain with no actual flavor. No thanks. 4-alarm is my limit for hotness, and the original Death Sauce hits the mark perfectly. It's right at the top end limit before pain takes over completely from flavor. This version, with chipotle, is real hot, but it's not as hot as the original recipe. If the original is 4-alarm, I put this at around 3.5-alarm. Hot, but it could be hotter. But all-in-all it's a terrific chipotle hot sauce.

Blairs Original is mild, to my taste, and I use it like a spicy ketchup- don't be afraid to pour it on!  If I could find a sauce with this flavor and a lot more heat,I'd be a  happy guy.  That said, I think this sauce's taste would compliment just about any food I could think of.

review/text: I just tried this for the first time today and all I can say is "WOW."  It is plenty hot, but unlike a lot of other hot sauces that just go for maximum heat and forget about the flavor, this sauce delivers on both.  The heat is enough to satisfy all but the most extreme hot sauce lover, but has all the taste too.  Try this with some wings or fried chicken strips for a real treat.  This now ranks right up there with Cholula as my favorite hot sauce.  Cholula for less heat days, and Original Death for all others. :-)  Absolutely yummy!

review/summary: Perfect for someone who can't control themselves!
review/text: I lived in Germany for 8 years and became addicted to Haribo Gummi Bears.  Haribo and only Haribo.  All the other brands have a different texture and consistency, not to mention taste.  I returned stateside and found that World Market sold them in 5 lb bags.  I was thrilled!  Unfortunately, once the bag is open, I can't seem to stop eating them.  I would hate for them to go stale.  So these individual bags allow me to eat an entire bag at a time without the guilt.  The packaging is perfect for helping you assert your self control.  That's not to say that I haven't sat down and ate 6 bags (or more) at a time, but I figure with all the opening of the little bags, I am burning off almost as many calories as I am ingesting.  Anyway, shipping was quick, packaging was great and the gummi bears inside are delicious as ever.

review/summary: Good, but tiny!
review/text: So this is a mixed review. I give 5 stars for the taste and quality of the bears. If you are familiar with Haribo, it's the same awesome yumminess you expect from the brand.<br /><br />So the packages are TINY and the bears are TINY! I was imagining the bears to be small, but the package seriously is 2in x 2in big. The description also said that there were 2.2 lbs in the canister of bears and then you get the canister and it says "1 lb 9.4 oz". That's over 1/2 lb. off! The little packages themselves say "less than 1/2 oz" and you only get about 10 bears in each package. If you are buying this product because you are thinking you get a great deal, it's WAY expensive. You are only getting 2oz of bears for the same price as a 7oz bag on sale (and using a coupon) at the store. Even without the coupon, the bigger packages are a way better deal.<br /><br />I'm giving the overall product 4 stars because the price is CRAZY and the description was inaccurate, but the package size and gummi bear size is perfect for my toddler, so I'll find good use for them, but I won't be repeating shipments with subscribe & save. It's just too expensive. The taste is great too, so only one star less for price. Hopefully amazon will update the description so that people are more informed before buying.

review/text: The missing star (originally two) is because this product is melted into a gummi "splat," there are no gummi bear formations.  Another minus, it is hard to open packets and we have to use scissors, and then the treat is melted into corners so our scissors get dirty/sticky.  HOWEVER, my colleagues loved them!  They looked for melting patterns and talk about looking for packs with "more red," or "green melted with green," etc.  So they get a star back :)

I bought them for a co-worker girl in the office, but the Haribo's are more of a hit with everyone else. The package count seems to be about right for my monthly subscription. Amazon has a good program here.

review/summary: Not all Gummi Bears are created equal
review/text: In fact, not all Haribo Gummi Bears are the same.  They vary in taste depending on where they're produced.  These are great--not too sweet and not too shiny/slimy as others can be.  Wonderful flavor.  Even the flavors I like least taste great.  The only problem with this is that 72 mini bags disappear quicker than I can imagine!  Enjoy.
