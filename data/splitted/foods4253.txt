review/text: We have enjoyed Market Spice Tea since our first taste at a local Las Vegas coffee house. When the coffee house closed a couple of years ago we didn't even know how to get it again until last summer when we went to Seattle on vacation. The tea is delicious, ordering it on Amazon was easy, the delivery was fast and we all had it for Christmas!

review/summary: You won't be disapointed!
review/text: This is by far the best tea you will ever find if you like a bold, in your face, but not overwhelming taste of cinnamon & oranges instead of just flavored water like other teas.<br /><br />You must be very careful handling the tea bags from the essential oils they use.  I love to smell tea so I placed the tea bag to my nose and took a whiff, then cried for the next 30 minutes as my nose was on fire!!  No amount of water or soap could remove the burning from the oils that were displaced on my nose.  Also don't directly touch it or reach into the bag with acrylic nails.  I ruined a fresh french manicure and learned the hard way - the essential oils leave a green film on your nails that takes days to wear off.<br /><br />Other than that, just try it once and you will be hooked like all the others!  My boss introduced this to me after she came back with it from a trip to Seatle.  I've been ordering it ever since along with all my other co-workers who became a addicted.  It will brighten any day!!!!!!

review/text: I first got this tea on a trip to Seattle.  I was using it sparingly by just adding one bag to a gallon of sun tea made with the normal amount of Lipton.  Everyone seemed to like the different flavor of my iced tea so I ordered more.  The weather is turning cold here and I decided to try this tea hot at one bag per cup.  (needed to cut down on the coffee and half&half!  I couldn't believe how good it is.  It is sweet!  It is spicey!  It is just plain good!  Gave two bags to a friend to try and she called asking where could she get more!  It is just plain good and very satisfying!

review/text: I am from Seattle so I know how good this tea is. There's nothing quite like it and I would recommend it if you like a tea with a kick to it. I was pleased to find it here on Amazon.com  My only complaints are that the shipping was a bit expensive ($6 for a $10 item!) and I had expected that with the higher shipping cost that it would arrive sooner - it didn't. It took me 10 business days to get it over on the east coast. It was packed fine, but nothing special. Overall I am more satisfied than dis-satisfied but if I order it again from them directly I will keep in mind the high shipping cost and the time it takes to get here.

review/summary: A decent sugar-free hot beverage option
review/text: I love hot chocolate, and was hoping for a sugar-free option that would still taste good.  While the chocolate has a decent flavor, I am sad to say that it suffers the fate of many sugar-free products.  It's somewhat bland, though not entirely bad.  I'm sure that if you drink enough of it you'll get used to the flavor, but after drinking this and having a packet of the regular Swiss Miss, I immediately switched back over.  That said, if I ever need to limit my sugar intake, this is the brand I would get, since it doesn't give you that bizarre aftertaste that most "sugar free" sweet products have.  If you can't have sugar but still want some hot chocolate, this would be the product to get.  Just be aware that it's not going to knock your socks off with it's taste.

review/summary: Mmmmmmmmmmm............
review/text: Have been buying Swiss Miss Sugar-Free cocoa in the 60-envelope box for some time from Costco, but lately they discontinued carrying it, only offering a paltry 24-count box for 8 Washingtons.  I was disappointed - with one diagnosed diabetic adult, one prediabetic (chocaholic) adult, and two at-risk kids in the house, this was a great little treat with little impact on the glucometer or waistline - low carb, low calorie, no sugar, and lots of flavor.<br /><br />Was glad to find the 2-pack here on Amazon, and ordered two 2-packs to qualify for free Super Saver shipping to stretch our dollars, making each 60-count box approximately 12 Washingtons... take that, Costco!  ;)  lol.  It also arrived within two days or so... pleasant surprise!  :D<br /><br />I'm no expert but to me the cocoa is really very nice.  The kids like theirs simply mixed with very hot tap water; it mixes very easily if one adds a bit of water first to make a slurry, then fill the rest of the mug up and mix completely.  I prefer my chocolate "darker" (no longer eat milk chocolate) so add a scant teaspooon of instant coffee to the mix, make the slurry, fill the rest of the mug up and mix completely.<br /><br />Good little treat for the chocolate-lover.

review/text: The hot chocolate has a great taste. I purchased it because my sister was worried about the kids having too much sugar every night before bed. The kids had no idea it was sugar free. Even the adults we gave it to had no clue. Like other reviewers said - it doesn't mix very well so we actually made it on the stove in a pot so it would have time to mix up. If you were looking to make one packet with just some hot water, stir it a lot and even then you will have some chocolate not melted. On a positive note, each packet does make a decent size cup of hot chocolate. Enjoy!

review/summary: Not a fan of the taste... tip: don't use the entire pouch for one cup
review/text: Of course any review for cacao will be subjective, so is mine:<br /><br />I simply do not like the taste of swiss miss (both the no sugar version as reviewed) as well as the regular version: it simply does not taste like chocolate when prepared with water. For those who prefer a chocolaty taste, I would recommend Nesquick prepared with milk. You can get it in larger tubs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003G2LJ4U">Nesquik Chocolate Powder Drink Mix, 48.7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> and it doesn't loose flavor.<br /><br />I must admit, it's a convenient hot drink, especially if you don't like coffee or tea and most offices have at least hot water available. Here's a tip for those of you who don't like the strong flavor: simply use half the pouch per cup of water and it will tone it down (this is how my wife drinks it in the office) and at the same time you'll consume less calories.

review/summary: no sugar added hot chocolate
review/text: Our family has used this product for years - every morning in a cup of brewed coffee. What a way to start the day! When Costco stopped carrying it, I was glad to find it still available at Amazon. The chocolatey  flavor isn't too rich, which works well with coffee. We love that it isn't loaded with extra sugar and uses sucralose instead of aspartame. Best of all - it's only 60 calories.

No sugar option made it so that even the diabetics were able to enjoy cocoa with their Christmas packs, too!  Super!!<br /><br />Thanks!

review/summary: Good Taste, Poor "Mouthfeel"
review/text: This cocoa product has a good "Chocolate" flavor, but doesn't have a creamy texture that I prefer. It is quite thin, when prepared according to package directions. My two grandchildren, ages 4 and 3, who will drink almost anything that has a sweet flavor, actually do not like this for some reason. It is better (actually drinkable) if some sort of creamer product is added, but this defeats the purpose if you are trying to save on calorie or carbohydrate or fat grams. I have been trying to use this up by adding to my coffee instead of the creamer/sugar substitute that I normally use and this has worked better than just using it for hot cocoa. I probably would not buy this product again.

I immediately began searching the label to find out what had been used to make it so "sweet". I found nothing about a sweetner on the individual packages but aha! on the side of the box I found the culprit: sucralose. I'll have to keep searching because I won't be buying this product again.

I have been using Round Up for several years now and find that what works best is to spray, wait 4 days and then spray again. If you need the weeds gone fast, or by a certain time, (like if you have company coming or an upcoming BBQ that weekend or something like that), spray thoroughly, wait 12 hours, spray, wait another 12 hours, spray again, and they will be completely wilted and dead within 8-12 hours or maybe even sooner. Basically, just spray the you-know-what out of them!

review/summary: Taste of Britain
review/text: Being a native Californian, with parents who were dust bowl Okies, who moved to Arizona during the depression, I like a lot of different kinds of foods. When I first moved to England in the late seventies, I was aghast at the food. Of all the shocks to my senses, the smell of Malt Vinegar, (just about the only seasoning besides salt that the typical Brit used during my years there) was particularly offensive. After two weeks of walking by our neighborhood "Chippie" I finally broke down and tried the Fish & Chips with salt & vinegar. I was forever hooked. It really is addicting, it makes you cough, it makes you sneeze, it makes you want more. Heinz Malt Vinegar taste the same to me here in the US as it did in the UK, so if you want the flavor of Britain,  try this the next time you have fish & chips, you might find yourself addicted too. Or for even a more British thing, peel a cucumber, slice it thin and soak it in a bowl of malt vinegar, and put a few slices of cuc between two pieces of buttered bread and cut into quarters, for an authentic "Tea" time snack.

review/summary: Surprise, contains corn
review/text: I'm sure this vinegar is delicious, judging from the other reviews. But because Amazon doesn't have a policy of disclosing all food ingredients, and because of corn allergy in the family, and because I didn't research it offsite before buying, I now have six bottles of vinegar I can't use.<br /><br />For future reference for those who might need to know, here are the ingredients as listed on the Heinz Gourmet Malt Vinegar bottle label:<br /><br />Malt vinegar (barley, corn malt), diluted with water to 5% acidity.

review/summary: Accept no substitute!
review/text: Out of the clear blue, I recently got a yearning for fish and chips and went online to look through recipes.  One think I took for granted was that I'd need a bottle of malt vinegar to use as a condiment.  Assuming they were all the same, I grabbed the first bottle I saw on my grocer's shelf, from a very famous and time-honored company whose products I enjoy.  I'm here to tell you that malt vinegars are NOT all the same.  My first recipe attempt was pretty much a disaster, and this nasty vinegar finished it off.  I poured it out and went to several groceries until I found the Heinz version, which I remembered from being a fish & chips junkie back in my college days.  Heinz is the stuff!  If you've tried malt vinegar and you didn't like it, make it a point to try the Heinz version.  On a chunk of deep fried cod or halibut filet, it is heaven.

review/summary: i love it
review/text: Like another reviewer, I became a fan of Heinz malt vinegar while in the UK.  It seemed a little bizarre to me to see this product advertized on Amazon, but I have lived for a while in a place in California where you couldn't find this in the supermarket, and I would've gladly ordered some through the mail.  Even though I avoid fried fish and chips these days, I still love the taste of malt vinegar, and Heinz makes the best one I've tried.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/summary: Stanley wants seconds!
review/text: Stanley may not be the best source for food reviews, since he generally eats anything he can fit into his mouth and seems to enjoy it, but the fact is, he is very fussy about dog food.  I've tried the high priced stuff, Royal Kanin, Iams, even Paul Newman's offering which smells better than the stuff I feed myself.  He eats it, of course, but not joyfully, not with that Cocker Spaniel enthusism.  Plainly put, when Stanley eats something he loves, he sends up a spray and every fiber of his doggy being exudes joy.  Yeah, I know, so do I, thanks for bringing it up in front of strangers.  We're talking about the dog, so beat it.<br /><br />Anyway, until now, only people food...but specially prepared for Stanley (vet approved menu: chicken or beef, baked boiled or broiled, fat removed, diced and mooshed together with selected fresh vegetables)...elicited this kind of enthusiasm. I am not averse to cooking for my dog, but it would be nice to be able to open up a can every so often instead. Particularly when there is only one piece of chicken left and I want it.  A friend told me that his finicky dog loved Purina, to the exclusion of all other canned offerings, so I tried it.  Country Stew, Lamb and Rice and this "Gravy with Beef" which sounds unappetizing, but smells fine, are his favorites.  He still prefers a nice piece of beef and has absolute and undisputed dibs on the white meat from every chicken, but this rates a ten on his tail-wagging unbridled joy of eating scale.<br /><br />I should point out that Stanley also eats bugs when he can get them, so while the word "choosy" might describe his eating habits, so does disgusting.  But no matter, he's the best Good Boy ever and deserves the best...whether it's people food, dog food or the occasional crawly thing.

review/summary: Our dogs love it but finding low price and 12 oz cans is tough
review/text: When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses "...it's mostly water," our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the "beef and liver" chunks in the future.

review/summary: Pedigree Dog Food, why I give if 5 Stars
review/text: I have a four year old dog who loves Pedigree Canned Dog food.  We have been using it the last six months.  I have purchased some of the most expensive canned dog foods at a local pet store and he will not eat the stuff.  If I have a bag of high quality kibbles and mix it in with the Pedigree, he will not eat his food.  We tried Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Holistic Select, Innova, Merrick, and Natural Balance.  I don't know what is in these higher quality cans of dog food he does not like.  Maybe too many vegetables??  He will even hide and pout if I put that stuff in front of him.  One time I left the food out for 15 min., put it away, and tried the next day.  He just would not eat the food.  He just loves the smell and taste of Pedigree, and he will even eat Alpo on occasion, but he will not eat the expensive dog foods, which I am more than willing to purchase for him.  I talked to two vets about this.  They tell me dogs go by odor.  The worse something smells the more they like it.  This is why many dogs will roll in dead things out of doors.  We do try to balance out his diets with apples, carrots, etc., if he will eat them, plus the dog gets a vitamin with minerals each day.  Of course he will eat cooked meat if I give it to him, and often we will give this to him with some rice or whole wheat pasta mixed in.  If someone can tell me how to get him to eat the better canned or kibble dog food that so many folks think dogs should be on, then I would like to know this.  Also, the reason we started using Pedigree is because we have some friends (and their relatives) who have had many dogs over the years and feed them Pedigree.  These dogs have lived to a ripe old age.  The biggest thing that got them down was arthritis, but the Pedigree never killed them.  So, this dog food may not be high quality, which I agree when compared to Blue Buffalo, etc., but it does not seem to affect their life span.  I am sure there will be folks who will tell me differently, but for those folks I know personally, they have not found any problems with this food for their dogs.  Amen.

Instead of complementing the natural flavor of the steak, it ruins it. Your expensive steak ends up tasting like flavored beef jerky. Speaking of beef jerky, this marinade somehow hardens the meat instead of softening it. 1 star. Recommended only if you are completely inept at cooking, or dislike the natural flavor of steak.
