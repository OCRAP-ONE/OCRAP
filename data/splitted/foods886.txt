review/summary: Buffalo Bleu
review/text: I bought cases of the large bags of Buffalo Bleu, New York Cheddar and a medium sized case of Spicy Thai.  The cheddar kind of tastes like pringles to me, but the others in my family really like them.  The thai is really good, but they aren't that much different than barbecue chips with a sprinkle of ginger flavor.  But the Buffalo Bleu IS AWESOME!  These are the absolutely best chips I have ever eaten.  The funny thing is that the bleu's were the ones that I thought I would probably regret getting.  They are awesome.  I will buy again.  And again.  And again.<br /><br />I would suggest, though, if you get them to get the smallest bag size or else you will do what my family and I have done:  finish a bag every other day.  The smallest bag might be the most expensive per ounce but they will probably last longer.

review/summary: Always delicious and always expensive
review/text: Kettle chips are always delicious,though a little expensive considering they're just potatoes.  WAY better than anything Frito-Lays puts out.  It's a shame that the independent chip companies are dying out at the local grocers because Frito-Lays crowds them out, when the independents are so much better.  Take a trip to your local Trader Joe's or Amazon to find good chips nowadays, and cheap too if you find them on sale here, cheap all the time at Trader Joe's.

review/summary: A very tasty chip!
review/text: These chips are crisp, tangy and a nice change from barbecue flavor chips.  If you like spicy foods, you'll love these.  The blue cheese is not at all overwhelming, just adds that extra "bite."  The box of chips arrived well packed, nothing broken, and the expiration date was over 3 months in advance, making this a very good value, considering the 20% discount Amazon had during November.

review/summary: OK but not great
review/text: First off the krinkle cut chips are far inferior to the regular style kettle chips in my opinion.  Secondly, the flavor doesn't really capture the taste of buffalo wings or bleu cheese.  They taste kinda weird.  It's probably not the best type of flavor to put on a potato chip, even though I love wings.

review/text: A big fan of kettle-cooked chips since I was a kid, I tend to go around buying any and all brands and flavors I can find.  As a result, Buffalo Bleu was on my list.<br /><br />I was in for a real surprise when I got my hands on this flavor.  It has a great taste -- not too sweet, not too salty -- and a nice crunch.  There's not really anything else to say; if you like good chips, give these a try.

review/summary: One of the healthier chips
review/text: Simple, uncomplicated and healthy ingredients. Cooked in expeller pressed oils (not heated to extract, which causes loss of nutritional value), Kettle chips have a firmer texture than most others, but they have great flavor, even though no flavor enhancers are used except for the spices. No preservatives is also a plus. My only negative experience with them is an occasional bag in which the chips in the very bottom of the bag are oily. I was so pleased to find them at a price nearly a third less than what I have been paying in the grocery market.

review/text: These are nothing more than barbecue potato chips.  Covered with a dusting of chili powder, salt, and sugar, I would not buy these again. I really love blue cheese, but I can't taste it in these chips. I should never buy anything I haven't tried, and now I'm stuck with all these bags of chips that I don't like. I have tried the salt and cracked pepper flavor and wish I had bought them instead.

review/summary: A salty, spicy crispy delight!
review/text: This flavor of Kettle chips is my favorite.  I always need to have a few of these bags laying around for a good movie or sporting event.  Krinkle cut happens to be my favorite type of chip and kettle chip delivers on these.  Not only are the chips always crispy and fresh, but they have a perfect coating of salt and pepper.<br /><br />That coating creates a nice blend of salt w/ a bit of nice black pepper kick that lets you know the chip is willing to give a bit of bite before surrendering.  I've gotten a few boxes of these over the past year and have had no problems with the chips or unbalanced flavoring.  Once again Kettle delivers a fantastic product that delights the taste buds

review/summary: Stale, too oily to touch and tasted weird
review/text: I ve had this exact kind a ton of times at my local deli and love their taste, figured i d save a bunch by getting a box of 24 delivered to my desk at work. Unfortunately, I think they unloaded their oldest/worst batch on me. The chips tasted stale, leached out a ton of oil ( I m not kidding, felt like I was eating pizza given how much oil i was leaching out with a napkin from each individual chip!) and the taste was just off. I think with all the oil that leached out, it upset the flavor balance of the chip and now they just taste really salty and stale.<br /><br />Tried 3 different bags, and it was the same in each case (couldnt eat more than a couple of chips, they were that bad). Got in touch with Amazon customer care, and they were kind enough to get me a refund, but i recommend that you save yourself the hassle and give these a miss.

review/summary: Taste good but NOT truly MSG-FREE
review/text: I bought 2 cases of these chips because I heard nothing but great things about this brand and this flavor of chip in particular. However, upon receiving them today, I saw that although they state NO MSG, they DO contain Yeast Extract which acts exactly as MSG does and therefore I cannot eat them. Unfortunately ALL Kettle chips contain this ingredient so I am unable to eat any of them. I don't think I can return them but I got them at a cheap price so I will donate them or see if Amazon can let me return them since the description was a bit misleading. These chips are MUCH healthier than many other brands, so if you are not MSG sensitive, I say dig in!

We really like the Sea Salt & Pepper chips but were unable to obtain a package larger than 5 ounces in the local stores, at a much higher price than at Amazon.com. While we would like to have the ability of getting a larger size bag, say 24-32 ounces, it was nice to be able to get the 9 ounce bag of chips.

review/summary: Check the label
review/text: The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are "All Natural" really, really, really upsets me. These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain "yeast extract." On a chemical level, yeast extract is the same thing as MSG; it's just derived from a different source. Kettle labels some of their products with "NO MSG," but their reps say people who are sensitive to glutamates should avoid their products. Be an informed consumer.

review/summary: Great tasting healthy product!
review/text: I've been drinking Tieman's fusion coffee for about 4 years, even before Amazon start carrying it.  It does not taste weird like most hybrid coffees.  It tastes like really good regular coffee and you make it at home exactly the same way as normal coffee.  Plus, it's a 'health food' with all the antioxidants!<br /><br />After trying the dark whole bean for a while, though, I decided to switch back to dark ground.  I always transfer my new coffee to mason jars, and noticed with the whole beans that that tea will eventually settle to the bottom of the jar leaving the whole beans at the top.  So, I have switched back to dark ground, which always stays evenly mixed.  By keeping it in the mason jars, it stays fresh until consumed.<br /><br />Whole bean or ground are both GREAT!  i love Tieman's fusion coffee and feel better by drinking it!

review/text: This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is "russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA".  Notice that this product title starts with "Alaskan Salmon", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of "Grained Salmon Caviar"  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see "made in USA" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was "sorry I was out of town".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.

review/text: As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say "Product of USA." This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star.

review/text: I have been purchasing Reese Skinless & Boneless sardines for several months. These sardines come neatly packed approximately 5 to a can. They have always tasted fresh with no fishy taste. As an added bonus they are low in sodium, only 45mg/can. Most canned sardines are high in sodium. The sardines are good eaten right from the can or in a sandwich with tomatoes or scallions. Sometimes I add a small amount of olive oil as the fish can be a tad dry. Excellent sardines. An additional note: For what it is worth the sardines processed in Portugal are far superior to those processed in Morocco. Those from Morocco have of late been over cooked and bits and pieces while the ones from Portugal are firm whole pieces.

review/summary: EXCELLENT SARDINES AND VALUE
review/text: I am always concerned about sodium, fat, oil and calories.  These Reese Skinless & Boneless sardines are definitely the answer.  What an excellent value, boneless, not unusual, but boneless and skinless, that is another story.  I was buying canned sardines from the .99 Cent store for years, smaller cans, but excellent value.  Once I found these at Amazon this is where I now buy my sardines.  These are an excellent purchase.  I also like the pull tab top.  No can-opener necessary.  I just put them on a plate and add a little mustard and enjoy them.  I highly recommend these.  Actually, I think I am going to have to open a can right now since my mouth is watering.  Oooops, I just checked the pantry and discovered I already ate my last can of sardines, so I am placing my next order now.  If you like sardines, these are a wonderful purchase.

review/summary: enjoy them every day!
review/text: I've been getting these sardines for 4 months under the subscription program and am quite satisfied. There are usually 3 sardines per can, sometimes 4. Occassionally there may be a tiny spec of skin still present, but not usually.  I would characterize the taste as mild which is just fine with me. I think some people who call these bland are more used to sardines packed in olive oil and a lot of salt, but these are a lower salt alternative and have less calories than those packed in olive oil. The quality has been very consistent, and i consume a half can of these sardines every day on wheat bread with humus.<br />I have had briesling sardines, which, as i understand it, are very young and tender sardines, and they were superior to these sardines, but i have always found briesling sardines to be a lot more expensive. These sardines suit my needs and price range very well and i enjoy them a lot.<br />As you probably know, sardines are a very good source of omega-3 fatty acids (the good kind), like other fish. But unlike larger fish, sardines tend to have lower mercury content, which makes them an ideal protein rich snack.

review/summary: Low Sodium Sardines Serve Multiple Purposes
review/text: These sardines are a basic stocked item in my pantry. They are a fast protein pick-up that is low calorie, low salt, and low fat. I always have a can with me at work. Also,for cat lovers, my cat has kidney issues, and living in the desert she is additionally at risk for dehydration. So, besides some amazing homeopathic pills and organic cat food (that I buy from Amazon,) I give her the liquid from these super,no-salt added sardines, and the liquid is like a miracle fluid. Obviously she laps up the liquid within a short time (plus a bit of a sardine) and I can see and feel that she is doing better. I used to love the Season brand sardines as well, but Amazon dropped them from their subscription program. By the way, I called Reese up and they told me these are wild-caught sardines, which is a concern of mine, as I will not buy farm-raised fish. As far as the sardines go they are firm, lovely whole pieces, which are moist and tasty.

review/summary: Excellent boneless/skinless sardines
review/text: I have tried various brands of boneless/skinless sardines,in search of the perfect one for me to be buying regularly, since I am now eating them frequently. (I find that a breakfast of a can of these, mixed with an egg and a bit of salt and parsley, and fried as patties, is a "perfect" breakfast--tasty, digestible, very satisfying for a long time, and nutritionally powerful. They make a good salad ingredient also.) You have to pour off the broth that comes in the can before adding the egg or salad dressing, and in most brands of sardines, that broth is way too salty to drink. When I read the previous customer review saying that these Reese sardines are no good because they have NO added salt and are therefore "tasteless", I realized this was the brand I wanted. I now enjoy drinking the broth, which has just a bit of natural saltiness of the sea, and there is nothing to prevent adding some salt to the remaining sardines; they are delicious when seasoned to your taste.  I also appreciate that the sardines are smaller and more tender than most of the other brands. The price is very good also, especially if you get into "subscribe and save" with them, as I have.

review/summary: Low Sodium and Low Cholesterol Sardines
review/text: These sardines are very healthy because they are low in sodium and low in cholesterol.  Most sardines come with the skin, that increases the chloresterol content.  The sardines have a strong fish smell.  I rinse the sardines with water in a strainer.  I then crumble the sardines, and add mustard and minced garlic.  I also add olive oil.  These ingredients take away the smell and cause the sardines to taste good.  I then put the sardines on a mixed salad I purchase from the salad bar at my supermarket.<br /><br />Before I do the above I give a small chunk to my cat and she eats it all up.

review/summary: Price Increases Come Fast and Furious
review/text: These are very good sardines and I have been getting them regularly through Amazon's Subscribe and Save for several years now.  In a recent but quick series of price increases, the Reese S&B sardines have gone up a full ten bucks per package, from $13 to $23 for the ten can (tin can--haha) item.<br /><br />Perhaps they were a little underpriced early on, but I can't take many more of these substantial increases.  The problem is that there is really nowhere else to go if you like the no muss, no fuss utility that these Reese S&B's bring to the table.  If I just ate a can a week or so, I wouldn't really feel the price increase.  Sadly, that's not the case.  I go through them pretty quick.  Be forewarned.  They're good.  They're also good and spendy.

Finally heard about these and tried them (one can from my store first) and they're good. Ordered in bulk from Amazon since the one can I bought at the store was the only can and the only way I'm going to eat these is if I have them around. Just wish the cans opened more easily. Oh, well, maybe with practice I'll get proficient opening and eating them. (OK, they're still new and unusual and aren't the first thing I grab from the pantry.)

review/summary: Think Health
review/text: Nutrition (information from Wikipedia)<br />Sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies suggest that regular consumption of omega-3 fatty acids reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease. These fatty acids may also help lower blood sugar levels a small amount. They are also a good source of vitamin D, calcium, B12, and protein. Because they are low in the food chain, sardines are very low in contaminants, such as mercury, relative to other fish commonly eaten by humans.<br /><br />Canned sardines in supermarkets may actually be sprat (such as the "Brisling sardine") or round herrings. Fish sizes vary by species. Good quality sardines should have the head and gills removed before packing. They may also be eviscerated before packing (typically the larger varieties). If not, they should be purged of undigested or partially digested food or feces by holding the live fish in a tank long enough for them to empty their digestive systems.<br /><br />Sardines are made from any of 11 different species of fish--including herring, sild, pilchard, and sprats or brisling. Some are smaller, some are larger. Some are taken at peak maturity, some much before. And all are subject to various standards around the globe. Brisling fished from the Norwegian fjords are uniformly smaller than other species used in sardine production--just 3" to 4.5" long when fully mature. By contrast, herring taken off the coast of Portugal might average 8" to 10" in length. These larger fish are caught young, before the meat reaches peak quality, and then sectioned to fit in their cans. But remember, the smaller the fully grown fish, the more delicate and tender the sardines. The European sprat, Sprattus sprattus, also known as bristling, brisling or skipper, is a small, herring-like, marine fish. Found in European waters, it has silver grey scales and white-grey flesh. Specific seas in which the species occurs include the Irish Sea, Baltic Sea and Sea of the Hebrides. The fish is around 12% fat in its flesh and is a source of many vitamins. When used for food it can be canned, salted, fried, grilled, baked, marinated, and so on. Young sprats are commonly known as brisling. Canned sprats (usually smoked) are available in many north European countries, including the Baltic states, Scandinavia, Ireland, Germany, Poland and Russia. They are an important Latvian export. The majority of brisling sardines that are sold to the public are harvested off the coasts of Norway and Scotland. "These are from Monaco" not sure if it matters.<br /><br />I had never wanted to eat Sardines, but for health reasons I needed the protein and the omega-3.  So I started my search for one that would fit my needs.  I found these to be very good.  I did not want salt, again for health reasons.  I find the taste to be like tuna.  I think I will make sardine salad. Ok they are 10 for $19.99 ($0.45 / oz) $2.00 per can, I am very happy and will continue to buy them.

review/summary: GREAT TASTING SARDINE WITHOUT HAVING TO PICK BONES
review/text: My Dad loves sardines, but doesn't like the sharp little bones that are usually in the cans!  At one time, a local box store carried boneless sardines, but not anymore.<br />So, I went to Amazon to look for these boneless sardines. YES! I informed my Dad of the price---double the price of sardines with bones, but for him it was worth the price<br />of not having to dig through and separate those tiny boats from the fish. Furthermore, if one doesn't eat those tiny bones, a lot of what is in the can is just waste anyway.<br />So, I ordered a pack of 10 cans some months back and now my Dad was ready for more. If someone goes back for a product again, you know it's good.

If I indeed paid $25, I might be out of my mind that day.<br /><br />Yes. The product tastes good, and the can is very easy to open. I can get a lot of protein and omega-3 without a lot of sodium and calories. But a regular can of sardine is only 50 cents or even 33 cents in the grocery store. Why do I want to pay so many times more? I didn't get a raise. I need to save my $ to pay my gas bill.<br /><br />I decided to go for local brand. If I take in a bit more calorie or sodium, I'm try to eat less of other stuff. Higher fat may not be bad, because it may mean higher omega-3. And I love the bones, because they contain calcium. I do not need boneless sardine.

review/summary: First Time
review/text: This was my first experience with Pu-erh Tea, also known as the "champagne of teas." It was fairly easy to steep and produced a dark liquid, even darker than my longest brewed Ceylon tea. I found that steeping for 3 minutes allowed me to get 3 to 4 pots (about 18 oz per pot) of full flavored Pu-erh. It has an excellent earthy taste with a scent that is reminiscent of oak wood and something sweet. I have read some books about tea and watched a couple documentaries that focus on what makes good tea. Some of that literature discusses what characterizes quality Pu-erh tea and this product seems to fit the bill. It's now definitely among my favorite teas, a list that includes Darjeeling and Oolong. The only difficulty I had was breaking apart the cake, which is very hard and held together extremely firmly. I ended up sawing off pieces with a serrated knife - once I got some pieces broken off, some of it would break away and crumble more easily by hand. I expect this cake hardness is common to all Pu-erh teas since the fermentation and cake drying process is the standard for this type of tea.

review/summary: Best baby/toddler/child cereal
review/text: We have searched and searched for this cereal!  My kids have both eaten it several times a week from about 6-8 months in age and my oldest is now 4 and still adores it!  So quick and so healthy.  When they were little, I mixed it with breast milk and now just with regular cold milk.  Can be made with soy, cow's milk, almond milk - whatever your preference as it alters the flavor a little.  Its naturally sweetened with the fruit and seems to fill them up well!  We have had to search it out and special order through Whole Foods and I have regularly stalked amazon hoping to do a subscribe and save!  So thrilled to see its finally in stock!<br /><br />Apparently, I ate it as a baby too!

review/summary: Baby Familia is not just for kids
review/text: I began looking for this product from Amazon after my local WFMs stopped carrying it and I wasn't able to find it anyplace else in my home area. Many years ago, perhaps as many as 40, I used to buy and enjoy the Original Familia Swiss Muesli, based on the recipe of Doctor Bircher-Benner. A few years later, I moved to a remote location where it was difficult to find Familia for sale. When I returned to "civilization" again, I discovered that the Familia company had seemingly changed their recipe; it was no longer the same texture that I had remembered from before. It was as if they had removed the finest particles of the cereal or whatever it was that had quickly absorbed the milk, and seemed also to be a higher percentage of rolled oats. As a result, the muesli took longer to soften to the desired consistency and just didn't have the same feel in the mouth.<br /><br />When I discovered Familia Original Baby Muesli a few years ago, its blend of fine ingredients reminded  me of what was missing from the "new" Familia formulation. I quickly found that I could mix the Baby Familia with the "adult" Familia (in about a one to two proportion) and approximate what I recall as the original cereal blend. I now enjoy Familia Muesli cereal the way I remember it.<br /><br />If buying it here in quantities of six boxes at a time, I suggest storing the extra in the freezer or refrigerator.

My 11 year old son has loved this "favorite oatmeal" since he was a baby, so I ordered some for his birthday.  He was surprised and happy!  Now he's back to eating it everyday (with blueberries!).

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: I began using this when my daughter was about a year old to get a little more fiber in her diet.  I use it to make a smoothie drink, mixing 1/3 cup with milk and 1/2 container of a Gerber baby food fruit ( makes about 1 - 1 1/4 cups altogether), heat it and serve.  Well, she's now 7 and that is still her breakfast which she asks for everyday.  I panicked a few months ago when I was told the company had stopped making the product. Amazon was out so I found it from a vendor online and paid almost 3 times as much as on Amazon.  Very grateful Amazon has it now and for a reasonable price.  Who knows, I may need it til she's grown!

review/text: I am very happy to have found this cereal. There is no cooking required, I just warm up the milk. Best thing however are the ingredients which do not include sugar - just apple and banana flakes to sweeten the cereal. Just pure good ingredients. It tastes great on its own, so much so that I happily finish any leftovers. Heartier than the typical instant cereals and I honestly feel good about giving it to my child.

review/summary: Grapeseed oil is a great substitute!
review/text: I've been using grapeseed oil for more and more cooking and have been very pleased with the results. Mantova Grapeseed oil comes in glass, typical of the higher grade products and we like it very well. I have seen that this oil doesn't smoke as much when frying. I read that grapeseed oil doesn't break down at higher temperatures as does vegetable oils. The flavor is very light and smooth.

review/summary: Very nice grapeseed oil!
review/text: When exploring more vegetarian cooking, I noted in Mark Bittman's vegetarian cookbook that he recommends grapeseed oil for stir fry dishes. It was in the context of experimenting with adding tofu to our diets that I reflected upon this. One of the dishes I wanted to explore was tofu stir fry. I bought another grapeseed oil product and enjoyed its usefulness greatly. But it was in a small bottle and quickly ran out.<br /><br />Then, I purchased Mantova Grape Seed Oil. I am also very satisfied with this product. One of Grapeseed oil's great strengths is that it has a higher heating temperasture than, say, olive oil. So you don't get smoking nearly as quickly. I have been very pleased as I have used this with tofu stir fry, and I expect it to continue to perform well in the future.<br /><br />And the price is pretty friendly to boot! The first Grapeseed Oil that I bought from a local store did its job well, but it was pricier than this product.<br /><br />So, I'm a pretty happy customer!

review/summary: Works great for cold process soap...or in recipes!
review/text: I bought this grapeseed oil for making soap.  The price is right and it works great!  My soap comes out just the way I expect it to every time.  Highly recommended to those interested in making cold process soaps with lye.<br /><br />I have also started using it as a replacement for "vegetable oil" in recipes.  I don't feel comfortable using actual vegetable oil (which is usually soybean oil), and I usually substitute with olive oil...but sometimes I don't want things to taste like olive!  This grapeseed oil has a very light flavor that does not affect the taste of recipes.  I also feel good about the high smoke point; this makes it an ideal oil for use in cooking and baking.

review/text: I don't see a down-side to this product. The first ingredient is chicken, it has other stuff like carrots and blueberries further down the list, my cats eat it, and it's inexpensive!<br /><br />The food came in earlier this week, and I've already mixed it into the old food for my two cats. They don't eat around the Premium Edge pieces, which they would usually do with a new food, so I know they like it. Plus I've given them a piece or two on the sly once or twice [shhhh!].<br /><br />I'm a little mad at myself for not thinking of Amazon for my cats' needs sooner! I mean, this big bag of food, for almost half what it usually costs me locally, and delivered to my door for free! A great find!

New research has found the benefits to feeding an overweight cat a low carb, high protein diet to prevent diabetes and other cat diseases.  Most diet foods are higher carb and low protein which do not help a cat loose weight efficiently.  My cats love this food.

review/summary: Best possible quality for amazing price...
review/text: I have one tuxedo cat and one ragdoll cat, and they both go b-a-n-a-n-a-s for this food. I am going to assume that they love it because of all of the amazing ingredients- cranberries, blueberries, real meat and fish, no by-products, no fillers...potatoes, peas, carrots. This company spends more time on the quality of their product and less time trying to trick people into buying it...which is how things should be.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to find this company, and am smart enough to keep feeding it to my pets (I feed this to my dog, too). I have a limited budget so it is really, really nice to know I can feed my pets the best without having to cut costs elsewhere.

review/summary: Product Comparison - Premium wins on Ingredients, Analysis and Price!
review/text: I'm going to preface this review by saying that my kitties are not picky about food. We've made sure to expose them to a variety of dry and wet foods since they were very young, and they are usually willing to try new things. That being said, they loved this food and took to it with no problems at all. I mixed it 50/50 with their old food (a mid-range name brand), but I didn't even need to.<br /><br />I compared the ingredients and guaranteed analysis in Premium Edge to our current dry food, Purina One Hairball and also Taste of the Wild which I was considering purchasing as well. I found the ingredients in Premium Edge much better than Purina and, in my opinion, even a smidge better than Taste of the Wild. For example, PE's first 4 ingredients are: Chicken, chicken meal, peas, egg product (also a good source of protein for kitties). ToW's first 4 ingredients are: Chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat. Purina's are: Chicken, corn gluten meal, brewers rice, poultry by-product meal. No comparison there. I'd much rather feed my cats a dry food that at least has some "real" chicken in it, although chicken meal isn't as bad as some people think it is -- it's just ground up meat and other bits like bone and tissue (which they would eat in a wild or raw diet anyway!) Then there's the guaranteed analysis to consider. More protein is always better, since cats are obligate carnivores and would not eat carbs if they had their choice. PE wins with 45% protein, followed by Tow at 42% then Purina One with only 34%.<br /><br />And finally price... Price per pound based on Amazon price: Premium Edge 18 lb. bag was $1.46/lb., ToW 15 lb. bag was $2.26/lb., and Purina One was $1.59/lb. for 16 lb. bag. So again, Premium Edge came out on top. This is what I will be buying from now on, until I finally bite the bullet and move my brood to a wet food only or a full-on raw food diet.

review/summary: Purrfect For Our 2 Cat Family
review/text: Our two rescue cats are a 2 year old Torbie and an 8 year old Tuxedo. Both girls are inside kitties and get a moderate amount of exercise playing with each other and their 2 dogs. On regular dry cat food one of the cats has a tendency to 'tub' up rather quickly and the older feline's fur tends to become tangled and a tich dry with diet foods. This also leads to additional grooming and resulting hair balls.<br /><br />After surfing through likely food sites, I was impressed by Premium Edge's ingredient list, (chicken and salmon), target audience and price point in that order.  The gobbler preferring seafod blends, and the older girl loving chicken, it seemed this would be a good fit. But as any cat parent knows, the proof is in the pudding...would these 2 indivuals like it, really like it 18 pounds-worth?<br /><br />Both cats accepted this new kibble without problems...big sigh of relief there.  The formerly chunky kitty has begun to look a little more panther-like again, while in only a matter of days, the coat of our AMH tabby is soft and gleaming with less need for as much grooming. This is an added plus, as not every weight reduction formula out there will yield a nicer coat.<br /><br />Our senior girl can chew this small, firm kibble just fine, stools seem the same with the Premium Edge Dry Food and there is not as much hacking and hawking of fur balls underfoot.  ONe tip, since both cats become finicky with any dry chow that becomes 'old', with bags larger than 7 lbs, we are using a few Lock n Lock containers, with tight seals, to hold the excess, and keep at bay our pair of curious canine chowhounds.

Unfortunately, Bremmer foods bought the maker Ry Krisp and raised the price. If you go the manufacturer's website, the price is much lower than Amazon, but the shipping cost is outrageous. Sadly I now have to buy RyVita which is much more reasonable in cost.

review/text: We've been giving these treats to our dog since she was a puppy.  For five years now, when I say the magic words "Puppy 'night 'night," she wags happily, trots over to her bed, lies down, and waits for her bedtime treat.  If she wants to go to bed, or if I forget, she'll stand by the shelf where I keep them and just stare at me until I get one. She gobbles them down in about 10 seconds now, but we enjoy the ritual and it still makes me smile, so I keep ordering them.  The pet store stopped carrying them a couple of years ago, and they're less expensive on Amazon anyway, so this has been a good and reliable source.  Two furry paws up!

review/summary: Tasty treats for new pups.
review/text: These are perfect for my new puppies, they both love them and the smell really attracts them to chew. My puppies, as an earlier commentator said, 'polish them off'. A good buy.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: When my dog was a puppy, I bought this teething treats for him. He loved it. It's very soft and digests well. Only thing that I didnt' like about this is that it's little too soft and it only takes few mintues for my puppy to finish 1 steak. wish it would last little longer..

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: My puppy LOVES these!!<br />They're great if you want a long-lasting treat (20-40 mins)!<br />ALSO, these don't stain my pup's mouth (he's all white), don't crumble, and are soft to teeth/gums.<br /><br />I just wish they were a bit more healthy...

review/summary: OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS WONDERFUL
review/text: Put it on a pita with some good olive oil, put it on chicken, put it on beef.... What can I say. This stuff is AWESOME!!!! It is also good mixed with some olive oil and some homemade bread !!! Oh My. Zatar is wonderful stuff. Sometimes the American palate gets a little old I must admit. Grab a bit of the Middle East with this and you won't be disappointed. It is a wonderful combination of flavors. Since it is quite a large bag. Place it in a container in the fridge. Zatar will soon become a staple on you table. It sure has become a part of mine. From what I have read in the middle east they use Zatar at breakfast. What a way to start the day I say !!!
