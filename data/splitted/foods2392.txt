review/summary: Product does not live up to reviews
review/text: Over the last several months I have been hearing about deer antlers and I've done a lot of research and read lots of reviews before I decide to try this product. I have three black labs that have a chew product every night to help keep their teeth clean and thought this might be a way to save money and give them something new to chew on. Although the cost was kind of expensive, I felt it was worth trying.<br />I was excited to receive this product after reading all of the reviews. The deer rack was a good 7-9 inches or more long as described, had very little smell, and is very hard compared to something like rawhide or other types of bones one might buy. These antlers were more then twice the size of the ones I seen at local pet stores in the area and only about 1/3 of the price.<br />Needless to say, all three of my girls chewed on their antlers for about 10 minutes and have not looked twice at them again. I might not be surprised if my dogs were picky but I find it interesting since my girls eat anything and everything. Perhaps if your dogs have never had anything to chew on in their lifetime they might like this product. Other then that, the product is a waste of money.

review/summary: Only One?
review/text: I thought I was buying a bag full of these for $9 but there was only one 4" antler piece in the bag!  If my dog's last name was Gucci, Rockefeller, or Gates, this might make sense. But I am just an average guy so the price (including shipping) was rediculous for what I got. As they say, "fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me". Never again guys

review/summary: Bitter after taste
review/text: I am a hard core coffee lover, but have been having trouble with the caffeine so have decided to to try and find a good decaf.  I thought this might be the one but I was sorely let down.  The coffee smells pretty good but once brewed it has a very bitter slightly acidic after taste.  I even tried mixing it half and half with my other coffee but could STILL taste the bitterness.  Needless to say I have it sitting on my shelf and neither my sister nor I will be drinking it.

review/summary: Great cereal marshmallows
review/text: My son has developed a love for Lucky Charms cereal. Unfortunately that love often only includes the tasty marshmallows and the actual cereal part ends up being dropped on the floor for our "automatic vacuum" (the dog) to clean up. These seemed like a good way to ensure that our Lucky Charms cereal stays as it should. First of all, these do indeed taste very much like the marshmallows found in the cereal. They are crisp, solid-colored, and fresh tasting. Made in the US, the packages had only about a year before its "sell by" date so keep in mind to only order as much as you can use in a reasonable time. Finally, these are small 5 1/4 x 7 1/2 bags so most should be able to use them while fresh. All in all these are a great purchase for marshmallow lovers.

review/summary: almost as good as Lucky Charms marshmallows
review/text: When eaten plain, in my family's opinion, these are not quite as good as the "real" Lucky Charms marshmallows. (I am referring to the newer, multicolored marshmallows in Lucky Charms.) My teenage daughter loves the ones out of the cereal box, and was excited to try these, but doesn't care for them. I do like these pretty well, and will probably eventually finish what I bought. However based on an extremely high shipping cost and the fact that they didn't quite live up to my hopes for them, I don't think I'd buy them again. When I pour them into the cereal to have extra marshmallows, I am perfectly satisfied with them. Eaten alone, it's hard to put my finger on exactly what's different, but I think they taste a little more "freeze dried" or slightly less fresh than the ones from the box.

review/text: After opening up my last box of Lucky Charms and finding out that my daughter had eaten most of the marshmallows out of the box, I decided to try this product. I am so impressed!

review/text: As a lifelong fan of Ritz crackers, and I make no apologies for that, I like what I like, I was so happy to see these at my local grocery. I'm the kind of person that likes to rub off the excess salt from ny pretzels and crackers and the like.  I enjoy salt, just not too much,  These are perfect, they dont need "rubbing" though I find  myself doing it out of habit.  These are my default Ritz, but don't miss the honey butter and brown sugar cinnamon options if you can find them,  They're really good too.

review/summary: There is definitely an aftertaste, but better than Splenda or aspartame.
review/text: I can't stand aspartame and Splenda because of the chemical aftertaste, but I read good things about stevia and glucose tolerance (search PubMed on NIH's website for stevia), so wanted to give it a try.  I can definitely tell the difference between sugar and Truvia.  It leaves sort of a woody/licorice aftertaste in my mouth, but the taste does not linger as long as the aftertaste from Splenda.  Truvia is not nearly as unpleasant as Splenda, but I think I would prefer tea or coffee unsweetened over sweetened with Truvia.<br /><br />Just to prove that I wasn't being unconsciously biased against Truvia, I asked my husband to brew a pot of coffee, split it equally into two measuring cups, and add 2 teaspoons of sugar to one cup and 1 packet of Truvia to the other.  (In case this seems somewhat arbitrary, Truvia states that 1 packet is equal to about 2 teaspoons of sugar, in sweetness.)  I didn't want down two cups of coffee at once, so I drank several shot glasses of the differently-sweetened coffee.  After several blind taste tests, I could tell which one was Truvia and which one was sugar every time.  Also, the aftertaste seemed to get worse as the coffee cooled.<br /><br />My husband could also tell the difference between Truvia and sugar, but he didn't seem to mind the taste very much.  A friend of ours can't tell the difference between Truvia and sugar at all.  So before you spring for a box (or 6 boxes, on Amazon) of Truvia, as it is fairly expensive compared to Splenda or sugar, you should try a packet or two elsewhere first.<br /><br />As for how sweet it is compared to sugar - it seems plenty sweet to me but I usually don't put a lot of sugar in my drinks.  Some suggestions to mitigate the aftertaste are:  put it in a hot drink (and drink it while it's hot), or put it in a drink with lots of other flavors to mask it, like strong chai (I could still taste it through the chai, but it's not as bad), or use half sugar and half Truvia.

review/summary: Not the real deal.
review/text: I was delighted when I found another sweetener that seemed to be based on stevia and not aspartame or chlorine (clorinated sugar, that is, as in Splenda). But after I used up my first box, which was not the most enjoyable experience (had a bad aftertaste), I decided to boycott the stuff.<br /><br />The mix of erythritol and rebiana goes through a patented process that is controlled by the same big companies that manage aspartame. Some of it starts out with stevia but the same could be said of Splenda and sugar; the whole ends up being truly artificial in substance. Just say 'no'. Look for a stevia sweetener that consists of stevia, not some big company's invention.<br /><br />The stuff I'm using now is absolutely wonderful. It's called SweetLeaf.

review/text: I fell for the pretty box at first, and I'm glad there is a more natural alternative to aspartame and even an alternative to Splenda. But Truvia is the most expensive stevia-derived sweetener I have found, and even though Truvia claims to be made from the sweetest part of the stevia plant, Stevia Supreme is sweeter (and cheaper).

review/summary: The only sugar substitute we use
review/text: After realizing how high the calorie content was in our flavored coffee creamer, my husband convinced me to try Truvia with half and half instead.  I was a bit skeptical because I strongly dislike other artificial sweeteners and didn't think this would be much different.  To my surprise, to me it really doesn't taste that much different than sugar.  We use it in our coffee every day.  It is more expensive than other sweeteners, but buying in bulk helps with that part.  For us, it's worth it knowing we're using a sweetener that's low calorie and, most importantly, natural and not chemically-based.

review/text: I am very picky when it comes to sweeteners. I have been a loyal Sweet & Low user for many years. However, the more I read about aspertame, the more it grosses me out. I have tried Splenda but don't like the taste. I have also tried Stevia, but it made me nauseous. Truvia tastes great in and on everything! I now use it in my coffee, in my unsweetened oatmeal, and even on strawberries for a sweet treat. It's great, I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Also, buying on Amazon is the way to go - even when I can find it at the grocery store, it's over $5 a box.

At any rate, my purchase was an excellant buy, came packaged well, and was in date for three years.

Stevia can taste different and be sweeter or not as sweet depending on the company.  One might have to try several different companies, and/or compare drops to powder to packets.<br /><br />I've been using stevia for quite a long time and Truvia is the one I like the most, but I recommend buying small quantities of stevia until you find the one you like.

I usually get it at the grocery store, but it is good to see that it is available on Amazon, and now that I have Prime, I might just be getting it online instead.<br /><br />This sweetener tastes really good, and in addition to coffee, I have had it with desserts and it tastes great. I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia! However, you may be better off purchasing a larger box (300 or 400 count) instead of this pack of six ... Unless you just really like the size of the 40-count boxes. But if you have never tried it, definitely purchase a smaller box to try it out first!

review/summary: Does not live up to its claim
review/text: This sweetener claims that a single packet will provide the same sweetness as two tsps. Wrong!! After 2 packets you just barely start to taste any sweetness. I had to use 4 packets to get my desired taste which is 2 tsps of (domino's) sugar in my  tea. In addition, Stevia is supposed to be 300 times sweeter than sugar cane aka table sugar. This particular brand does not even live up to its own advertisement of a single packet having the same sweetness as two tsps.<br /><br />Btw liquid stevia is much more potent and a few drops will do it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Sweetens without affecting your blood glucose levels...(as all stevia does)<br />-The after taste is very suttle...(no licorice)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Takes too many packets to sweeten<br />-Pretty expensive

review/summary: The only truly all-natural no calorie sweetener
review/text: Now that reports are all over saying how Agave is processed and "read" by your body the same as High Fructose Corn Syrup, I've stopped using that.<br /><br />There are loads of information of artificial sweeteners, with some other countries banning them.<br /><br />Then there is Stevia.<br /><br />First, do NOT taste any Stevia product right out of the packet to judge it. Stevia is far sweeter than sugar or artificial sweeteners so it will just be "too much" pouring it in your mouth or tasting it straight.  However, on food or in coffee it's excellent.<br /><br />I would have thought there isn't much more to say on that until I recently tried Stevia in the Raw and felt it bad enough to write a comparison review.<br /><br />Do I think Truvia is too expensive? Yes. Why can't a competitor surface and charge less? I haven't yet found one.<br /><br />I thought I had but then found that Stevia in the Raw is not raw--it's mixed with Dextrose which is a form of glucose.  Then I found that a box of 50 packets of Stevia in the Raw weighs 1.75 ounces whereas a box of Truvia weighs 4.9.  This wouldn't matter except for there really isn't nearly enough Stevia in the Raw in one packet to sweeten anything. They truly gave you WAY less in every packet to make the price seem better in getting 50 packets. Put 1/4 of the amount in every packet and you have to use 4 packs of Stevia in the Raw to equal one packet of Truvia.<br /><br />Come on people...bring on a real competitor. I want better pricing but so far Truvia is the only thing I'll use. I have found other Stevia products in spoonable form but my grocery has no other ones in packets of any other brand and I prefer packets.

review/summary: Expensive as compared with pure stevia
review/text: I had the opportunity to try a packet of Truvia at a local Japanese restaurant.  I was surprised to find it on the table along with the other sweeteners considering how expensive the single serving packets are as compared with other artificial sweetener packets. Truvia tasted only mildly sweet with almost a cooling aftertaste in green tea.  Assuming you paid $8 for a .4 ounce jar of Sweet Leaf pure stevia extract powder which contains 400 servings, you would be paying 2 cents per serving - and you can find this size container here on Amazon for $7 or less per container when you buy 4 containers at one time.<br />If you buy Truvia with the price quoted here, you are spending almost 8 cents per serving - almost 4 times as much as compared with buying a small, portable container of Sweet Leaf pure stevia extract.  Truvia contains according to the packet "erythritol, rebiana and natural flavors", 3 grams of carbohydrate and 3 grams of erythritol.  It is touted as "nature's calorie-free sweetener" on the label.  If you were to compare the nutritional value of this sugar substitute with pure stevia, how would Truvia stack up? Would it be worth paying a premium price?<br />I guess that it comes down to the question - how much are you willing to pay for the convenience of single packets and for a brand name?

Having lived most of my life in the Philly suburbs, cheese steaks, hogies and Frank's Black Cherry Wishniak really bring back the memories. I retired to Florida and miss alot of the great foods, like those mentioned and snapper soup...with a touch of sherry of course. So..to youse guys, if you haven't tried it (Frank's Black Cherry) add it to your "BUCKET LIST"

review/summary: Happy Kitty
review/text: Our kitty is spoiled she gets tuna, lunch meat, wet food, dry food and once in a while a little ice cream. :) But her all time favorite thing has to be temptation treats(all flavors). She will sprint across the house when I get home, jump on the bed and wait for her treats to be delivered. We were worried she was overweight but the vet says she's in great health and a little "fluff" is to be expected on a house cat.

review/summary: Banish hairballs!
review/text: All of our cats love this product, they anticipate it actually, and meow and meow until served! We've tried other products but have had limited success and repeatedly been surprised by gooey blobs of purged hairballs.  Since using Whiskas we have not had one cat purge a hairball and I am grateful, truly. I would love it if they would come in bulk, on our first shipment, none of the zip locks on the bags worked.  This second shipment seems better but I'd still rather empty them all into a larger container than deal with the zip lock.

review/summary: Really works for hairballs!
review/text: Since we have been following the package directions that say to feed 10 treats at one time, our cat rarely throws up at all and her stools are plumper. She has always had tiny, hard stools until we started feeding her these treats. We can tell by her stool if she hasn't had a 10 treat dose in a couple of days. She eats these as readily as any other packaged treat we give her. A great find as cleaning up grassy vomit almost every day was getting quite tedious! The auto ship feature is also a big plus. We can't always get these treats here on our island when we need them. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: My Cats Love These
review/text: Specifically they love this flavor.  I've taught them to do tricks using these treats because the cats want them so much that if they can figure out what I'm asking, they do it to get the treat!  But they are smart boys.<br /><br />I don't like some other treats because they are as small as kibble.  These are big enough for me to hold between two finger tips while the cats take them.<br /><br />My cats ask for these each night around treat time.  One of my cats eats dry food almost exclusively (no canned food, no meat scraps, etc) and he is often the first to ask for these treats.

review/summary: The only treats my cat will eat
review/text: So my Mom often buys bags of kitty treats for her "grandkitten"... and I find it so hilarious that if it isnt the Temptations treats in the yellow bag, he will NOT touch them. We can mix different brands together in a pile, and he will pull the Temptations treats out with his paw and leave the others. Its unreal. Either they just hit the jackpot with the perfect cat-seducing ingredients, or they have some sort of addictive substance in them.... who knows! :) I only give them 4 stars because they are not the "healthiest" treat for a cat, but honestly... he just loves them so much I cant say no.

review/text: I can make my cats do the silliest things to get these. I like to put cardboard boxes around the living room and toss treats into them at random. The cats will leap into the boxes, gobble the treat and then leap out waiting to hear where the next one will go. It's pretty dang entertaining. They sure don't do this for anything else. Something about these treats drives the cats crazy and I love it.

review/summary: Maybe too good, cats don't want anything else!
review/text: We occasionally feed a couple stray cats as they are good at keeping the mice and snakes away. Once in awhile we will give them some of these Temptations Cat Treats and they are crazy about them! They will only eat the regular cat food if their efforts at getting more of the Temptations Treats doesn't work. One of them will sit at the door and meow and meow but eventually goes and eats the regular food. We have tried all the different varieties of Temptations Treats and they don't have a preference, they like all of them. If you want something to really great to give your cat, try any variety of the Temptations Cat Treats but be prepared for your cat to start begging for these all the time. The one thing we cannot tell is how good nutritionally these are for cats, the package says 100% nutritionally complete but not sure what that means in this case. Even if you could feed a cat these alone, that would be way too expensive so for now I will balance a few treats with regular varieties of dry cat food.

review/text: Well, here I am, buying my SECOND 12-pack of these treats.<br /><br />My Egyptian Mau is absolutely NUTS over these and has treat time pegged to two 5-minute windows of time each day.<br /><br />These are great hard-coated treats and my cat loves them like no other.  These packs are the same 3 ounce size I used to buy at the grocery store & every one has been fresh and in excellent condition.  Amazon's Subscribe & Save price is much lower than the local stores' prices.<br /><br />You know what they say:  "Dogs Have Owners.  Cats Have Staff."<br /><br />Maybe he needs his own Amazon account?  No, that would be too dangerous.  I can see a garage filled to the brim with cat toys and a house furnished with nothing but cat trees, live birds, and bowls of goldfish...<br /><br />Try these treats; you won't be disappointed (and neither will your cat, which may be most important)!

review/text: I've been buying cat treats for many years. Of the brands and types that are still on the market, I find that Whiskas Temptations is the one treat that all cats love. They come in several flavors. My cats like the Hearty Beef and Turkey flavors best. Pricing can be an issue as I have noticed continual price increases in this product for the last few years. Shop around and get them where you find the best price. Currently, the best price is about $1.35 per 3 oz. bag. But I,ve seen them at prices up to around $2 per bag.

review/summary: Cat's are fickel
review/text: My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever.

review/summary: Chester and Pumpkin both say "keepem' comin' please!
review/text: We have two cats.  One is a large black Bombay 4 years old.  The other a Teal Tabby 2 years old.  We love our kitties.  They are our family.  We tried every cat treat we could find and many large animal supply (and small) chain stores and neither Chester or Pumpkin would have anything to do with them except turn up their nose and walk away.  Then we came on "Temptations".  Now, unfortunately, they whine for them all day.  But, loving parents as we are, they usually get them.  An inexpensive and tasty treat.  They get the best food, and now thanks to "Temptation" the best treats.  All they need to get now is a JOB!

review/summary: Not for kittens less than 6 months old!
review/text: My 4 month old kitten usually eats another variety of Whiskas Temptations (Chicken Flavor Dentabites, which he LOVES!), but he's gotten into the habit of eating my hair that I've shed and that's fallen on the floor(gross, I know), so I decided to get him this hairball control variety of Whiskas Temptations.  The fine print on the package says that it should not be used on kittens less than 6 months of age.  I didn't notice this until after I bought and opened the package.  Hopefully, they'll stay fresh for another 2 months.

review/summary: Im skeptical as to what is in these things!
review/text: So my cat loves these things. She practically hisses at me at random times and jumps on the counter throws the bag on the floor and starts swatting the bag all over the house. I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.

review/summary: The name does them no justice. The cat loves these things!
review/text: I found these in a local Petco and decided to try them with my friend's cat. The cat has gone crazy for these things! I've never seen this cat walk around on two legs, try to climb my arm to get to the treat in my hand, or reach into a bag to try to get to the contents before I gave her some of these. The name is very fitting, but the real temptation is for we humans to keep giving just *one* more treat to the cat over and over again to enjoy the fun reactions.

review/summary: My cat goes bananas for Temptations
review/text: I have a very tall, lean, long-legged male cat. He doesn't eat much. I put out the finest wet food and he shows barely any interest. I buy expensive dry food to supplement his main meals. Eh, he could take or leave it. I even tried giving him high-end tuna from a can--the kind people eat--and he hardly nibbled at it. He just doesn't have much of an appetite, or so I thought. When I sprinkle a handful of these treats on a napkin, he furiously eats them all up. When I open the cabinet where I keep them, he comes running from wherever he is in the house. He seems to like all the flavors equally (chicken, beef, salmon - doesn't matter). Temptations is the only food I can count on his eating on a consistent basis. I could never train him or manipulate him with food before because nothing ever motivated him. These treats motivate him. If I need to calm him down for a brushing or a nail trimming, Temptations will work the magic. Thank you, Temptations.

review/summary: Frankenstein's Little Monsters' Treats
review/text: Of course, my cats deserve only the best so I began giving them treats to elicit a desired behavior in them.  Little did I know this would backfire and they would elicit a desired behavior in ME!<br /><br />Not only do they LOVE these (and a couple of other flavors), they have now learned when it 10pm, which is treat time and time to leave the bedroom.<br /><br />By 930pm the vultures are starting the circle me on bed while staring at me; at 945 they start to softly vocalize; by 10pm they hoist me on their little backs and carry me to the drawer where the treats live while in full complaining voice.  I obey and give them an equal number of treats in the hallway, quickly locking the bedroom door behind me. Why lock it?  We have lever type doorhandles and the male has learned to open the bedroom since "Treat Time" started, will march back in and demand more.<br /><br />Did Dr Frankenstein realized the monster he created?  YIKES!

review/summary: Does wonders for bad breath
review/text: We adopted a neighborhood cat a few months ago. She is very nice, but had horrible breath even after we started feeding her various special cat foods. Otherwise great cat, but when she would yawn in your lap, you had to fight fainting.<br /><br />We took "Dentabites" more for fun since our cat loved other whiskas tempations we tried with her, but well, thought let's try to see if it really can do anything about her breath. After about a week of giving her dentabites, we noticed her breath "improved" and after 2 weeks it was amazing. Her bad breath is almost completely gone, or gone as much as it can without brushing teeth i suppose. We didn't change anything in her diet at the time so we were pretty sure it was dentabites that did the job. Also, since then, we've been feeding her various foods but keep the dentabites snacks and bad breath hasn't returned... one more point to be sure that Dentabites really work.<br /><br />Really great product. Just a few treats a day make enormous difference. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cats love, I only like...
review/text: Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.<br /><br />HOWEVER - most Temptations are chock-full of grain fillers that cats do not need and do not eat<br />on their own if they are outside cats.  For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we'd give it a try, since they both love catnip. (Not all cats<br />respond to catnip.)  I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do.

review/summary: Hairball reducer AND soft fur all in one!
review/text: My 13 year old cat has never liked cat treats.  I have tried a variety over the years, and she wouldn't have anything to do with them.  Until I found this one.  I was really happy to finally find something to reward her, or get her to come to me when called.  These treats have petroleum in them.  My cat loves Vaseline, so it makes sense that she likes these.  I have noticed a decrease in the frequency of her throwing up.  The great surprise that I found is that her fur has become softer!  I know it must be the petroleum in these that is coating her fur as well.  I have to feed her a special cat food because she has a tendancy towards the urinary tract infection, and since I have been doing that, her fur has been more coarse and dry.  These treats have brought back the softness to her fur.  I'm sold, and I will be buying these from now one.  My very picky cat loves them!

review/text: These are truly temptations for our cats and will have them running from any side of the house.  When you open the bag, they actually smell like "french fries" (two of us confirm this) so the smell from the human side is not bad.  We have tried so many other treats but the Whiskas Temptations Chicken flavor are definitely a favorite.<br /><br />They can put weight on your cat quickly and certainly are not meant to be a diet.  But for treats, they are great and our cats really love them.  If our 5 love them, the chances are high that your cats will love them too!

They love the flavor, though after such a long time they're growing weary of the taste.

This is just one product that can help cut down on long-term dental health issues with your feline.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is that it only comes in 1 flavor; my cats want variety.

review/summary: Hairball Control Chicken Favour Treat
review/text: Each of my three cats loves this flavor of the Temptations Treats. Anytime I go into the kitchen, one or more of my cats follows me in, sits on a perch (each has his own spot so the other will not nibble from the plate of another) and waits for his/her Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treat. This makes it a lot easier to deal with a hairball problem.

review/summary: All around crowd pleaser!
review/text: Counting rescue kitties I have 13 cats that I "treat" on a daily basis and not a one turns their nose up on this particular flavor. The fact that they help with tartar control is an added bonus.

review/summary: Like a "Stuffed" Greenie for Cats
review/text: Our cats are definitely tempted by Temptations!  I was delighted to find that Temptations had come out in a "Greenie" dentable form.  All five of our kitties love them and they are like "crack" for cats.  The Whiskas Temptations line of treats are a favorite among our felines.<br /><br />Love to see my cats run around and chase these things!  Stuffed delights for them!  Cats love 'em and they are supposed to provide good dental hygiene for them.
