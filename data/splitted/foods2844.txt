review/summary: Great Pod, Great Price
review/text: We've ordered two of these boxes and I'm about to get a third.  At home, I use Illy loose grounds exclusively and do all the measuring and tamping and whatnot myself so I can feel all Barista-ey.  But in our second home, we use these pods.  They stay fresh, there's no mess, there's no fuss, and they taste great.  Get the 100% Arabica verion; it's worth the extra few bucks.

review/summary: A little piece of heaven.
review/text: For years I have been trying to simulate a truly Italian espresso or cappuccino without success.  Several packages arrived [...] just before Christmas.  My son had sent a Briel Cadiz Espresso machine, two lovely Russian china cups and a case of Espressione Classic Espresso Pods.  It was the kindest, most wonderful Christmas present I can remember.  The espresso machine excels in quality and ease of use.  The espresso is exquisite.  Each time I prepare an espresso or cappuccino I experience my son's loving kindness and a small part of the many gifts of Italy.  Heaven on Earth.

If you've ever wondered if pre-packaged espresso can taste as good as freshly ground, wonder no more. The Espressione pods are--to my palate, at least--indistinguishable from fresh ground beans. Yep, they really are that good!

review/summary: Excellent pods that I've used in my Briel espresso unit for years
review/text: Both the 100% Arabica and the Espressione Espresso are excellent for espresso drinks. Traditionally espresso, unlike good drip coffee, is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees. The taste differences are noticeable, but I don't have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.<br /><br />If you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly on the "best before" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get "expired" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso. Basically they're vacuum packed and not much is happening inside the wrapper.

review/summary: PLEASE BE AWARE - EMERGENCY STOMACH SURGERY WAS NEEDED
review/text: I have never posted a review before, but because I am such an animal lover, I couldn't help but warn any pet owners thinking of giving these treats to your babies.  I was told these treats, Texas Toothpicks, are "safer and healthier alternative to rawhide" for dogs of all ages and sizes.  My beloved dachshund, Tele, began vomitting blood this past Friday.  I rushed her to the vet, and they immediately took her for x-rays, as they assumed she must have ingested something dangerous.  There was a huge, pointed and jagged bone fragment lodged in her upper abdomen.  They feared that the bloody vomit might be due to the stomach being punctured, so they needed to do emergency surgery to remove it before it did puncture the stomach or worse.  It was also clear by the size and shape, that she would not be able to pass it naturally and safely, even if it wasn't lodged.  Luckily, Tele is recovering so far, but it has been hell for me (and her, of course), especially considering I, as a loving parent, had given her this treat.  So, after $2,000 in medical costs, the fear of almost losing my beloved Tele and 10-14 days of recovery for her, I urge you to reconsider Texas Toothpicks for your pets!<br />I have seen at least one other posting about this concern with bone fragments and their small breed dog.  I wish I'd seen it beforehand, so hopefully my posting will help.

review/summary: Dangerouse treat
review/text: Merrick's Texas Toothpicks Value Pack (6.5 oz bag)<br /><br />From the first look the cow tails are very dry and stiff, look old and are dark in color. Besides those, when my dog started chewing on it, we saw that she is spitting out these bone fragments that she can not chew on. After examining the treat, I saw that the middle part of the cow tail is just like a bone. This is a very dangerous treat for specially small dogs like Multi-poos. I usually buy cow tails from my local pet shop and have never had such problem. The middle part is spongy and easy to chew. I do not recommend this product!!

White Dog Bone claims the description means 12 texas toothpicks are in the bag. I think they are mad because when I ordered they had them listed at a significant discount and did not want to honor it. I filed a complaint with Amazon and they agreed with me.<br /><br />The product itself is great. My dogs love them. I just wish that White Dog Bone was more concerned about customer service. They were very rude and refused to even talk to me exept to say that it was "Amazon's problem."

review/summary: Keeps her teeth in great shape!
review/text: Belly loves her Texas Toothpicks! It is the one treat she never ever gets tired of. I owe it to these cow tails for keeping her teeth pearly white; the inside of the cow-tail is sort of a spongy texture and helps clean her teeth while she chews. The smell is mild and is not something I notice while she is chewing like I do with other treats. They are not oily or greasy in any way and do not soil anything if she decides she wants to chew her treat on the carpet. They are hard to find locally but I have had great luck getting them (very quickly) from this vendor.

review/summary: Great snack for teething pups! (lowfat, odor free)
review/text: My chihuahua pup loves these. I've tried them out on labradors and greyhounds as well - gone in a flash (so buy in bulk or use as occasional treats only.)<br /><br />I prefer to buy Merrick's treats over the typical brands in the pet supermarts - those are often imported from Brazil, and I don't trust those manufacturers.<br /><br />One of these lasts for my 6 lb. chihuahua pup for 2 weeks or so. One of the great things about these, is that if you offer enough inviting, organic dried animal treats like these - your pup may choose mostly to chew approved-only materials.<br /><br />The one possible downside to offering a puppy dried animal parts like this, is that my chi never would chew on a Kong after getting use to this sort of treat. He has no interest in any nylon or plastic chew, which is a bummer, because they last much longer. Oh well.

review/text: My 130-pound Anatolian shepherd LOVES Texas Toothpicks.  Every night after dinner he sits and stares at the storage bin until I get out a toothpick.  He is extremely picky about what he chews -- won't touch Nylabones or even real bones -- but as soon as I reach for one of these his tail starts wagging.  He takes it in his mouth and goes to his rug and is in doggy ecstasy until he finishes it.  As others have mentioned, these have no odor and don't make any mess on the carpet. They are a bit expensive, but this is the only chew I have found that will not give him stomach problems. I have been buying them at the pet store for a much higher price, so I am delighted to find them here at a discount.

review/text: I have (7) small to medium size dogs and I buy them a variety of treats monthly here on Amazon. I like getting them things they can chew on and that is good for their teeth so I thought these Texas Toothpicks would be perfect! Maybe these are only for larger dogs because my small/medium size dogs want nothing to do with them and they do love to chew on bones and treats but not these sticks! So this was unfortunately a waste of money for me and my furry "kids" and I thought other pet owners might have the same reaction as my dogs did. I will take them to the animal shelter because maybe there are those "bigger" dogs that might appreciate these sticks and they will not go to waste at least!

review/text: I give these to my shar-pei instead of rawhide and he enjoys them a lot. They are dehydrated cow tails, so there are little crunchy bones inside of them. If your dog tends to gobble up things quickly or if you have a smaller type dog, I would probably opt for something else. I have had no problems giving them to my dogs (I also have a Doberman) who chew them slowly though. I like these because they do not contain four, corn, or other junk typical dog treats have.

review/summary: BOTH my senior blind cocker and golden retriever puppy LOVE them!
review/text: I have a blind 9 year old Cocker Spaniel who is very VERY food-responsive and she just loves them! She can demolish one in 45 minutes or less. My newest addition, a 10 week Golden Retriever puppy, isn't as food-responsive but still loves them! Initially, I purchased them for my puppy since she is teething. I was really looking for a product that would keep her attention (something that smells and tastes good to her) and soothe her teething needs. I honestly decided on "bully sticks" after reading great things about them from the Dog Whisperer Cesar Millan's book. They are great b/c they don't smell bad (only a slight odor) but both my dogs love them. My only complaint is the price. If my dogs didn't chew them so fast, the price wouldn't be an issue. I love the product and I will continue to purchase. I am hoping I do not have any digestive issues like others have had. So far - so GREAT!

review/summary: Great alternative to Bully Sticks
review/text: We have a 12-year-old greyhound who has loved bully sticks for years. But she recently lost interest in them, we think because they are a lot of work to chew. We've been looking for something else for her and found these Texas Toothpicks. She loves them!!! She's back to chewing like she did when she was younger. The Toothpicks don't last as long (about 5-10 minutes), but this is perfect for her at this stage of her life. The main thing is that she loves them and is back to cleaning her teeth and exercising her gums and having fun doing it.

review/summary: Very nice peppery kick!
review/text: I've been eating this brand of canned roasted eel for years. This flavor is new to me. It's got a very pronounced and lingering black pepper kick that I wasn't expecting to be as strong. My scalp started to heat up. I was pleasantly surprised. It tastes like kippered fish, with a coating of sweet soy sauce. The sauce I'm not terribly fond of, but everything else about this product is very good. Made in Taiwan, no preservatives or artificial colors. One can is 236 calories, according to the label.<br /><br />It makes for an easy lunch on days I'm too lazy to cook or go outside to buy food. With a container of plain white rice and some miso soup, this makes a filling meal. It has a ring pull lid so you don't even need a can opener.

review/text: These may be the best pretzels I've ever had. They're tasty AND healthy (bonus: They're organic). Good alone or with salsa, guacamole or a non-fat dips. Or add some apple or pear slices, a dollop of yogurt or some fresh veggies for a quick and healthy at-home or on the go snack.<br /><br />I first came across them in a desperate attempt to wean myself from baked white cheddar chips. Looking for something crunchy yet non-fattening wasn't easy. You get 15 pretzel sticks at only 130 calories and no saturated or trans fats. Works for me!<br /><br />Best of all, there's 4% dietary fiber in a serving. (About 8 servings to an 8-ounce bags, so we're talking about a week's worth of healthy snacks.)<br /><br />The honey wheat flavor is great and best of all, it's a satisfying snack, too.<br /><br />If you buy in bulk, be sure to hide away those other bags and count out portions. Otherwise, it's way too easy to overeat these pretzels.

Every once in a while eating these you get a punch from the taste of sesame seeds which make these pretzel sticks that much better.

review/summary: Good pretzel, if slightly sweet.
review/text: The problem with most pretzels is that they are white-flour bombs.  Lots of carbohydrate and not much else (other than a ton of salt).  Consequently, I have been looking for a good whole-grain pretzel.  These are pretty good.  The multiple grains add a variety and depth of flavor not found in plain pretzels, and you sure don't miss the extra salt.  Although they have a crunch, they are not so hard that my wife won't eat them.  They have only three flaws.  First, they are slightly sweet.  Although it is a subtle sweetness (which I suppose some folks like), I could do without it.  Second, white flour remains the number one ingredient, notwithstanding the multiplicity of whole grains.  Third, although they are low fat, they are not fat-free.  I am not sure why the bakers find it necessary to add oil to a pretzel.  Despite these shortcomings, these are a good--and healthier--alternative to standard prtezels, and much, much healthier than most other salty snacks.

review/text: This was a great tasting organic snack food, buying it through Amazon in bulk, it costs less, stays fresh and delivered to my door. It is priced a lot better than in the stores, if you can even find it in a store! It is a good product that myself and husband enjoy. If you like pretzels want organic and are looking for a slightly salty/sweet taste, then this is one you will enjoy too!<br /> This is an edit of my review as my last shippment of this product was not very good... the pretzels in this latest shipment have an odd taste to them...sad as they were so good tasting in prior shipments...I also see that you can not get this organic Pretzel anymore as it show as unavailable, this maybe is due to the problem I am having, perhaps someone else found this odd taste that wasn't there before so<br />I'd change my rating on this product now after the problem w/ this shippment I hope they fix the problem.

review/text: Snyder did it all right. (you used to be able to get these in the big pretzel size in my grocery store, but they are no longer available where I live) The pumpernickel is delish, the onion is very faint, but distinguishible, and the salt is just enough to get you all excited, but not too much to overpower the pumpernickel. The sticks are a fun shape to munch, and if you have company that likes to dip things these are a good size for that (no double dipping). Sticks are about 3 inches long.

It's probably more the case that you are going to either love or hate this tea after the first couple of cups (give yourself a couple of cups' worth before passing judgement, so that you don't confuse surprise with dislike). You have as much chance of liking or disliking this tea as you do any other. I personally think Earl Grey has a "funkier" smell and taste to it than Lapsang, though that doesn't stop me from drinking it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and start with fresh water in a clean kettle, and a fresh tea-bag in a cup or mug. Even with a mug, my experience has been that the brew time suggested is a little long. Go with 4 rather than 5, and that might help if you are nervous that the tea is going to be especially bitter. Really, this tea, if properly made, is not bitter at all. In fact, I never add sugar or sweeteners to any tea, and Lapsang tastes slightly sweet to me on its own.<br /><br />For a supermarket tea, this is a bargain. I got a 20-count in the grocery store on a 2 for 5-buck sale, and it's hard to beat roughly 12 cents for a pour, for this quality. To give you a comparison, I'm currently curing a Yixing teapot with a premium green tea that ran 40-some dollars for the quarter-pound. Consider that this Lapsang is costing you malt-liquor prices and you may be a bit more charitable with your expectations.<br /><br />And by the way, premium lapsang souchong is out there, but based on reviews I've read on other sites, many drinkers don't find that the taste is significantly enhanced, unlike other teas, which really do tend to get progressively better as the price increases.

review/summary: Twinings Lapsang Souchong not that great
review/text: For Lapsang Souchong, Twinings' version really isn't that good. The smokey essence is very artificial smelling. There are no ingredients listed on the box or any indication as to what they have used, but it smells like "artificial smoke flavor". VERY pungent odor before even opening the box, almost intolerable when steeping. Should be a softer smoke. Not as strong on the tongue but artificial smoke scent was unbearable. Sorry Twinings. I'd say spend a few bucks more and get a looseleaf variety instead. It'll be a much more "real" Lapsang Souchong experience.

review/text: This isn't your ordinary, boring, Lipton black tea.  It has a very unique flavor and aroma--what some call campfire, but to me is more leathery.  It's smooth and intense, without being overpowering, and is probably one of my top favorite teas.<br /><br />In short, you'll either love it or hate it.<br /><br />Be prepared to store this tea in a airtight container (a zip lock seems to work fine) if storing with other teas.  If not, your stash will take on the flavor and smell of the Lapsang.  I ruined a whole box of Lady Grey that way.

review/summary: Hit me one time with that delicious bacon tea
review/text: One of the many gifts my mother gave to me was the love of a strong tea.  Normally, I'm down for the standard Irish Breakfast or similar styles; however, when I was introduced to Lapsang Souchong, it was love at first smell.  It tastes like delicious bacon.  Everyone loves bacon!  Bacon anything is good: On a bagel, around a steak, around a hot dog, by itself, and now in my tea.<br /><br />Now I am no tea snob, I drink with milk and sugar like a normal person.  I have tried many teas, and strongly dislike the earl/lady grey clones as well as anything carried by Starbucks.  This is totally different. I can and will drink 5-6 cups a day and not get tired of it (hence my need to be a complete whack-job and order 120 bags on Amazon).  Totally support all you other whack jobs out there.  And if anyone knows of another brand that makes awesome Lapsang Souchong, I am not tied to Twinings, it is just the only one I have seen.

review/summary: great tea if you know how to brew it
review/text: The reviews here are either "it's great!" or "it's terrible!".  When I tried it the first time, I was in the "it's terrible!" camp.  But that was made full strength, and I found it to be way too strong.  Since I always make tea by the quart (you can't make good tea in a tea cup; the water doesn't stay hot long enough), I decided to make the next quart with 1 bag of Lapsang and the rest (I use 6 bags to a quart; I like my tea strong) just regular black tea.  The result was great!<br /><br />Lapsang souchang has changed me from a "tea once in a while" to a "tea every day" drinker.  My dissatisfaction with almost all tea was that it lacked "body".  That is why a good cup of coffee is so satisfying, but a weak cup of tea is not.  Now that I use Lapsang as part of the mix, my tea has a robust flavor and body that I find very satisfying.<br /><br />One more thing:  add some milk in your cup to your Lapsang tea made as above.  It will mellow the smoky flavor in a nice way.<br /><br />Without Lapsang Souchang, my tea consumption would go way down.  Now I drink a quart of it a day.

review/summary: Twinings - poor choice
review/text: I'm a big fan of Lapsang Souchong tea; have been drinking it since LBJ was in office. That said, Twinings version is dreadful. The tea itself seems to be of low quality, and as one other reviewer suggested, the "smoke" seems to be out of a chemistry set, very artificial, burnt, and harsh tasting rather than a rich, smoky taste. Maybe they smoke it over discarded tires.<br /><br /> My favorite Lapsangs to date have been Wagner's loose (now out of business, apparently), and Numi's tea bags. Unfortunately, Numi discontinued their bags a while back, and for some reason, their loose tea doesn't seem the equal, which is pretty weird. Still, Numi is quite good, and far better than Twining's pathetic effort.

I may try and find another variety of Lapsang to compare against, but the Twinings is definately in your face (and pantry).<br /><br />If you want to preserve your sanity and marriage, be sure to get a ziploc freezer bag to contain your Lapsang.

review/summary: Freakin' Awesome.
review/text: The tea is excellent.  I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as Numi's "Smoky Tarry", but it came through, colors flying.  It kind of smells like your in a leather shop where someone's cooking bacon while smoking a pipe, but the taste is surprisingly smooth.  It could be drank alone by itself, but it is strong enough to add milk, if you should so choose.  I couldn't imagine it with sugar in it.  That might be disgusting.  Actually, it probably would be.  Don't put sugar in it.  Some teas were meant to be unsweetened.  Another thing worth mentioning, the flavor comes from the smoking of the leaves over bamboo slats, so after you've used the bag once, you can't really use it again, like with some stronger breakfast teas.  Overall, one of the best teas for just about any time of the day except bedtime.  Serve HOT.<br /><br />\m>_&lt;\m/

It doesn't get any better than this.  You can have that same feeling as you brew this tea in your home or office, I do, almost daily during the winter and often during late Summer nights out in the back yard in my lawn chair.  This tea is an acquired taste for most, but well worth the effort.  Give yourself several cups to get over the unusually different taste, savor the instant shift to the outdoors, and enjoy a tea that is my favorite of all time and teas!

On top of that, it arrived with lightning speed.<br /><br />For those who live in somewhat remote areas not near a lot of shopping, it makes sense to check Amazon for favorite food items that you can't find locally, and I will now be doing this more often.

review/text: Lapsang Souchong tea is generally a love-it or hate-it item. As the label indicates, it has a strong smoky flavor which comes from smoking the tea leaves with pinewood smoke as they lay on bamboo trays. As a former pipe smoker, I liken the aroma to that of the Latakia blended tobaccos. I tasted this tea variety at a party once and fell in love with it. No grocery store in my area carries it, so I am glad I can buy it on Amazon for a fair price.

It is definitely an acquired taste and if you like smoked products like smoked bacon, almonds or smoked Gouda in particular...you will get used to the unique, smokey taste of this tea.  I began drinking it by itself and then halfway through added some milk, which toned down the intense smokiness a bit.  I can't say I could drink this as easily as I do Earl Grey which I could drink all day long, but there will be days I would definitely be in the mood.  As a final note, all throughout the experience, I wanted to eat smoked almonds! ;-)

review/text: ... I'm just dropping by to pick up my "fix"!<br /><br />A lot of tea is consumed in this household, and a lot of varieties of tea. Iced tea is a staple all summer, and much of the time it's made with lapsang.  Which is delicious, cooling, and a nice change from straight black tea, green tea, English Breakfast blend, and sometimes Earl Grey.<br /><br />If I remember correctly, Taylors is also good.  But Twinings' lapsang is what's available here in the US, just not in our supermarket here in west Texas.  For those who haven't tried it, I'd also recommend Choice's Genmai cha (tea).  It's made from green tea and roasted brown rice.

review/text: I was first introduced to Lapsang Souchong by a former employer who was a translator for the US Army stationed in China. Although he brewed his tea from loose leaf, Twinings tea bags are an excellent substitute (and less expensive). This is a delicious, full-bodied tea that drips with a delicious, smokey flavor.  It is excellent for a late-afternoon pick-me-up and can be enjoyed without sweetners, lemon or cream. I suggest you buy a tea ball and a small quantity of loose leaf from a tea shop FIRST. If you enjoy this very different tea drinking experience, make the investment and purchase a six-pack of Twinings tea bags.

review/summary: A wonderful tea, but an acquired taste
review/text: When I was first introduced to Lapsang Souchong tea several years ago I have to admit I didn't like it at all. It sort of reminded me of smoked leather - hardly something you'd want to drink! But I found that if I sweetened it up quite a bit (dark brown sugar gave it a nice flavor) and added a lot of milk or cream it was actually not bad. I'm glad I didn't give up, because since then I've come to love it even more than my previous tea favorite, Earl Grey, but it did take quite a while to arrive at this point. Now that I've developed a real taste for it I sweeten it only a little and I don't add much milk, which brings out the smokey flavor more. Maybe eventually I'll take it black.<br /><br />Lapsang Souchong is a very outdoorsy tea. It reminds me of campfires and chilly weather and blowing leaves in autumn. Although it's especially great on a rainy day or in front of a fireplace on a cold night, I actually enjoy it all year long. For those of you that don't like it yet or aren't quite sure what to make of it, keep trying. Try different ways of making it - different strengths, levels of sweetness, and amounts of milk or cream. You just might make a lifelong friend!<br /><br />By the way, one reviewer mentioned that the Twinings brand of Lapsang tasted unnatural, as if they made it using artificial smoke flavor. I must heartily disagree! The Twinings tea does have a more robust smokey flavor than the other brand I tried (Taylors of Harrogate), and maybe that was interpreted as being "artificial", but in comparing the two brands I definitely like Twinings better. There's nothing artificial about it, and the richness of the smokey essence is exactly what I love so much about Twinings. If it's too rich for you maybe the Taylors would suit you better, as it's also an excellent tea. I would urge people to try both brands and make up their own minds.

Perhaps it could be compared to excellent Scotch Whiskey,in that not everyone will appreciate it, we who do find it irreplaceable in our cupboards.

I even ended up taking a prescription med for the bladder problem, which helped, but was still there (and the prescription was pretty expensive).  Through a tip from another, I found that coffee could be the real cause.  I switched to tea, and within three days, I could tell a definite difference with the bladder problem.  I stayed 100% with tea for three weeks, all being good, and then drank just ONE cup of coffee, and the bladder problem was noticeable within a couple of hours.  So, I've been on tea ever since, and have come to enjoy all sorts of the many flavors of teas.  And, by the way, I no longer need that prescription medication!<br /><br />Anyway, Lapsang Souchong tea... it's pretty good.  I had first experienced this flavor many years ago, and was fascinated by the smoky flavor.  (the tea is laid to dry over smoldering pine branches)  That tea I first tried was all natural, loose tea, in a tin can.  That loose tea was VERY strong flavored, and you either liked it or hated it.<br /><br />I happened to like it.  Now, to compare this bagged version.  It has the same scent as the loose leaf, but the flavor is NOT any where near as strong.  So for those that may have tried the loose leaf, and didn't like it, you might like this, as it is milder in flavor, yet has that nice scent while you are drinking it.<br /><br />It's a good tea, however not one I would drink every single day, which is why I give it three stars.  (certain very popular brand names, which I will not mention, but names that have been around for 50+ years, I generally rate those teas with only one star... just to give you an idea)<br /><br />Some of my 4 and 5 star teas are:  Earl Grey, Constant Comment, Chai, Jasmine, Ginger, and various assorted green teas, as well as numerous loose leaf teas.  (that should give you an idea of my taste buds)

review/text: If your taste buds are gone you may like this tea. I was determined to finish this cup of tea to the last drop but was getting nauseated. Way too smoky flavor for my taste.

review/text: I'm not sure who would like this tea. To me it tasted and smelled like burnt charcoal and it burned the back of my throat.

review/summary: I didn't think any tea could taste so grotesque...AWFUL
review/text: As a connoissuer of a wide variety of fine loose teas sold by tea specialists, I am not such a "tea snob" that I am above enjoying high-quality packaged teabags produced for the mass market. This tea, however, is the most nauseating blend I have ever sampled. I brewed as per directions, and the "stench," not the aroma, almost prevented me from tasting it, but I did. Taking one small sip proved more than enough. If a smoked side of a hog or such were to be immersed in water, and served as tea, it could not be worse than this "smokey"  blend. Even when poured down the sink, the odor left behind required some added clean-up. This was given to me as a gift; a very poor choice. I would not even donate the sealed packets to a food bank...it would be an insult.
