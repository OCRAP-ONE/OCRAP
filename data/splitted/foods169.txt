review/summary: Our dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie
review/text: I have 2 small terriers who aren't really interested in any kind of dog toys (except rawhide ones, which they choke on) but they LOVE Greenies.  I can get them to do almost anything if I mention "Greenie".  I do wish Greenies were a little harder.  The dogs polish them off so quickly that I don't think they really are helping clean the teeth very well.

review/summary: Greenies
review/text: My medium sized dog will not chew rubber bones.  So I bought greenies hoping the chewing would help keep her teeth clean.<br />she is overweight so I don't give her extra treats during the day.  Unfortunately the Greenies are not as hard as I thought, she is able to bite off and swallow the pieces within a minute or two.

review/text: Heaven forbid that I should run out of these, so I usually order more than one box at the time. My dogs are small, so I always buy the LITE Teenie Greenies. My dogs love these so much they will do anything I ask them to do just to get one. They will come to me when I call them, no matter where they are, if they think they'll get a greenie reward. I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie. I have never seen a dog yet who did not love greenies.  Even my almost toothless fourteen year old schnauzer loves her some greenies.

review/text: After reading how good Agave Nectar is for you and a number of excellent reviews, I decided to take the plunge and order Madhava's Agave Nectar Light in the 46 oz. bottles, pack of two.  Not having a clue as to how good or bad this product was going to taste, I was very nervous and wondered if I had made a wise decision or big mistake.  I couldn't wait to try it and was delightfully surprised.  In tea, it tastes sweeter than sugar.  In smoothies, it's sensational.  Even a spoonful is wonderful.  My husband loves it in his oatmeal and I like to mix it with dehydrated coconut and raw cacao nibs for a real treat.  I could not be more pleased with my discovery!

review/text: I'm so sick of ppl trying to mislead. I've lost 40lbs over the last year with a few diet changes, no working out, and agave has been one of my changes. People say it is actually bad for you and has a high GI value, always question them! I went onto the GI site, and this has a value of 10-19 (per 10grams), which is low, highs being 70+. Also, not all agave is created equal, meaning, if processed it can ruin the quality and content. So, be careful on who you purchase this from. Less processing, the better.<br /><br />10 grams of sugar has a GI of about 56.666<br />10 grams of agave has a GI of about 10-19

I actually like both of them!  I can't decide which is better.  My husband uses half sugar and half coffee - but the Agave nectar makes his coffee taste like honey with the amount he feels he has to use...so the coconut sap sugar is better for him.  I found this jug messy to use in coffee and difficult to limit the amount poured into a cup - so I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VMBF6">Wilton Set of 2 6-Ounce Mini Melting Decorating Squeeze Bottles</a> to help pour and they have worked great!

review/summary: Agave "nectar" is a scam
review/text: from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word "Agave" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as "diabetic friendly". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. Inulin is a fructose polymer and is not digestible. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to separate the inulin into fructose molecules, resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing," said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. "Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses", she told me. "Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.

review/summary: It may not be what you think it is
review/text: We purchased this syrup for making popsicles (fresh fruit and very little sweetener) some time ago based on what we now have discovered to be crap science and misleading advertising.<br /><br />We normally are very strict in our choice of foods and nutrition and are members of a group who spearheaded the research on trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils) forcing the FDA's hand for trans fat labeling.<br /><br />That group, a good source of easily understood food science, and nutrition is The Weston A. Price Foundation.  I've just completed some research on their site, and others, and discovered some disturbing facts about this so called agave nectar.  It has a quite dark history.  Type "agave" into their search engine and you'll find a number of articles/reports.  You might also try a general internet search engine and do the same.<br /><br />If you are concerned about your health, may I suggest you do this research and get the facts about this man made, very high fructose syrup?  I believe it is better to have all the information available to weigh against the agave industry's partial truths.  One article even suggests that current agave syrup labeling does not conform to FDA requirements.<br /><br />The consensus of non-vested conscientious science is that agave syrup is another bad guy.  The power of the advertising dollar is really something isn't it?<br /><br />We're going back to real maple syrup (NOT any of the "original" artificially flavored high fructose corn syrup syrups).

review/summary: basically cool and tasty (in cold and warm drinks) but...
review/text: Maybe its only my feeling, but tough this Agave Nectar tastes great, I have the feeling this isnt as sweet then the other blue agave sirups i tried. It dissolves fine in even cold drinks, but as said, I need more for a similar result then with the other Agave nectars. I will most likely fall back to the other ones.

review/summary: edges out the others taste wise
review/text: I've been using agave for a few years now and before discovering it here on Amazon I'd generally go with what was on sale locally. I've tried several brands and most are "good" but this Madhava Light works the best for me in things like white tea or coffee where you want just the *sweet* with as little added flavor to it as possible.<br /><br />This brand also tends to be easier to find locally so I can compare prices and frequently get a really good deal from the smaller to this larger size.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended!

review/summary: Best stuff ever.
review/text: I hate to rave about this stuff because I think if everyone finds out how good it is for the price, especially Subscribe and Save price) they will want to buy it and someone will want a bigger profit and so up goes the price.  This order has two jugs of nector and one of them refills a wine bottle to the top with a little left over.  I put it in the wine bottle with a pour spout and keep it by the stove for easy access and with that and the honey there is no need for sugar in the kitchen.  This light Agave Nector is really delicious and way better than the two local Florida sugar growers who are now getting into the Agave business.  Highly recommend.

review/text: A year ago, I was in search of a natural sweetner to replace pancake syrup which contained ingredients I wanted to delete from my family's diet, so I tried Madhava Organic Agave Nectar. Oh boy did I hit home!It's all natural, from a plant I'd never heard of, (agave plant). It's delicious not only on pancakes, but in teas and just about anything that requires a sweetner! My wife bake some chicken wings yesterday and she coated the wings with the agave nectar, uuummmmm! Wish I could give you guys a bite, but sorry, ALL GONE! I Highly Recommend this product! I keep 4 of the 46 ounce light jars on hand at all times!...And no, you can't borrow some from me, GET YOUR OWN!

review/text: Im addicted to this stuff since I switched from using sugar to agave.  For those not in the know, its sweeter than sugar and has a "real" sweet taste - not like sweetners or artificial sweetners that have strange aftertastes. (sorry, I tried stevia and just couldnt adapt.)  I order a few of the the 46 ounce bottles at once so I always have it on hand and dont run out.  Its easy enough to transfer the agave into smaller containers, like an old honey bear container or syrup container and that way I have some at work and some at home.  This tastes delicious, is certified organic, dissolves in hot and cold drinks (use it in your coffee - its delish!) and the company sends it very very quickly.  Im a happy customer.

review/summary: A good sweeter sugar alternative...wish it had a pump.
review/text: I would've given this 5 stars, but it is so messy without a pump or a way to pour this out without it dripping all over the place. I know picky picky, but that is the only gripe. Since buying this, I've used it in place of regular sugar for everything I can. From the morning coffee, to breakfast foods like oatmeal and even cereal (suggestion is mix with the liquid first then pour on cereal)...will try cooking at some point I think...just not sure of the sugar to agave ratio, since it is sweeter I'm assuming less sugar and less liquid but I dunno. I actually purchased this since I was going to use 1 for brewing an agave beer...tequiza anyone? LOL...not tried that yet since I've found more uses that I need to buy another set just for that purpose.

review/text: The price on this product was quite good.  I was aware before I bought it that it has more fructose than high fructose corn syrup, which I avoid like the plague because it increases one's triglycerides.  But then so does honey.  Agave nectar doesn't solidify as honey does, so it is more convenient to store and use up slowly in applications where a liquid sweetener is desirable.  I use it sparingly.

review/summary: The only agave nectar I use
review/text: Madhava Organic Agave Nectar was supposed to be an experiment for me when I purchased the first time a couple years ago. Now it is the main sweetener I use in cooking! It is a very light tasting natural sugar substitute that I keep on hand for all baking. I never have to worry about a sugar rush or dip in blood sugar when using agave nectar. It can even be used in my new favorite drink: prickly pear agave margaritas! So good! Subscribe and Save has made it easy to do so and less expensive than buying at the grocery store. Even though more natural products have become easily available I will continue to purchase from amazon since I know that it will be fresh and shipped super quick.

review/summary: great vegan honey replacement!
review/text: I got this to use in tea that I preferred to use honey in(Jasmine tea). And I gave up using honey,(being a product made by bees,and it really belongs to the bees),when I became vegan.<br /><br />I also found it,with Stevia,or xylitol(a sugar substitute that isn't like sugar,having only 5 molecules of(something),so it does not affect you body or teeth like sugar does. Stevia is a sugar-like,low calorie sugar replacement,being like sugar in that it has 6 molecules(of whatever it is that makes your body respond to it like it is sugar). But I made a good vegan chocolate syrup,that would not have been good without a modest squirt of agave nectar.<br /><br />I only used filtered water,some cocoa powder(about a quarter cup),I teaspoon(a regular teaspoon,not a measuring teaspoon) of instant coffee(I like Maxwell house and hershey's cocoa,the special dark or the regular cocoa works)...for most of the sweet taste,I used Stevia,enough to make it sweet. I don't know how much. But it had an "off"taste,and wasn't that great. I added a short squirt of agave nectar,a tablespoon,maybe a little more.but not much,and it"fixed it",and the "off"taste went away. I had it on unsweetened,partly thawed frozen strawberries. Chocolate fans I'm sure will find many uses for a basic,not high calorie,tasty chocolate syrup. With soymilk I'm sure it would make a good,vegan,chocolate milk,or hot chocolate. Or a vegan hot cocoa. Added to tofu and soymilk in a blender,vegan chocolate pudding. More ambitious cooks could probably find 101 things to do with it,if they spent an hour or two thinking of favorite recipes,I'm sure.

review/summary: Sweet
review/text: Came quickly.<br /><br />I used it for the first time in baking and it has a nice sweet flavor.  Good value especially with the free shipping.  This is the first time I've used agave so can't compare it with other brands.  I can say it was sweeter than sugar and I'll be cutting down the amount I use in recipes.  I am experimenting with cooking with sugar alternatives and I liked how this one tasted.

review/summary: Out of this world!
review/text: I was skeptical for a long time about agave nectar and finally gave in and bought this!  Wow!  Wow!  This is so yummy.  I have been baking with it following Elana's Pantry recipes and everything has turned out wonderful.  It is fantastic in salad dressings, smoothies, frostings, cupcakes, and on hot and cold cereal.  AND it is so yummy, you just want to eat it plain! I love that it has a low glycemic index.  This is definitely a new staple in my pantry..and the great price on Amazon makes that possible!

review/summary: Sweet stuff!
review/text: I have been using this agave nectar for several years.  It has a mild taste, somewhat similar to a very light honey.  It is wonderful over fresh fruit, to sweeten tea, and I have begun to bake with it.  It is an all-natural sweetener that is supposedly low glycemic.  I just know it tastes great!

review/summary: A Good Honey Substitute
review/text: I bought the "Light" Agave Nector which is a thinner consistency (and dissolves faster) than honey and is also sweeter than honey.  I use the Agave in hot tea with creamer and for me it's a better flavor than using honey.  However, for coffee I prefer the strong honey flavor against the acid though I do not mind the Agave sweetener in coffee occasionally- it's still better than the flavor of plain sugar!  In foods such as oatmeal I will continue to use the 'light' Agave nector as it does not take much to get the oatmeal sweeter (whereas it does take a fair amount of honey). Additionally, another reviewer mentioned the 'Amber' tasting good in oatmeal too. Although I have not tried Agave Nector in baked goods or desserts I'm sure it would perform well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot compare prices/brands of Agave Nector as this is my first time purchasing Agave Nector but it seems comparable to the price of honey.  Agave is it's own flavor and I have enjoyed switching between honey and Agave for coffee and tea; it's nice to have variety for variety's sake and I can see why some would prefer to continue purchasing Agave Nector as it is such a healthy sweetener. Since it takes less Agave liquid to sweeten things it's a good buy since one would have to add more honey to get things sweet enough.<br /><br />I gave Agave Nector a 5 because I can see the creative potential in baking.  Adding the nector to whipped topping and/or adding to pancakes with fruit might be good--- an application you could not have attempted with honey alone!

review/text: This agave nectar is great for so many uses, and it imparts practically no flavor of its own, just sweetness.  I add a teaspoon to my coffee every day.  I also use it heavily in baking vegan and sometimes gluten free.  Another nice feature of agave nectar is that it dissolves into cold drinks as well as hot, unlike honey and maple syrup.  I like to buy it here because it is a LOT cheaper than my local grocery store.

AGAVE NECTAR is made of 90% fructose, it is a HIGH consentrated sugar. It causes FAST WEIGHT GAIN. I'm not for sure what I am going to do with the rest of these bottles I have but I'm not putting them in my body!

review/text: The only reason I didn't give this a 5-star rating is because one of the bottles was busted when I received it.  Thankfully they were wrapped in a bubble wrap bag, but it wasn't enough to prevent the safety seal under the lid from popping loose. Judging by the condition of the box, evidently something heavy was placed on top of my package, and the pressure caused the safety seal to separate from the rim by about 1/4" inch) so I lost about 1oz. of product.<br /><br />Aside from that, I love the agave, and it's a far better deal than what I can get at a grocery store.

review/summary: Oil is comparable to others - seller is lacking
review/text: I have used Lavender Essential Oil for years and loved the idea that these were food grade.  I ordered 7 different oils about a month ago - at the time of this purchase - but have only received 5.<br /><br />First the oils: They are mostly comparable to other brands but seem a thinner and do not seem to last as long as others - I expect that is due to the food grade. The bottles do not come with droppers - this makes it difficult to use as everything with essential oils is based on drops.  Depending on how often I actually use in food - I may or may not purchase this brand of lavender again.  The price is good but if I have to buy my own dropper tops it outweighs the better price.<br /><br />The company - faerie's finest - I was okay with the delay I was informed of on two of the oils in this purchase; however, when I recently emailed them to find out when those two oils would arrive I was informed that they were supposedly mailed before the date I was told there would be a delay.  When the issue is resolved - I will update this review.  In the interim, I will not recommend the seller nor will I buy from them again.  Which is unfortunate as they have nice selection of essential oils.

review/text: Hi,<br /> Online it says 100% pure lavender oil.  I use lavender oil religously and this does not smell like other pure lavender oils I've recieved in the past. The smell is faint and it is a little more 'perfume' smelling. I did notice on the bottle it says a 100% natural oil not a 100% pure lavender oil.  Online it states that it is a 100% pure lavender oil.  I wrote them and they wrote, "Thanks. We are sorry to hear that. Your can return for refund. But this is 100% Pure lavender oil, no mixed, no chemical.".. Too return it you would have to pay shipping back plus you are out the shipping you paid to recieve it too.  All in all if you are looking for a strong lavender smell this is not it. There responce was fast so I will give them the benifit of dout, so giving 3 stars for an okay rating. Thanks

review/text: I ordered this oil from "Enchanted Wilderness...Catey13" and am not sorry that I did!  I absolutely love lavender and when I finally recieved this oil, it smelled just as I imagined or better!  The concentration is strong and just a few drops go a really long way.  I've already used it in bath salts, a body scrub, a face moisturizer, linen spray and glycerin water and the bottle is still almost completely full.  Seems like this amount could last me for years!  I use the linen spray on my bed and it really makes the whole room smell wonderful and the bed seems "fresher" for a longer time between weekly washings.  The price was very reasonable and I even received a surprise sample of some rose geranium oil and some recipes and suggested uses with my order.  Also, the bottle does not have a dropper top, but there was a pipette included which works just fine.  Looking forward to trying it in lavender shortbread cookies next.  Would definitely order this again!

review/text: The dressing came quickly and was packed carefully.  I had thought I was getting the dry powder to mix with milk and mayonaise and make my own so I was very disappointed.  I was cooking for a large group in another country and needed the powder for traveling. I thought no problem, I'll just return it but found out most food items are not returnable.  Now I have 84 tiny packages of dressing that I have no idea of how I will use. I needed to read the info more carefully and it would have been helpful if it had been specified more clearly.  The powder and ready made were all mixed together on the shopping pages.  Perhaps someone else can learn from my mistake.

review/summary: Chocolate, Chocolate, and More.
review/text: First off, I don't usual spend time to write product reviews, but I felt obligated to in this case. Despite the few negative reviews I had seen, and the low expectations that ensued, I found myself pretty pleasantly surprised when I received this gift basket earlier today.<br /><br />The packaging itself is solid. You get a dark-chocolate colored basket with just enough plastic wrapping to keep everything in pristine shape without being a hassle to open. There were no signs of re-purposed Jello boxes -- only a dense amount of straw lining the bottom to serve as a cushion. I thought it was a very nice touch.<br /><br />Now for the part that actually matters: The candy. You get a pretty well organized assortment of chocolate-themed products, varying from chocolate covered peanuts and raisins, to peanut butter cups and and marshmallow cups, and yes, there's even a few pieces of individually-wrapped dark and milk chocolate for the diehard choco-holic. This variation is well balanced so your tastebuds don't feel tired of any one particular confection.<br /><br />Of course, a couple items featured in this basket probably do have their comparable counterparts in your local grocer. But that's beside the point. You'll be hard pressed to create anything of a similar caliber yourself in terms of presentation and overall packaging.<br /><br />Executive summary: This basket was made by chocolate lovers, for chocolate lovers. I'd buy it again and most likely will when Christmas rolls around.

review/text: I read the other reviews and had to share my experience. Apparently this company has read earlier reviews and has taken corrective action. While others have said their chocolates arrived melted, my basket was actually chilled. The basket came packaged in a heavy Styrofoam container. This container is shaped similar to a regular cooler, complete with a lid. Inside this cooler was the basket, padded appropriately, with bags of "fake ice" at the bottom to keep the basket cold. I was very impressed. Indeed, this Styrofoam cooler is so nice I'm sure I will find another use for it in the future.

review/summary: Issues Resolved In Second Basket
review/text: I received this gift basket Monday which was an unseasonably warm late October day here in Colorado.  My family and I tried the chocolate covered peanuts that same evening and though delicious they were melted together in one lump!  Same experience with the chocolate coated pretzels.  The chocolate covered raisins also tasted great and fortunately had stayed intact with no ill effects from being too warm.  There's a variety of truffles, covered marshmallows, graham crackers etc included I have not yet opened or tasted.  All the  treats appear to be of very high quality though the quantities are quite small which may be a good thing for those of us watching our waistlines.  The actual basket the treats come in is a little cheap looking but I did decide to keep it to make up my own gift basket for someone in the future.  At a cost of around $40 I don't consider this item to be an exceptional value.<br />PS  I took a star off this gift basket since the more I look at it the less impressed I am.  For some strange reasons a rice krispie type bar with a bit of chocolate was placed in a box for flan, some truffles were placed in one of those single serve size cereal boxes for sugar pops and some dark chocolate pieces were in a Royal Jello box.  I don't really think I would want to give as a gift something with this odd packaging.<br />UPDATE:  ig4U contacted me and sent me another basket to review.  This second basket did NOT contain melted chocolates or strange recycled packages.  Based on the second basket I received this item would make an attractive, respectable gift for a chocolate lover.

review/summary: Not Sure How This Was Handled During Shipment - First was Prototype, Replacement is Official
review/text: This Chocolate Sampler Gift Basket arrived today, October 25, 2011.  I noticed, with delight, that one of my favorites was included....Chocolate Covered Peanuts!  When I opened the box, I expected to munch on a few.  Imagine my dismay when I discovered that everything had melted together in one BIG messy clump that was awkward to break apart!<br /><br />It appears that this shipment had been left somewhere warm, where the chocolate melted, then was placed somewhere cool where the chocolate hardened into a clump.  I haven't opened the other packages of chocolate yet so I'm not sure what I will find when it comes time to open them in subsequent days.<br /><br />Update on October 26, 2011:<br /><br />I opened the small package marked "Kenzi Confections, All Natural Chocolate Napolitans Milk Product of Belgium".  This small box was wrapped similar to a gift.  However, when I took the Kenzi wrap off, I discovered that it covered a box labeled:  "Royal Orange Gelatin"!!!!  Inside was a handful of individually wrapped milk chocolate pieces which, like the chocolate covered peanuts, had been left somewhere warm, the chocolate melted, then was placed somewhere cool, and the chocolate re-hardened.  Unfortunately, this made these chocolate pieces look unappetizedly funky!  The lack of appropriate nutritional information on this particular package was also irritating.)<br /><br />Update - Thursday, October 27, 2011:<br /><br />Opened the package marked "Kenzi Confections, All Natural Chocolate Napolitans Dark, Product of Belgium" and discovered that it actually covered a box labeled "Nestle Raisinets", which made it IMPOSSIBLE to know the appropriate nutritional information on this handful of candy.  These also had been melted and re-hardened just like the other candies which caused them to look just as funky.<br /><br />No Pun Intended but wrapping up my reviews - regarding the Kenzi Confections inside other boxes such as Goya Spanish Flan Style Custard and Kellog's Fruit Loops is off-putting.  Makes me question the viability of the Kenzi Confection Company and why they can't afford their own packaging.<br /><br />The Lindt Lindor Mint Chocolate Truffles could have been better if they had not been melted first.  The filling inside had oozed out during the melt which resulted in a messy unwrapping that was not fully anticipated.<br /><br />The last, large, box looks suspiciously like a Kenzi Confection product because of the way it is "wrapped" with a label stating:  "Life is Like a Box of Chocolates", a well-known quote from the film "Forrest Gump".  As of this writing, on October 30, 2011, I am about to open it to see what damage has been delivered.<br /><br />Update = Wednesday, November 30, 2011<br /><br />This evening, I received the official gift basket with a note that what I previously received was a prototype that should never have been released to the general public.  This official gift basket looks better than what I got about a month ago.  The chocolate covered peanuts are MUCH better this time around!  I'll still need to check the rest of the candies in the coming days.<br /><br />Update = Tuesday,December 6, 2011<br /><br />I've been sampling the new basket that I received and have been enjoying the chocolates this time around.  I have two more boxes left to taste, within the basket, and I'm looking forward to that.<br /><br />Update = Wednesday, December 7, 2011<br /><br />The final box I sampled was labeled:  "Life is Like a Box of Chocolate", like the line from the movie "Forrest Gump".  This box included candies such as salted(?!?) caramel, chocolate covered pretzel, chocolate covered graham cracker, chocolate marshmallow cups, chocolate peanut butter cups, and small biscuit/cookies with chocolate on the bottom.<br /><br />Others might like these.  The marshmallow cups didn't impress me much as I'm not into that kind of candy.  The salted caramel I didn't care for much either as I don't like the taste of salt to begin with.

review/text: My wife absolutely loved the basket. She is a chocolate fanatic and thought the variety of delicacies in this collection were fantastic. The truffles and chocolate chip marshmallow crispie bar were here favorites. I would highly recommend this as a gift and thought it gave great value for the price.
