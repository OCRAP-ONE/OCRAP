review/text: These cookies may be "wheat free", but they are made from Barley Flour which is NOT acceptable for Celiac folks on a gluten free diet.  They came up on my Gluten Free Cookie search and I almost ordered them before reading the ingredients. Please note that I have not tried the cookies since they are not gluten free; therefore my rating is not indicative of the taste or quality of this product  - the site would not let me post this without giving a rating so I just chose the middle of the scale rating.

review/text: I've been eating these for a couple of years now as they used to sell them in an organic supermarket I worked near.  They're extremely tasty and way better for you than most other cookies.  You would never know it was a healthier choice.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not replacing your veggies for the day or anything but it's definitely a smart snack choice when you're craving sweet... and the kind of snack you get hooked on!  It's also a great option for kids and even comes in snack packs for their lunches!

review/text: So far we have tried vanilla, oatmeal and chocolate chip varieties of Barbara's Snackimals and like all of them.  Ingredients are quite good and per bag price is very reasonable--even more so on auto-delivery.  Large 2+ ounce single servings are quite satisfying when you want something slightly sweet and crunchy with only 120 calories and modest fat content. The only change we have made to our auto-delivery schedule is to have them shipped more frequently.

review/summary: Flavor Not What I Was Expecting
review/text: I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.

review/text: not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.

review/text: I'm giving this syrup four stars rather than five because I have tasted slightly better raspberry syrup.  Unfortunately, that syrup was made for our local grocery chain (Wegmans) and it has been discontinued.  After much looking and trying different brands, the Torani wins the contest as the best available.  The price via Amazon isn't bad either.  Put a shot of this in your iced tea and enjoy.  I look forward to summers so I can have my raspberry iced tea.  Good stuff!  We always make sure we have a bottle on the shelf.  For a real treat drizzle some over vanilla ice cream.

review/summary: Toraini syrup is great for flavored teas
review/text: I love iced tea. I was given iced tea in my bottle as a baby. My mom and Granny always used Lipton loose leaf. As an adult I started short cutting with tea bags and they were OK.  Years ago I started buying Snapple bottled tea with Raspberry, Lemon, or Peach flavors. They are a delicious change but a bit expensive. I moved and Snapple is not available here. So I started buying powdered flavored instant teas. Nasty! I was on a mission if Snapple could do it, so could I.<br />I wanted the great flavor of home brewed tea and I sometimes want it to be flavored. I bought a Mr Coffee Iced Tea Maker for the ease of use. I bought Loose leaf Lipton tea because that is what I was weaned on. 1 bought the 4 cup paper coffee filters as they fit the tea maker perfectly. I've tried several products and Torani Syrups are the best and reasonably priced. I now make great flavored tea that is as good, if not better, than any I've ever bought anywhere.<br />I use the Tea Maker now according to Mr Coffee instructions using � cup Lipton loose leaf tea. I use � cup of sugar and � cup of Torani Raspberry or Peach syrup. Oh Baby! Great tea! I wonder how the blackberry syrup would taste.<br />BTW I bought it with super saver shipping and it arrived quickly. Great Job Amazon!

review/text: I like Torani syrups generally, but the Raspberry flavor was a miss for us. The taste isn't quite right, it has a vaguely chemical finish and lacks sweetness. I use Torani syrups to flavor seltzer, so it might be better if it's used in larger amounts. Some of the other syrups just take a splash to flavor the drink, Raspberry didn't taste right at the same ratio. Maybe better as an accent flavor.

For a gallon of tea, I use 1/2 cup per gallon and that produces the same flavor offered by Sonic Drive-Ins.  Yes, we can make our own now & don't have to wait for the happy hour prices.

review/text: Working in a coffee shop on a college campus, people have a lot of complaints about the products we use, however, the one product people never seem to complain about is our flavoring.  I recommend Torani brand syrup to anybody wanting to add flavor to their drinks.  When I say drinks, I mean all drinks.  Coffee, Soda (these work great when making Italian Sodas), Tea, anything.  Torani makes an excellent product.  The one thing I would say to somebody buying for the first time would be to play around with measurements.  It's very easy to go overboard with the flavor.  It's also easy to put too little flavor.  It's always embarrassing to have somebody come back to the counter because their drink didn't have enough flavor.

review/text: We bought this when the local Starbucks was too low on the raspberry syrup we put in our morning coffee to sell us a bottle, hoping after reading reviews of raspberry syrups availabe from Amazon that this would be a good substitute.  The only members of our household who seem to like it are the ants that appeared to cluster around the top, which cracked when we opened the first bottle.  We bought a pack of 3 bottles - not sure what we'll do with the other two, but we find the bottles of syrup we buy from Starbucks to have a much stronger and slightly sweeter raspberry flavor.  There's no comparison.

review/text: This is the perfect afternoon cup  of coffee.<br />I'd rate it - in K-Cup strengths (which I regard as stronger than the usual grocery store can brewed coffees) as "medium".  And since all other K-cups are all-or-nothing when it comes to caffeine, this one hits the middle.

review/summary: Yay!  An alternative to (high-sodium) baking soda!
review/text: I'm relegated to eating low-sodium for the rest of my earth-bound life, so most baked goods were either severely limited or totally off-limits.  But not any more!  This product has re-opened the door to a plethora of baked goodies.  Be sure to pay attention to the instructions and double (at least) the amount of product you use in recipes.  If the recipe says use a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, use at least 1 teaspoon of this substitute, maybe even a bit more. And, like some of the other reviews point out, because this product starts working RIGHT AWAY as soon as it's wet, add it last ... i.e., just before putting your recipes in the oven.<br /><br />Other folks have complained about the price and the fact that you have to use more.  My response: I don't mind. I'm thrilled that this product exists and allows me to eat foods that were previously on the "do no eat" list.<br /><br />Is there a taste different?  Very slight / hardly noticeable.  Do I mind?  No. I'm just glad to have something that gives me more options.  The mere fact that this product (a) exists and (b) actually works means I give it five stars.

review/text: Sometimes you're just not in the mood for the oily, burnt flavor of many dark roasts. This blend is the antidote.  Fresh, fragrant, foamy, just right. Drink a potful...no acid stomach. Stick with the Breakfast Blend beans, tho, for best experience. The ground is not as flavorful. Also, the Bed and Breakfast blend is farther down the roasting spectrum toward espresso.

And it has a nice mild chocolate flavor and smell. By it's self, it does have an after taste, that is not pleasant. But, I Mix it with Millstone Breakfast Blend Whole Bean Coffee to give it more of a real Coffee Flavour. The natural Oils in the Millstone Breakfast Blend Whole Bean Coffee, makes them both taste pretty good together, to me. It usually arrives in between 1 to 2 weeks on Free Super Saver Shipping. Which is slow, but bearable to get the Free Shipping. If I had to pay shipping, then the Coffee would cost too much to buy.

review/text: Delicious decaf tea! Don't know how Good Earth did it, but they created a masterpiece in this tea. And one GREAT bonus: it doesn't stain your teeth like black tea and even green tea do.<br /><br />I wish Amazon would offer this decaf version through Subscribe & Save, to bring its price down. Amazon sells very few decaf white teas, and this may be the only *flavored* decaf white tea on Amazon. Why does it have to cost so much more than the caffeinated version of the same tea?<br /><br />I love tea; our family owns and drinks many kinds. However, this is my favorite decaf white tea. Its flavor is delicate yet refreshing.<br /><br />I bought mine at a local grocer and am so disappointed that they don't carry it any more. I haven't been able to find it lately at *any* stores. It's one of the few teas I'm willing to purchase by the case.

review/summary: Great decaf option for green tea lovers!
review/text: I recently had to stop drinking caffeinated beverages because they were making me jittery. My favorite reasonably priced green tea was Yamamotoyama green tea. I loved that tea because it tasted clean and refreshing, and it had a great color to it.<br /><br />I kept searching around for a decaf option and found this on sale at the grocery store. I did not like this tea at first--since it was different. The color is certainly not as pleasing to the eye (it's not such a bright green). However, it has really grown on me. It has a hint of lemon grass too, which took some getting used to. However, now I drink it all day long at the office.<br /><br />And the best thing is, this tea doesn't bother my acid reflux or give me heartburn. Sometimes, teas can also make me feel a little nauseated sometimes. However, this one is gentle on my stomach as well. A great product.

Overall, I think it is OK but I need to get used to it and experiment with different recipes.

review/summary: Simply Delish!!
review/text: I tried this sauce on a whim, when I saw it in Whole Foods Market. It had a local label and I'm all 'gung ho' for trying out products made locally. I wasn't sure what to expect so I tasted a little bit before mixing it with my other ingredients, and was initially surprised that it truly tasted like its name as well as very authentic. But boy was I surprised after I used this with a stuffed shells recipe and really tasted the flavors! The flavoring of the herbs in the sauce were simply robust and just delicious, complimenting my other ingredients extremely well. I vowed never to buy commercial pasta sauces ever again, but this certainly changed my mind. This is very close to making a sauce from scratch, in my opinion. If you're skeptical, I would suggest buying a jar from your local health food store before buying in bulk...you won't regret it!

review/summary: Good Intro to Brand and Product Line
review/text: Great sampler packet. I have tried other brands of ready to eat Indian foods such as Jyoti and Tasty Bite. This brand compares favorably and I do plan on buying this exact product again. It is not overly hot but is spicey - so while it may be a bit much for some children, adults should do fine.<br /><br />As these types of vegetarian items (or near veggie since some of the sampler includes paneer cheese which is like cubes of tofu but with a cheesy taste), are highly pureed in texture, except when there are beans, they can be used as sauces over rice, shell pasta, quinoa, couscous, polenta, potatoes, etc.  The bean ones could be heated and used in lieu of soup or chili for lunch with a crusty french bread for instance. Would pair great with a fresh salad.<br /><br />Product is excellent for those looking for all those great spices like cumin, curry, tumeric, peppers, and the like. Also qualifies as a whole food.<br /><br />Highly portable since packaged in tear away foil packets which are light weight and could be eaten out of them in a pinch if don't mind your fingers getting a bit messy reaching in and out of the foil to spoon out the food. I don't recommend trying to eat with a fork as even the bean ones are in sauces. Foil packages are not for the microwave but product eats fine at room temperature. Great for camping, picnics, road trips, etc.

These dishes smell wonderful and complex as they heat up. If you can keep some frozen nan (or even pita) on hand to heat up in the oven, your guests will rave. (even the non-vegetarians!)

The Kitchens of India flavours and spices are much more tantalizing in equivalent entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />The only problem I previously had with Kitchens of India is we'd order one variety at a time and before the family finished them we'd be ready to move onto another. Not a problem now! We order these variety packs for quick meals on the go and never get sick of them (although the wife doesn't like the spinach one and says it looks like a poopy diaper... but more for me!).

review/summary: no substitute for authentic indian cuisine
review/text: i subscribed happily but was very disappointed. I'm from South Asia so I'm familiar with this kind of food.<br /><br /> Dal Bukara - Black Lentil Curry : this was alright. I had to put more spices to make it better<br /> Palak Paneer- Spinach w/Cottage Cheese: alright; not too special<br /> Rajma Masala - Red Kidney Bean Curry : I didn't enjoy this and ended throwing it away<br /> Navratan Korma - Mixed Vegetable & Cottage Cheese Curry; I couldn't eat more than a few bites. it smelled really bad and tasted WORSE. all i tasted was cumin.<br />pav Bhaji - Mashed Vegetable Curry:<br />Pindi Chana-Chick Pea Curry: this was the ONLY packet I actually enjoyed from the 6 but not enough to make me buy this brand again<br /><br />all i tasted for most of the 6 products was cumin and more cumin. if you've never tried indian cuisine before; I wouldn't advise you to have your first impression from here.

review/text: My husband is a huge fan of Indian food...  me, not so much.  The dishes in this variety pack are *YUM*!!!  After a long day, whip up a little jasmine rice, and heat a pack up.  Voila!  I quick, tasty meal for 2.  You will likely want a side dish, if you require a large portion.  I originally bought these on sale, but will purchase more, whether they are on sale or not.

review/summary: Tasty but very fatty
review/text: I fear that these spicy convenience foods are too high in fat to eat often. They taste well enough and will satisfy a craving for Indian food if you live far from a good source. Not really as good as "the real thing", but fairly yummy. There is a very high  ratio of calories from fat to total calories on some flavors. As well as being to plentiful, I think the fats are saturated or hydrogenated and not well tolerated by my system. I tried the sampler pack and had some facial breakouts! I will probably not buy more, dispite my love for spicy foods. I think I'll try an Indian cookbook.

review/text: We've only tried 3 of the 6 flavors so far, but all have been VERY tasty (definitely on the spicy side, but that is what you want from Indian food) you can literally heat and eat, but my husband and I prefer a little more substance - so we added 1/2 a pound of cooked chicken and served it over rice - WONDERFUL!!! We enjoyed them so much we ordered 4 more sets before the discount code I had expired. If you are going to try just one the Mixed Vegetable Curry is Fabulous!

review/summary: 3 YUMS + 3 UMMMMS?? = 3 STARS
review/text: This is a hard review to write based off the fact that every pack is different and has a different taste and different good / bad things about each.<br /><br />I bought this package so that I can try them out and see which ones I liked.<br /><br />I gave this product 3 stars because I liked 3 of them a lot and the other 2 were OK, and 1 of them was just straight up UN UH!<br /><br />So...for the most part, I am 98.9999% vegan. But on occasion I will have some cheese, butter, and milk here and there if they are included in something that I did not make myself. That being said, when I am 'bad' I want it to be GOOD! However...I honestly like the taste of the ones without the dairy products so much better.<br /><br />And I am Italian, so I definitely used to have a special place in my heart for cheese, but the cottage cheese ones were kinda off.<br /><br />The mashed vegetable one (which contains butter) was just ok.<br /><br />So to review, in order...best to least:<br /><br />Rajma Masala - Red Kidney Bean Curry<br />Pindi Chana-Chick Pea Cu<br />Dal Bukara - Black Lentil Curry<br />Navratan Korma - Mixed Vegetable & Cottage Cheese Curry<br />Jpav Bhaji - Mashed Vegetable Curry<br /><br />Notice I didn't place Palak Paneer- Spinach w/Cottage Cheese on the list?? That's because it was NASTY! Definitely didn't like this one. I mean, It wasnt so bad that I threw it away. I still ate it, but I wont ever buy the Spinach one again.<br /><br />Don't let me sway your decision to buy Kitchens of India products though. The ones I did like tasted better than most Indian restaurants I have been to. And I've been to quite a few. Not to mention it is much cheaper than going out to a restaurant by far!<br /><br />And if you live on the north eastern USA and have a Wegmans near you, they just started making different kinda of packaged Naan breads which are also very good (they are not vegan though sadly).<br /><br />I've ordered a 6 pack of the Kidney Bean curry, lentil curry, and chick pea curry because I liked them so much. And thankfully out of the 6 choices in this multi pack, the 3 that I like the best have the lowest amount of fat and sodium, which seem to be very high in all of Kitchens of India products. Especially the Sodium. So be careful, and eat them in moderation as I do.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/text: Hi. Been eating these for about a year or two now and absolutely love them. Simple as that.If your new to Indian food, this stuff is fairly authentic and very tasty for a prepackaged meal. stick it in the microwave for about 60-65 seconds and your done. i suggest putting some rice on the side and perhaps some naan bread and you are all set. my only warning to newbies is the pindi chana is considered "very spicy" (I am used to it so it has no effect on me by now). All the other dishes are simply very tasty.<br /><br />One thing i want to point out is, the salt content in almost all indian food is super high so if you have high blood pressure this is not for you.<br /><br />I only eat about one package a week due to the high salt content but would indulge more if they offered a lower sodium version.<br /><br />Thanks to Kitchens Of India (the other companies such as tasty bite are ok, but nothing compared to this company)!<br /><br />Ps. they are hard to find in most supermarkets and now that i discovered amazon carries them.... well that's the end of that search!

review/text: I like Indian food, and have bought other brands of packaged Indian food before. In comparison, these taste extremely salty - to me, the Biryani was so salty as to be inedible unless mixed with yogurt. I'll finish up what I bought (this pack plus a couple of others that sounded good) but I won't buy this brand again.

review/summary: Mmmmm, Tastey
review/text: Well, I'm not much of a cook, especially Indian food and the sheer amount of spices I would be wasting trying to make any of these outstrips the cost of purchasing these meals.  I tried to make Palak Paneer before, and it didn't work out.  So until I can get in that Indian Cooking class, I resort to pre-made or take out for a fix.<br /><br />All of the varieties in this pack are good.  Some are better than others, the only one that is lack luster is the Palak Paneer.  The down side to these is that they contain a lot of your daily salt intake.  The upside is that they don't have to be refrigerated, you get a good variety and they are fast to make.  If you pre-cook some rice, you can just put some in a bowl, pour the contents of the pouch on top and pop in the microwave for a minute or so and you're read to eat.  And with fresh cooked rice, just dump it on, the heat from the rice will warm it up.<br /><br />Warning:  Besides the Palak Paneer, I would characterize these a fairly spicy for Western gullets.  If you suffer from anything thing that precludes spicy foods, I'd stay away, most of this is probably nothing you want to deal with.<br /><br />I'm actually not ordering this anymore because I have tried to cook more myself and these were making it too easy to just say screw it.<br /><br />Dal Bukara - Black Lentil Curry - this is good, not much of a lentil fan until I had this.<br />Palak Paneer- Spinach w/Cottage Cheese - just so-so, cheese is not consistent, no real mph to it.<br />Rajma Masala - Red Kidney Bean Curry - I do not like kidney beans, but I love this, this one is a little spicy.<br />Navratan Korma - Mixed Vegetable & Cottage Cheese Curry - Good, again, the cheese is not great, but better than the Palak<br />Jpav Bhaji - Mashed Vegetable Curry, - super good, spicy.<br />Pindi Chana-Chick Pea Curry - I love this one with the chickpeas.<br /><br />The kidney beans and the chick peas really reminded me of chili.  You could put them over fritos and you wouldn't be disappointed.<br /><br />For fast, easy Indian dish from your pantry, you could do worse than this product.

review/summary: Kitchens Of India Dinners
review/text: The product arrived promptly - I had not expected to receive it so quickly.  {A definite Plus}  Thus far, we have tried two items;  Saag Paneer, and a Dal dish.  The dal was tasty and the spices were not too strong. We also tried out the Saag Paneer.  The flavor was perfect, however I only found 1 piece of the cheese.  Served with rice, the meal was filling and satisfying.  Husband used some chicken to round out his meal.  This will be a definite Meatless Monday menu for me.  I'll have to get some onion naan from our local Indian grocer.  Hubby can augment one of the dishes with a protein of his choice.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to enjoying the other meals very soon!<br />I recommend these dishes to non- vegetarians [like me!]

review/text: I love Indian food; and I am a vegetarian. I don't own a microwave and I spend a lot of time on foot with a backpack. So, these prepared dishes are really perfect for me. I can carry a pouch or two in my pack so I have a delicious, vegetarian meal that I can cook anyplace I have hot water or a burner or fire. I find them a little bit magical, actually. No need to keep them in a fridge; no need to have a can opener. These can even be cooked in the pouch they come in, so I would imagine it's even possible to just leave them in a very hot, sunny place for a while and be OK. Delicious food. Amazingly convenient and affordable. Thanks!

review/text: I am an avid cook and therefore have become picky overtime because I can taste the difference when something is a quality product or not.  I was skeptical when my husband ordered these but they were so inexpensive that I figured "why not?"  They are surprisingly delicious!  I love Indian food and these have made it so easy to make a quick, filling meal.  Cook up some basmati rice or naan to pair with one of the packages and you have an easy, cheap meal for two.  Some of the food combinations sounded bizarre to me, but they are all really tasty.  Also, when we ordered, each individual package came with a CD of Indian music which I thought was hysterical, but in an endearing way.  Maybe it aids with you digestion?  They're fun in any case.<br /><br />These would be a great idea for emergency food storage and were a lifesaver when our kitchen was being redone and the only appliance I had access to was my microwave.

review/summary: Great Variety, Convenient and Kosher too!
review/text: Tasty, very convenient, especially if you don't live near an Indian restaurant (closest one to me is just over an hour's drive away) These packets are way easier and cheaper than takeout. Easy to microwave, but cover it very well, it likes to splatter. I do a paper towel *and* a paper plate on top of the bowl. Trust me, it's messy if you don't. You'll probably want some rice or naan to go with it, as there is a lot of sauce. Also, if you're concerned about portions, you'll want to know that the packet is more than one official serving, but it is so good that I usually have it all for one meal. The spinach paneer is just a bit less flavorful and spicy than the other dishes, but if you're in the mood for something a little more toned down, it's perfect. It was fun to go through the different kinds and flavors to see which ones I like the best. They're Kosher too, and some of them even look ok for Pesach, based on the ingredients list (and your own practices) Sounds like a lot of details, and a bit more prep than some nuke and go meals but it so worth it. Yum.

review/text: We really like Indian food and find most "Kitchens of India" dishes fairly authentic tasting. The meals in this "Variety Pack" are all good and range from fairly mild to very spicy, which provides something for everyone in my family since we all have different tolerances for spicy foods.<br /><br />These are very easy to make using the microwave method and just involve opening the foil packet, dumping the contents into a microwave safe bowl, cooking for about 1 - 2 minutes, stirring, and serving. My only real issue with these is that most of the packet say they contains 2.5 servings but it is closer to 2 for my family. These make an excellent main course or side dish for an Indian themed dinner and they make for an enjoyable snack as well.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I first discovered these several years ago on a trip to San Francisco, at the Rainbow Market. They are not only vegetarian and gluten-free, they have no preservatives. However, while authentic tasting, they are not quite spicy enough for me.<br />After my young son decided to become a vegetarian, I started ordering this variety pack on a regular basis. Even though the price each is the same as it is in my local store, I can never find all six flavors at the same store at the same time, so it is worth it to order it this way. I serve these over basmati rice, and it's more than enough to feed two people.

review/text: I am a vegetarian and a fan of indian food, so I decided to try this sample pack of Kitchens of India food products. I find it difficult to come across a deal that involves all vegetarian friendly foods, and so I purchased this when it was in the Daily Deals section. The vegetable curry was the best of the six, and I got them for a decent price, so I am happy with my purchase.

review/text: The food packets are easy to fix and very quick.My wife finds them a little spicy(hot). Eat them with more rice to tone down the heat.

review/summary: Good deal, good food, no preservatives
review/text: It's good Indian food for a good price.<br /><br />I get these at World Market when I visit the city for 4 to 5 dollars each. So Amazon's price is good. But I have flavors that I love and others that I don't. So getting all 6 might not be good for you if you don't like all of the different recipies.<br /><br />If you want to try some preservative-free Indian food, this isn't a bad way to start. But it's not restaurant or true home-made quality.<br /><br />You'll want to make it with Basmati Rice to get the best taste and intended texture.<br /><br />Here's a link for good basmati:  http://www.amazon.com/Himalayan-Pride-Basmati-Rice-Pound/dp/B002CSMDLM/

review/text: I bought these when they were the gold box deal, and I am so glad that I did.  I have made 2 of these so far, and they are soooo good.  My husband is a believer that if there is no meat, its not a meal, so I just take some chicken breast and sprinkle it with adobo and serve it along with the packet of food, and some basmati rice.  Its nice to have Indian food at home, this is so much cheaper than take out, and cheaper than having to buy all the seasonings and making it yourself.  I am very happy with my purchase.
