review/summary: Good Licorice
review/text: I ordered Kookabura Licorice which I had never tried before and found it quite good.  Australian licorice is probably the best in the world, in my opinion.  The service with this company was excellent.  They should try to carry "Black Opal"licorice which is also an Australian brand and is even better than the Kookabura.

review/summary: A True Find!
review/text: This stuff is truly amazing...very tasty, indeed! The corned beef was tender and good flavored, without being too salty. The potatoes were billed as reconstituted, but I couldn't tell. Overall, the hash was quite light in texture, as advertised. I'm assuming that half a can is a serving...they're not saying. The stats in grams are pretty darned impressive: 3 saturated fat, 6 fiber, 15 protein, and 5 sugar. Try throwing a can of this hash into a large cast-iron skillet, add some diced pickled beets and yellow onion, and stir-fry with a ration of butter. Congrats, you've now made a fairly respectable "red-flannel hash"!

review/text: I find this a tasty product, as is the original non-reduced fat.  It still has a lot of fat, if that's your issue.

review/text: When I opened the first can, I could smell beef. Cooking this product was a pleasure. Unlike other canned corned beef hashes, it did not melt into a pool of greasy slime when heated. It browns nicely and tastes the way I remember from my childhood. I can even slice it and cook patties. Easily the best commercial hash I've had in 30 years.

review/text: Can corned beef for breakfast is a passion of mine since childhood.  I used to spend a lot of time with relatives who lived on the coast with frequent power outages.  Thus, canned items were often used and we had canned corn beef almost every Saturday.  The reduced fat line has all the flavor of the original, and more healthy for you.  I usually broil it crisp, and scramble a egg.  Then top with some BBQ sauce.....overall a very good item.

Two of them were severely so and had to be thrown away.<br />The shipping box was undamaged so I have to assume the problem arose when the cans were originally wrapped.  Frankly the price through Amazon is not so good that one can afford to throw product away.<br /><br />Please understand the 5 star rating is for the hash quality only.

review/text: We have to watch our cholesterol, but once in a while, a good hash and eggs breakfast is needed!  I tried this kind of half-hearted, thinking it just wouldn't be as good as the 'full' recipe.  I was wrong!  I've been buying only the reduced fat version since, but it isn't easy to find in the stores!  I was very happy to find it available here, the price is comparable to what I paid in the store, delivery was fast and fine!<br /><br />We actually prefer the 'reduced fat' version of this tasty hash.  It does not become greasy as it cooks, and it still fries up with that crispy crust in my non stick skillet.<br /><br />Don't let the 'reduced fat' label scare you away - this is a delicious product!

review/text: I've purchased this product for years.  Due to some physical limitations, there are days when I just can't mess with meal preparation.  The reduced fat product is still tasty- and I actually like the flavor better, as it's not greasy. The protein content is very important, and with 21 grams per serving, this makes for the base of a decent meal.  A side vegetable, and I'm good to go, and don't end up with a lot of pain from repetitive motion.  If you like canned hash, this is a good bet !!

Yes, it's true, the potatoes probably outnumber the beefies, but that's inconsequential if you add a slew of healthy veggies while stir-frying this wonderfully non greasy hash to the crispness of your choice.  It's also receptive to a variety of toppings or sauces which fancy it up as well.  I don't know why Hormel even makes the full-fat version anymore when this stuff performs so well!

review/summary: Horrible packing\shipping, good low fat CBH
review/text: I just bought his item off Amazon. The shipment came very fast, but some of the cans were dented. They packed it very poorly, they literally jut put it in a cardboard box along with a case of another canned food item. There was nothing but a couple of those air-filled bags in there with the 2 cases. They both got banged around pretty good before delivery. Both cases had several dented cans from the shipping, so a very bad score from Amazon for packaging by people that don't care.<br /><br />As for the CBH itself, I personally found the low-fat version too low in fat! It didn't render any fat when I cooked it in a non-stick frying pan. I had to add oil to keep it from sticking which defeats the purpose of the non-fat feature. Even so, it still came out pretty dry tasting, it didn't have that rich smooth taste that a little more fat will provide. Even without the normal amount of fat, this product still tasted fine.<br /><br />I can't really say this is a complaint about the product. After all, I knowingly ordered a low-fat version of the product to try it out and put in the disaster prep stockpile. I just want to let people know that this is a good product, but it will not cook or taste like regular CBH will. It is dryer and less flavorful. But, it does have less fat and if that is important to you, then this should fit the bill.<br /><br />I am knocking off 1 star for the truly awful packing\shipping.<br /><br />-Mike

review/text: If you're looking for great value and great taste then this product is for you. I was skeptical about artisan salts and sea salts being different than regular salt until I accidentally ordered a case of sea salt from Portugal from our Co-op. Artisan salts and sea salts add flavor and zing to sea food, grilled foods and vegetables. I've never looked back and only use these special kinds of salts on everything. Be advised, though, if you put pink salt on something, it will turn that something slightly pink.<br /><br />Try this salt and then try salt from Hawaii, Portugal, France, prussian blue from Germany, salt from Japan, Mexico, etc ... You will be surprised at the diversity in taste.

Always a conversation starter when I put it on the table.<br /><br />Be advised that the pieces are rather large and the salt itself is "dense" rather than "crumbly" so you will need to have a good quality mill.  Our Oxo mill handles it fine, but I did try a lever-operated mill--no luck.<br /><br />Finally, the 2.2 pound bag (a kilo) costs the same as the two pound bag.  Why would anyone not buy the kilo package?

To my dismay, even with two pills, my coffee was still lack-luster. Neither the chocolate nor the caramel tasted like the real thing, just another ho hum imitation flavor assimilation lacking quality for the taste buds. In my opinion, these pills are not worth buying. This is too bad because such care went into the packaging. If the product had half the class the packaging does,I would purchase their product for my coffee shop.

review/text: I did alot of research on dog foods and Merrick was one of the brands rated very well. My minpin Hudson is very picky about his food but he ran into the kitchen as soon as i opened the can. I mix a little in with his dry dog food and he devours it.  i was suprised when i first opened the can because it looked watery and there were whole chicken wings with bones and all not what your accustume to when you open a can of dog food. However, the chicken wings fall apart easily and are very soft the bones literally turn to mush. It looks like whole chicken wings in gravy that have cooked in the crock pot allday and it smells wonderful.  I have tried other high quality brands and he would quit eating them after a day or two.  He eats this every time and it looks like homemade food that I would eat. His coat is glistening and soft and he has great energy. I can't wait to try the other flavors I'll let you know if he likes them. I'm going to switch his dry food to merrick when his Inova is gone.

The rest of the can contains little cubes of meat, a few vegetables and lots and lots of gravy. I usually split half a can between the two dogs. The only way I am able to get another meal out of the can is to add more cooked vegetables. The dogs really like it but I will not buy this flavor again. You are getting less for your money since it contains bones and so much gravy. I would recommend the Turducken. They absolutely love that one.

review/summary: Merrick Wings
review/text: My dog loves the food and knowing it is from Merrick I know it is healthy and good for my dog.  The only complaint I have is the tabs to open the can have a tendency to break off before I can open the can.  I regular can opener doesn't open the can because the ridges are too high.  This is very bothersome and has happened about 3 times in my case of 12.

review/summary: Beware the chicken bones!
review/text: As a small dog owner, (Shitshu), we are careful about what our dog can easily get down her throat.  She is also a picky eater, as are a fair amount of small dogs.<br />She loves the Merrick Wingaling, but one day while breaking up one of the large chunks of chicken, I was amazed to find a fairly stout chicken bone within the meat.  I removed it, thinking it must be an anomoly.  Then it happened again in the same can, then another can, and on and on.<br />Final word, although my dog likes this food very much, we will stop buying this brand due to the possibility of our dog getting scratches in the throat from chicken bone edges, or worse yet, choking on the bones with a full mouth of food.  Many people have said on other dog sites that dogs can digest chicken bones.  That is true, if they can get them into their stomachs.  The problem arises on the scratches to the throat lining, then possible inflammation or infection, and at the worst, choking and not being able to dislodge a sharp piece of bone.  No thanks.<br />It is just not worth the possible worry, considering the price of this food.

review/summary: false advertising on cans
review/text: I purchased two cases of Merricks Wingalings and Smothered Comfort. The label states "whole thighs" and "whole wings" but that is a lie. Once opened, the cans have one - if you're lucky two pieces. The rest (3/4 of each can) is processed cubes of who knows what my dog refuses to eat. Merricks should either fill the can with what they advertise - "WHOLE thighs and wings" - plural - or tell the consumer the truth about what they are selling here.

Having saved the wrapper just as I was waiting for Amazon to load I just happened to notice that these tasty morsels are made in China.  Doggone it.  With all the bad press associated with China and their food exports, including pet food within the past couple years, I have to pass.

review/text: This purchase started as a way to get free shipping for an different purchase. I love mangos. The raw fruit is delicious, dried makes for a tasty healthy snack, so I figured I'd give mango candy a try.<br /><br />It's like skittles but softer & without the hard candy shell. The mango flavor isn't as strong as I'd like but it's enough to satisfy (this is just candy afterall). I engulfed the first 4 packs while at work (day one). Gave a pack to the boss who immediately asked where I bought this addictive candy. Guess I'll have to give him another pack. As another review mentioned, it does have a slight oily feel but it didn't bother me at all. I think that's what helps it stay so chewy.<br /><br />In short, I like it. It might not be for everyone but I'll be buying more of this tasty candy.

review/summary: NO MORE CRAMPS!
review/text: I used to have EXTREMELY bad cramps during my time of the month. When I say EXTREME, I mean cramping so bad that I would have minor blackouts. My mother-in-law suggested I take some organic virgin coconut oil and I took a tablespoon of it, however it didn't taste good at all. It did make my cramps go away for that entire day. So my wonderful husband went out and bought me some of these capsules from the health food store, I was kind of skeptical b/c he paid $20 for it, but I thanked him and started popping the suggested amount, 3 caps, 3 times a day.<br /><br />Since the caps have a small amount in each cap, you have to take that many to get it in your system. The first month I took them, the cramps subsided to just enduring slight pain in the morning on my first day. The second month I didn't experience any PMS symptoms and even less pain on the first day. The third month I experienced NO PMS and NO PAIN through my whole 7 days. I've heard it is good for lowering your cholesterol and help maintain weight amongst other things. I'm just happy they made my cramps go away.

It is now 2 days later and they are still very gassy and it smells really bad. My Husky seems to be the only one really reacting to the treat.

I will still give these treats to my dogs because they really like the taste and texture.

review/text: My dog, at almost 12 y/o, has become extremely picky about his food.  I've spent more time and energy preparing food for him than I have for my husband.  Also, he's recently been diagnosed with cancer, so I'm not sure how much of his pickiness  is just that, or due to his medical condition.  These Nutri-Dent chews are pretty much his main diet at this point...I've given him baked chicken, roasted turkey, scrambled beef, and even made him mixed food using ground turkey, rice, mixed veggies and scrambled eggs.  He still prefers these.  Go figure!  If he likes these so much, that's what he'll get!  I'm out of ideas otherwise.

review/summary: My dog LOVES it, but ...
review/text: My dog loves it, she gets exited only from thinking she is going to get one. Her dentist is also happy with her teeth and it looks like this product delivers.<br />So why only 3 stars ? I'm not sure this product is good for the dog health. I heard some rummers abouth dogs who had problems with it and I always susspected the way it looks. Just doesnt look like something that can be good for the dog.<br />So what do I do ?<br />Eventhough my dog is medium size I give her the small ones and only few times a week. I hope it will not affect her health in the long run.<br /><br />BTW, if u ask my dog to rate, she will probably give it 6 stars (or bones), it is her favorite.

review/summary: Beware of this product--one of our dogs died.
review/text: You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog.

review/summary: Ribbons became smithereens
review/text: I had just bought the package, so the expiration date was far away.  After just two minutes of boiling (package indicates 5-7 minutes), almost all the noodles had broken into tiny pieces.  I immediately dumped them into a colander and covered them with cold water.  I had to serve them in my pasta primavera because my dinner guests had already arrived.  My primavera looked pathetic and unappetizing.  I should've stuck with DeBoles artichoke noodles, which have never failed me.  At least I didn't continue boiling the smithereens according to package directions, or they would've turned to mush, as they had for another one-star reviewer.  Eden can go ahead and send me a new box after I complain, but it's too late for my dinner guests.  Never again, Eden!

review/text: This is really a very high quality cinnamon. Good consistency, strong flavor, evenly ground. Because it's organic (protects the environment) and from Ceylon (which apparently is of much higher quality and better for your health than from other locales) I will only buy this. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Excellent Quality Cinnamon Powder
review/text: Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder has been a must-have for me from the very first time I tasted it. Forget about the adulterated, irradiated cinnamon powder that lines the shelves in the supermarket. After having done my own extensive research I discovered that organic Ceylon cinnamon is by far the best. Of all the varieties of  cinnamon Ceylon cinnamon is the one that provides health benefits. I was happy and relieved to discover Indus organic Ceylon cinnamon powder here at Amazon. It is certified organic plus the flavor is exceptional. I enjoy it with my favorite snack of 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, fruit and nuts. To that combination I add 1 1/2 teaspoons of this product. It tastes absolutely delicious! It adds a subtle sweetness without the calories, of course, and is much better for you than artificial sweeteners. Experiment to find out how much or how little cinnamon you may require on your sweet potatoes, apples, winter squash, etc. For example 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder is just the right amount to sprinkle over one sliced apple.  Also it is great in recipes in which cinnamon is an ingredient. Additionally, each packet lasts for a long time while it maintains freshness. I am a loyal customer of Indus and highly recommend the Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Best Cinnamon Ever!!
review/text: Ceylon Cinnamon was recommended to me as a homeopathic remedy for osteoarthritis in my index fingers.  One teaspoon mixed with a tablespoon of honey taken with very little water every morning before breakfast.  I cannot say the finger joints are much better, but the cinnamon was delicious and will be the only one I use from now on.  The packaging, company, shipping, etc. was all very good too.

review/summary: Okay, but no cigar...
review/text: These just arrived, and I was first taken aback by how small the jar is (perhaps a squat half-gallon size), and it it is a scant two thirds full, not full to the top, as shown in the picture of the product (I am aware of the issue of settling, but trust me, you can't shake these enough to come close to the volume shown, in fact it is closer half full now). It is difficult to tell from a photo, but somehow I thought it was one of the large jars you you see in convenience stores; not even close. The silver dollar size is near accurate, each round is slightly larger than a silver dollar (this is a ground and formed beef jerky, not a natural muscle meat product, so the item size is consistent). The lid bears a large red label marked for retail sales at four for a dollar, which means that for the price I just paid ($18.82 for one jar), for the purchase of the entire jar, you are getting a bonus of about four of the little rounds off the full retail price if sold individually, or just under $.23.5 per bite size round. Curiously, there is a blank where it clearly shows the product weight should be listed, but I would estimate no more than a pound, tops. As to value for the price, I'd give it maybe two stars.<br /><br />This is a smoked, peppered beef jerky product, and I can see what appears to be pepper in the formed meat, but the flavor is quite mild on both counts. It isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about, either. In all fairness, I like peppered meat, so I was looking for very peppery flavor; if you like a very mild pepper flavor you might be quite pleased. There is no natural grain to the meat, so it is sort of an odd leathery texture(much like fruit leather does not retain the original texture of the fruit). To me, this tastes about like a less salty than usual traditional jerky, which usually has some pepper; but being advertised as a peppered product, to my tastes, it falls short. I would give it a three on flavor; it tastes alright, just not a great spicy, peppery jerky.<br /><br />Over all, it doesn't taste bad, and I'm not going to throw it out, but it wasn't what I expected, either value or taste wise; I wouldn't buy it again.
