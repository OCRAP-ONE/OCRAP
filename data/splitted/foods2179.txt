review/summary: Maple Syrup
review/text: This maple syrup is delicious and so flavorful -- Did you know grade B maple syrup has so many vitamins and minerals you could almost not feel guilty about having french toast for breakfast. I also try and use maple syrup where I can for sweetener instead of sugar. The company was wonderful about the shipping and the product arrived packaged well and on time! Enjoy.

review/summary: Very good syrup
review/text: This is only the second time I have ever tried grade B maple syrup. I liked this one better than Now Foods grade B. I think it has more maple flavor. I only give it 4 stars because of lack of experience compared to others. I think its priced well and it was shipped well.  I really love it on plain yogurt as well as pancakes and waffles. Would definetly buy again.

review/summary: Honey Flavored SUGAR!
review/text: This product is falsely advertise and its name is completely misleading. I personally contacted the seller about what the 'ACTUAL' ingredients were in this product and here is a quote from them;<br /><br />"It is 8-10 percent HONEY and 90-92 percent CANE SUGAR".<br /><br />This is NOT a true 'HONEY POWDER'. It is simply honey flavored sugar. I would look at Arizona Farms, HiBee and others. They are 100 percent dehydrated honey, no sugar added. I have personally been buying honey powder for years at my local Asian Super market and they sell Arizona and HiBee for about $7-8 per pound and its 100 percent honey.

I ordered this large amount and then repackaged at home with my FoodSaver into one- to two-pound bags.

review/summary: 100 calories makes this a soup bargain, but cook more than instructions
review/text: This soup has a nice herbally broth and is a great filler for dieters as it has almost no fat and ony 100 calories (squeaks into 1 WW point). It has 3 grams of fiber, which means it'll carry you longer than broth and noodle soups usually do.<br /><br />However, this needs almost twice as much the cooking time as recommended. The beans and pasta stay hard if only directions are followed. I find that using boiling water from the start, and renuking at the 5 or 7 minute mark and letting it sit again works best to soften the ingredients and thicken the broth.<br /><br />For non-Vegans, this benefits from a sprinkling of parmsan. For more protein, one could add soy crumbles to stay vegan. I occasionally add both parmesan and some milk to make it like a cream of tomatoey base.<br /><br />The pasta is not as good as regular pasta (never really gets to the right texture). I noticed this with Dr. McD's ramen soup, too. Don't know if it's because it's vegan or not, but there ya go.<br /><br />Still, when you are dieting or just want something without a host of preservatives and chemicals, this is a nice soup to have handy.

review/summary: Not bad, not my favorite
review/text: I'm eating a cup of this soup as I type this. It's handy to have in the office, it keeps me from running out to buy something deep-fried or cream-filled, and it really isn't bad. But it's not my favorite Dr. McDougall's soup. It has a slightly bitter edge that I don't care for, the kind you sometimes get from dried herbs that have been sitting too long (the use-by date is a year from now), and at the same time it seems too sweet. The first thing my wife said about it when she tried hers a few minutes ago was, "too sweet," so it's not just me (and she likes food sweeter than I do). We won't throw the rest of the box away, but I won't be ordering this one again. If I'm going to give up a trip to my favorite bakery to eat soup in my office, I want it to be better than not bad.

review/text: I am not vegan, but have been looking for some easy, healthier lunches.  This soup tastes pretty good!  And it is low calorie and low sodium.  Only complaint is that if you microwave it per the instructions, it will spill out everywhere.  I cook mine for about 1 min - 1:15 on High, then 2:30 on 20%, and cover and let sit for about 5 mins... comes out great.  The pasta cooks as it sets for 5 mins and it cools downenough to eat it without scalding your tongue.

review/text: Vegan. Natural. Low calorie. Nice Italian tomato flavor with mini pasta. Lower sodium compared to most soups. Flavor balance well created. Low calorie choice. Great with a couple slices of your favorite crispbread or some whole grain crackers. Low calorie, healthy instant lunch "anytime" option. Nice for your desk drawer, traveling, or anywhere you can get some hot water. 100 calories, 4g protein, and 360mg sodium per cup. Important to let stand re-covered as recommended for 7+ minutes and then stir well.

review/summary: Flavorless Soup
review/text: I bought these soups to help my family make the venture from omnivores to vegetarians easier. Today, I decided to have a cup for dinner since my husband came home from work and got straight into bed and my oldest (who is 3) started chanting that he wanted grilled cheese instead of the bbq tofu that I had been planning on.<br /><br />The cooking time is way off. You really need to fill it with boiling water and let it sit for a good ten or fifteen minutes. The flavor is very... meh. I'm hungry and this is what I made so this is what I'm going to eat. I have no idea what we're going to do with the rest of the soups because I'm not sure that I'm going to want to wait fifteen minutes to eat a flavorless soup again.

Healthy, easy and tasty. You need to make sure you make it correctly though. I boil water in a kettle, then add the seasoning and a little water - stir it really thoroughly, then I add the rest of the water to the line and cover it with the spoon. Wait 5 min or so and then stir again before eating. Perfect! :)

review/summary: Great tasting instant soup without all the salt!
review/text: I have tried many different McDougall soups and this was my first "light sodium" purchase. I didn't miss any of the salt and the flavor was still rich and delicious. If you can handle the extra sodium, go for the lentil curry couscous or minestrone. Those are my favorite along with this tomato basil pasta!<br /><br />The only downside to these soups with the noodles in them is you really have to let the soup sit so that the noodles can soften. I don't mind the crunch of a semi-uncooked elbow noodle, but others may. An alternative solution is to add hot water, and in addition, microwave for another 1-2 minutes.<br /><br />Great pricing on amazon-- much cheaper than in the grocery store!

It has a sweet strangeness to its taste that is unbearable.  And it never quite shakes the underlying taste of water.  There are chunks of soup base that never get dissolved no matter how much you stir or heat it.  The pasta bits and beans have a powdery texture.  All in all, it's pretty bad.<br /><br />I don't know what I was expecting from 100 calorie ready-to-eat vegan soup, but... I was disappointed.

review/text: When you "subscribe" to one of the Starbucks products, you set a schedule for them to send you coffee at a discount, every month or whatever. The price is right, and you can hold off shipments if you overestimated, or invoke an immediate shipment if you're running low. The only complaint I have about this great deal is that you have to purchase 3 packages of the same type of coffee at once. This can get monotonous if you don't roar through coffee (at work, say). A good deal, it could be made better.

review/text: No longer anywhere to be found in the grocery stores, these little Chiclets are just perfect in taste and size. Every year my sister requests them as her birthday gift. She and I agree, they're the greatest. Whenever I visit my grandchildren they want to know if I have Chiclets, and of course I do. They never see them anywhere except when Grammy comes to visit. A special treat.

review/text: I can't eat anything that contains artificial sweeteners, and I have had a hard time finding any gum locally that does not contain them.  Peppermint Chiclets is perfect for me!  It tastes great and doesn't leave a bad after taste.  Since I can't find it locally, I enjoy the convenience of buying it by the box from Amazon.  In fact, since I have free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime, I am ordering several other grocery items from Amazon now.  No tax, no shipping charge, and better prices makes it a win-win situation for me!

review/text: I purchased the Chiclets Gum for a dear friend after she told me she can't find it any more.  I told her I would send her some from where I live.  However, I couldn't find it either.  It's not sold in any of the major grocery stores, pharmacies, or variety stores like Target or WalMart.<br /><br />I went to Amazon.com and was able to purchase Chiclets Gum through the Cadbury Adams company.  I was happy to be able to send it all on to my friend who was delighted. She got it on Valentine's Day which made it even more special.  I wish the Cadbury Adams company would have a wider distribution.  The public still loves the gum and would buy it if it were available.  Thank you for your helping me find it.<br /><br />Joyce H.

I also like that I can put one piece or more depending on how much I want to chew. Sometimes I just need a little something.<br /><br />If you are looking for a gum that doesn't have aspartame in it Chiclets are a good choice.

review/summary: excellent tea, blend with herbal tea for delicious midcaffeine tea
review/text: The chai mate has too much caffeine for me, as it is as much as a cup of coffee - although they claim it doesn't give you any jitters, for me it does. I blend this with one of their herbal (non-caffeine) chai's - the roobios is great - using a half-half ratio. The resultant mix is delicious with milk and a bit of honey - and is a great pick-me-up in mid morning. Teavana's teas also always make me feel better - each of their teas has a special "healing" power to it - I am not sure if it is true or not, but I do feel like I'm doing something better for my body by drinking their teas.

review/text: Just got this tea in one of the IntoTeas gift sets and I'm loving it!  It's replaced my morning coffee and it much much healthier than the former with the same amount of caffeine.  Also, I have noticed that the caffeine "high" (for lack of a better word) is not as jittery as coffee but still gets the job done and gives me the energy I need in the morning.<br /><br />The taste is fantastic as well, and it's very unique.  I can't quite place all the flavors, other than of course the chai, but I'm very impressed.<br /><br />Here's to hoping the other Teavana teas I've got coming are just as good!

review/summary: Fantastical
review/text: I normally get this tea at Teavana stores in the mall or their website, so was excited to see it on Amazon (as I have tons of gift cards here). It seemed to take a little longer then other products to arrive but came in great shape and came with a free sample just like my other orders from the Teavana site have (which makes sense since they're partnered with Amazon). I drink the Samurai Chai Mate with the White Ayurvedic Chai  and they taste fantastic. They're supposed to be full of caffeine but for me they're my anytime tea. I have to steep a little longer then recommended time as I like my tea strong (with a bit of sugar or honey :) but it tastes great. Not to sickly sweet like some fruity teas.<br />It is sweeter then some of their other teas, so if you don't like sweet then you may want to try out some of their others. I recommend going into the stores and sampling their array of teas they usually have set out. The blend they normally have of this one is good but not always what comes out at home though so don't just go by that one, they use German rock sugar which costs a little more while most people will use normal table sugar, honey, or artificial sweetener which will affect the tastes. Anyway, go try the tea, find your tea, and drink happy :D

Delish.<br /><br />Note - we ordered a tea kettle (on Amazon :)) that allows you to brew to specific temps. I recently learned the temp coupled with the steeping time makes all the difference.<br /><br />One more thing -- Teavana has an app. It provides directions for preparing all the teas they sell, including combinations between varieties. AND it has a little timer for steeping.<br /><br />Good job Teavana.

review/text: I always recommend you buy one pack first before you buy multiple packs.  The crackle bred is very very light and crispy.  I found it. Is a great alternative to the heavier gf bread and holds it's form when compared with rice cakes.  As many newbie gf knows, you end up making many costly mistakes before you find the 'one'.  I prefer the multigrain as it primarily uses brown rice and everything tastes good on it from deli meat, cheese, smoked salmon, peanut butter.  I have been eating this for weeks and I am not tired of it like i have with some of the other gf bread/rice cakes.  I wish amazon does a 6-pack as the only one with gluten sensitive in the family, it is alot in one delivery even though this has an expiry date greater than 6 months.

She'll put a slice of lunchmeat, like a nice turkey pastrami or capacollo, calabrese or proscuitto along with a slice of cheese and make a little mini snack/sandwich. If you want a gluten-free cracker with crunch and few calories, this is a good way to go.

I called the provider and he said to tie it down and the broken root would not cause the tree any problems. I did what he said and the tree seems to be alright, however it doesn't look very good because of the tie down. I was not offered a refund of replacement. Be careful not to set this tree where wind or direct sun will cause it harm.

review/summary: Best pumpkin seeds ever!
review/text: I first fell in love with the Gerbs line of pumpkin seeds when I found them in my local Whole Foods several years ago. At the time they carried the whole line- lightly salted, cinnamon sugar and my favorite, light spicy. What I loved about them is the package said because of the way they are prepared, you could pop the whole shell and kernel in your mouth and eat them whole! I've been doing that with pumpkin seeds my whole life (mainly Davids). Then they stopped carrying them and I found the lightly salted ones only at my Wild By Nature. Their web site had not gone up yet. I found the Habanero ones on Amazon and ordered six packs. They are amazingly good! Huge seeds with just the right seasoning. Their web site is up for ordering now and they sell the one pound size in all flavors! There is even a hotter version called Ghost Pepper. I think I'll try that next order. These are great! You can eat the whole 3.5 oz bag in one seating if you are not careful!

review/summary: soup not salt
review/text: I've searched through many a local supermarket in many a Chinatown, and this is the dashi that I default to.  If you look at the ingredients, you'll see that the first ingredient is bonito flakes and the second is mackerel flakes.  Salt and MSG aren't even on the list.  What you get is a real fish based dashi flavor instead of the salty liquid that you get with just about every other product.  This lacks all of the salt and MSG that you may be used to, so be prepared for a more delicate, subtle flavor.  This is what you use when you want real flavor.<br /><br />The packages come in individual packets made of what appears to be cheesecloth.  It's not a powder or a mix.  It's actual fish flakes.  The whole packet looks quite a bit like a giant teabag.<br /><br />Why did I drop a star?  It is rather pricy, but you get what you pay for.  This price is very similar to what you'd find in a real Asian supermarket.  Also, it's tough to buy 50 packages of dashi unless you use it quite often.  Then again, dashi lasts quite a while in a dark, dry environment, so it may be worth it to stock up.<br /><br />EDIT: this is for ten boxes.  Each box has five individually wrapped packets.  Each packet makes approximately 1 liter of dashi.  As mentioned before, the packets are giant tea bags, so you can't make half a packet at a time.

review/summary: Hydrolized Wheat Protein = MSG
review/text: Please read the packaging carefully if you are sensitive to MSG... it reads "No MSG Added" - 'Added' is the operative word.  One of the ingredients is Hydrolized Wheat Protein.  According to some sources I found online, including the "Truth in Labeling Campaign", anything "hydrolyzed, or any "hydrolyzed protein" contains processed free glutamic acid (aka MSG).

review/summary: Wow! Surprised, VERY GOOD!
review/text: I've tried Arizona's Lemon Iced Tea it was okay wasn't that great. I tried the Pomegranate Green Tea it was pretty good but not that great. Then I tried this Peach Iced Tea. I'm quite surprised that it's actually quite good. I don't know how one of the other reviewers ended up with grittiness. Mine dissolved fine in cold water and there is no grittiness to it. It tastes pretty good just about as good as the can stuff. I'm quite impressed. I thought I would like the Pomegranate one more and bought two and only one box of Peach. I will be definitely buying more Peach Iced Tea in the future.

review/summary: FINALLY... a DIET DRINK without the AFTERTASTE!
review/text: I ordered the ARIZONA DIET PEACH TEA PACKETS as part of a multi-product purchase through AMAZON.com.  The product arrived promptly and without incident.<br /><br />I just recently became acquainted with ARIZONA DIET PEACH TEA via my sister.  She purchased a few cans locally via a Maryland Walgreen's store.  She knew beforehand of my intolerance to artificially sweetened diet drinks, however on the "off chance" that I would be willing to try something "new", she gave a can to my husband so that he could forward it to me to try.  I saw the can in the refrigerator, popped the tab top, and poured some over a big glass of ice.  Mmmmm, I love peach; I love tea.  Wow, I liked it!  It was a tall can, so I drank it in three sittings.  It wasn't until the last mouthful when I spied the word "DIET" on the can.  WHAT?  A diet drink with no horrid, bitter, chemical aftertaste?  I couldn't believe it.  I was hooked on the stuff, now!<br /><br />I searched for the stuff for over a month to no avail... there was no ARIZONA DIET PEACH TEA to be found locally; canned, powdered, or otherwise.  I took a chance and perused the AMAZON website.  Much to my delight they offered the product in both ready made cans and powdered mix.  I elected to purchase the mixes (tubs) utilizing the auto ship option.  Additionally, I purchased six packages of single serving packets (10 ct x 6 boxes) which happened to arrive first.  Curious with regard to the "powdered" nature of the product, I poured a single packet into a 16.9 oz bottle of water, shook well, and... voila! - an instant zero calorie drink with GREAT FLAVOR and NO artificial sweetener aftertaste.  The tubs of tea mix arrived soon after.  With equal ease and preparation, two tubs of powder and tap water were transformed into one gallon of delicious ARIZONA DIET PEACH TEA.  Perfect timing for summertime.<br /><br />As a 10+ year diabetic, I had grown weary of plain water day in and day out.  This marvelous ARIZONA DIET PEACH TEA product made with SPLENDA is just what my "numbed" palate had been craving.  Thank you AMAZON for making this product available for purchase.  -- And to show my appreciation to my sister for having "enlightened" me with regard to ARIZONA DIET PEACH TEA, I have purchased Amazon's offering of ARIZONA DIET LEMONADE MIX for not one, but both of my sisters.  (They are diabetic as well and simply lo-o-o-ve their lemonade!)

review/text: This is amazingly convenient to carry and add to a glass of water for how quickly it disolves. It's pretty good, but a little too sweet for me (and perhaps why others say they prefer it made extra strong). It tastes much better to me with a little lemon juice for added tartness, but that's hard to come by except at home.

review/text: Love this milk, the taste is great and it needs no refrigeration until each bottle is open. We leave the box in the pantry and put a few in the fridge at a time which is a great space saver for limited refrigerator space (as someone else mentioned, it is also great frozen). The price is great, especially considering the free super saver shipping option...you can save even more if you choose the "subscribe and save" feature which is something I just discovered and love. The only downside to buying on Amazon, is that the expiration date is an unknown until you receive the milk. Ours has an expiration date of January 2012, so not good for as long as I had hoped...however, with how good this tastes, it probably won't last that long anyway!  Will be buying again!
