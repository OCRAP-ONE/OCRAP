review/summary: Marginal Product.  Slow Shipping.
review/text: Not the best pine nuts.  Smaller than expected and not entirely fresh --- but edible and sweet although somewhat dry.  The vendor took a full 5 days to process the order and get it to USPS for priority mail shipping.  Very slow by my standards.<br /><br />Honestly, I would not bother to order from this vendor (Candy Express) again.  Marginal product and very slow handling --- unacceptable in my opinion.

review/summary: Worse Pine Nuts
review/text: I recently received my order of Pine Nuts.These are the worse Pine Nuts I ever purchased. They were half the size of the Pine Nuts I have used in the past. They were also very dark in color compared to the Pine Nuts I've had in the past. I am very disappointed.

review/summary: Pine Nuts, As Expected
review/text: I was delighted with the pine nuts being available for less than $25 per pound, as they cost everywhere around me. The online price through this seller was slightly above $15 per pound. Although I didn't need 2 pounds, I went for it and figured I'd use them more than usual in upcoming months. Shipping didn't take much time at all, and the quality and size of the nuts was as good as any I've bought.

review/summary: Exactly what I was looking for.
review/text: I have been searching high and low for pine nuts in international markets, specialty stores, any place besides a grocery store that only seems to sell about 3oz. bottles for ridiculously high prices. I use them to make pesto, pignoli cookies, etc. and I use LOTS of them. Being able to purchase a couple of pounds vs. a couple of ounces at this price makes it a good value and it's a very good product. Thank you.

review/summary: Happily surprised!
review/text: I was of course wary of buying something as perishable as pine nuts over the internet whether from an Amazon seller or not so I was very pleasantly surprised when the pine nuts shipped the next day and were in my hands within 2 more days.  They were not discolored, rancid or in any way bad and I have frozen and used them quite satisfactorily in a number of dishes and cookies.  I have absolutely no complaints about this company or the way that they do business and will definitely buy pine nuts from them again.

review/text: I have a hard time finding bulk pine nuts in my community and the small clamshell packs are just too pricey.  I ordered these nuts and received them quickly in the mail shortly after I ordered.  They are delicious and taste better than the ones I find in the grocery store.  They are an oily nut and I would recommend that the unused amounts be stored in the freezer so that they do not go rancid.<br /><br />Delicious- thank you!

review/text: I use pine nuts for pesto and since I raise basil, I make a lot of pesto. I belong to a food co-op, the purpose of which is to save money by buying in bulk. When I noticed that the price of pine nuts through my co-op went up, I checked out Amazon and found these. They are fresh and delicious and half the cost of my food co-op. I couldn't be happier although the food co-op isn't as I have told several other members about my great find.

If it were carried by the local supermarket the soup would go on sale for $1 a can.  Not on sale it would be $2.50.  I can't bring myself to pay over $5 per can here.

review/summary: Nice sack!
review/text: So, I just got my Keurig so naturally, I am online searching for the best variety packs I can find. I must say that the bag was a big sell for me, having 5 kids bags always come in handy. The bag is a lower quality bag, you would not want to stuff a bunch of heavy items and carry it around all day. It would be great for kids to put toys in, light items, etc. Anyway, I reviewed the desription and it sounded pretty exciting to be getting a "grab bag" of K-cups essentially. I ordered it with Prime, got within 2 days and started digging. I was a tad dissapointed that is was very Green Mountain brand heavy. I love Green Mountain, but felt that I would get a little more brand variety. I am giving it a 4 star due to that fact. Other than that, there was a ton of different flavors, some bold, some flavored, and some nice classics! The other brands included were Donut House and Revv.<br /><br />Included were:<br /><br />34 Green Mountain brand varities<br />6 Donut House<br />4 Revv<br /><br />36+6+4= 44 so I got a bonus!!!!

review/text: I purchased this product as a gift for my brother in law and sister to use in their recently acquired Keurig. They loved it and said that it had a great variety of coffee flavors. They enjoyed trying new flavors and finding new favorites in this variety pack. They also thought it was cute that it literally came in a red sack, though in packaging, the coffee is packed separately in a protective plastic. This item shipped quickly, was undamaged, and was thoroughly enjoyed by the recipients. If you're looking for a nice variety pack for yourself or as a gift, I would definitely recommend this.

review/text: The shipping was lightning fast, I ordered it July 4, and got it July 6.  The description is accurate, you get a nice variety and no more than 3 of any different type, and, if you're newer to Keurig, like I am, it's a good way to try different flavours without getting stuck with a big box of something you won't use.  So far, out of the flavored kinds, I'm digging the Southern Pecan and the Cinnamon Roll the best.  The Donut House non-flavored type is good too, and, my sampler didn't have a bunch of decaf, I think maybe one or two at most, which is fine, I need my caffeine in my K-cup fix!

review/summary: Crushed K-cups, Grab bag on coffee
review/text: The bag is cute, definitely cannot hold anything heavier than k-cups though.<br /><br />When my box arrived, this bag was just thrown in there, no secured packing or anything. The box was in decent shape, but my bag looked like someone had stepped on it before it went into the box. Treads of some type on the bag. Hoped that was from before it was filled, but half the cups were crushed, and there was quite a bit of coffee grinds loose on the inside of the bag. Had to toss an awful lot of cups.<br /><br />There was a variety in the bag, though half the bag was decaf. A couple flavored coffees reg caff, and then a lot of different unflavored bold mixes. Also, a few teas. There were 3 or 4 of some kinds. I don't mind some decaf to keep around for guests or my teen that likes coffee, but it was definitely more than I needed. They could do another set decaf instead, you would think.<br /><br />Overall, I would not been overjoyed, but at least have been content about the item if mine hadn't been badly mishandled, and sent to me anyway. I will use the bag for extras once I figure out how to clean it. It would be perfect to take on vacation with other people you don't know the coffee preference, and taking a machine. Just check your sack for broken k-cups first.

review/text: I think it would be difficult to go wrong with this product.  If you want a fairly large variety pack then I believe this is the way to go.  I received 42 k-cups- there were no more than 2 of a variety (both decaf and caf, and a wonderful half-caf...).  The bag is a small bonus- it is about the quality you'd expect based on the fact that it comes holding a bunch of k-cups (I actually really really like it)- not military grade but reasonably well made nonetheless.  I plan to purchase another sampler pack when we are done with this one, and am considering it as a gift option for friends with keurigs.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: I was worried about buying this because a lot of people haven't reviewed it.  I love it!  It came in a sealed packaging box, then there was a sealed bag overtop of the sack.  The sack had all loose k cups in it.  The sack itself seems sturdy and is nice for holding all of your loose k cups if you don't have a k-cup carousel or stand.  The expiration dates were AWESOME and most expired in 2013.  None were already expired!  There is a bit of a thrill and excitement opening up your sack of k cups and looking through all of the variety and hoping you get doubles of the ones you're like "ooh, that sounds soo yummy!" (for me, the flavored coffees).<br /><br />Here is what I got:<br /><br />3 green mountain lake and lodge exp: 3/05/13<br />2 black tiger 3/05/13<br />2 green mountain caramel vanilla cream 2/20/13<br />2 gloria jean's mudslide 2/16/13<br />2 green mountain vermont country blend 3/19/13<br />2 donut house cinnamon roll 2/12/13<br />2 donut house chocolate glazed donut 2/9/13<br />2 tully's breakfast blend 11/17/12<br />green mountain mocha nut fudge 1/20/13<br />2 cafe escapes chai latte 10/8/12<br />2 green mountain extra bold kenyan aa 2/12/13<br />2 green mountain extra bold dark magic 3/16/13<br />2 green mountain breakfast blend decaf 1/23/13<br />2 green mountain fair trade select 3/11/13<br />2 caribou decaf blend 1/16/13<br />2 green mountain french vanilla 2/9/13<br />2 donut house donut house coffee/cafe 3/6/13<br />green mountain mocha fudge nut 1/20/13<br />2 revv pulse with ginseng & guarana 3/2/13<br />2 green mountain nantucket blend iced coffee 2/25/13<br />2 green mountain extra bold sumatran reserve 2/10/13<br />2 green mountain our blend 3/5/13<br /><br />grand total: 43 .. guess I got one extra! :)<br /><br />I will definitely be buying from here again, even though the price of each k-cup was roughly 80 cents.

I didn't even know their was that many different types of extra bold coffee. I would think their would be normal coffee and flavored coffee and maybe even some tea. I will not be ordering this product again.

review/summary: Best steak rub I've ever had!
review/text: This is, without a doubt, the best steak seasoning I've ever had.  We use it on just about any cut of beef, burgers, pork...it's delicious!  It has a well balanced flavor that enhances the natural flavor of the meat without overwhelming it.  The only problem was ordering it from amazon.  Four of the six cans had loose lids and spilled part of their contents.  Very disappointing.  I'll look for a different source in the future!<br />Five stars for Szeged Steak Rub!<br />One star for packing and shipping!

My dad did grow up on the island of Santa Maria (Azores) so may be used to a more "robust" sausage.

So, I paid $15.46 for an additional 1/2 oz.

Very weak flavor and the choco-brownie flavoring just wasn't my thing (thought I'd never meet a brownie I didn't like).

review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

review/text: So I have a confession to make. I don't like pina coladas...or getting caught in the rain, for that matter. They're too sickeningly sweet filled with tropical flavors built to give me heartburn. I love fresh pineapple, but when I wasn't on meds to help fight my acid reflux, even looking at one was enough to send me into heartburn agony for a few hours. But now I can indulge and it's wonderful! Anyway, yes, I don't like pina coladas because of the creaminess as well, so I'm glad they released a pineapple matcha as well as a pina colada matcha. Pineapple I can definitely get behind. We love pineapple in this house, my wife spent some time in Mexico and fell in love with them there. We even have one of those pineapple corer/slicers, a big piece of $10 equipment with a single purpose that I refuse to live without.  I am very excited to be trying this matcha and I'm praying it will help feed in to that pineapple addiction we've found ourselves with. Maybe I'll try it swirled together with some strawberry matcha...I love the taste of pineapples and strawberries together.  Or any of the berries, for that matter. They just balance each other out so beautifully.<br /><br />So after a bit of mental back and forth, I decided to give this one a go. Pineapple can be done well in teas, so hopefully this one will live up to expectations. When I first mixed it up, my wife could smell it from across the room. "That has to be bubble gum or cotton candy." Nope, just pineapple! It does smell very sweet. At first sip, I'd be hard-pressed to find pineapple specifically, more of an overall tropical candy flavor with a touch of a medicinal aftertaste, like chewable baby aspirin. But in the aftertaste, the taste that lingers on your tongue, I found pineapple. Yum, yum, yum pineapple. I'm not too sure of this one, I'm going to have to try it with strawberry, but it's got all of the sweetness of pineapple and none of the tartness that makes it so good. I don't think this is one I'll be stocking up on, but I don't think I'll be forcing it on my friends either. I won't have any trouble finishing it, but I doubt I'll get more. Still, I am grateful to have been granted the chance to try it! I just don't think I'm enough of a tropical fruit fan to fully enjoy it.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: My daughter often had a Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB) for breakfast when she was in high school, leading my wife and I to give her grief for not having a good breakfast.<br /><br />Years later, when my aging father was ill and it was difficult to get him to eat as doctors said he should, a nurse recommended CIB, saying that it was a complete meal. Fortunately, my father loved it.<br /><br />Since then at least two other nurses have mentioned it to me, and for the past several years I've been drinking it fairly regularly. Now, it's rare that a day goes by when I don't have CIB for one of my meals.<br /><br />A major ice storm hit the rural area I live in recently, knocking out power, telephone, and even cellular service and water. Part of a tree in our front yard landed on the power line, and limbs of two tall trees fell onto our driveway, blocking our means of exit.<br /><br />Fortunately we had a fresh box of CIB on hand (French Vanilla, our favorite flavor) and a gallon of milk (which we kept "refrigerated" by keeping it in a cooler outside where the temps were below freezing). After that experience I realized that having a supply of CIB plus some powdered milk and bottled water on hand was as important as having flashlights, a portable radio, batteries, candles, and matches, etc., in case of emergency.<br /><br />I'm a big guy who likes to eat and who does a fair amount of physical labor, and a glass of CIB fills me up, gives me an energy boost, and keeps me satisfied till lunchtime (assuming I've had it in the morning; sometimes I have it for lunch instead).<br /><br />When I travel by car to visit relatives out of state I carry a supply of CIB with me. They may offer me eggs and sausage or bacon, etc., for breakfast, but if I have my CIB and milk is available, that and a good cup of coffee are all I need. I've also gotten into the habit of carrying a thermos with a pre-mixed CIB drink in it when I go on such road trips, so that I can have that for a meal when I'm on the road instead of having a McDonald's meal. I have noticed that I stay more awake and alert throughout the 8 1/2 hour drive if I substitute a CIB for a McMeal, and don't feel a need to pull into a rest area for a nap as I usually do after eating a McMeal.<br /><br />I swear by it and even though Amazon's price is only a few cents below what my local WalMart charges, getting CIB delivered to the door 3 boxes at a time is convenient and seems a good way to avoid ever getting low on it.<br /><br />I like it blended with a banana too, and in hot weather blending CIB with a banana and a scoop of vanilla ice cream makes for an extra special treat.<br /><br />I have apologized to my daughter for giving her a hard time about her CIB breakfasts when she was in high school. When I tell her that at least 3 nurses have raved about CIB to me, she says, "See? SEE? And you and mom gave me such a hard time, telling me it wasn't enough to have for breakfast! Grrrr!!" ;-)

review/summary: Carnation instant breakfast
review/text: This is a great product.  I've been drinking it almost daily for over 40 years.  Carnation changed the vanilla flavor a few years ago.  They received a complaint from me, and apparently many others, about it. It tasted good, like butterscotch, but I wanted vanilla.  They eventually returned the vanilla to the original recipe.  I use it mostly in protein shakes.  But I do like the occasional frozen mug with just the powder and cold milk.  Remember to put the powder in first.  Always leave enough room to stir vigorously.  Try really hard not to drink it all without coming up for air.  It's hard to do but you can do it.  In other words - savor and make it last.  The energy boost is almost immediate.  I don't use the sugar-free.  Hence the immediate boost.

review/text: I work a midshift & don't get home til late & so by then I am starving and tired and this is the perfect solution. I don't have to worry about eating a big unhealthy meal before bed but at the same time its filling. It is expensive but its worth it for me and the best flavors are chocolate malt and the vanilla ones they both taste like shakes!

review/summary: Delicious nutrition, albeit added sugar
review/text: I LOVE these things. I can get them cheaper at my local store so I don't buy them here on Amazon, BUT I wanted to review the product because it is excellent, particularly for someone like me who worries about getting enough protein and vitamins/minerals.<br /><br />I'm a college student, so I don't eat a whole lot of meat, because a) Its expensive, b) I often don't have enough time to cook it, c) I worry about not cooking it properly and getting some icky food-born illness.<br /><br />So, the majority of my protein comes from dairy products- quick and easy to consume, and relatively cheap. But on their own I still worry its not enough protein, so these things are great! You just pour a package into your glass of milk, stir it up, and enjoy! A high-protein, vitamin rich, delicious snack or mini meal!<br /><br />The vanilla flavor really is very, very tasty. I highly recommend.<br /><br />The ONLY cons I can think of are:<br />1) Added sugar to an already sweet drink, has something like 18g per serving?<br />2) Can be hard to find and/or expensive (on a student budget, anyway)<br /><br />But the pros much outweigh the cons for me. I drink one or two of these everyday and love them. They're great added to smoothies to bump up the nutrition value!

review/summary: The Original.
review/text: Earl Grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.<br /><br />(From the Twinings website: "When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name.")<br /><br />Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley.

review/summary: Twinings Earl Grey Loose Tea
review/text: This is the same Twinings Earl Grey Tea you drink using a tea bag but by using loose tea leaves instead, it seems to give you a richer flavor because the water has been able to circulate around the tea leaves better.  If you like your tea a little less potent, you can either let it steep a shorter period of time or use less tea thereby making the tin of tea leaves produce more cups of tea.<br /><br />You also get the tea packaged in a tight fitting tin rather than a cardboard box so that the tea will stay fresh longer.  Stores in my shopping area do not carry loose teas so to be able to get a loose tea flavor I like that will give a nice robust flavor and be packaged in a tin container for freshness and convenience is a double win for me.  Shopping at Amazon makes it a real bargain for me.

review/text: I don't have a whole bunch bad to say about this tea or a whole lot that is real good.  However, for the price I suppose that is what one should expect.  The tea came packagge nicely and the tin was full right to the top so you will get your money's worth.  I found that I get more flavor out of the tea if I steep it at a higher temperature but I am sure that varies among different people.  Also know that this tea is really only good for one steep as the second one is kind of blah and degrades quickly form there.<br /><br />For my money I take Bigelow in tea bags over this product.

The jerky is not dried out and brittle; it is moist and chewy. No carbohydrates to make your pet gain weight either. My cats even like these (I break them into small pieces for them). The beef ones almost smell like they have a little bacon in them (but they don't). My dogs come running the minute they hear the rustle of this bag when I pick it up. I know many dog trainers that swear by these too. These will get your dog to do ANYTHING! I highly recommend these!

review/text: Bought this through Amazon from The New Mall. Ordered on Sunday. Order processed and shipped on Monday. Recieved in perfect condition - it was well bubble wrapped. Shipping is more than the tea but hey for under $14 I have over a pound of tea. That is less than 6 cents a cup, half the price of the same in bag form even with free super saver shipping. That's only a bargain if the tea is good, and it is in my opinion. The Ceylon green tea is not grassy like many greens. The large broken pieces of leaf have a full and pleasant taste. Not bitter. The tea flavor definitely comes through in the blend. The bergamot smells wonderfully of citrus and tastes just as good. The bergamot is not overdone but isn't underdone either. Similar to the level of bergamot in Twinings but slightly less bright. This is my daily go to tea.
