review/summary: Real Customer Service
review/text: I ordered this collection on 6/9/10 and it arrived on 6/12. Although it was was very well-packaged, this did not prevent the USPS from managing to break one of the tubes. The seller was contacted by email and a replacement requested. As this was a birthday gift and the occasion was only a week away, I offered to pay for expedited shipping. Seller responded immediately stating that a replacement would be shipped ASAP. The replacement tube arrived three days later in good shape. My offer to pay additional shipping charges was declined. In summary, this product is excellent and the customer service absolutely first rate. I highly recommend both the product and the seller.

review/summary: First class company, wonderful offerings
review/text: I purchased the Old World collection directly from the Spice Lab as a Father's Day gift for my husband.  The item was extremely well packed and arrived ahead of schedule. A small wooden salt spoon, sample packets of gourmet salts and a reference/index card with information about each of the 11 salts were included. Brett was responsive and helpful. This is a great company with an interesting variety of salts and spices. I will definitely make a future purchase and refer the Spice Lab to others.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm disappointed that my email reguarding a broken test tube and cork has gone unanswered.  The first time I used one of the salts, I was extrememly gentle but a large piece broke off as well as some of the cork top. The tubes should not be so fragile so I sent an email to that affect to Brett, the owner. Despite answering my initial email about how much I loved the gift and where could I post a positive comment, he has not responded with regards to the breakage. Good customer service would be to follow up.....

review/summary: Review Correction
review/text: On Sept.12 I posted the following seller review:<br />  3/5 stars:<br />  "I'm sorry to say that this item arrived with some slight cosmetic damage. On the top front edge of the rack there is what I would call a dent, but it's also rough. From the way it was packaged I would have to say that it was that way when it was put into the box. I intended this as a gift, and I don't have time to return it, so I'll just try to sand it down so it's at least smooth."<br />  Jammies, September 12, 2012<br />Later Amazon added:<br />  Message from Amazon: "This item was fulfilled by Amazon, and we take responsibility for this fulfillment experience."<br /><br />Shortly after I posted it, I received an email from The Spice Lab Inc. offering to send a new block. I sent them a couple of pictures of the damaged area. They sent me a new block and two little spoons to replace the one that was missing from my original order. The replacement block arrived yesterday in plenty of time for my trip to visit my son and daughter-in-law.<br /><br />In hindsight, I should have contacted The Spice Lab before I posted the review, so they could have had time to resolve the problem. I had jumped to the conclusion that I'd need to return the item in order to get a replacement, which wasn't the case.<br /><br />Since it's a gift, I can't speak to the quality of the salt, but I can say that the block is very sturdy and attractive, and the little spoon is a charming addition.<br /><br />I greatly appreciate the efforts of Brett at The Spice Lab, and I would happily buy from them again.

I would recommend this for someone who'd like to sample various kinds of salt and doesn't mind paying a high price. The reason I gave it four and not five stars was the price.

I ate 11 boxes of them in just a few days and gave the last one away so I wouldn't eat it too.  If a person can stop after eating 1 or 2 servings, they are a great addition to your diet.

review/text: I saw these in our local commissary one day and decided I *had* to give them a try.  I was only looking for something that might be a better for me choice to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I had no idea how much I would like these and have to have *more*.  I got one bag of the Raspberry and one bag of the Maple and I love them both!!!  I'm thrilled to see that they are a much healthier alternative than most baked goods, especially than the ones I normally choose.  I am not someone who is health consious or tends to read labels before buying an item.  I love these twists and am looking to buy them in a larger quantity so I can enjoy them more often!  They are light and flaky and satisfying and good...a must for me!

review/summary: Not Too Light, Not Too Sweet, But Oh What A Wonderful Flavor
review/text: Every Revolution product I have tried has been a wonderful experience.  Revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable.<br /><br />Better Than The Rest<br /><br />I've been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now, and I simply love it. No other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste.  For example, Trader Joe's store brand (while good) seems as if it has been sweetened (to the point where it's too sweet), and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added (I didn't check the ingredients, so I may be wrong about this).  There's also Yogi's pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste. I liked it; didn't love it.<br /><br />Complimenting Flavors<br /><br />Pomegranates are often compared to apples.  In fact, pomegranate means "seeded apple" (from latin: pomum - apple and granatus - seeded), and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart, but has a very strong and distinct flavor.  Thus, a light white tea is the perfect companion; it doesn't overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue.  Likewise, the amount of pomegranate, or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor, is truly perfect.  No flavor overpowers the other, but rather all the flavors compliment one another.<br /><br />Brewing<br /><br />I'm sure someone out there will say that I'm butchering tea when I brew this, but when I do, I leave the tea bag in the mug until I've consumed it all.  I find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter.  Typically this is only the case for herbal teas, which don't become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves.  In this case the same is true, perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light. The tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds (flesh included).  Do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed? (If you don't, try it! It's wonderful.)  That initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get (or at least I get) from a pomegranate is captured in this tea, and it makes sense! There's pomegranate seeds in there!<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Buy this tea!  I was a little skeptical about my first purchase since I was buying 6 boxes, but it was a great choice that I do not in the least bit regret.  I've bought this for myself and for family, with everyone absolutely loving it. Best $20 I have ever spent (and continue to spend)!

review/text: This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I don't know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the tea's composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wife's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor. Really disappointing, especially since we're stuck with six boxes.

review/text: I purchased this tea for someone who enjoys Trader Joe's white pomegranate tea, and unfortunately it was not a good substitute. Though I haven't tried it myself I was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable.  I am rating 4 stars since this is such a subjective judgement, and I have no doubts about this being a high quality product.

review/summary: Makes great iced tea
review/text: I've been using this tea for for about 6 months and drink it as iced tea daily.<br /><br />I microwave my water on high in a pyrex 2 cup glass container for 2 minutes on high and then pop the little white mesh bags in for about 5 - 15 minutes. I use about 3 - 4 bags for a rich taste and since I'm going to be pouring it over ice. I put my ice cubes in a large glass and pour my hot tea over the ice, grab a straw and it's ready to drink.<br /><br />It also tastes good when I steep 2 bags of the Revolution White Pomegranate Tea with 2 bags of the Arizona Pomegranate. This is my favorite on ice. The Arizona is a green tea. Anyhow, this is my usual lunchtime pick me upper. I want to note that I gave up drinking diet soda in March and has made this concoction my replacement. It was a little difficult at first, but now that awful stuff is out of my system.<br /><br />I have not tried this tea hot, as I am not a fan of hot tea, but I'm sure it's just as delicious. I subscribe to this and the Arizona Pomegranate Green Tea.

review/summary: mellow flavor, no chemical aftertaste
review/text: This Melitta decaf Riviera Sunset coffee has an excellent taste.  There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees.  It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa.  I really enjoyed this.  The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself.  When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1/2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1/2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.  I will definitely be trying other types of Melitta coffee in the future.

review/summary: Packaging needs improvement, great taste, decaff is not my thing
review/text: I'm not a coffee expert, but I know a good tasting coffee when I drink a cup. The Melitta Riviera is a light roast, with a nutty and creamy flavor. The aroma is just exhilarating. It left a nice aroma throughout the house, almost made it seem like I was in a coffee shop. Unfortunately, it is just decaffeinated and did not give me the jolt I need in the morning.<br /><br />The packaging caused some problems for me. The seal is excessively tight. I've never had this problem with Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Peet's Coffee, or Meijer packs. With the Melitta, it was so tight that when I did open it, the bag tore apart and spilled a lot of the ground coffee onto my kitchen top and floor. One could argue that this tight seal packs in all the flavor, I could argue that if it were easier to open I wouldn't have spilled maybe 3 days worth of coffee grounds onto the floor.<br /><br />Pros: Light roast, excellent aroma, nutty and creamy taste<br /><br />Cons: Decaf (arggghhh) and hard to open pack<br /><br />Overall: 3/5

review/text: The minute you open a bag of Melitta Riviera Sunset you will think you are in Starbucks. The rich aroma is intoxicating, a promise of things to come. I like my coffee a little stronger so I used a � cup ground coffee with 12-ounces water. After brewing the coffee my entire apartment was heavenly scented with a superior fragrance. The first sip was like falling in love. I literally felt heady. The only thing I added was a little half & half and two packets of stevia. I would highly recommend that you have this coffee after dinner with your dessert. This is truly an exceptional coffee! I'm beyond impressed. Now I'm eager to try the Melitta's Parisian Vanilla ground coffee.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: coffee snob reviews pre-ground decaf
review/text: This is pretty decent coffee, for pre-ground decaf.  Here's how a coffee snob reviews it:<br /><br />* Unpacking *<br />This coffee had to travel a long way to reach my house, and it was hot out.  Heat and time are enemies of fresh coffee.  The package was pretty hard to open, I resorted to scissors.  The grind is very uniform with no detectible dust.  The smell is stale compared to the local fresh roasted, non-decaf, beans I usually buy.<br /><br />* Brewing *<br />I busted out my cone and loaded two servings into a Melitta filter.  I poured two cups of 200F water through.  The uniform grind is apparent in that the coffee didn't clog as it does with blade-ground coffee (due to dust).  I drank the coffee black...<br /><br />* Tasting *<br />The smell is of decaf and or instant coffee.  Pretty stale but the decaf process is partly to blame.  Overall I enjoyed it as much as any drip decaf I've had recently.  There was no biting bitterness.  I drank two cups black without much of a gut ache.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Tight packaging with little air helps maintain freshness.<br />- Excellent grind uniformity.<br />- Low bitterness<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not locally roasted.<br />- Not fresh. Best-by date is a year in advance.<br /><br />Verdict: For mail-order, pre-ground decaf, this coffee lived up to expectations and was drinkable.  3 or 4 stars.

review/summary: A good cup of decaf
review/text: This Melitta Riviera Sunset decaf makes a better-than-decent cup of coffee with medium body and just a little bite. I used my my usual two heaping coffee scoops for six ounces of water in a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker.<br /><br />While I was enjoying the coffee, I read the package and saw that it recommends two level teaspoons of coffee for six ounces of water. That got my curiosity up so I measured out my coffee scoop and it is one tablespoon. Since I use two heaping scoops, that's slightly more than three times as much as suggested on the package. Following the directions would probably make a watery, undrinkable brew.<br /><br />The coffee has a nice even espresso grind, perhaps a bit lighter than a French roast. I would have guessed that it was primarily arabica with some robusta but Melitta states that it is an all-arabica blend from Central and South America. It is decaffeinated through the chemical-free Swiss water process which is the only acceptable way to decaffeinate as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Also note the cute vintage travel poster-style label and the clever name: because it's decaffeinated, it's perfect to drink while watching the sunset.

review/summary: Nothing Special
review/text: I have a pretty wide appreciation for acceptable coffee, but in my opinion, this stuff is mediocre coffee. I drink both regular and decaf on a daily basis and to me, this tasted like institutional cafeteria coffee. I am normally a fan of the "Swiss water decaffeination process" decaf coffees, and was disappointed by the quality of this "gourmet" coffee.<br /><br />With that said, I did try this twice to give it a fair review. The first time I prepared it the same way I normally make my coffee (on the strong side), the second time I followed the directions exactly. Both times using filtered water and a quality coffee maker that uses the Melitta style (cone) filter. To my taste, it was stale and over-ground (like the flavor was watered out of it and then over-roasted and ground extra fine to try and put some flavor back into it), comparable in quality to low-end bulk coffee. The brands of decaf coffee I do like and brew at home (Dunkin' and Newman's Own, to name only two) are in the same price range, and also purchased pre-ground, but to me taste much smoother, and more full-flavored. This coffee is not one I would make a point to purchase when there are better coffee choices for the same money -or cheaper coffee choices for the same quality.

review/text: The price is great but I just didn't like the taste of this coffee. I'm pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong. This one produce very acidic coffee when made strong, but if you make it thin, then it tastes okay with just slight acidic after taste. How you'd like this coffee is really depending on your personal taste of coffee, but if you are like me, drink coffee strong, or dislike acidic after taste that lasts while, then this is not for you.

review/summary: A good, mellow, basic coffee
review/text: Melitta's Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated Ground Coffee turned out to be a good basic coffee - not bitter, not burned-tasting, a well-rounded mellow brew that tastes like real coffee. I had it this morning with almond milk, stevia and a pinch of cinnamon, and though I'd had a bad night and didn't even know if I could handle coffee, it was delicious and easy on a morning tummy. Besides brewing it alone to get a nice decaffeinated coffee for night-time drinking (especially in the winter), we've been mixing it with regular coffee in various blends, depending on our caffeine-related needs at the time.<br /><br />The packaging is practical and easy to re-close and the grind is good for my automatic coffeemaker. I will buy this one again.

review/summary: Decaf Never Tasted So Good---5 Stars!
review/text: Wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor.  No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried.  Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.<br /><br />I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!<br /><br />I love using my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011528S0">Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold</a> for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0T2">Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6)</a>and filter cone (similar to this one:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001794Q0S">Ready Set Joe/Mug</a>) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.<br /><br />Take time to "bloom the grounds" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).<br /><br />Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  I look forward to ordering more.<br /><br />Update 9/21/10:  Just ordered my first 3-pack through Subscribe & Save; great deal for some delicious decaf!

review/summary: good cup of decaf
review/text: I enjoy my coffee with plenty of sugar and a flavored creamer. This provided a good base for that experience. As a non-connoisseur, this is just about right: not too strong, not bitter, good "coffee" flavor.<br /><br />For the sake of comparison, I most often drink the ground version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55MM">Eight O'Clock Coffee, 50% Decaf Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> Right now on Amazon, Melitta's is slightly more expensive per ounce, though Subscribe and Save would even it out and Melitta's brewing instructions call for using a smaller amount of grounds. I would expect them to be about the same quality, and in my opinion they were. This is certainly a coffee I'm happy to drink when I want decaf.<br /><br />One downside is the bag. My husband got to it before I did, but he reported that it required scissors to get it open. The resealing feature on the bag then couldn't be used, so we made the transfer to another sealed container.

review/text: This ground decaffeinated coffee makes a fine brew with a rich aroma and flavor. It is smooth and satisfying with a full-bodied taste. My wife and I loved the taste and aroma of this ground coffee. For an ideal cup measure one heaping teaspoon full of coffee per cup of hot water. You could change the quantity depending on the strength of the coffee you desire. I generally drink decaffeinated Folgers's brand, and when I compared the two brands, I did not find a great deal of difference in the richness of coffee. You may want to consider the price variance between the two brands before you want to purchase this product.

review/summary: Delicious Decaffeinated
review/text: First off,  let me state that I am not a fan of decaffeinated coffee of any type.  But I often have guests over who ask for de-caf, so I gave this a try.<br /><br />While I agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain "different" taste about this blend, for me, it was not a bitter taste, but instead, a good, strong flavor that mimicked the strong (real) coffee taste I enjoy.  I had a second cup, and the flavor grew on me even more, and I thought: "it really is delicious for a decaf."<br /><br />The aroma isn't truly satisfying (why does this always happen with decaf?) but I think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack.<br /><br />The package had to be snipped open with scissors --this is tightly packed!-- and then I just poured it into a zip loc for storage in the fridge.<br /><br />I'll stick with regular coffee, but I'm sure my de-caf loving friends will enjoy this.

review/summary: Good Flavor
review/text: I am a coffee lover. It is one of the few pleasures of my life so I was excited to review this product.  Once received I opened it up and gave a good sniff.  I know to some that may sound stupid, but I love to open coffee and have the aroma surround me, this coffee did not do that as much as others that I have used.  I had to really give a good sniff to smell the aroma, but it smelled pretty good once I got my nose in there.<br /><br />I set out to brew myself a pot.  I followed the directions and enlisted my husband to have a cup with me.  Now usually I do not drink decaffeinated, so I was just a little concerned. Decaf to me can taste very flat. But I waited and a nice smell filled the air.  Finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product. My husband smiled. He loves any coffee that has Arabica beans. He looked at me and said, "ummm this is really good."  My turn.  I sniffed some more, I'm a real sniffer before anything goes into my body.  It still smelled pretty good so now for the taste test.<br /><br />Okay, it was definitely different than the Dunkin  Donuts coffee that I'm use to and love. However,it had a smooth flavor, but  a little richer than I like and I didn't seem to notice that it was decaf, that was a good thing.  It was flavorful and made a pretty good cup of coffee.  Hubby liked it a lot. So I would have to say it was a winner, a good rich coffee flavor and a good price.

review/summary: Good-quality coffee at a decent price
review/text: I'm a big coffee drinker (much against my better judgement), but due to a stomach condition, I've been "forced" to drink mostly decaf for the last few years. I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I don't make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.<br /><br />When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).<br /><br />For a pack of 3, the price seems decent. If you drink decaf, I think this is quite worth a try.

review/summary: Not bad, not great...
review/text: Not much of a decaf drinker (unless I am craving a cup late night for some reason). I have to say, this coffee tasted average at best. I am a WAWA coffee fan, and coming from them to this.. well it missed the mark. I gave some to my mother in law and she seemed happy with it, so 3 stars in that respect. I might try mixing it with my non-decaf coffee to see how it tastes, but I am not holding my breath. If the price was a few $$ cheaper, definitely would bump it up a star.

review/summary: Good Coffee, Nothing Extraordinary Though
review/text: I would recommend this as a good basic coffee.  It has a satisfying flavor and will make many a good cup of coffee.  I prefer drinking my coffee black and I found this to be produce a good cup.  It is not bitter and even though I had the decaffeinated coffee, it did not taste flat like so many decafs do.

review/summary: Nice for a late night cup
review/text: My wife finds it bizarre that I enjoy a good cup of joe just before I call it a night. Yeah, sometimes I get a little spiky due to too much caffeine intake and so I thought I'd give this decaff a go. What you get is a good cup without any bitterness but it's a little weak and I recommend dropping about 50% more into your brewer to get a fuller flavor. Also, as it's vacuum packed into a slim cardboard box it arrived completely squished flat - nothing like the fat photo in the amazon product shot. I know it's a minor thing to complain about but I like leaving my coffee out next to the coffee maker and this item wouldn't even stand up. It was about 1/2" thick!<br /><br />So you're not going to have Mr Wolf commending you for your great coffee with this one but for a decaff it ain't half bad.

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: Like most Melitta brews, I found this one to be somewhat middle of the road.  It's certainly not undrinkable, but it's not the first one I'd reach for, either.  As many of the other reviewers mentioned, I did find it nearly undrinkable when brewed in the quantity shown; I think you have to at least double the amount you use to get a good cup, so take that into consideration when figuring the value.<br /><br />I'm a little sensitive to caffeine and like to have a decaf on hand for drinking later in the day, and I bought this primarily to use with my Mr. Coffee frappe maker (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a>; let me just put in a quick pitch for that, I love it!)  I found the "Riviera Sunset" stood up well to all the milk, flavoring, and ice inherent in making a frappe (again, with a significant increase in the amount used).<br /><br />I would probably not purchase this coffee just because of my own views on coffee; I look for bird-friendly, Fair Trade brands, and I find nothing to indicate that Melitta makes any effort to meet these expectations.  Leaving aside these considerations, though, I think those who enjoy a somewhat light, easy-drinking brew would like this coffee.

review/summary: Good for a mass-produced decaf
review/text: Okay, I'm a complete coffee nut: I've even been known to grow my own beans, and when I run out of my private label, I tend to enjoy the baddest Kona or Jamaican Blue Mountain I can find.<br /><br />Still, sometimes I just want a quick cup of respectable coffee without all the fuss, and this is what I was hoping for in the Melitta Riviera decaf. To a good degree, I was happy with it, but it's certainly not something I'd curl up with when in the mood for a really outstanding cup of coffee.<br /><br />The positives are the aroma, the uniformity of the grind and the overall taste, which I'd rate as fairly mild and maybe a slight bit on the acid side. I found I liked it best either in a French press or in my Viviano espresso maker - two techniques that make the most out of somewhat weak coffee. Brewed conventionally, I found I could compensate by using somewhat more coffee than usual.<br /><br />Still, although not a serious competitor to the world's best coffees, it doesn't cost $50 a pound, either. I'd have to say that for the price, it's definitely worth trying.

review/text: This is good for packaged ground coffee, and for decaf, it definitely has a strong coffee flavor. This is great for that winding down cup of coffee late night that won't keep you up because of the caffeine.<br /><br />Each sealed package holds ten ounces of extra-fine ground coffee. The bag feels sturdy if you prefer to keep your ground coffee in its original packaging.<br /><br />With coffee prices going up, it may be a good idea to compare the prices of this (if you try this and like it, you get a better price with the Amazon Subscribe & Save option) versus getting coffee beans from your local coffee shop and grinding them at home or having the coffee shop grind them for you.

review/summary: robust, real coffee taste without the caffeine
review/text: Disclaimer: I'm a coffee addict.  I'm also a Starbucks addict, so I've become a bit snobby about my coffee preferences and can't stand the economy stuff.  I've had regular Melitta coffee before and was favorably impressed by it, so I decided to give the decaf version a try. Especially when the weather gets cold, I like a nice hot cup of coffee in the evenings and don't particular want to be tossing and turning hours later.<br /><br />The Riviera Sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you don't want the real thing. It had a nice, rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste.  While I continue to prefer the real thing on most occasions, I'm glad to know there's a good, flavorful substitute for when I don't want caffeine.

review/text: I am not a big fan of decaffeinated coffee--I figure what's the point?  Taste is so often compromised.  I have recently found that caffeine bothers me if I drink it after 7pm so it's decaff or nothing at that point.  Riviera Sunrise tastes like regular coffee.  I was so impressed I decided to try it as my morning coffee.  I expected to have a very negative response to not getting the morning caffeine of my usual coffee but that did not happen.  If you must give up caffeine this is a great solution.

review/text: Melitta Cafe is a smooth, flavorful coffee that compares well with regular coffee.  This is not the typical weak decaf blend that is true of many American brands.  Melitta has a rich, deep taste and a nice dark color.  Tastes great black or with cream.  As a stand alone coffee (no cream/sugar) it has a smooth, though strong flavor just like regular coffee.  This coffee is especially great as an after dinner drink.  Strong enough to taste like regular coffee but decaffeinated so it will not prevent sleep later.  Great coffee.

Honestly, you'll spend a crapload of money on K-cups if you don't get the filter for regular ground coffee.  Anyway, I don't know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way, but the water in my Keurig had a hard time seeping through, causing a bit of an overflow.  Aside from that, the taste was smooth and flavorful.  It has a coffee taste, plain and simple.  Is it anything special, not really.  It just tastes good and is reasonably priced.

review/summary: Great coffee flavor but still you know it is decaffeinated
review/text: If Melitta doesn't sell good coffee, who does?  I grew up using Melitta filters and still individually make each cup of coffee in a single cup filter. Generally I use pre ground coffee (so I am not a purist), although I occasionally grind my own.  I usually drink two cups of coffee a day.  Enough about my coffee habits.<br /><br />Melitta is a pretty trusted name in the coffee industry. and I expected this coffee to be be a quality product.  I was not disappointed with the coffee, although it was not quite as exciting as the regular vanilla flavored coffee I recently tried from Melitta.  The flavor was pretty strong and rich, although decaf always has a slight aftertaste, even with the Swiss Water process used for decaffeinating.  Generally. I drink regular coffee as my first choice, but I admit that I switch to decaf in the evening.<br /><br />I have no problem recommending this coffee as a second choice...

review/summary: One of the Best Decaffeninated Coffees I've Tasted
review/text: I am a coffee fan who drinks my coffee black; nothing is added to alter the flavor of the coffee. As a result of this habit I find myself somewhat more critical of how a coffee tastes. As a general rule I prefer an Arabica bean but I could not find a reference to bean type on the bag. Curious I checked their web site and found they use the Arabica bean exclusively.<br /><br />On the front of the bag there is reference to the process used to decaffeinate the Rivera Sunset coffee; the Swiss water process is used. Their web site provides a detailed explanation of this process which involves the removal of water soluble caffeine: "Unroasted coffee beans are immersed in heated water for several hours to remove the water-soluble caffeine present in the beans, as well as those coffee components that easily dissolve in water. The water is then drained from the beans and filtered or processed to remove the caffeine from the water. This decaffeinated water is then reintroduced to the coffee beans, allowing the flavor and aroma components to be absorbed by the coffee. Finally, the coffee is dried and ready for roasting."<br /><br />More information is provided on the web site concerning the bean growing and selection process; I found the web site to be user friendly and well thought out.<br /><br />Another habit of mine is the use of distilled water to brew coffee; I've found that public water supplies can provide water with a multitude of different tastes which can negatively influence the flavor of the coffee.<br /><br />Let me finally mention the flavor of the coffee itself. First it is very smooth and rich; I almost never have more than one cup of coffee at a time but found myself thinking more would be nice. That is very rare! The coffee had a delicate fruity flavor which I found pleasing.<br /><br />I did face one challenge with this coffee; the bag was very difficult to open without tearing it. After working on it for several minutes, I had decided I was not going to let a bag beat me, I discovered that I was able to open it be starting at the end where the bag was folded back. Once I got my finger inside the bag the rest came comparatively easy. Fortunately the two small tears I made in the bag were high enough to fold under when the bag was closed. The bag recommends storage in a refrigerator.<br /><br />This coffee is pleasant and refreshing and I have enjoyed drinking it; if you are a coffee lover you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try and see what you think. I hope you're as pleased with it as I am!

review/text: OK- I have to admit I was a huge SB fan (you know, that big StellarMoney coffee chain on every corner). I didn't expect much from a coffee ordered online, but I take any thoughts back after the first sip of this smooth, rich coffee. There is none of the gritty, acidic after taste of other coffees; but instead a blooming, silky flavor of nuts, mocha, and pure coffee. Mind you, this isn't a flavored coffee, it has all of these nuances built into the Riviera Sunset Decaf blend. Oh- did I forget to mention it's decaf? I couldn't believe it myself when I looked at the bag the second day! I thought it was true, caffinated coffee by the flavor alone, though I did notice the lack of energizing (as would any decaf). Highly recommended... and I am switching!

Plus, I'm not really awake until I smell the coffee brewing - just not morning without it.<br /><br />I tend to buy more affordable (e.g., supermarket type brands) of coffee so I can splurge on tea. So this was a real treat - outstanding aroma just opening the bag, and even better when brewing. Delightfully smooth taste, and highly drinkable black (the only way I drink coffee or tea).<br /><br />My only complaint is opening the bag. Based on what other reviewers stated, I opened it over a plastic bin so it would catch any spills. Very glad I did - an appreciable amount was spilled when I cut into the bag. I decanted it into an air-tight container. I've had this problem with other vacuum packed coffee, but the very fine grind of the Melitta made it even more of a problem.<br /><br />Still, not enough of a problem to warrant taking away a rating star. This makes a wonderful cup of coffee!

review/summary: smooth taste, good hot and iced
review/text: I've tried to give up my coffee habit, but it just hasn't been easy.  DH and I did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago, so I suppose that's something.  I'm a moderate coffee drinker- I like 1-2 cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning, and *love* a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon.  This Melitta "Riviera Sunset" decaf is smooth and doesn't have the bitter aftertaste that I dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop brands.  The flavor is great and I've enjoyed it both hot and iced.

review/summary: very tasty
review/text: What can you say about coffee, either you like it or you don't. I liked this coffee, although when I choose to review it I didn't notice it was decaf. That aside, it tastes fine (made in my Keurig) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one.

review/summary: For decaff,  quite excellent.
review/text: The coffee is excellent, with a smooth taste and pleasant aroma.  It did not have that bitter/plastic  aftertaste you find in a lot of decaf coffees.<br /><br />The grind is very fine,  my cheapo coffee filters let a little bit of the coffee through.  Use good quality filters with this coffee.<br /><br />It was difficult to open the package, and the little wire closer fell off after the second time.  However, I understand why coffee is packages this way, to minimize the exposure of the oils in the coffee to air. And of course a fine grind has a larger surface to mass ratio, making it age even faster.  So I forgive them for the packaging.  You really need an airtight opaque container to store this kind of coffee.<br /><br />Personally I like to grind my coffee right before using, but the convenience and taste of this Melitta  has convinced me that there are other options.

review/summary: Great decaf...
review/text: First, let's talk about the packaging.  I hate when coffee come packaged in bags like this.  They're quite cumbersome and in my opinion, do not keep the coffee fresh enough.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, this was one of the better tasting decaf's I have had.  It has a very rich flavor that you do not normally find with decaffeinated coffee.  It has a wonderful aroma as well.  Very pleased with this product.

review/summary: Smooth For Decaf
review/text: When it comes down to Melitta, they definitely have known for all this time, what it takes to really made a great cup of coffee. With their Cafe Collection, they definitelly bring out the best in flavors for all kinds of coffee lovers, and that is really a strong aroma. With their Rivera Sunset, they definitely bring out a decaffinated taste that feels like it is full of pep at the beginning of the morning. I really love it. The taste is strong and the intimate aroma is just delightful. All in all, I absolutely recommend this as a great treat in the morning to wake up and enjoy.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+

review/summary: Unexpectedly, surprisingly, good!
review/text: I am not much of a coffee drinker, mainly because I do not drink caffeine, and because I have never acquired the taste for coffee. However, I was tempted to try this product, and I was really surprised by how good it tasted.  It did not have any of the bitter after taste, and more importantly, I could not tell that it was decaffeinated.  This is important because most decaf coffees have an "odd" taste to me, but that "oddness" was missing from this product.<br /><br />Furthermore, I had to ask a coffee lover for an opinion, so I asked my mother-in-law, who drinks all kinds of coffees from all over the world almost 5 times a day.  She was skeptical at first, because she refuses to drink decaf.  However, after a few sips of this coffee, she said that although it is a "mild" coffee, it was in fact very tasty and nothing hinted at its decaf origins.  She liked it so much, she poured another cup.<br /><br />Between the two of us, we have almost finished the bag.  It should pass the test from even the pickiest coffee drinkers.  I positively recommend this product, and I hope you enjoy your next cup of coffee from this company.

review/summary: Pretty good for decaff...
review/text: I prepared this coffee in a french press (although it is ground too fine for this).  It had a nice aroma, a full taste and mild bitterness.  It's a fools game to try to describe the taste of anything in any detail-- so I'll just leave you with the coffee was quite good and it would make a good after dinner coffee.<br /><br />My only complaint is the coffee is pre-ground.  Ground coffee is a bit stale by the time you get it, however, a blade grinder will ruin the coffee as well.<br /><br />If you don't own a burr-grinder, this is the best cup of decaff you're going to get.

review/summary: Excellent tasting coffee, naturally decaffeinated
review/text: This is the best decaf my family and I have tried in a long time. It's smooth, not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other brands I've tried. I like that it's decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals. That's a big plus for me because many brands don't tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee. I usually buy whole bean, but this ground is so nice and fine, and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right. I'd suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste, seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor. This is one I'll be buying again.

review/summary: Great way to start (or finish) the day
review/text: This review is from my wife:<br /><br />"I'm not one who has all the right words for describing taste and flavor, unfortunately.  I say "unfortunately" because this is a very good tasting coffee and it deserves elegant description.  What I can tell you is that it has no edgy bitterness.  No bitterness at all, actually.  It's rich and smooth.  Yum.<br /><br />I use a European coffee press for brewing and this grind worked beautifully in that.  Not too course, not small enough to make a mess through the screen."

review/summary: Gourmet coffee for decaf lovers!
review/text: At last- a decaf coffee that doesn't taste decaf!  Smooth, rich, flavorful, with no bitter aftertaste.  Starbucks worthy (but to my husband who doesn't care for Starbucks, it's way better).  We like to drink this in the evening and it's basically dessert with cream and sugar.

review/summary: Mmmm, there's nothing like a good cup of coffee!
review/text: Melitta's cafe collection gourmet coffee is wonderful. It tastes rich, and just like a gourmet coffee should.  This coffee tasted like something I could have gotten in Europe at a cafe.<br /><br />It brewed very quickly, and with no coffee grain residue.  This is probably due to the coffee being an extra fine grind. The decaffinated version tasted great on its own, without milk or sugar to season.<br /><br />I'm a coffee lover, and I enjoy Gevalia and Godiva coffee-two other excellent foregn brands.  The Melitta stands on its own, and are their equivalents in taste and price. Enjoy a cup today!

review/summary: Best Decaf EVER
review/text: Soon as I got this bag of decaf I made a big mug and it filled my house with the wonderful aroma of high quality fresh brewed coffee.  It is very finely ground but I still used the same amount I normally do and it turned out great.  I added some soy milk, sat back, and enjoyed my rare treat of an after-noon coffee break!!!  Definitely will buy some of this for the winter months so I can treat myself to excellent hot coffee any time of the day or night!

review/summary: Strong flavor for a decaf brand!
review/text: I often find with decaf coffee to be somewhat on the weak side: not in this product.  The coffee had a strong grip, but not bitter, and had a smooth rounded experience when a creamer is used (note this coffee works well with a soy creamer).  You do not need to apply any extra heap of coffee to compensate for a 'decaf' option!  With such a strong grip, I would not recommend milk or low fat milk as you might as well drink it as is!

review/summary: So-So - average for decaf
review/text: The aroma of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4">Melitta Cafe Collection Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated Ground Coffee, 10-Ounce Bags)</a> was fairly weak. Scent, after all, is a huge part of taste, and this was disappointing.<br /><br />Even though I added more coffee grinds than the directions instructed, I found the coffee to be a bit bland. The taste was more than flavored water, but not amazingly so, with no subtle overtones. It wasn't bitter, but it wasn't much of anything.<br /><br />While I generally drink hi-test as opposed to decaffeinated, I do drink decaf at least twice a week. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4">Melitta</a> was comparable to the generic brand that I usually have.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4">Melitta Cafe Collection riviera Sunset Decaf</a> isn't a bad coffee, but it's not worth the money if there are other options available.
