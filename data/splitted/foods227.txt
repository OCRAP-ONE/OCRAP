review/summary: Gluten Free Goodies!
review/text: I had used Chebe Bread mix in its original form. That was quite a while ago, and for some reason I'd gotten away from using it until recently. Chebe bread has come a long way! I ordered a case of the All-purpose and used it to make a nice gluten free pie crust for my Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie, and also then used it to make stuffing. And then MORE to make dinner rolls...all came out very well. I am very pleased. If you go to the Chebe website you can find many more recipes which is nice because for each recipe it tells you which versions of Chebe Bread Mix can be used for which recipes (and now there are 5 or more varieties of this Mix). I am planning on trying out the Sticky rolls and a pizza crust with this Mix so I will see how that goes. The mix, is very fine and fly away....so you want to take it easy when opening it and pouring into the bowl or you will have a fine dusting of powder around the area you are mixing it in. I have really been pretty pleased with the items I have made from the Chebe All-Purpose Mix.

review/summary: So happy to discover this mix!
review/text: I thought our days of having delicious grinders, Cuban midnight sandwiches, calzones and other treats were over when I found out that my children and I had celiac disease.  Not so!  You can make all kinds of goodies with this mix, and we keep it as a pantry staple.  It's quick and easy to mix, needing only egg, oil and milk and unlike a lot of other gluten free doughs, it's not sticky which makes it easy to roll out, or form into shapes. We love it.

review/summary: Very High Salt Content + Expensive - I Found a Solution
review/text: My husband and I are both gluten intolerant and we watch our salt.  The buns are easy to make and tasty but they are too salty.  The nutrition statement for this product is very confusing.  The package states that the box of mix will make four buns.  The nutrition statement, on the side of the package, states that a bun contains 140 mg sodium.  But, when you read the fine print, you can see that the nutrition statement is actually based on making 10 tiny buns from one package.  So, using the package to make four buns, each bun would actually contain 350 mg sodium.  For anybody watching their sodium, that's too much salt for one bun.<br /><br />Also, four not-very large buns from one box of mix is pretty expensive.<br /><br />I realized that there's not much else in this mix except tapioca (manioc) flour and salt.  You add your own wet ingredients and, optionally, cheese.<br /><br />My solution:  I found many recipes on the Web, in English, for manioc buns or pao de queijo which is the Brazilian name for manioc buns.  The recipes that I found are esentially the same as the instructions on the Chebe box.  I bought Bob's Red Mill tapioca flour (four 20 oz bags for about $12.00) from Amazon.  To use up my remaining boxes of Chebe mixes, to dilute the salt level, in a bowl, I emptied the box of Chebe mix, added the same amount of Bob's unsalted tapioca flour (2 cups), and double the amount of wet ingredients required just to make the mix.<br /><br />The resulting dough was stickier than the original Chebe mix, but the buns that I made were incredibly good.  They tasted similar to southern biscuits.  They were hot and steaming with an excellent texture.  I baked them in an ungreased stoneware pan and they did not stick to the pan.<br /><br />After I've finished my remaining the Chebe mixes, I'll attempt to make more buns by using the rest of my Bob's tapioca flour with the same proportions of wet and dry ingredients that the Chebe mix uses.<br /><br />I'm not an experienced baker - does anybody have any idea how to make my lower salt dough less sticky - more oil, more liquid, more flour?

review/text: I found this to be a little too doughy if I followed the actual directions. Here's what I did for a crispy, delicious crust every time:<br /><br />Roll out as directed.<br />Place in oven (at temp on package) for ten minutes, without toppings. I used a pizza stone.<br />Flip the dough over -- so that the top, slightly crispy side is now the bottom -- and then put the toppings on.<br /><br />Best gluten free pizza dough I have tasted yet!

review/summary: Old formula is better, but the new works too
review/text: I not only have non-celiac gluten intolerance, but anaphylaxis to corn, so I use this mix primarily for tortillas.  I figured out that Chebe had changed it's formula when trying to make them one day.  I followed the package directions as usual, & got a gooey, sticky mess that would not roll out into tortillas.  Then next time I made tortillas I used 2 TBLS water (1/2 the amount called for), 2 TBLS olive oil & 1 egg & omitted the cheese.  This mixture seems a little dry, but once kneaded it works perfectly!  As one reviewer said, Chebe is changing back to the original formula & if it were unchanged, I would have given the mix 5 stars.  My 6 year old is also gluten intolerant & allergic to corn & he loves these topped with cheese to make cheese crisps.  Fry the dough & you have a great base for Navajo tacos or tostados!

review/summary: Bring back the old recipe!
review/text: I've been using Chebe mix for years, always a huge fan. It seems however, that along the new packaging (the cardboard boxes as opposed to the older version packed in bags) the recipe was changed as well - for the worse! Now it has this weird, medicine-like chemical smell to it! Awful, just awful. At first I thought that it was just a single lemon among the 2 8-packs I bought, but every other one was just as bad. I gave up after using using a few packages and threw out the rest.<br />I recently tried buying from another source (vitacost), and here we go again - same thing!<br />I don't know if it's the recipe or maybe they changed the source of their ingredients, and I really hope they go back to the original version, cause this one is just bad (to put it mildly).

review/text: For anybody who has food allergies or intolerances (gluten, soy, corn, dairy, etc.), Chebe products are an excellent alternative. You may have to play around with the recipe (or create your own) to get the result you want. With this all-purpose mix I make hard rolls using water instead of milk and scone-like biscuits adding light brown sugar and a teaspoon of baking powder. I highly recommend Chebe products!

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: My son has several allergies.  We were looking for anything that we could use that would pass as bread for his school lunches.  We were just hoping that it would be good enough, but we were surprised with Chebe.  It is actually very good.  We all liked it.  With the second batch we tried to make, the dough came out very sticky.  We called Chebe customer service and they helped us figure out the problem.  Very fast and friendly.  They even replaced the goofed up batch.  It is perfect for sandwiches at lunch and with jelly on it for breakfast.

review/text: Excellent GF bread mix.  I use it to make dinner rolls with grated cheese mixed in, and melted garlic butter brushed on top.  Very easy and tasty.  Even the rest of my family who can eat gluten like these rolls.  Also makes good sandwich buns.  I always keep it on hand.  You do have to mix the dough by hand, and it is very sticky, so I use more oil than the directions call for, and put oil on my hands before I start mixing it.

The bread is a little chewy, which we love, but soft enough for a child to enjoy. I buy Chebe on Amazon because I can buy several boxes at a time at a price cheaper than a grocery store.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I was diagnosed with a severe gluten intolerance back in January. The main thing I really missed was bread products and all the bread mixes/loaves I read about were just ok and very over priced so I never tried them. I saw someone rave about this bread mix and since it was at one my local grocery stores at a cheap price I decided to try it. It was amazing and tasted like "normal" bread. It doesn't rise if you're making a bread loaf due to the mix having no yeast but I've made pizza crust, bread, hamburger buns, and cinnamon rolls and they have all turned out great. My husband loves this bread and he can eat gluten. Highly recommend to anybody who can't eat gluten and wants bread products.

review/text: We've been using Chebe products for a couple of years now, enjoying the rolls, pizza crust, cheese sticks etc.  But yesterday, we tried making Calzone, which prompted me to write this review.  We followed the recipe on the insert (not the one on the package, it's slightly different) to the letter, and came out with a crisp, tasty product that even the pickiest Italian cook would have to approve.  So be creative -- it's worth the effort.  You don't have to be celiac / gluten free to enjoy it.  (I'm not, my husband is.)

review/text: Well what a surprise!  This stuff is really quite easy and good.  I used my vitamix to make the dough and it was a bit too much for it (sticky) - unfortunately hand blended is easier on kitchen equipment.  But you don't have to worry about handling the dough too much.  The thinner the end product the better it cooks inside. My current fav is a mini french bread loaf.  Crispy outside and slightly 'holey' inside. I made cheese bread sticks in with the plain mix and kneeding shredded cheese into it.  There is a slight odd, but not objectionable, taste which dipping in chili or smearing with butter covers up.  Next project - PIZZA!!!!!

review/summary: Best substitute yet
review/text: Bread was the hardest gluten free item for me to make. Even with the best recipe, while the taste was good, the texture was still crumbly. This is the closest to real bread since it has a chew to it and the dough is actually elastic instead of sticky and breaking apart. It also bakes up a nice golden color instead of the pale bread I usually get. Each bag doesn't make a lot of dough though. I get 5 smallish sandwich rolls which I make by flattening rounds of dough. I find I have to bake it longer than stated or it is a bit tacky. I hope there are more recipes coming.

review/summary: Chebe mixes make gluten free living so much easier!
review/text: This product is a basic bread mix that uses an unusual little known carbohydrate here in the USA. However Manioc is used throughout South America daily as their national bread. It is an easy recipe, generally using eggs and a small anount of milk(soy or other substitute can used as well)and oil. It rises on it's own and produces a chewy light yellow product. I highly recommend it. One of the best things(for me)no zanthan gum which bothers my stomach when too much is used.. The only mix I have pause to recommend is the pizza, as it is highly spiced...nothing but cheese and straight tomato sauce needed. Done that way---perfect pizza! Mange ...

review/summary: Good and Easy
review/text: The Aroy-D curries in the can are surprisingly delicious and make super easy meals.  I eat them several times a week.  I make my own curry from time to time, but this is just so tasty and easy that I can hardly resist just opening a can, tossing in some meat and vegetables and having delicious Thai curry in a few minutes.  I even serve this to guests who are always impressed.  It is a bit on the spicy side, so when I know that my diners won't like that, that's when I have to make my own. Also, I keep several cans at work for lunches; I can just bring in some leftover meat and veggies to toss in and heat and eat! Yum!

review/summary: NOT "Pure Matcha Green Tea"
review/text: The ingredients say Green Tea Matcha powder.  There is no mention of sugar in the contents.  This is a product that contains sugar.  NOT GOOD FOR DIABETICS or people who can not have sugar.  Also the color is not bright green but more of an olive/tan color.  This product description is very misleading.  I will return to the 100% organic Green Tea Matcha powder from Eden Foods which I have purchased in the past and was extremely happy. BUYERS BEWARE!

review/text: These are inexpensive great treats. I bought them at Walmart several times and Walmart is always sold out because they are a great deal. I decided to go to the web to find them. The 18 ounce bag is actually 72 small bones. The picture says 7, but it is 72. My two spoiled dogs love them. I am glad to find them on this web site so I can purchase them. Buying enough bags for free shipping makes it easier than going to Walmart every week to find they are sold out.

review/summary: Do research, don't expect complete success.
review/text: I live in Florida and according to research I've done, these can grow in this area. I received 8 seeds in a timely fashion. The company provided a page of basic information about seed growing. The seeds themselves had a sentence of instructions which I've followed. I've begun attempting germinating 4 of the 8 seeds with 4 different techniques including soaking for 18 hours, and using a damp paper towel, etc. It is week 4 and the seeds have not germinated yet. I've done research and I can't find any answers. Perhaps they're just duds? If anyone can help, please contact me. I will update this review if I get any new results.<br /><br />Couple of months and no germination. Perhaps I'll have to do more research, but I believe the seeds were just duds.

review/summary: Excellent plant for growth in Sunny Areas
review/text: The sugar apple tree is a very beautiful tree to have in your backyard. First, it grows relatively fast compared to other trees. Second, trees germinated from seed will produce fruit in 2-3 years. Third, it is easy to grow in sunny weather. Now, here comes the best part, the suggar apple fruit is AWESOME!!!!!, and likely it will become your favorite fruit after you eat it. So down to business, how do you grow the tree? Get a small pot with good soil (rich in nutrients), and put 4 seeds next to each other and about 3 mm or so deep in the soil. It is important that the seeds are covered by the soil but not deep into it. Next, water your pot+seeds. Important, these seeds like rain water and germinate fast with it. Good luck with your tree adventure my friends!!!!!

review/text: I have been a great fan of pickles (big and small) since I was a little girl. There is something about that great kosher dill flavor - they are sour, salty and savory all at once. It brings great joy to say that Vlasic Kosher Dill Gherkin Pickles definitely are worth a bite (or two). For starters, the pickles are small enough to use them as a side accent to any sandwich (I am thinking ruben or smoked turkey) or as a nice "extra" for a vegetable platter. When refrigerated, the gherkins become crunchier and taste better. Num num num.....

This is a great sauce for someone who wants something hot enough that they can't taste the food, but if you want to make your food taste better, this isn't the stuff to get.  If you want to show off how manly you are by eating hot things that other people can't eat, this will do that for you, but for someone looking for the best hot sauce to enhance their meal, you need to look elsewhere.

After settling down, I only discovered a few hours later that the fun was not over, as I felt a similar burning joy on the other end of my body (read: my anus). I can't say I recommend this sauce, unless you plan on throwing it in the eyes of your biggest enemy (in which case it would be really effective). Could've spent the money on another lap dance.. 2 stars for really being spicy though..

review/summary: Outstanding product
review/text: This is true high quality methi seed. For those that are familiar with this spice, nough said, and for those that are not I can only ask you to try it in your gourmet cooking. You will find many different reviews on it on the net, some filed with blessings and some filled with warnings. This plant compatibility is very specific, so to evaluate you need to try and decide for yourself. Nobody said that Eskimos and Somali will be happy on the same diet. To explain details: do you remember those small cubes of "whatever" with names like "instant chicken soup" or something like that? Well, those are now, by our modern standards made of things that you would be reluctant today to give to your dog. The funny thing is, they are still in production and people eat it. Here now is the real thing that started it all, natural, no nonsense, used by generations in many places like Argentina, China, India and few other countries for hundreds of years. It is called Fenugreek. Buy it, add one tea spoon to a quart of your soup before boiling, and find out how it makes your meal wholesome, healthy, custom and aromatic. If you prefer macaroni and cheese flushed with aspartame and saccharine US food this is most likely not for you and you should stick to your plastic burgers, but if you are searching for wholesome and specific flavors combines with medicinal values, this product will be just what you need in your kitchen. When I got it opened in my house, the "oh my God..." was what I have heard from wife and kids. Then I purchased 5 more bags and vacuum packed it. You get an idea. LOL<br />Remark: this is high quality dehydrated natural seed, just like premium dry rice, so if you want to get what it does, pour hot water over a bit of it and let it stand for 24 hours, then taste and decide.

review/summary: As good as bagged can get
review/text: Of course no bagged tea can ever be the "best tea ever", but in the realm of bagged, this tea is about the best you could ever ask for.<br /><br />Twinings Everyday is just that- a tea that's perfect every day of the week. It's a light black tea, with a nice easy flavor that has just a pinch of citrus. Steep it more lightly and you get an almost white tea flavor, longer to go darker. The only reason any tea enthusiast should be disappointed is if they prefer especially strong brews. My father-in-law is the type that would eat the leaves if he could, so he'd have to use extra bags to make the sort of insanely strong brew he prefers. Then again, that's why it comes in boxes of eighty.<br /><br />The actual flavor is perfectly balanced, and suits whatever bells and whistles you want to tack on. If you want to drink it as is, it's wonderful. It goes perfect with lemon, or with milk, and I've found it's also wonderful with honey and sugar. In short, this tea suits whatever you're in the mood for.<br /><br />I recommend this tea enthusiastically. I wound up picking up a box on clearance, and couldn't be happier. If you love tea, this is the perfect default to keep at hand when you can't decide which specialty brew to have. If you've never really gotten into tea, this is the pefect blend to learn what the fuss is about. This tea does lend itself more to afternoon and blending with milk or sweeteners, but it's fine in any situation.

review/summary: I gave up coffee for this tea!  It's that good.
review/text: This is the best tea I've ever had, and I have basically given up coffee in favor of it.  I usually buy several boxes at a time and one box seems to last a few months (drinking a few posts per day).  One of these tea bags brews an entire 32oz tea pot with great flavor.  If you love black tea you should give this a try----it's smooth and flavorful. Shipping is a little slow, but definitely worth the wait.

review/summary: Best tea for the ol' Brown Betty
review/text: While living for a month in Scotland in a self catering we had settled into this tea from the Co-Op as our favorite. When we returned to the states we put away our coffee machine and went with pots of tea for breakfast. Great stuff! The longer you steep it the fuller the flavor ... max about 8 minutes. Brought home 4 boxes in our suitcases. The tea was so good we donated clothes to the local charity to make room for it. When we got back to the states and ran out we replinished our supply with Amazon ... thanks for being so global Amazon! :-) Cheers!

review/summary: As the box says...
review/text: ...this is the "Finest Quality Everyday Black Tea."<br /><br />I bought a box at a discount/odd-lot store (in the US...a box of 100 bags, by the way), because it was cheap. I simply needed some moderately good black tea for the office, and since it was Twinings I assumed it would be more than adequate. But it has been a very pleasant surprise. It is not only good tea, a great bargain for the price. It is, as it claims, of the finest quality. I can't think of a brand or variety of bagged black tea (I'm excluding specialty and flavored varieties, and loose teas) that even comes close to this for flavor. It's the best in the category.<br /><br />Sadly...I haven't seen it again at that store, and this doesn't seem to be an item that's generally available in the US. For anyone willing to search, the UPC on this box is 70177-24681, and the packaging has a 2007 copyright date. The contact info on the box leads me to believe this might have been originally destined for Australia or New Zealand.

review/summary: Spanish Saffron from SimplyBeautiful -- Simply Beautiful!
review/text: When my wife unwrapped the new saffron package from SimplyBeautiful and opened the the little plastic pouch holding the 1 ounce of delicate deep red threads of saffron the fragrance emitting from it delighted both of us. We have been using saffron for several years in a variety of dishes, such as plain rice or risotto, hot milk drinks and some soups. We absolutely love it and would use it even more if it were not so frightfully expensive. Fortunately, just a little bit of saffron does a great job flavoring and coloring a dish in an attractive yellow hue, and 1 ounce goes a long way.<br /><br />SimplyBeautiful's saffron was as fresh and perfectly aromatic as could be. We shall definitely reorder it when our present supply runs out.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Charles Gregory

review/text: I have been buying saffron from them since the past three years and they have never failed me. Have ordered like 8 of these 1 ounce tins for family and they keep asking for more.<br />The quality of the saffron is fantastic. You can tell by the smell. It is a little pricey, but it is how it is. Saffron is one of the most expensive spices out there and you get what you pay for. But the upside is, only a little is enough. We have even divided these into 5 portions and put them in a decorative case to give them as gifts after our daughter was born. People actually call to ask where we get our saffron from.<br /><br />I am really happy with the product and will not try anything else.

review/summary: Served Succulent Meals With this Saffron
review/text: The following review will incorporate the views of both the taster (in this case me) and the skilled chef (mom naturally!)  This saffron from first appearance and smell can easily be pegged as what we endearingly call "the good stuff".  The threads have a nice coarseness to them that are to be expected from top quality saffron.  Upon closer scrutiny we hardly found any hint of "styles", or in other words, the wasteful little white things at the end of the stigmas.  While the aroma gives a nice pungent and earthy smell, both my mother and myself still prefer the eau de toilette of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00250QHZU">Gathering Saffron</a>.<br /><br />Upon preparing a chicken kabob marination with this saffron, we were delighted with the marvellous color developing on the meat.  It was the classic golden hue with little crimson squiggles of the stigma remnants.  As effective a painter as this particular saffron was, my mother did mention to me that the only drawback was the quantity in which it took to get the desired effect.  Therefore its potency may be outperformed by other higher quality saffron brands.<br /><br />Once our banquet was ready to be served and I took the first bite, I was lost in its tangy and tart flavors.  The chicken barely stood up to the pressure of the knife and was incredibly tender in my mouth.  It was near impossible for me to leave any piece of such a delectable plate unfinished.  Though everyone out there may not necessarily get the same exact results, you will be far from disappointed if you purchase this.  So despite the better alternatives out there both my mother and myself recommend this saffron.

review/summary: Excellent Berry Flavor!
review/text: Keeping in mind that this is not a sweet sparkling beverage, this is very good.  It is sparkling mountain spring water with flavor; however, if you wish a sweet beverage, simple add one little packet of your favorite artificial sweetener (Sugar Twin, Equal, etc.) and it is a perfectly sweetened delight.  The berry favor comes out more with the sweetener. Warning, though, when you add the sweetener to this drink, it will fizz up a lot, so be prepared to put the screw lid on REAL fast or put the drink in a glass first.  I've gotten pretty good at putting the cap back on fast.  Anyway, this is good stuff.  They also make sweetened drinks with no salt or calories, if that is what you are looking for.  A+ in my book!

review/text: If you are looking for non-sweetened lightly flavored sparkling water you couldn't do better than TalkingRain.  It comes in several flavors, but my favorite is Berry.  I have always enjoyed carbonated drinks, but so many are too sweet.  Drink too many of those and you end up needing to diet.  With TalkingRain there is no such problem.  And if you don't particularly like plain water, this is the solution.  When my son-in-law tasted it I had to double my order.

review/summary: Tasty discovery!
review/text: I found this package of red quinoa at a local health food store. I'd never bought quinoa before, so I thought it was a little expensive. But now that I've taken a trip to another natural food store -- the kind that carries food in bulk -- I realize it's the going rate.<br /><br />That said, I really love this red quinoa. The Eden Organic brand is much more tasty than the more expensive kind that I got at the bulk health food store. After having regular quinoa at a picnic last week, I must say that both of the brands of red quinoa have more flavor and interest than regular quinoa.<br /><br />I have two all-time favorite recipes now, one that mixes the quinoa with craisins, sunflower seeds, feta cheese, scallions and cilatro with a mustard vinaigrette (my own recipe). The other salad (on the Wegmans website) mixes the red quinoa with avocado, corn, tomatoes, scallions and cilantro in a lemon vinaigrette.

I have wanted to, since this grain is immeasurably better for you than just about any other grain but I was fearful of what would happen when I did cook with it. There is NO NEED to fear it. This stuff is a breeze to cook. Easier than rice on the stovetop (PLUS- It cooks well in a rice cooker). I have been trying it many ways and am ready to order more.

I would not have bought them otherwise.<br /><br />I didn't mind most of the other flavorings, but the MSG is just not a necessary ingredient  Furthermore, there is NO contact information for the company on the label.

review/text: This is the second flavor from Izze I have tried.  The first was the Clementine.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Blackberry.  Unlike the Clementine flavor the name of the drink also makes up one of the juices used to make the beverage, blackberry.  Like the Clementine a cocktail of juices from concentrate are added like Apple Juice and Lemon Juice to give a balanced flavor.<br /><br />This is not a drink to hydrate in quantity so much as a tasty pick me up.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />90 calories for just over 8 ounces is starting to get up there for me.  That is enough calories that I at least have to think about when I drink the beverage.  A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book.  The only issue I had is the calories.

review/summary: Real Fruit Juices With Added Carbonation, But No Added Sugar
review/text: Our nearby Fresh and Easy grocery store has a small section of premium soft drinks and some of them are really good. Just recently I purchased a 4-pack of Izze Sparkling Blackberry. It's an assortment of concentrated fruit juices dominated by blackberry with added carbonated water. The label says 70% fruit juices. This is not your average fruit-flavored soda pop, folks. This is real fruit juice and with no added  sugar. The taste is delicious and the blackberry stands out real nicely. The drink has a lot of natural sugars, but you don't get that sickening sweet taste I associate with so many of the  cheaper soft drinks. In fact, the drink has a slight sour bite to it and it's very pleasant. This stuff is more expensive, but maybe it's worth it. Personally, I'm looking forward to trying some of the other varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I've tried just about every flavor out there that i can find of Izze Sparkling soda and I've loved every sip of it. Izze is a wonderful combination of juice and sparkling water. The blackberry flavor is a blend of grape, apple, lemon, raspberry and, of course, blackberry. The mixture together seems to taste as much like blackberry as popping a fresh punch of blackberries into your mouth.<br /><br />The sweetness is the natural sweetness of fruit, and there is nothing added to make it artificial tasting. This is a super substitute for ordinary sodas. It's a much healthier choice!<br /><br />Very highly recommended!

review/text: *****<br />This Izze Sparkling Blackberry Soda isn't exactly a soda and isn't a really a juice---it's a healthy alternative drink that's a bit of a combination of the two. It contains a lovely medley of healthy juices without sweeteners except for the actual juice concentrate. For fizz and refreshment it includes 30% sparkling water.<br /><br />The juices it contains are: white grape juice, apple juice, blackberry juice, and lemon and raspberry juice concentrates. It also contains sparkling water, citric acid, natural flavor, red grape juice concentrate for color, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacinimide, and pyridoxine hydrocholoride (vitamin B6). All of this together surprisingly tastes exactly like blackberries!<br /><br />Izze Blackberry is very sweet but light (not thick and syrupy). The adults in my household really like it and I think children would enjoy it too. There's really nothing not to like about this healthy juice or soda alternative beverage!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
