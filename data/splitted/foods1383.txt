review/summary: My toddler gave this the thumbs down
review/text: My toddler (24 months old, very verbal, usually will eat anything) took a couple of bites looked at me with a surprised and smirkish look of confusion and said, "Soupy..." then gave me a skeptical look and tried a few more bites.  Then she giggled and said, "Mama - that yucky" and proceeded to wipe her napkin on her tongue.<br /><br />I love most of the Happy Baby and Happy Tot products, but I guess this was a no go.<br /><br />If you are wondering, the meal is actually very soupy and has all of the ingredients chopped up quite small and is mixed up like a stew.  You cook it 30 seconds in the microwave and then eat.  It couldn't be self fed with fingers.<br /><br />Hope that review helps!

review/summary: Convenient and healthy
review/text: These organic meal bowls are a great option for lunches/dinners when I need something healthy, fast. I keep them in my pantry for those kind of days. 30 seconds in the microwave and you have a healthy, organic meal. I was a bit surprised when I first purchased these bowls to find that the meal is not like a tv dinner (meat in one part of the tray, veggies in another). Instead, the turkey and vegetables and sauce are combined, like a chunky puree. This actually turns out to be a good thing, because my sometimes-picky toddler is more likely to eat the veggies this way (because they are combined with the rest of the meal). My son's appetite is getting bigger now, so I only wish that the portions on these were bigger because he loves them!

review/summary: Super Yummy ... LOVE the Convenience!
review/text: My daughter (3 1/2) LOVES the flavor of the Veggie, Brown Rice and Turkey toddler meal bowl, and so do I!  Rather than a soup, I think the consistency is closer to a stew.  So, a toddler that wants to pick up food with their hands (without using a utensil) might not be as interested in this, but if they are using utensils, this can definitely be easily eaten with a fork or spoon (but certainly could be eaten with hands as well).  All the ingredients blend well together, and I love the fact that it is so portable ... fully cooked, ready to eat ... just heat and serve!  Add to that that it is organic (no artificial ingredients), contains Salba (chia), and comes in a BPA free plastic bowl, and this is definitely a home run for us!!

review/summary: Fire roasting adds flavor
review/text: I use a lot of canned tomatoes in cooking, and have started to use fire roasted in place of plain diced tomatoes in recipies where I want a more smokey flavor.  I drain a can and sprinkle them on pizza along with grilled vegetables and some crumbled feta cheese.  Also use them to make a quick vegetable soup with some added frozen vegetables, oregano and chicken broth.  I don't find a great deal of flavor in most canned tomato products, and have appreciated the extra flavor in these.

review/summary: A flavorful alternative to he produce section
review/text: A while back, I realized that the produce section tomatoes I was buying didn't taste like the tomatoes I remembered from 60 years ago. While I'm sure that Tomatoland documents this better than I can, they tasted like cardboard, had thick and tough skins, were gassed into looking red and ripe when they weren't, and worst of all were costing me $2-3 a pound and more.<br /><br />Gourmet alert (or maybe I mean gourmand alert)! What I'm going to say next may upset you if you have preconceived ideas about how to eat tomatoes<br /><br />Like any other enterprising senior citizen who is tight on cash, I switched to these when using tomatoes in salads. Actually, what I started doing was tossing these into a colander, along with garbanzos, mushrooms, black pitted olives, and green salad olives. I prefer these diced tomatoes over canned generic diced tomatoes, because the garlic gives them more taste and depth of flavor. And then I toss a portion of the concoction over lettuce. Sometimes I just eat it by itself. With dressing, of course, whatever seems handy at the time.<br /><br />I consider it a win when I can get these for $1.15 a can or less, but I will go up to $1.25 a can before I start checking the supermarket sales instead. By the way, this should make pretty good salsa as well when mixed with hot peppers, but I haven't tried that yet. I also have mixed these in with spaghetti sauce to give it more body. Since I use cheap sauces like Ragu, these help dress it up a lot.<br /><br />Bon appetite!

Only thing I don't know is how they compare to smoked kippers/herring (Brunswick, King Oscar, etc) but I'll have to find out now that Sprats aren't available locally anymore.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like sardines, you'll LOVE sprats.

review/summary: Very small fish...
review/text: These are much smaller than sardines and herrings. RIGA SPRATS are sold by the country of LATVIA. Do not have the strong smell or taste of sardine at all and that is why a pound of sardine cost less than $2.00 dollars and sprats cost more which is the same as herrings from Germany. Herrings and sardines are bigger and packaged mostly in Morocco and Germany. Latvia joined the EU food lately so you need to check the expiration date on the cans since they used to sell expired cans which I got myself. I consume these and few other brands. Sprats do not feed on anything big so not only they do not have mercury but more importantly since sprats are so small and feed on plankton which is the same food for whales, it is probably one of the healthiest fish out there. Comes from cold waters of Baltic sea. Approximately some 27 count of fish in a can, smoked in vegetable oil. I love the sprats itself but each can has some 1000 MG of sodium which is not low so I drain the oil since vegetable oil is unhealthy, regardless of the type specified, and never trust when they claim olive oil either, to get ride of the oil and the unhealthy salt and then consume the fish. It goes well with crackers unlike sardines. It is excellent with salads as well... A very healthy wild fish with true fish qualities. Bravo.

I the beginning I survived on boost, which I still drink, but it is a bit too sweet after a while and doesn't have fiber.  That in addition to pain meds led to some pretty bad constipation (sorry for the TMI).  It is not super filling as advertised, but that is good in my case 'cause I need to get as many calories as I can.  Anyway, I think the taste is quite good, sweet, but not too sweet like others can be.  I've also tried the strawberry and find the vanilla to taste much better.

review/summary: These Pinenuts are From CHINA!
review/text: The Amazon description says that this is made in USA, which should mean exactly what it says. Instead the nuts are products of CHINA and are only packaged in the USA! I'm glad I ordered only one package of these nuts. The company should change its name to Cubic Zirconia Foods, Inc.

review/text: I discovered this delightful product while visiting San Fran a couple of years ago. Bought a jar and brought it home and was forever hooked! Imagine my delight when I found it here on Amazon.com!  I like to eat it with plain or garlic hummus and pita chips for lunch. I feel I have consumed a delicious, healthy, protein-packed, meal with the hummus and flax seeds. There are so many ways it can be used but I don't ever have any left to use for anything else!

review/summary: The price is right
review/text: We have a little Maltese that we spoil to no end.  These treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them.<br /><br />He can be a little picky.  Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Amazon, Zuke's Jerky Naturals.  I will say that we tried two different kinds.  Along with these, we tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MLKXOU">Wellness WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch</a>.<br /><br />The Zuke's are really potent.  When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are.  They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one).  The Wellness treats seem a little dryer.  While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness.  Plus they're cheaper so that's even better.  He can't get enough of them.<br /><br />We also tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a> made by Zuke's.  He doesn't like those as much as the Greenies.<br /><br />I would say that this product is one of the best we found for our dog.  Plus we were able to take advantage of the free super saver shipping as well.  These are highly recommended.<br /><br />[Edit: August 14, 2011]<br /><br />He still loves them!<br /><br />We've had to start giving our little guy Remedel for a little shoulder injury he had.  These Zukes make it real easy to give him the pill.  Since they're moist, we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill.  That way he doesn't even know he's taking it.  Trying to give him pills with the Wellness treats doesn't work so well since they're dryer.<br /><br />[Edit: September 29, 2012]<br /><br />Anyone else notice that they seem different??  The last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle.  They also weren't as potent as the other ones were.  He doesn't seem to like them as much any more.  I don't know if the bags we bought were partially opened so they dried out by the time the were delivered or if their recipe changed.  I'll buy some more and see how they turn out.  A little disappointed...

review/summary: Tough, brittle, completely dehydrated, and unsafe.
review/text: I bought two bags of these, thinking it was the same product that I used to buy in different packaging (light blue, with a see-through dog shape against a grass green background). Unfortunately, it was completely not the same thing! These treats were actually like jerky-- tough and brittle. I give my dog soft treats because he doesn't chew the damn things, and he choked on these horrible things; I had to toss them out.<br /><br />Note that the "Zuke's Jerky Naturals" with the other packaging (http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPY) have always been moist and soft, and I've never had a problem with those. I suspect that this batch was not new packaging, as I had thought, but very old packaging; these may be the same treats I usually feed my dog, just having sat on a shelf for years. In any case, these were COMPLETELY different treats, and not safe to feed my dog.

review/text: I'm constantly looking for healthy dog treats that are not crazy expensive.  These are one of the better deals I could find when considering cost/ounce.  My Lab absolutely loves them and they are good for him too.  The treats are soft and moist, which is a plus for my dog.  They could easily be broken into smaller pieces, but I generally just give my dog a whole one when he does something good.  I wouldn't keep them in my pocket because they do smell a bit.  It's not an overly offensive smell, but strong enough that you don't want to carry it around with you all day.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these for all dogs.

review/summary: Dogs love these!
review/text: We normally don't buy expensive treats (tend to stick to dry biscuits), but we got these for all of the family dogs as stocking stuffers for Christmas. They were a huge hit! Our dog is willing to do anything imaginable to get one of these. My boyfriend's mom, who totally spoils her Portie, hadn't seen these before, and her dog loved these like crazy as well, so she went out bought a bunch more when they ran out. Also, they're natural and there are no shady ingredients, so they are good for your pooch!<br /><br />Just to clarify, these don't actually have the consistency of jerky. They are little squares of what looks like pressed meat product. Clearly, our dogs do not care and consume these with great enthusiasm, so still very highly recommended!

review/summary: The only treats I'll use.
review/text: These treats are excellent. I have a chihuahua who has done obedience training and is now in agility training. I use the treats to aid with his training as they are easy to break into small pieces yet big enough for me to carry in my pocket and grab easily.<br /><br />They have NEVER made him sick no matter how many he eats during a training session and he goes absolutely NUTS when he hears me open the bag.<br /><br />I've purchased the smaller sized treats by Zukes, but they seem to be harder and are too big to offer a small dog as a treat, yet too difficult to split into smaller pieces. So, I find the square shaped ones to be much easier to use for training.<br /><br />They CAN get hard if the bag is left open so you need to make sure to close the bag immediately. I read another poster mention that putting a damp paper towel in the bag will restore the moisture to the treats, so I'll have to try that if I forget to close a bag, which happens.<br /><br />Overall a healthy and practical treat! I'm really glad I found these.

review/summary: My picky dog loves these treats!
review/text: My dog is very picky, to say the least. He's super cute, but is very picky about treats. He won't eat any biscuits, doesn't like most fake "meat" treats, and won't eat bacon. Because of this, he has hurt many an eager pet shop employee's feelings. However, he LOVES these treats. We just adopted him from the shelter, and his previous owners didn't teach him much. These treats are making training so much easier. He'll do almost anything for them.<br /><br />They're pretty big, so you can rip them up into much smaller pieces. They will dry out if you leave the package open, so they have to be sealed each time.<br /><br />I know I'm echoing most of the other reviews when I say this, but these are fantastic treats.

They were a big hit and continue to be one of my little schnoodle's favorite treats.<br />Soft jerky squares (approx 1") can easily be split into 3-4 pieces.  We use them for her training/play sessions and she seems to especially love it when the reward is the Zuke's soft lamb jerky.<br />Although she performs just as eagerly when the reward is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00292BM7C">Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats, Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz</a> or the Zuke's Mini Bakes Chicken n' Cherry.

review/summary: We Love Zukes!
review/text: We started off our dog with Zuke's Mini treats as puppy rewards. Now that she is bigger, she needs more. These natural treats fit easily inside her kong toys and in the middle of her everlasting treat balls and give her something different. We recommend Zuke's to everyone. My dogs love them and they are made without corn fillers or by-products, which are 2 things I check for when purchasing any treats.

review/summary: Not Really "Jerky"
review/text: It's difficult to tell from the pictures and the description, but these aren't really jerky (dried strips of meat) but are smallish, moist, chewy treats made from meat and other ingredients - I suppose meat goop formed into a shape.  Think Pringle vs. a potato chip.  Anyway, our dog seems to approve - not sure it even touched the sides!  The beef, lamb and salmon varieties she tried all disappear in the blink of an eye.  A tasty treat for your dog, made in the USA, but just not the jerky I was hoping for.

review/summary: Fresh coffee with great vanilla aroma
review/text: This coffee is very good. In comparison to Senseo the coffee is much better. Very happy with the freshness and taste of this product. Works in Senseo machine with the single tray, but a little tight when you try and use two pods with the double tray (there's more product in these pods.) The coffee brews much better in a Cafe Classics coffee brewer (my work place has the Bunn coffee brewer, which in my opinion has more pressure than the Senseo.)  Only one issue... the first package I received came with two vanilla and one Columbian decaf. WHAT! Amazon customer service corrected the issue without an argument.<br />Update May 29, 2012: I have found another brand that has a richer flavor than Cafe Classics. Try Baronet - sold on Amazon.

review/summary: 5 Servings in a 2 oz bag??
review/text: So I get my case after feeling sucked into buying after reading two 5-star reviews and the things are on sale.  Ok...BLAND.  I could deal with the blandness because I liked the few and simple ingredients.<br /><br />Then I read the back while I'm crunching...5 SERVINGS in this little 2 OZ bag and says 6 pieces a serving.  (This page lists it as 7 pieces..)  Huh??  I just finished an entire bag in about 3 minutes because the small bag had only 12 tiny pieces and was so light I thought the entire thing was one serving.  You are led to believe that after reading "Nutrition" on this page.  How do you get 5 servings out of that?  That's like calling 2 M&M's a serving.<br /><br />Each serving has 13 GRAMS of FAT.  Times that by 5! Then times the carbs by 5..holy cow.  This little 2 oz gem has more fat than if I'd just dug into a bag of chips and the chips would have had much more flavor and been 5 times more pleasurable to eat.  Amazon also says high in potassium and I see no listing of that on the bag at all.<br /><br />All in all I'll not be buying again.  HUGE amount of fat and carbs if you believe the confusing garb on the bag, hardly any flavor and way overpriced, even on sale.  Skip this one.  (Oh..did I mention...made in China...no wonder..)

It's gluten-free status makes it even more appealing to those of us who cannot tolerate wheat.  The sunflower seeds appear to be selected carefully for their excellent quality.

review/text: The trick with smoked or salk cured ham, is you need to skin it then soak what your gunna eat in water for a while to extract the salt.  It will still be salty but not as bad. You can always dress it with the tradtional pinapple or brown sugar for that sweet and salty taste.  Thin slices also help.  I am SOO sorry to hear about your Easter Ham.  I had a very similar incident with a smoked turkey for Christmas.  It was over smoked and the meat had turned to paste. Hope this helps.

review/summary: Great food for our 8 yr. old active lab
review/text: We started using this food about two years ago when our then 6 yr. old black lab weighed almost 95lbs (we were feeding her too much Eukanuba Weight Control)! She was overweight to say the least. We feed 2 cups in the morning dry, and then another 1 to 1/1/2 cups at night. Just over two years later she is much slimmer 75lbs and she still needs a 2 to 3 mile walk daily. It took a lot of walks and figuring out the proper amount to feed (we initially only fed her at night too) but this food has really helped.<br /><br />I will say that when we first started her on this food her poop was a little runny, and green, but it eventually fixed itself and that doesn't happen anymore. We have taken her to the vet also and the vet. has said the dog is in great shape and that we shouldn't change anything.

Price compares to what we have seen at Petco or PetSmart. No big savings. But, I love not having to run out shopping, getting it delivered to the door. Free shipping w/Amazon prime too. Good purchase. Will continue to buy this food for our girl.

review/text: My dogs love this food. They love any food. And my wife spoils them. The ingredient list is what would generally be considered "healthy" for a dog. We used to use Beneful, which is made by Purina, and really isn't as "Beneficial" as the name is supposed to imply. The Beneful main ingredients are corn (bad for dogs) and chicken by product (bad for everyone). Natural Balance is much healthier and is available drop shipped to your door by Amazon for about the same price as your local pet store (less if you factor in tax). For not having to haul the bag through the parking lot, this is completely worth it.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I feed my two oldest dogs this dry food. They have NO problems with it at all, even love it plain without anything added. I had to find a new high-quality food with the lowest amount of protein in it (this has 16% protein) because one of my dogs had bladder stones that were removed, but she still had crystals forming in her urine afterwards, and that is what causes stones. (I combine 1/2 dry and 1/2 wet food to decrease the amount of protein even further for her - the nasty prescription food vets recommend has 12% protein but very bad preservatives, corn, wheat, animal digest and by-products, so I couldn't give her that food - and the other one gets 3/4 dry and 1/4 wet mixed.) The two younger ones (one is a puppy, the other is 2 years old) get the Wellness Super5Mix Complete Health dry dog food or the Taste of the Wild dry dog food mixed with 1/4 wet. I also add a couple of squirts of wild salmon oil to all the dogs' food as well because it is very good for them. My dogs love dinner time!

review/text: We started getting this food because our chihuahua put on some weight after he was neutered. This helped him drop a couple pounds, and he also likes the taste of it. Now that he is more active, we may switch him to the regular formula, but this has been serving us well for about 6 months now.
