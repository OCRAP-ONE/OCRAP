review/summary: Quickly cleared my slow-running drain
review/text: I had a terrible plugged drain that nothing would clear. Finally a friend recommended that vinegar might dissolve the blockage. This had so frustrated me that I decided to buy the best vinegar available. When my box of Modena Extravecchio Gold Seal arrived in the mail I immediately went to work. Within minutes, my kitchen sink was flowing freely once again.<br /><br />I am a bit upset about the short listed shelf life of only two years. I'm afraid that my drain will stop up again just after the two year shelf life has expired and I will be forced to purchase a new case. Given that it is already 75 years old it seems like an unreasonable limitation, but of course I wouldn't risk going against the manufacturer's recommendation.<br /><br />It certainly commands a small premium compared to other drain-cleaner products, but it is well worth the extra money!

review/text: I was not happy with this product, for several reasons. First, it did not have a "Best by date." Secondly, I could not find the maximun acidity percentage on the bottle. Finally, the product did not have any superb taste, but was rather bland. It was also watery when I poured it for dipping. I am sorry but I will not buy this product again.

review/text: Review of Asian Taste Dried Mushroom, 5-Ounce (Pack of 34), Price: $12.00 ($0.07 / oz)<br /><br />The title is Asian Taste Dried Mushroom, 5-Ounce (Pack of 34), but they mean 34 mushrooms in one pack instead of 34 packs of it. And in fact, there is only 32 mushrooms in one bag. So the price is $12 ($2.4/oz). The price is crazy expensive. And the quality of this product is just fair.<br />Do not buy this one. You can get very good dried mushrooms @ reasonable price from amazon.

review/summary: Fabulous and versatile
review/text: We picked this up on a whim at the local supermarket and now we swear by it.  It's must-use for stir-fry, but we also use it in Asian noodle dishes and in Asian inspired salads and sandwiches.  It would also make a great dipping sauce, although we're not really big dippers.  The sweetness is similar to a duck or sweet and sour sauce, but it also has a good deal of spicy kick to it.  But it also mixes well with rooster sauce if you want to make it hotter.  Strongly recommend, especially for those looking to get away from the usual soy-based marinades.

review/text: Perhaps I didn't prepare these correctly but I did try them different ways, steamed, pressure cooked with chicken, in soup, baked with a roast. I really did try to like them but we just couldn't get around the fact that some were ok and some were gross looking like a rubber body part from a joke shop. I tried soaking them for different lengths of time, no soaking them it just didn't make a difference!<br />Also some of these were cut in clumps with a thick base that were almost impossible to chew or cut. I had high hopes for these but they fell short.<br />I am going back to fresh and canned.<br />If anyone has a secret to cooking these please pass it along!

In fact, there is not much one can do wrong with good fresh crab legs, just steam/boil, and freeze to ship.

review/text: First thing is I did not purchase crab legs from Omaha as the price  is 10 steps beyond gouging. Here in the NY area they can be purchased for $7.99 a pound, no S&H. There are 2 sizes of legs, larger and smaller [usually referred to as A's & B's] with the larger being approximately $2.00 a pound more.<br /><br />Considering that there's more shell weight than meat weight, $25 a pound is completely outrageous.<br /><br />Look elsewhere for your crab legs. I hope Amazon takes note of this review.

When she opened the packs, every one was full of weevils! Disgusting. We had only had them for a few days before she opened them. I'm confident the weevils did not come from our home, especially since we have never had the problem before with any of our flour.

review/summary: Birthday gift for my Soldier
review/text: I ordered two boxes of the Treats For Troopers Snack Package on April 13 to arrive for my Soldier's 20th birthday on May 13. As of May 15 it hasn't arrived and I'm a little disappointed that his birthday has come and gone without his little "party in a box". As soon as I receive word that it has arrived I can post a better review. It's what he told me they most enjoy receiving while deployed in Iraq for themselves. Boxes of little toy animals is what they enjoy getting to give away to the kids.<br /><br />Well it's almost Christmas and the boxes never did arrive to my soldier. I'm out the money and even though the supplier assured me that they had sent it it never arrived. I asked my son if others were having difficulty in getting their mail and he said they were not. All I can assume is that after two attempts, this item was never actually shipped at all and my money is gone! Great birthday present for my 21 year old Soldier, huh?<br /><br />He is now safe at home, stationed in Colorado. That was a great gift for me. I'll be seeing him for Christmas. I won't be using this company to send him any more goodies.

review/summary: Pups and momma dog loved it
review/text: I used this formula on my lactating golden to have a little extra protein in her diet. She was able to nurse her pups and still have adequate weight. The protein is 26% with chicken meal being the first ingredient. After reading other reviews, I thought a "meal" product was a by product, but actually "meat meal" is the term used when ANY proteins just get tossed into the food. Chicken meal merely means that the water is taken out of the protein so you get a FULL dose of protein, as opposed to water down. From what I read, pure "chicken" contained like 70-80% water! On an ingredient list, the ingredients show by weight so basically the first ingredient is almost all water?! It's crazy what you find out when you research these things. Back to this food though- they use antibiotic and hormone free chicken... so my pups that I breed have a good healthy start... without any cancer causing agents! I started to feed the pups the kibble,soaked in water, at 5 weeks and they LOVED IT!

review/summary: An Absolute Essential
review/text: My friend and I put Tony Chachere's on everything except dessert and cereal!  We do like the regular Tony's; but since we don't like to consume too much sodium, we often use the salt-free kind.  (The salt-free type contains potassium and should not be consumed by people with limited renal function.  Anyone who uses a salt substitute should check with a physician first.)<br /><br />We like Tony's on our collard greens very much.  It is a basic ingredient in our cookbook, The Collard Patch.<br /><br />Usually we find it necessary to kick it up a notch by sprinkling some crushed red pepper on our food in addition to Tony's. We eat a large amount of spice.  Here in Louisiana, Creole seasoning is an essential staple, part of a diet that is both healthy and tasty. We carry a shaker in our glove compartment of our pickup truck! We are very glad that it is possible to buy Tony Chachere's on Amazon.<br /><br />One would think that using the same seasoning blend on almost all our food would make it all taste the same, but the truth is that a blend of Creole seasonings enhances the flavors of individual foods. A mixture of Creole seasoning and curry works wonderfully in vegetable soup and on meat.

I would have been better off using ground red pepper and some of my own spices to reduce the salt.  When I read the back of the cannister for the ingredients, the first one named was salt.

review/summary: One of my all-time favorite seasonings!
review/text: I was introduced to Tony's during my graduate school time at LSU - Baton Rouge.  I was a midwestern kid who was absolutely wowed by the incredible cuisine I found in southern Louisiana.  I saw this Tony's stuff everywhere, including in the kitchens of many restaurants.  This is one of the best general purpose seasonings on the market.  Great on any kind of meat.  Fabulous on your eggs.  Want to make real southern green beans?  Just add Tony's.  The list goes on and on!!<br /><br />For those watching salt, like me, or who just think this is TOO SALTY - try the LITE version.  It's even better than the original as far as I'm concerned.  It can be very difficult to find in stores lately (at least in my area), so you may have to order online.  (It's not available on Amazon - but elsewhere.)  Perhaps you could just take the regular and no salt versions and mix them together, but I haven't tried that.  The NO SALT version is, in my opinion, lacking a little due to the complete absence of salt.<br /><br />Give this stuff a try, and you really will use it on everything!

review/text: I LOVE this stuff! It adds so much flavor and is good for dieters as it does not add any hidden sugars. Most all seasonings have some sugar in them, but this is just good old unadulterated seasoning for ones who want a bunch of flavor without the added calories. Like I said.....I LOVE it!

review/text: When my husband was told to restrict his sodium intake I bought Tony's salt free seasoning.  We like the way it flavors foods but we have both found there is something in it that causes us to sneeze and cough whenever we use it.  I have asthma and have had to use my quick relief inhaler several times when I used the product.  My husband is not asthamtic but it did cause him to sneeze and cough.  I don't what might cause this reaction but it happened more than once so I don't believe it was just a coincidence .

If you want a stronger brew then use the middle brew button but I find that the larger cup (3rd button on the B-60 and B-70) to work for me.  I'll try the others in the near future.  I've been drinking Gloria Jean's Capuccino (middle brew button) and Coffee Barista's Columbian.  They are excellent!  I like a strong cup of Joe but not bitter and these 3 are great!  You pay a little more for the Starbuck-s K-cups however, I feel it's worth it.  I'll pay just about any price for a "GOOD" cup of Joe.  People, stop your whining and enjoy your coffee -

review/text: Starbucks' Breakfast Blend is a tad more bitter than their ubiquitous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0069AFIN4">Pike Place Roast</a>.  If you are looking for a good K-Cup to start your morning, this coffee will work just fine.  At times, it feels a bit acidic (more so than other brands), so I would recommend some form of creamer here.  For whatever reason, these K-Cups do NOT taste quite as good as the bean version you can buy in stores.<br /><br />It seems that Amazon is now offering a decent price on these K-Cups, but you may be able to find them elsewhere for cheaper.

review/summary: OK, but just a "cup of coffee"
review/text: A cup of store-brewed Starbucks Breakfast Blend has always been my favorite cup of coffee. Even when I brewed (regular brewing) it at home I couldn't get the quite same taste, but I could get close enough. Now that I have a Keurig brewer, I was excited to finally see Starbucks BB k-cups.... but, ouch, the price.<br /><br />For comparison, with my Keurig brewer, right now I like Tully's Extra Bold Breakfast Blend and Tully's Extra Bold Kona Blend, both of which I brew on the 2nd cup size (~7oz).  I've liked some other k-cups in the past, but they haven't been available on Keurig's site for a while.<br /><br />Anyway, I finally gave in and bought the Starbucks Breakfast (and House) Blend k-cups (from Keurig's site). Neither is like getting the same cup at Starbucks. I realize it can't be exactly the same, k-cup vs large brew. The Breakfast Blend k-cup is ok, I guess.  But it just doesn't have any of the complexity you taste in a cup from Starbucks. It's just "a cup of coffee".  I brew it on the 2nd (~7 oz) cup size on my brewer... smaller is too strong/bitter and larger is too watery.  To me, it's definitely not worth spending more on the Starbucks branded k-cups since I don't feel like I am getting anything close to the store brewed cup. Actually, I don't even like it as much as the Tully's BB mentioned above, so wouldn't buy the Starbucks BB even if it was the same price. Bummer.<br /><br />(FYI - For me, the Starbucks House Blend is undrinkable - it's too bitter (and I've tried brewing 3 different sizes, from smallest to travel mug).  It's just bitter regardless, with no underlying complexity of flavor. )<br /><br />Hope this helps someone, since obviously taste is very subjective!<br />c-

However, this product will flop as starbuck's consumers typically want to be seen holding a starbuck's cup so everyone will know they overspent. Since Keurig's coffee is typically consumed in the privacy of one's own home, starbuck's attempt to get in will certainly fail.

review/summary: Best GF cookies ever
review/text: We made these last week. They are absolutely delicious. I had to go get the box to prove to my 13 yo son that they were gluten free. They are easy to make and easy to cut out. My 9 yo GF son had a great time making his own Christmas cookies. I told my GF friends and one of them made the pumpkin recipe on the box and raved about how her whole family loved them. They have been gluten free for 15 years and were so excited about these cookies. Another friend is using them for decorating at her daughter's December birthday party.<br /><br />I would keep the dough divided into halves or thirds and keep the unused part in the fridge while you are cutting out cookies. Also, the recipe calls for potato starch to flour the pastry sheet. (If you don't have a pastry sheet, use a GF cereal box liner. Cut it down one side and open it up. Works great, esp. if you have more than one kid making cookies.) I used corn starch and it worked fine. I also had to bake them a few minutes longer than the instructions. It says it makes 100 small cookies. That must be thumb nail size. We made about 30 normal cookie cutter size (3" x 4") cookies.<br /><br />This is at the top of our list for favorite GF treats. Great to be able to make something that tasted so good for my son.

The tub is very big, and hard for my wife to lift out of the drawer since the handhold moulding on the side is not very deep.  So we just leave it in the drawer with the lid loosely on, and scoop it out as we need it.  The tub is too big to pour from, so we use a little scoop that we just toss inside the tub after each use.  Very good value for money on this size of packaging and it looks like it will last several months.  I will buy this again.

review/summary: Strawberry milk mix made with sugar, NO HFCS!
review/text: Obviously, strawberry milk is not a health food. Especially when you make it with whole milk like I do. That being said, the Nesquik powders are a much better option for me than the syrups because they are sweetened with sugar and not HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) which gives me intense, sharp stomach pains. I can have a glass of strawberry milk when I have to skip meals just to have something to hold me over or when I need to take a medication which requires food or milk, and I can do it without the stomach issues. I like both the strawberry and chocolate powders.

review/text: I was under the impression when I purchased this item that it was several bully sticks and that in no way ONE stick would originally cost almost $70.00! I thought that this was one heck of a bargain at $15.00. I was wrong.  I received ONE bully stick, about two and a half feet long. I would be more upset but it appears that my dog does enjoy, after some encouraging, chewing on it. It may not last her longer than it takes me to finish this review, but at only $15.00. I can't be too upset. I am however disappointed, feeling somewhat mislead by the picture. If I would have paid the original price they have posted, that would have been a much different story.<br /><br />I'm rating this item only 2 stars, no more because of the reasons mentioned above, but no less because even though it's no great bargain, it still seems like a fair price for the product I did receive. If I would have I known that this is only one item, I most likely would have not made this purchase.

review/summary: Not a bad product.
review/text: This review is for the boneless ham. A little on the small size, but tasty. Be sure to thaw before baking or you will dry it out. Best eaten the day its made. I sliced some for the next morning and it definitely lost something. On the plus side if you've got a family, odds are there will be nothing left.

review/summary: Best Gelatin Dessert I've Found...
review/text: This gelatin is really good; the strawberry-banana flavor is nice but not too overpowering. I love the fact that it has no sodium and only 10 calories. It is so worth the small amount of time it takes to prepare it for the amount of money saved over other products with excess packaging!

review/text: Not happy with this product, they come very hard and without the directions telling you this is how they are supposed to be.  They are apparently dehydrated and you fill them and they soften up, but they were so hard I don't know how you would do that, they just broke in my hands.

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: I have seen this mix in my supermarket for a very long time and one day my husband asked me to make it for him. I made it and we loved it.If you love carrot cake you will love this cake. I think it had a little too much raisins for me but it did not bother me. I already have another box in my cabinet to make again another time. I will just remove some of the raisins. I tried 2 different cream cheese frostings and the best one for this cake is the Duncan Hines creamy cream cheese frosting. Mine looked just like the picture on the box. Delicious!

review/summary: Not quite as good as regular batter, but its good enough!
review/text: Considering that its low carb, its pretty tasty.  It coated well, stood up to frying well, and did OK in the oven (a little soggy on the bottom for a few pieces).  Be aware that there is a little bit of an aftertaste, as with almost all low carb products, but in this product its not overwhelming (remember: individual tastes may vary!), and if you use a lot of hot sauce on your chicken like I do, you don't notice it at all, hah.  It also works well for regular fried chicken with a bit of salt, pepper and paprika added.<br /><br />I will be buying this product again (and again).<br /><br />Note: if you are looking for a frying batter coating, use this from Dixie - do NOT buy Dixie's "Plain bread crumbs", it had a really bad sour taste and aftertaste.  This stuff is good.<br /><br />I now can put home made Hot Wings and breaded chicken breast tenders back on my diet and enjoy a favorite food without blasting my blood sugar and still keep my diet low carb -- Thanks Dixie, and pass me the hot wing sauce!

review/summary: SO SO Sauce
review/text: Ordered this based on the positive reviews, but frankly it just doesn't do much for me.....You can use it to marinate meats, be careful....it can be quite strong....I recommend tasting it first. I think there are better products that are easy to find and cheaper.<br /><br />I was attempting to find something along the lines of some "sweet soy sauce" I had at a great restaurant. This is not it. Since I now own 6 bottles of this, will give away some of them....and experiment with adding some sweeteners to achieve a similar product.

review/summary: Small Fireballs - Ugh
review/text: I was so disappointed when I received my package.  I ordered these for my husband for Christmas as he loves them but I was expecting the 'LARGE' fireballs.  I wish the distributors would specify in their description whether the fireballs are 'small' or 'large'.  I was under the assumption that since it was a 3lb bag, it would be the large fireballs.  I still have the container from the last time I ordered Atomic Fireballs and it had the weight listed as 3lbs so I thought I would be receiving 3 lbs of large fireballs.  I am still debating on whether to return them or not.  I am going to wrap them and let my husband open them for Christmas.  I will leave it up to him whether or not I will return them and search yet again for the 'LARGE' fireballs.  What a bummer because I love them too..the big ones!

review/summary: An Acquired Taste
review/text: It's almost impossible to find any gum now without some kind of artificial sweetener. So this filled-the-bill for me. I will say it was strange chewing this at first (because it it pretty much like a plain gum base with an oh so slight mint flavor) and the pieces are large enough I chewed only a half piece at a time, but it cured my need to chew and I don't have to fret about the cancer causing artificial sweeteners. I say give it a try. Chew a few pieces and I think it will grow on you too :)

review/text: This seller delivery is really slow and you cannot track it. It still did not arrive after two weeks. But I know this product from Turkey. This specific gum has green tea flavor. You can also find Falim Gum without any flavor. Those of them and this product also are free from any sugar products, if you wonder how gum tastes, you can have this gum and love it. In US or Canada, we are actually chewing plastics with sugar but this is a real gum. I strongly advise it. It is a Turkish product and its name means my fortune. Every single gum is wrapped with a paper tells your fortune, it is for fun but in Turkish.

review/summary: Great Dark Chocolate for "on the go" but pricey
review/text: My wife loves these dark chocolate pearls because she can keep a box in her purse. The box is metal and seals well. Of course, the Godiva chocolate tastes great. The downside is the price. At $3.77 per ounce, that comes out to over $60.00 a pound - pricey for any chocolate product.

review/summary: Great On-The-Go Product
review/text: These Godiva Dark Chocolate Pearls are getting harder to find in stores, which is a shame because they fill a great niche in the chocolate lover's life. They are a perfectly portable, portion-controlled (if you want them to be), high-end treat.<br /><br />Another reviewer talked about the price tag on these, which I'll admit is hefty (it's usually cheaper in stores, if you can find them!). You're paying, though, not only for the quality chocolate, but also for the design and package. This tin is one of the only candy tins that I have never seen pop open at the bottom of a crowded purse. Never! The box doesn't seem perfectly air-tight, but it keeps the pearls fresh for a good long time regardless.<br /><br />The pearl design is super-smart, particularly given how many people (women especially) are trying to be portion conscious.  One or two pearls really will satisfy a chocolate craving without "costing" a lot of calories. The dark chocolate is more like Dove than one of the high-cacao artisanal chocolates out there - it's rich and full-flavored without being bitter in the least.<br /><br />I highly recommend Godiva Dark Chocolate Pearls. Given that they're becoming scarce on stores (and pricier online), I'm a little concerned they might be on the way out - try some while you can!

review/text: While dating my husband he grilled up some of the best brats I ever had.  He refused to tell me what he used telling me it was his secret ingredient.  It took me getting married to him to finally find out his secret ingredient was the Original Bry basting spray. Finding out about Bry spray was definately worth getting married! We use it mostly whenever we grill pork , chicken & brats.  We even used it on the Thanksgiving turkey we grilled for our large family gathering.  It was so good there was nothing left but bones.

review/summary: Great Seeds
review/text: I bought this after using some Lemon Balm Essential Oil -- which is super expensive...I thought I'd give it a try to grow this plant myself.  I started by simply planting a few of the seeds in a small pot -- within days they had sprouted and looked great.  They are now moved into their own separate containers and on their way to be being big healthy plants.  I imagine that with these seeds I'll be watching them closely to ensure their survivial for the next few months but hope to have them in the group sometime this fall...if we don't make that then early spring.  Great deal on these plants.  I look forward to enjoying the aroma this plant has to offer.

review/text: I have probably read 10,000 reviews on Amazon and I'm embarrassed to say this is one of the first (the first?) one I have written.<br />And in the interest of full disclosure, I am related to the founding team so I sort of HAD to give Weefulls a try.  But now?  I'm hooked.  They are so good and so easy.  Weefulls, Plum organics, Justin's nut butters, smoked salmon, Planetbox, where would I be without you?<br />Eating healthful food is a huge priority in our household, but I have NO TIME, with work and two small kids.  Knowing that I have a bag of Weefulls mix in the cupboard allows me to pull together a last minute breakfast, lunch or dinner that is both delicious and healthy for my whole family.<br />My son really only wants pancakes, waffles, or bagels in the morning for breakfast, and the other alternatives in this category are full of junk!<br />It took me a few tries to get the right ratio of water to mix, and to make pancakes that cooked all the way through in a reasonable amount of time. (They suggest making it more like crepes with more water so they taste better and cook faster).<br />I am going to get a waffle maker for the holidays because I've had Weefulls as waffles and they are even better than the crepes / pancakes.<br />Anyway, it is definitely worth buying a few bags to see how Weefulls might fit into your weekly routine.  A breakfast here, a dinner side there (I usually do a protein and a weefull and a few other fruits and veggies) and you will be hooked.  Keep up the good work guys!
