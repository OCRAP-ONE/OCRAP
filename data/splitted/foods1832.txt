review/text: I love Kay's chips as a way to get my snack fix while maintaining my weight loss.  The taste of all these chips, including the lemon herb and chili cheese, are great!  The only negative is that the texture is a bit crumbly, thus messy.  I will continue to buy these, however, as a fast and healthy snack option.

review/summary: Really not that good
review/text: Saw the bunch of 5 star reviews and thought I'd give these a try. So people complained about it being salty, but that wasn't the problem for me, since really, potato chips are just as salty as these. I think someone else called this taste "unnatural", and that pretty much tells the story. These chips taste like they were manufactured in a laboratory, and not actually the product of natural consumables. They look like corn chips but they seriously just taste like flavoring and oil and basically empty of flavor besides these. Not recommended.

review/summary: Very good chips!
review/text: I was a little wary of these due to the mixed reviews here. However, I'm glad I purchased them. I think the flavor is good and the chips are crunchy and taste fried to me. One drawback is that they are pretty small so it's tough to dip them without getting your fingers messy. They cheese can also stick to your hands. I actually like the taste of these more than the sour cream and onion Pop Chips I purchased in the same order. These also have great nutrition compared to those (10 grams of protein per serving, 15 per bag!) I will probably buy these again, they make a good snack.

review/summary: excellent meal! so why can't i find it in stores anymore???
review/text: My family and I absolutely LOVE this slow cooker chicken! and every time I've made it for company, they too have loved it. I usually make it over egg noodles. I have been looking for this particular seasoning packet in every store I can think of, since we returned to the states 3 years ago, but haven't been able to find it ANYWHERE... So, one day I got curious, and searched online and found it here. I wish I could buy it by individual packs, rather than the case... as it will probably take me 2 years to use all 12 packages (assuming they don't expire before then), but alas the taste is worth it! McCormick really should sell this at more stores. So far I have only found it in Texas (about 6 years ago), and in military commissaries overseas (4 yrs ago).

review/summary: Crock-Pot easy
review/text: We've been enjoying McCormick's crock-pot chilli for some time now so I thought why not try this newest recipe. Of course it's simple: chicken ( I use thighs with skin removed ), a couple cans of stewed tomatoes ( plain is good, Italian better ), can of tomato paste and a half pound of sliced mushrooms. That's it. I put these ingredients in my slow cooker around noon time. A while later ( 4-5 hours on high or 8 hours on low per the instructions ) it's ready. It can be eaten as is or, as we do, put on top of spaghetti. Sometimes to make it even more like spaghetti sauce I'll add a can of marinara ( Hunt's works well ) which is just the right touch and stretches the sauce base.<br /><br />  This dish isn't what you'd call 'gourmet' but when time is an issue using this mix will definitely make life easier. The only down side to using thighs I find is pulling out the bones and other things not wanted. But thighs are inexpensive and tasty. I've also used chicken breast sliced into long strips which is better if you have young ones who just want to dive in and can't watch for those unwanted items.<br /><br />  Along with the chilli mix and the beef stew mix ( both get eaten very quickly around here ) the Italian Herb mix is a good kitchen tool to have when a wholesome, quick meal is called for. It's easily modified to taste and keeps you coming back for more. And buying these mixes from Amazon in bulk packs almost cuts the cost in half compared to individual packs bought at large food stores. Can't beat that!

I've been really impressed with Happy Family's line of products and their new Happy Times items really seem to be growing with my family.  Not only are each of these individually packaged, perfect for the school lunch box, they even have a cute little 'message' area where I write basic little notes or draw a little picture to surprise my little girl as she enjoys her lunch at school.  Just so she knows mommy is thinking of her :) My daughter LOVES this snack and it makes me happy that a) she can open it by herself easily b) it's a healthy organic treat of a veggie c) it's organic too!<br /><br />Love this item, keep them coming Happy Family Brands, we really appreciate it, what perfect preschool treat!

review/text: I was searching for organic nut and dairy free snacks for my older kids at school (8 and 6).  I am tired of the processed cheese crackers and the like.  I bought these at Target to make sure they liked them and they LOVED them!  They said they are "sweet and tangy".  I tried them too and love them as well!  I grab them when I need something sweet!  I love that they come in individual packets so I (or they) can drop them into lunch boxes each morning.<br />So great to have an organic snack for older kids that also has fruits and veggies inside!

My daughter doesn't really notice what her snacks come in (packaging), but when she's eating this snack, all the older kids want to know what she's eating.  She likes them, and when we share, everyone else likes them as well!  There's never enough in the bag, she gobbles them down so fast.  They are actually really sweet, and melt right in her mouth. OK, I know this because I'm always tasting her food, and finishing the left overs!  And with these, I certainly don't mind when she hand me the leftovers and says, "All done!"

review/summary: Tastes great and very innovative!
review/text: As a mom of a very hungry toddler son, I'm always needing snacks on hand, especially when we are out and about. This product is just one of many from HappyFamily that he and I both love and eat! My son loves the taste of the crazy crunchies and it is very easy for him to eat! He is able to hold the pouch and eat from it whether we are in the car, in the grocery store or even at home at the table. Another reason I love this product, as well as the other HappyFamily products, is it's a great and easy way to get my son to eat vegetables and fruit! And, last but not least, I love how innovative this product (HappyTimes) is in it's packaging. Each individual pouch has a place for you as a mom or dad to write a note, a "happy note," to your child. For parents with older children, I just think it's a great idea to have a snack that allows you to write a little note to your child to put in his/her lunchbox. It beats having to write a note on a napkin as my mom used to do!

So I was ecstatic to find this at my local grocery store for only $3.99 a box.<br /><br />It doesn't taste like matzah. I think it actually tastes better...a bit potatoey, like Baked Lays, but hard and crispy. I used it to make matzah buttercrunch and it performed quite admirably. I've heard that it makes good fried matzah as well.<br />Great product. If you're Jewish and can't eat wheat matzah, buy this by the case.

review/text: These are so scrumptious that my family, 4 of the 5 of us who must eat gluten-free, actually like this BETTER than the wheat-based matzah! Who knew? Almost every other food product in the GF version has been unable to reach the taste standards of its containing-counterparts - but not Yehuda-brand GF "matzo-style squares."  (LOL - you can't call it "matzos" because the rabbis-on-high have dictated that that wheat is the only grain suitable for authentic matzos!)<br /><br />I'll enjoy my "matzo-style squares" as often as my normal American food budget will permit, which is not very often. This product is several times the cost of its wheat-based counterpart. To provide my family and myself with this product for both Pesach and the entire ensuing 7 days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread would take up my entire Pesach-related food budget!<br /><br />Being able to purchase this product as a once-in-a-while treat will help us to cope with the deprivation that one experiences on a GF diet. I'm very thankful for this product! It would be improved with a price that can render it more accessible to the normal American family.

review/text: I bougth Yahuda Matzo Style last month.  I wanted to try it before Passover.  I love the taste and texture.  The biggest problem is that about a third of the box I opened arrived in crumbles.  I did not check the other 2 boxes, because I need them unopened for Passover.  I hope the 2 boxes arrived in better condition.  I will try and make matzah balls with the crumbs and use them as a coating or toppng.  At these prices I am not going to waste any of it.<br /><br />I am going to buy another pack of 3 so that I will have enough to serve during the holiday for myself and family members who can not eat wheat. I hope you keep this item in stock as long as possible as we eat matzah all year long.

review/text: I ordered this item, a 10 pound BAG of sour cherry Jelly Belly jelly beans but what I received was a previously opened BOX of jelly beans which were crystallized and melted together and looked nothing like the image above. In addition, the jelly beans were simply dumped into the cardboard box with no wrapper whatsoever. This box had a seal on it which had been cut through and then retaped. The external shipping packaging was undisturbed. When I have ordered Jelly Belly jelly beans from other vendors, they have come in plastic bags, shipped in a cardboard box.<br /><br />Since I really wanted what I had ordered, I was disappointed to see that upon return of the defective merchandise, I was only eligible for a refund, not a replacement as Amazon was out of stock on my item. I sent the item back and was surprised to see that today, when my return processed, there is now 1 ten pound bag of sour cherry Jelly belly jelly beans in stock. I wonder if the in stock item is the very same defective item which I just returned.

review/text: I thought it was OK... overall.  The chocolate coating does at least taste--and melt--like chocolate, which for a protein/meal bar is not exactly something you can expect.  The bar did last longer going down though: not only because it's bigger, but because it's so tough to chew! (A little too tough for me; the center could use a little moisture.)  Maybe peanut just isn't my favorite in any bar--which seems to be the case; although this bar doesn't taste especially peanutty.  Lastly, 10 calories short of 300 is really over the limit for me in the bar category.

review/text: I noticed Amazon lumped all the Go-Lean bar reviews together, but anyway, these were so good I won't hesitate to try other flavors.<br /><br />Covered with milk chocolate, it tasted like a cross between a Snicker's, Milky Way and peanut butter cups, just a bit more chewy. The bars were fresh, large and very satisfying, even better than I had hoped. Well done, Kashi!

review/summary: Too Much Salt
review/text: 280 mgs. of salt is too much for a "health" bar. I love most Kashi products, but this one left a salty taste that lingered all day. If you salt your food you probably will not notice the salty taste. I have always used salt sparingly mostly because I like to taste my food not cover it up with another flavor. So judge for yourself, but health food should have to follow certain guidelines.

review/summary: Filling and tasty, not a bad snack on the go
review/text: If I am famished from hunger, and a real meal is many hours off, I don't feel bad about eating one of these glorified candy bars as a mini-meal.  It is filling and satisfying, and if you put chocolate and peanut butter on a shoe, I'd probably like it.  The chocolate coating is formulated for durability and it does that job well, although there is a price to be paid in taste.  The filling, however, is the best part.  Peanutty and chewy, the grains, chocolate and peanut butter combine brilliantly leaving me wanting another one or three.<br /><br />The problem with bars like this is that they are neither plain candy bars nor real nutrition, and they have to balance the great taste of candy with the fact that they actually have to have some nutritional value to compensate for the huge premium the makers charge for this bar over a plain old candy bar.  Kashi does this better than most of the competition, and their bar is a bit larger and sturdier than most, which makes it the first choice for my gym bag or purse for an emergency meal.<br /><br />Try not to let these slip from "emergency food" to "substitute for lunch" or "regular snack."  These bars, although healthier than candy, are not a real meal, do not have the fiber and nutrients to hold you over to  the next real meal, and are a lot more candy bar than piece of fruit.  These are good to keep in a bag for a day when you have no alternatives, but if you find that there are too many emergencies to be good for your health or your waistline, try putting an apple in that purse instead.

review/text: My whole family loves the Kashi Chewy Bars (including my 6 year old)!  If you're expecting the taste of a candy bar, then yes...you will be disappointed.  However, in my humble opinion these are the best tasting meal replacement bars I've ever had!  These bars usually hold me over for 3-4 hours.  According to my handy calculator, they're only 6 points each for those of us who count Weight Watchers Points.

review/summary: My Family Wouldn't Eat Them
review/text: I purchased a 12-pack of Kashi GOLEAN Peanut Butter & Chocolate bars for myself and my family. We tried one and nobody wanted to finish it. It tasted way too much like a "power" bar. I didn't expect a candy bar, but there are some healthy bars that taste good. The bars sat in our kitchen for a few weeks before we threw the rest (11) away. What a nasty tasting waste of money! I contacted Kashi about returning the bars, but they just sent me a few coupons for some free bars. We tried some other flavors, but they weren't much better. I would rather have had my money back.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I consider the GoLean "chewy" bars to be superior to any other nutritional bar out there, and I think this is the best flavor.  I often carry them for lunch (paired with a baggie of fresh veggies).  The calorie count is a little high for a snack for me, but as a lunch entree, it is low.  Highly satisfying, it has none of the over sweetness or "roots and bark" quality of many others on the market. It has a decent fiber count but never tastes mealy or grainy.

It's like a healthy version of a peanut butter cup--it's chewy, peanut-buttery, chocolatey, but the bonus is that they really fill you up unlike a candy bar, especially if you drink a big glass of water with it as there is a lot of fiber in this bar. And it doesn't make you feel shaky or headachey like a candy can, at least for me. I always keep one in my purse just in case I can't stop to eat during the day.

review/text: It's a bit pricey with shipping, but I bought this because this brand has unusual colors.  I needed purple for a King Cake, and here in Illinois you just can't find purple sugar.  I actually like this brand quite a bit, and would recommend it.<br /><br />The colors are nice and bright compared to some cheaper brands I've seen.  The first thing I noticed, however, is that the sugar crystals are LARGE compared to the near-shavings I get from the colored sugars I got at the local grocery store.  I guess I'll have to go buy the Green and Gold ones too, so they match next time.

review/text: This is some pretty tasty Italian dressing that is wonderful on any sort of salad. Unfortunately, my primary use for Italian dressing is to marinate meat, and especially chicken. The problem with is that it has too high of an oil content which causes the grill to flare up frequently, blackening the chicken. The generic brand from Jewel works a lot better for grilling. However, the flavor is delicious and it is perfect for salads, so if you don't plan to use it for grilling, don't hesitate.

review/summary: They turned it up to 11
review/text: I enjoy Sumatra beans from my local roaster on a regular basis, so I wanted to try buying in bulk to take into the office.  Since I like my coffee bold, I ordered this instead of the regular Sumatra.  Calling it "dark" is an understatement.  I actually had to scale back the grounds in my French press about 40% - this stuff will punch you in the face twice and steal your car!  This turned out to be a blessing in disguise:  We normally use 6-7 scoops in our 12-cup automatic at work, but with this we only need 3 or 4 at the most.<br /><br />Kudos to CBD for actually meaning what they say when they say "dark"!  And the actual flavor, once you wrangle control of the strength back, is quite good.  Just heed this fair warning:  If you find yourself wondering what a 12-cup pot of espresso would taste like, this coffee is for you.  Otherwise, you may want to try the regular Sumatra first.

review/text: There are many wonderful and complex flavors that good coffees can offer. This is my mainstay since it has great smooth and rich coffee flavor. It isn't acidy or bitter at all. Actually I like a little acidity so my favorite is to blend this with the Smoked Coffee offered on Coffee Bean Direct's website. Dark Sumatra makes the best base coffee for any blend that I've tried. Costa Rican Tarrazu won't stand on its own but will add just the right amount of acidity to make it my second best choice to blend with Dark Sumatra. If you want to discover the flavorful world of rich coffees, Dark Sumatra is the starting point, then start playing with it.

review/text: Wow! What an amazing deal! Thanks to the incredibly wide scope of Amazon's "Always please the customer!" thinking, I'm subscribing to a monthly delivery of a 5-pound bag of totally awesome fresh Dark Sumatra coffee beans (from Coffee Bean Direct Coffee Roasters). These fresh-roasted beans make an exceptionally terrific, totally smooth, rich and deliciously tasty cup of coffee, some of the very best ever. And the price is just right. With Amazon's flexible coffee bean subscription plan, I get the freshest beans exactly when I want and need them, I don't have to fret about going to the coffee store or market or running out of anything. I just grind my fresh aromatic beans before bed each night and I have absolutely fabulous hot Dark Sumatran coffee the next morning. These fresh beans are so richly aromatic that my [non coffee drinking] partner likes to grind and set-up the coffee at night just so he can enjoy these Dark Sumatra beans in his own fashion.<br /><br />Amazon.com sends me my 5-pound bag of fresh roasted beans promptly each and every month. I can suspend my order or purchase more beans, change my delivery dates and of course, I can always choose from Coffee Bean Direct Coffee Roasters' excellent stock of the very best fresh-roasted coffee beans available from almost anywhere in the world.<br /><br />I once lived in Hawaii's famed Kona coffee district and had my own absolutely fresh, just picked-off-the-tree coffee beans from my own trees, I could roast those fresh, tasty Kona beans myself whenever and however I wanted. This was a totally unique coffee lovers' experience, but Coffee Bean Direct Coffee Roasters' coming straight to my door courtesy of Amazon.com expertise is just as awesome and a lot less messy and time-consuming. I have the worlds' best coffee from the worlds' best retailer every month with absolutely no fuss.<br /><br />Please Amazon.com, find a way to stop by in the mornings, brew and serve some of my deliciously hot Dark Sumatra coffee (don't forget to wash the pot and used cup please!), that would be almost perfection. Oh, and did I mention making fresh, hot scones?<br /><br />Maybe?<br /><br />Thank you Amazon.com, you've changed the way I shop! And it's great!

review/text: The price was great (>$5/lb)...but, next time, I'll prefer to pay more to avoid this coffee (to my takste=, this is more along the lines of dishwater).<br /><br />Given a choice, I'd take Pete's Major Dickinson's very dark, delicious blend.,  Unfortunatelym it's almost 3X the price of this coffee).<br /><br />Hopefully, I'll find something in between the two. ...I'll report back when I find it!

review/summary: The Best I've Found
review/text: We've been using these bags regularly for several years now with no complaints. We don't overload the trash and these work really well for us. The degradable plastic in general does seem to tear somewhat easier than "normal" plastic. We just got used to it, see the comment about overloading. It seems to me a more than acceptable tradeoff to get a full size well performing bag that is degradable. And no, I'm not known to be a tree hugger!

review/summary: Love the idea, but...
review/text: I really wanted to like these bags because they are compostable.  However, they rip WAY to easily.  I removed a full bag from the kitchen trash can and it had several holes in it, so I tried to double bag it.  When I put the full bag into an empty one, it just ripped the empty bag completely open.  These bags would probably work fine for trash that doesn't have any sharp corners, but for the kinds of things I throw away in the kitchen, these bags just are not going to work.  I will not be buying them again for that purpose until they are more durable.

review/text: When I found these gummies on amazon I was really excited. I am a big fan of sour gummies so I just had to have these.<br />However when I first opened the bag I was already kind of disgusted by the artificial smell. Also the are very ooey-gooey soft and somewhat glibbery. I had to leave them out in the open for a few days to get them to harden up just a bit.<br />I couldn't get myself to eating one with this slimey texture.<br />Worst of all is the fact that they aren't really sour at all. The bag reads super sour but they are neither super nor are they sour. I guess I just stick with the sour Haribo gummies instead. At least that's a safe choice.

review/summary: Kentucky Spirit is Kentucky bourbon at a higher level
review/text: Wild Turkey is good Kentucky bourbon whiskey and Kentucky Spirit is Wild Turkey's top of the line expression in regular production: Master distiller Jimmy Russel's statement product. It's a single barrel selection with the barrel and rick numbers on each neck label served up at 101 proof to keep most of the cask goodness intact. I was expecting it to be good. It exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />In the glass it's a dark coppery bronze color. The nose is rich and complex and evolves strikingly through time. Time is a big factor here. This stuff is 101 proof and has a lot of alcohol to disperse. Initially, the aroma of butter - as in brown butter and buttered corn is striking. As it opens up, sweeter sherry, treacle, pecan pie, citrus and floral notes join in. It's a positively delicious aroma. First sip shows a toffee sweetness that explodes across the palate with apple flower, toffee frosting, maple candy, citrus spritz and vanilla oak. It's a paradise of plant esters in a distilled spirit. Finish is long and complex with unfolding layers of aged sawn wood, perfumed sweetness, bitter orange/dark chocolate fudgy notes and spicy spirit. The glow in my mouth lingers for many long minutes, decaying into oak and toffee coffee bittersweet. It's what bourbon is all about - yet it's quite rare at this price point.<br /><br />This is among the finest bourbons I've ever tried. It's right up there with rare limited editions in sophistication and distinction. Yet it treads a careful line through its disparate flavor elements, staying balanced among sweet and dry, floral and woody, bitter and sweet. What a masterful performance. I could drink it every day. Comparable quality in Scotch whiskey or French Cognac would cost multiples of what you get for less than a U.S. Grant note here in the US. Beyond the bargain aspect, the richness of flavor and complexity and balance of presentation shows that American distillery at the high end gives nothing up to the masters of the old world. This is a first rate distillate - right up there with the world's best in refinement and sheer yumminess. Jimmy Russel, I take my hat off to you.

review/summary: Not an Improved Recipe for Me
review/text: Besides changing the bowl to a very thin plastic one that gets too hot to touch, the new recipe is not an improvement that I care for. It's too bad because the previous version had bits of dried mushroom that gave it a more complex flavor -- now it's kind of a blah generic spiciness.<br /><br />Have to mention they fiddled with the noodles too. They are thinner, and don't have that chewy bite. Very disappointed that Nong Shim USA made these changes. I'll have to look for the better Made in Korea kind at the local Asian markets to satisfy my Shin Bowl cravings.

review/summary: Authentic, and THE BEST
review/text: If you're not going to buy this product, which I recommend, then try to avoid fish sauce that contains "hydrolyzed wheat or soybean proteins". Also, many will say "Phu Quoc" on them because that's where the best fish sauce are made but if it's not made in Phu Quoc or Vietname then it's probably a fake.<br /><br />I use this brand for sauces and salads, and I can taste the difference. Also, it's good to know I'm eating something that is made from natural ingredients. I'll pay extra for that.<br /><br />This is the FAQ from redboatfishsauce site:<br /><br />What are the ingredients for each product?<br />The two ingredients in every Red Boat fish sauce are fresh caught wild black anchovies and sea salt.<br /><br />What is the difference between 40N and 50N?<br />Degrees N is an industry standard to measure the number of grams of nitrogen per liter of fish sauce which relates to the protein level. The highest quality fish sauces are greater than 30N with the flavor becoming more rich and complex with larger N designation.<br /><br />Are your products gluten free?<br />Yes. Our sauces do not contain wheat or wheat by-products and are produced in a gluten free facility.<br /><br />Do our products contain MSG?<br />No. Our product also does not contain hydrolyzed wheat or soybean proteins which are hidden sources of free glutamates.<br /><br />Do our products contain any type or form of peanuts or shellfish?<br />No.<br /><br />What are the clear crystals in the bottom of my bottle?<br />Natural sea salt may occasionally crystallize on the bottom of the bottles of Red Boat sauces. This is a natural process and does not affect the product quality in any way.<br /><br />Are other fish sauce brands labeled "Phu Quoc" authentic?<br />Look at the label carefully. If the product does not say "Made in Phu Quoc" or "Product of Vietnam" it is likely not authentic. Many knock-offs are made or processed in Thailand or Hong Kong.

review/summary: Exceptional sauce
review/text: This is easily the best fish sauce I've ever bought. The flavor is intense but very mellow. You can use it as a dipping sauce or sprinkle it on leftovers or salads like I do. I am reminded of the difference between using real wine vs. cooking wine. Just like real wine, this is on another level from what you can easily find at the average US market.<br /><br />The reason I bought it initially, though, was the lack of sugar, wheat or other cheap fillers. I wanted as close to organic as I could find. Fresh-caught anchovies, minimally processed in traditional ways, fit the bill for me.<br /><br />Yes, it does cost more, but if you, like me, are looking for fish sauces online then you probably don't have access to an Asian supermarket anyway, so why bother spending the money on shipping sugar or wheat protein? Or trash fish? And, because there are no fillers, you will use less liquid for the same amount of flavor, so maybe it is not that expensive in the end.

review/text: I've mostly used Thai fish sauces to date, especially the excellent "Squid" brand and the ubiquitous "Thai Village".  They're really good, but nothing prepared me for the over-the-top flavor of this Vietnamese sauce from N''c M'm.  Its nuances of exquisite flavor are like nothing else.  If you've had the "Three Crabs" brand, you might have a tiny inkling of what I'm talking about.  Three Crabs is a very small amount of this Vietnamese sauce diluted with lots of things like normal Thai fish sauce, malt, sugar, and water.  That subtle, tiny edge it has has been moved to the forefront with this undilutedly magnificent fish sauce, the best I've ever had. Wow.<br /><br />It is rare and pricy. Don't waste it.  I only use a few drops in salad dressings and finishing sauces.  Things that don't get hot.  For searing and marinating, Squid is just as good and way cheaper.

review/text: After buying this for 9$ per bottle from my local Asian supermarket in San Jose, CA and doing a blind taste test in which I just dip my finger blindly into two different kinds, I taste no difference.  I tried dipping other basic food in blind taste tests and the $3 Fish sauce "Flying Lion Phu Quoc" brand I usually use tastes better.  As a daily user of nuoc mam in everyday meals, I'm not sure what the hype for this is all about.  Sounds like a marketing gimmick to me.  Has a nice label, fascinating description that I had to try right when I got home from the store.  Try it for your self, but don't be fooled like I was.  I myself will always be searching for new types of authentic Phu Quoc myself, please do let me know if you find any worthwhile yourself.

review/summary: Surprisingly Delicious
review/text: Bought these pouches for the great protein to carb ratio and for the convenience of taking them to work to put over a bed of lettuce with some olive oil, sea salt, and pepper (getting hungry!). I am just coming off the Ideal Protein Diet plan and after losing 60 pounds I needed a convenient and low-cost alternative for daily meals at the office. I also wanted to make sure I felt full with a good-tasting meal. I have no desire to east something only to be hungry an hour later.<br /><br />These meals are packed flat in (approx) 4"x6" envelopes. When I say flat, I mean they can fit in your back pocket or whatever bag you carry to the office. All-in-all, very convenient and very inexpensive alternative at around $2+ per envelope. Don't get freaked out by the appearance of the food because it kinda looks like cat-food when it's all smooshed flat. But once you put on the plate and poke it around a little with your fork, it's all good. Also, if you're a person who doesn't care for the sometimes fishy smell of some canned tuna, don't worry about that with these packages. They are really tasty and surprisingly delicious. I've already recommended them to my family and recommend you give them a whirl. Enjoy!

review/text: Nothing but great things to say about this seasoning salt.  I have used this product in place of table salt and seasoning salt (Lawry's).  Not only do I find I use way less than I would if I was using plain sea salt, but I also find it has more flavor than Lawry's seasoning salt.  I can't really compare it to anything but table salt, sea salt, or Lawry's because that's all I've ever used on salads and in cooking.  Speaking of salads- I have also found that using Herbamare, I don't always need salad dressing.  If I sprinkle on a salad and toss it well w/ just a bit of olive oil, I find it flavors it well and allows the taste of my garden grown veggies to come through.  What I like most is that the herbs in Herbamare can be detected and tasted.  If that makes sense.  It adds unique individual flavors as well as salt.  One more thing - it is excellent on cucumbers and tomatoes.

review/text: A few years ago a friend of ours introduced this product to us.  Immediately, we began using this when cooking and enjoyed the taste.  We use it when snacking on celery, carrots, tomatoes, and other 'veggies'.

review/summary: Can't live without it!
review/text: I'm french so I literally grew up with this salt, I don't even know how to cook without it. What a nice surprise when I found out I can easily order it here on Amazon in the US!<br />Basically this is 2/3 real sea salt and 1/3 herb salt (like celery salt and such) so you can cut on salt without even thinking about it.<br />The taste? So much better than dumb salt, it adds a wonderful but subtle herb/vegetables flavor (kinda like a bouquet garni?).<br />Everybody loves it, husband, friends, grandma and brother in law, everybody.<br />Best way to enjoy it? Fresh bread, butter, sprinkle the salt on the top of the "tartine" and eat with fresh radish! Yum!<br /><br />My mother always insist on sending me some from France "But Mom I can just order it from Amazon here!".<br />It's hard to believe that 50 years ago, this was just a local product and now it's sold on Amazon in the US. But it totally deserves it! Thank you Alfred Vogel for offering us healthy AND yummy products since 1963! Way before organic products were trendy.<br />This is a true 6 stars product.

review/summary: People wonder about our secret ingredient!
review/text: I use this on pasta, salad, pizza and roasted potatoes - just to name a few items. It enhances the flavor of everything we cook. People always ask what we did to make the potatoes or salad or pizza taste so good. I always tell them about this salt. You won't be disappointed.
