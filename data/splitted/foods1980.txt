review/text: You can count on Jack Links to provide a tasty, consistent-quality product. This Mega Pack is a great value, too. Still, I try to purchase smaller, boutique brands whenever possible. But they are becoming increasingly difficult to find. So Jack Links can definitely fill the bill.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Perfect Protein
review/text: I am on a high protein, low calorie diet.  Jerky is perfect because it has 15gm of protein per serving and only 80 calories.  It is immensely portable and doesn't have to be refrigerated, so I take it with me everywhere.  It is a lifesaver.  I have it on subscribe n save so I always have it available at a price much more reasonable than at the grocery stores. And I love the taste!

review/summary: Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy
review/text: I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.

review/summary: Pretty Damn Good Jerky
review/text: I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.

review/text: Love Jack Links, so I was thrilled to see these easy to grab individually wrapped packages on Amazon with the Subscribe and Save option.  I have a son in college so I have them sent to him. It is pricier than going to a warehouse store and buying in bulk but you are paying for the convenience of the 100 calorie packs.  I have them in my pantry at home also, and my 2 adult daughters use them for their lunches also. I would have given 5 stars if the price was a bit lower.

review/summary: The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category'
review/text: The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.  I've tried the Jalepeno brand but, it is not as 'hot' as the Peppered brand -but I still make room for both.<br /><br />Again back to the price... it's on the high side.  Which compels me to eventually research more about making my own beef jerky and then make it closer to what I'm looking for - scorching hot!  Something that includes cayenne, habaneros and the like for a taste to remember!

review/text: I know its not the healthiest snack, but there's nothing as satisfying as a nice quality piece of jerky.  It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.<br /><br />I have order this double package in both Original and Teriyaki, and is the best price I have found when you figure it down to a per oz price.  It's even cheaper if you add it as a "subscription" to be shipped every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months...which you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />One other use I have for this is an extra special treat for my dog.<br /><br />Anyway, this is always high quality jerky.  Only negative is these large backs end up with a bunch of small crumbled shavings in the bottom--guess what then gets poured onto a plate for my dog!!!

I have been eatting it for years now, and another positive is that it is made in Wisconsin. My only wish is that you could buy this stuff in better quanitity discounts. The small bags are nice for day trips, but it would nice to be able to buy in larger bags for additional discounts.

review/text: I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same. Fortunately my mother-in-law and wife gift me with Jack Link's beef jerky on a regular basis. Jack Link's uses premium cuts of meat that are seasoned and smoked in a way that you will find to be delicious. Once you open the bag, be sure to put it in the fridge unless you want your beef jerky to grow some white fuzz. An opened bag of beef jerky that is refrigerated can last for months. I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes.

If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.

review/summary: Cheaper else where
review/text: I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.  A bit too steep of an increase for my blood.  I stopped by Wally world earlier on the weekend and they still have them for about half price.  So I grabbed a case for what they want for three envelopes.<br />Guess if your hardup and no way to get to town, go for it - however, if your looking to save a buck and heading out to wally world, wait for it!

review/summary: Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH
review/text: I'm normally rather "meh" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g. slim jims and their ilk), but Jack Links are always good, and the sweet and hot variety, for whatever reason, is AMAZING.  So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of.

review/summary: This fish is fantastic - beware price increase!
review/text: I purchased this 9 pack in May of 2012.  Now it is September 2012 and I wanted to get some more of this very tasty fish in mustard sauce - it's the best canned fish I've found, with a long shelf life. High quality product, arrived on time with few-to-little dents. The mustard sauce is great.<br /><br />The problem here is my order in May cost under $9 (w/ free Prime shipping) for the 9 tins of fish.  The price now is $24 plus added $5 shipping.  No more Prime? No more Subscribe and Save? Come on Amazon, bring this back.  Tripling the price is not fair.<br /><br />It would be 5 stars for the product alone, but the insane price increase is not acceptable so one star is removed.<br /><br />EDIT 10/2012-  The price has come down a little bit to $20 with free Prime shipping but it is still nowhere near the original $9 I paid with my first order.  I went ahead and ordered anyway because I can't find this locally at all. This latest shipment had each tin individually wrapped in bubble wrap and there were ZERO dents in the tins.  Thank you Amazon for at least packaging these properly, even if the price is still too high.  It's good fish and the expiration date on this order (received in October 2012) is 12/31/2016.

review/text: The fish were excellent, but a few cans had some dents, nothing serious but they were packed loose in a plastic bag and were pretty much free to bounce around in the box.  Like I said, the fish were great, I was a little concerned they would have an acid bite due to the mustard (I've had fish in the past with mustard, not this brand, and they were too acidic!)but these were very mild and tasty!  I enjoyed them, but remember, not everyone has the same palate. So if you're willing to try something different, try these!  (Plus, I have to admit, I got them at such a great price I couldn't pass them up.)

review/summary: Delicious but they added "vegetable oil," which is totally unnecessary
review/text: Like most herring products, MW Polar Herring Fillets in Mustard is delicious.  However, MW Polar makes the mistake of adding vegetable oil to this product.  I've eaten many cans of sardines in tomato sauce from Thailand and they taste delicious despite the fact that no vegetable oil is added.  The fat from the sardines is more than enough to make the tomato paste delicious.  Herring tastes a little better than sardines even though these 2 fish species look almost exactly alike.  MW Polar should stop adding vegetable oil to their herring products because the fat from the herring is more than enough to make it delicious.<br />Some scientists are worried, based on experiments with lower animals, that cetoleic acid (an omega-11 fatty acid), which comprises about 10% of herring fat, could be cardiotoxic to humans.  Sardine fat is only about 1% cetoleic acid.  I personally am not worried about eating plenty of the cetoleic acid in herring fat because the Inuit Eskimos of Greenland, who hunt and eat marine mammals in addition to fish, ingest about 100 times the cetoleic acid of most American fish eaters.  Result:  Cardiovascular disease is virtually nonexistent among the Inuit Eskimos of Greenland despite the fact that they are the world's heaviest cigarette smokers!

review/summary: Taste is OK, ingedients aren't, overall meh
review/text: This is a bigger tin (compared to the regular, unflavoured product -- but the fish content is also lower, so the difference is probably the sauce). The taste is quite good, I must say, but let us look at the ingredients (taken directly from a tin):<br />Herring Fillets (60%), water, mustard (water, mustad seeds, spirit vinegar, salt, spices, natural flavourings), sugar, vegetable oil, spirit vinegar, Thickener: guar gum, carregeenan; Seasonings (with celery, soy, gluten), salt, tomato paste. (Contains: Herring, mustard, celery, soy, gluten).<br /><br />And so, the regular kippers come in smaller tins but the fish content is at least 80%, and it contains nothing but fish, water, and salt. Here we have a lot of undesireables:<br />- Gluten (bad for those allergic to it)<br />- Soy (can't remember what's wrong with soy, but there's some controversy, so I try to avoid)<br />- Vegetable oil (sounds innocent, but it's probably some garbage like highly processed corn or cottonseed or soy oil, or a mixture of them. These are bad oils. Search the net on "vegetable oil" to find out why exactly it's not a good thing).<br /><br />All in all, meh. OK product; not too healthful; taste fine; was good for the price I got it for (nine bucks a pack, which as I can see nearly doubled since I ordered, which was like a week ago; was delivered very fast). Wouldn't recommend, really. I will consume what I got, but will not reorder.

review/text: I also order this stuff from coffeeam.com but it is a concentrate; it says right on the carton to add equal parts of milk(or milk substitute - I use 1/2% milk to watch calories and cholesterol levels).  I also use the Krups espresso machine in order to steam my milk before mixing with the heated up Chai.  And as a result, it tastes exactly like Starbucks.  I can drink it at a much lower cost though by making it at home!  If your Chai is made this way, you shouldn't taste a 'peppery' or 'spicy' taste.  That means there is too much chai.  Of course, after reading the other reviews, I realize that some people enjoy the stronger flavor.  But for those who enjoy the Starbucks Chai, this is the way to go.

Just heating the milk does not add the micro-bubbles that make a drink a latte.

review/text: I Know I am in the minority here but I do not like this tea. I've had chai tea before and loved it, but Tazo's version is weird. It contains black pepper. It strongly overpowers the drink for me. In my opinion black pepper does not belong in a drink. I found this undrinkable.

I got them to help me quit smoking (oral fix.) I am finding out they are effective in losing weight as well. They defiantly curve my appetite. I find they give me a nice subtle increase in energy too, without that "nervous feel". I am telling my friends about this product. Who would have ever thought "one can eat candy AND lose weight"!?

I don't know if it's just me, but once I'm done eating a lollipop I'm hungry for food. I figured maybe it was just the first time, but every other time I ate a lollipop, I would get extremely hungry right after. I will admit it tastes good but it doesn't do what it's claiming. I haven't lost any weight, at all.

review/text: I liked these lollipos.  They seemed to work and tasted pretty good.  The drawback was that they contained sugar (bad for a ketogenic diet) and they burned the inside of my mouth (I'm guessing they have a lot of acid in them).  Because I'm afraid they may damage my teeth due to what I'm guessing is a high acid content, I probably will not order them again which is a shame.  They really seemed to help curb my appetite.  :(

review/text: The last order of "assorted flavor" pops I received (2 bags!) were actually two bags of all cinnamon pops, that had been re-barcoded with an assorted sticker over the correct 'cinnamon' sticker. At $30 a bag, it'd be nice to get what you order. It was a gift tho, so I didn't go to the trouble of returning. I'd have been less bummed if it was a favorite flavor!<br /><br />Love the product & have been using them on and off for several years. Best flavors IMHO, Pink Lemonade, Pina Colada, Mountain Berry... nummy. They do speed up your metabolism (and that sometimes includes... let me be delicate... your intestines). They do help as a snack replacement & as long as you just suck them, they last forever, so they push you through the craving fit and leave you feeling satisfied.

review/summary: Keeps your mouth busy for sure!
review/text: These may not work as an effective "appetite suppressant" for me, BUT, they seriously take between 45 minutes to 1 hour to finish!!!  That is great for me because they keep my mouth busy and I'm not thinking of snacking all day.  Also, by the time I finish one, I have to wait to eat anyways just because the sweet taste is still in my mouth and therefore keeps me satisfied for another 30min to an hour later =)  Well, then maybe they are an appetite suppressant. LOL  I ordered the assorted flavors pack because I wasn't sure what I was in for.  Initially, I thought I wanted to order just watermelon.  Glad I didn't, it was nasty!  My favorite flavors ended up sup rising me: cappuccino, candy cane, root beer float (I normally HATE root beer anything).  I also love the cherry (taste like Luden's cough drops) and the grape.  Interesting side effect: I've cut back on the smoking!

review/summary: A great food for our dogs
review/text: I have been feeding Fromm Four Star Beef Frittata for the last month to my bichons and chihuahua.<br />The ingredients are healthful, no byproducts, grains or artificial anything. It's a family run company with its own production mill and has never had a recall, which is reassuring in today's day and age with all the recalls and sick pets!<br /><br />The kibble size is quite small, which is great for my 4 pound Chihuahua.  The other dogs don't seem to mind the kibble size at all.<br /><br />Coats are looking beautiful. I have one super sensitive bichon whose skin has stayed in good shape on this food, thankfully.  She gets yeast infections on her skin (ears, toes, face/muzzle) that can make her quite miserable.  Fromm has kept her in great shape!<br /><br />Back yard clean-up is good.  Initially when I switched the girls to Fromm, they had a little gas but once acclimated have not been gassy at all.<br /><br />Great food!  Transitioning/rotating to the Game Bird recipe now and will report on that too!

review/summary: The best quality grain-free dog food available!
review/text: I have been feeding my Puggle and Pug Fromm grain-free dog food for three months and it has really improved their coats.  Shedding has dramatically decreased to that of a 'normal' dog. (Pugs are notorious shedders.)  Their coats are now so shiny and soft!  I don't get a big cloud of dog hair from petting them anymore.  I haven't had to use the Furminator in . . . 6 weeks, and I may not need it anymore at all.  Their coats are beautifull and glossy and hardly shed now.  Before Fromm, there was always a ton of hair on my dark leather sofa and I just realized that there is hardly a hair on it now!  Wow!<br />My dogs LOVE Fromm and gobble it down.  We only feed our dogs Fromm dry food and use it for training treats -- they love it that much. (Okay, we also give our dogs natural chews like Bully Sticks, Pizzle Sticks, and dried cow esophagus, but they are all natural, too.  No grains, no sugar, no coloring.)<br />I like that it has a natural ingredient in it that reduces feces odor --- and it REALLY works!  If they get an 'outside' treat (all we feed them is Fromm, and use it for treats) I can always tell by the horrible (regular/bad) smell of their feces the next day.  When they don't get any unathorized treats, the smell is greatly reduced.<br />Also, Fromm doesn't have any fillers, it's a 'rich' dog food, in that you probably won't need to feed your dog the same amount that you were feeding them if you were using a dog food filled with corn and other fillers.  The good thing about that is that you get LESS poop.  (And that's always a good thing!)  My dogs generally poop 2-3 times a day and it is well formed and not overly malodorous.<br />Go slow in transitioning your dog over from regular (corny) dry food, because Fromm is a very rich diet.  Check the back of the bag for how much you should feed your dog and also calculate in treats or you will wind up with weight gain.<br />Fromm has never had a dog food recall.  That's awesome!  They are very careful about their ingredients.<br />I truly believe that spending my money wisely on such a high quality, grain-free dog food like Fromm Beef Frittata will provide my dogs with a long healthy life and that they will be less likely to have diseases or cancer.  I can already see a great difference in their coats.<br />I don't feed my family 'Frankenfoods' like corn syrup, sugar, 'flavorings', by-products and grains, and I wouldn't feed my dogs any of that either.  I believe I'm making an investmentin my dog's health by feeding them Fromm brand. Four paws up for Fromm!

review/summary: PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!
review/text: Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.  In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :)<br /><br />I got a great deal through Amazon on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs.  They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of crap food.  People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal.  But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust.<br /><br />Get these treats.  You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually.

review/text: We purchased these for our poodle.  She is the smaller breed (appx. 10 pounds) so I was a little worried these might be too big.  As a whole piece, the treats might be a little large for her, but they can be broken in two very easily.  The bag actually shows you how to break them in two, of course it's pretty self-explanatory as each treat has a cut down the middle of them.  So, the actual size of the treat should not be an issue for those with large or small dogs!  As far as taste--of course I can only rely on how well our dog likes them-she loves them.  Of course she is a little piggy and likes everything, but she really seems to be more fond of these than cheaper treats we have given her.  Overall I am pleased with these treats and I would recommend them if asked!

review/summary: A+ from picky eater
review/text: In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't buy from Amazon - I bought these at PetSmart, but I wanted to do a product review because these treats are worth buying in bulk - they're amazing!<br /><br />These little treats are wonderful.  I am extremely picky about what my dog eats because he's had digestive problems in the past and also because I believe dogs shouldn't be fed the unwanted junk leftover from the corn/grain industry, food that has been irradiated, or food that is made in questionable countries (cough* China * cough cough).<br /><br />Not only are these Newman's Own treats a good price, they are a good size and are indeed made with quality ingredients.  As another reviewer said, you can literally see the oats and such in the baked treats (see the product picture I took).  Plus, they're shaped like little hearts - adorable!  The best things about these treats, however, are that (1) they're made in Canada from a company we all can trust, and (2) my dog absolutely loves them. These treats are made from certified organic ingredients with 7% fat (min).  With all the pet food recalls and my inherent distaste for low quality, Chinese, irradiated, or high fat treats these treats are a winner!<br /><br />Also, my dog is a terribly picky eater when it comes to treats (which is hilarious because he'd eat cat poop if I let him).  He has never eaten any biscuit that was not literally made in a bakery from a boutique.  This has cost me lots of money in the past (in finding treats he likes, and having to deal with the bags and bags of treats he didn't like such as Blue Buffalo, Mother Hubbard's, and Wellness bars).  I bought a 13oz bag of these at PetSmart today for 5.00 (far less than I spent on the other brands), and my dog will not leave me alone.  He literally dances to get my attention because he wants me to give him one of these treats.  It seems like neither of us could be happier with this product.  If I can remember, I will do an update once the bag is gone to see if this trend has continued.<br /><br />Is there anything Newman's Own cant do?

review/text: Three years ago we found out our dog Bella had severe food allergies.Fish,potatos,veggies,fruit and a few other selected foods are all she can eat. I look and could only find Newmans Own Salmon&Potato treats for her to eat.Since then they come evey 2mths ,by Sub&save. Today when I opened the first package I was shocked. The normally,heart shaped treats that are light, airy, thick, and easy to break,were nothing but,dark,flat,hard to break rocks. So my question is "What Happened?" Not only was it one package but all six. If this is their new product,they lost a customer.But if it was a bad batch, I say how dare they send this out to consumers,take their money,and think its right.Today there are many treats made that she can eat,but I stuck with Newmans out of loyalty,because they were first in making a great product Bella could eat.And Bella really loves this treats.I hope Newmans can fix this.

Unfortunately, my two dogs (male 9 yrs & female 3 yrs) just are not impressed. I think perhaps if the 'cookies' were a little less dry and / or their excellent quality ingredients were just a little more aromatic that they would be more tempting and desired by my spoiled, but well loved dogs. If I break the cookie in half, it seems to release slightly more tasty aroma and I can almost talk the dogs into them.

review/text: Both of my dogs love these treats.  I am so glad I can give them something good for them that they beg to have!  And no worries about what might have been put in them from another country.

review/summary: No matter how healthy it is... is nothing if your dog doesn't like it
review/text: I supposed as a treat, this would do better than its dog food. But I was wrong when I received and tried it today. My dog does not like it at all. This treat feels like cookies and very dry. I got a small dog (Yorkshire). I don't know if big dog will find it delicious or not. Just my own experience.
