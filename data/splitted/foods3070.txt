review/summary: This is really good Cinnamon
review/text: I was a little leery about what kind of Cinnamon to get as there are many comments going many ways.  But in the end I wanted something that was strong in flavor as it is being used for baking.  I'm glad I did.  My raisin nut fig bread is super yummy.  And with this size I won't have to worry about running out soon.  Good Buy.

review/summary: Less than $3 at my local CostCo
review/text: The price was less than $3 at my local Costco.<br /><br />Saigon Cinnamon is good in tiny amounts for Vietnamese Pho broth or other hearty broths. Maybe as a meat preservative. That's about it.<br /><br />Do not use this species of Cinnamon to flavor coffee or deserts - it is the WRONG cinnamon. For those, you need True Cinnamon (Ceylon Cinnamon).<br /><br />This stuff bites the tongue is good for sprinkling into hearty broths or to use as cheap ant repellent.

review/summary: At last!
review/text: Finally, after years of searching, I've found a dependable source of the best candy on Earth! I first had a Violet Crumble while visiting Austin, TX. (They have the best groceries there.) Here in Nashville, the closest thing I've found is the Cadbury Crunchie bar, which is similar and good, but I felt I was missing something. I am not Australian, and do not have an Australia obsession, I just really like this candy bar.<br /><br />The center is a matrix of crunchy honeycomb-like stuff, and is covered with really good milk chocolate. Many popular American chocolate candies are made with Hershey milk chocolate, which uses sour milk as their 'secret ingredient.' The Violet Crumble does not, which I think is an improvement (definatly a change) over the local stuff. The chocolate of the VC is really good in quality, not waxy, and not too thin. This is a really great candy bar. You should try it.

review/summary: My favorite candy bar ever.
review/text: This candy bar is fantastic! I live in the United States, and there is not really anything else like it here, although the Cadbury Crunchie bar in the UK and Canada is similar.  What really makes this candy bar special is the light, firm yet spungie middle. When you bite into it the texture is definately unique. It tastes really great too: sort of a light toffee/honey taste with smooth milk chocolate on the outside. I cannot recommend this candy bar enough.

review/summary: Amazing product
review/text: So I've never had this before. But my girlfriend kept on going on and on and on about how delicious this is.<br /><br />After a month of searching for a way to get it here in the US, I finally found a seller on Amazon.<br /><br />So, it's very interesting. The inside consistency is that of malt balls, however, the taste is nothing like malt balls. It's a combination of honey and sweet nougat (like the inside of a snickers bar (minus the caramel, peanuts of course)).<br /><br />I really like it. I'd recommend this to anyone. It's a shame it's not sold in stores here, I think it'd do quite well

review/summary: honeycomb chocolate awesomeness
review/text: They used to sell Violet Crumble in many stores here in Hawaii in the 80s, when I was a kid. It was always a treat to have one. Then, time went on and I sort of forgot about them since they disappeared from the shelves. And one day when I was really craving one, I realized I hadn't seen one anywhere in a long time. Then I got the crappy news that they aren't really easy to come by in the U.S. anymore. The chocolate is not too sweet, and the honeycomb middle is crunchy and light. It's unlike any other candy bar I've had (though I have not had the Crunchie bar people compare it to). Quite possibly my fave candy bar of all time. Of all time!!!

review/summary: Honeycomb Coated with Milk Chocolate
review/text: Violet Crumbles are a classic Australian candy bar: they've been around forever and are very popular over here. They consist of a fairly hard, but brittle bar of honeycomb coated in milk chocolate. And yes, they are delicious!<br /><br />They're also a lot like the (internationally) better known "Crunchie" bar. The main differences are that:<br /><br />1. Violet Crumbles have a slightly thicker outer layer of milk chocolate.<br /><br />2. The honeycomb in a Violet Crumble is slightly harder and more solid, so it tends to shatter rather than crumble when you bite down on it.<br /><br />3. The honeycomb in a Violet Crumble has a stronger honey flavor, with significantly more "bite" to it, so to speak.<br /><br />Note that Violet Crumbles can also be purchased here on Amazon in packs of three.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Finally found them and worth the price since the bars are bigger!
review/text: I was not sure I wanted to spend the money for the shipping but the bars came in perfect condition other than a couple broken in half inside the wrapper itself.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the bars are large, much bigger than the standard ones I use to buy here in the US.  I've never seen a 50g bar, so 6 of them at about $3 a bar isn't too bad if you crave these things.  They charged around 1.99 for them when they had them at Cost Plus World Market.  You can't find them anywhere in the US so it felt like X-mas opening the box.  Very happy!  Yes it's a lot for shipping but they are coming from Australia and they got here quite fast (5 days).

review/summary: One of the very best candies ever
review/text: I found Violet Crumble in a shop about 25 miles from home one time. I always look for new taste treats, and this one looked interesting. They charged $1 per par, so I only bought one. If I had known how great it is, I would've bought five. It tastes amazing and the way it feels in your mouth and the way it crunches is also amazing. It's somewhat similar to a malted milk ball in consistency, but far far better tasting. It's pretty special. The flavor is kind of like coffee. I think everyone should try these at least once. I will definitely order a case of 24 of them sometime. They don't sell these in any stores near me as far as I know, and I would hate to drive 25 miles and go through some nightmare parking hassles just to get a candy bar. I really need to find a good candy shop near me if there is one, because I'm really tired of the same old ordinary, boring, low grade American candies at the supermarket. So if you want something different and amazing, then I'd definitely recommend Violet Crumble. It's worth the price.

review/summary: my favorite candy, not available is US anymore, bummer
review/text: I used to get these from my local Stop and Shop.  Then one day they just did not carry them any more.  Turns out Nestle decided not to make and distribute these in the US.  In any event, if you read all the reviews on this bar you will see that no one has said they did not like the bar (even the 1 star reviews).  The low rated reviews only complain about the shipping cost.  I don't blame them of course.  You will pay significant shipping to get them from overseas.  It is all just a question of how badly you want them.  As it turns out... I want them badly.<br /><br />These bars have an excellent chocolate covering.  Not thick but just right.  You can taste the quality of the chocolate readily as it melts on your tounge.  It is a very high quality milk chocolate.  It is not in any way like a Hershey chocolate.<br /><br />These bars have what is called a "sponge" candy center.  Indeed, this is the bar; one six inch long sponge candy bar covered in wonderful milk chocolate.  I love the way it breaks up under my teeth, and then melts in my mouth.  Wonderful texture and flavor.<br /><br />As I get on in years, and after two glimpses at death (though all is fine), I have concluded that I no longer need to anguish so much over spending money and that as long as I remember how my fellow man is suffering elsewhere and do something about it, it is OK for me to enjoy the things I like.  So I order them and pay the shipping and relish the fact that my favorite candy costs 6$/bar and I am royalty, for a moment.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!

review/summary: Good Gift for Coffee Fanatics
review/text: I bought this sampler for my Mother and she loved it. This is a woman who does not function without two or three pots of coffee a day so she knows her coffee. As for me, I am not much of a coffee drinker but I tried most of the flavors and thought that they were very good without being overly strong. We got about two pots (8 to 12 cups) per bag without the coffee being too watered down. Definitely a hit with any coffee drinkers in your life. I sprung for the gift wrapping and was not disappointed. Be warned though, the box it is shipped in will have the name of the company and what is inside of it, so if you are trying to surprise someone maybe have it shipped to a friends house first. Otherwise very happy with the product.

Imagine, if you will, popping a piece of soft strawberry gum into your mouth and beginning to chew--the first few seconds are always the best, when you get a blast of intense strawberry flavor along with a firm, enjoyable chew, right? Then imagine that gum melting away gradually on your tongue, without losing any of its flavor, rather than enduring and just becoming stringy and bland. Very nice indeed.

These are fresh, mildly flavored, mildly sugared, and to me, preferable to the other Emerald nut variants. Few better snack foods exist. They're high-protein, fill you up, and keep you going.<br /><br />But don't pay $11 a can. Target has them, as does Publix, for about half that. Publix in particular often puts them on sale for $3 or so. Stock up when that happens; they last a good while in the cupboard.

review/text: These are fabulous... better, even, than Emerald's Cocoa Roast Almonds.  Unfortunately, we haven't been able to find them readily at any of our local stores.  I was happy to have found them online, but wish they were somewhat less expensive.  The product is 5 stars, no doubt about it.  The price is... probably 3 or 4.

review/summary: Didn't notice anything with the butter flavor
review/text: The oil worked very well; however, the supposed butter flavor was not noticeable as we still added melted butter.  I switched to using regular coconut oil and the melted butter and it is fine.  I also didn't care for the fact that there wasn't a way to reseal the pack except to fold it over and put a paper clip on it, but then you better use it soon.  We very rarely made a full pot of popcorn.  I find using the jar of coconut oil more flexible.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I have no idea why this product is packaged this way.  The first thing I did, was to cut the packages open and pour the contents into a small jar to keep and use from.  This butterred flavored coconut oil makes great popcorn.  I use it with pop secret popcorn in a presto microwave popcorn popper and it makes large puffy popcorn that looks and tastes great.  You only need 1 table spoon per batch so this will last a long time.

review/summary: Stanley wants seconds!
review/text: Stanley may not be the best source for food reviews, since he generally eats anything he can fit into his mouth and seems to enjoy it, but the fact is, he is very fussy about dog food.  I've tried the high priced stuff, Royal Kanin, Iams, even Paul Newman's offering which smells better than the stuff I feed myself.  He eats it, of course, but not joyfully, not with that Cocker Spaniel enthusism.  Plainly put, when Stanley eats something he loves, he sends up a spray and every fiber of his doggy being exudes joy.  Yeah, I know, so do I, thanks for bringing it up in front of strangers.  We're talking about the dog, so beat it.<br /><br />Anyway, until now, only people food...but specially prepared for Stanley (vet approved menu: chicken or beef, baked boiled or broiled, fat removed, diced and mooshed together with selected fresh vegetables)...elicited this kind of enthusiasm. I am not averse to cooking for my dog, but it would be nice to be able to open up a can every so often instead. Particularly when there is only one piece of chicken left and I want it.  A friend told me that his finicky dog loved Purina, to the exclusion of all other canned offerings, so I tried it.  Country Stew, Lamb and Rice and this "Gravy with Beef" which sounds unappetizing, but smells fine, are his favorites.  He still prefers a nice piece of beef and has absolute and undisputed dibs on the white meat from every chicken, but this rates a ten on his tail-wagging unbridled joy of eating scale.<br /><br />I should point out that Stanley also eats bugs when he can get them, so while the word "choosy" might describe his eating habits, so does disgusting.  But no matter, he's the best Good Boy ever and deserves the best...whether it's people food, dog food or the occasional crawly thing.

review/summary: Our dogs love it but finding low price and 12 oz cans is tough
review/text: When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses "...it's mostly water," our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the "beef and liver" chunks in the future.

review/summary: Pedigree Dog Food, why I give if 5 Stars
review/text: I have a four year old dog who loves Pedigree Canned Dog food.  We have been using it the last six months.  I have purchased some of the most expensive canned dog foods at a local pet store and he will not eat the stuff.  If I have a bag of high quality kibbles and mix it in with the Pedigree, he will not eat his food.  We tried Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Holistic Select, Innova, Merrick, and Natural Balance.  I don't know what is in these higher quality cans of dog food he does not like.  Maybe too many vegetables??  He will even hide and pout if I put that stuff in front of him.  One time I left the food out for 15 min., put it away, and tried the next day.  He just would not eat the food.  He just loves the smell and taste of Pedigree, and he will even eat Alpo on occasion, but he will not eat the expensive dog foods, which I am more than willing to purchase for him.  I talked to two vets about this.  They tell me dogs go by odor.  The worse something smells the more they like it.  This is why many dogs will roll in dead things out of doors.  We do try to balance out his diets with apples, carrots, etc., if he will eat them, plus the dog gets a vitamin with minerals each day.  Of course he will eat cooked meat if I give it to him, and often we will give this to him with some rice or whole wheat pasta mixed in.  If someone can tell me how to get him to eat the better canned or kibble dog food that so many folks think dogs should be on, then I would like to know this.  Also, the reason we started using Pedigree is because we have some friends (and their relatives) who have had many dogs over the years and feed them Pedigree.  These dogs have lived to a ripe old age.  The biggest thing that got them down was arthritis, but the Pedigree never killed them.  So, this dog food may not be high quality, which I agree when compared to Blue Buffalo, etc., but it does not seem to affect their life span.  I am sure there will be folks who will tell me differently, but for those folks I know personally, they have not found any problems with this food for their dogs.  Amen.

review/text: We feed only high quality grain free food and treats to our cat and two dogs (and some raw). These are their favorite to date.<br /><br />The cat has repeatedly managed to open cabinets, knock the tub onto the floor and then had the dogs do the job of tearing it open. Because of this treat, we have had to put a magnetic "lock" on one of our kitchen cabinets!<br /><br />So needless to say, they absolutely love the salmon, cod and now the shrimp. We use the little flakey bits at the bottom as food toppers, this especially helps when transitioning to a new food for our Chihuahua and Australian Shepherd - both rescues.<br /><br />Overall a great item, pets love it, we love that its good for them and that's all that matters.

review/text: There's simply not much maple flavor. Even after combining the separated oily, what results is just speckled & oily almond butter. I assume this 'subtle' (to put it kindly) mapley-ness is due to maple sugar rather than maple syrup being used. They really copped out cost-wise with regards to the additives, as there IS palm oil yet separation does occur; sure, this consequently means you don't need to refrigerate it, but this stuff shouldn't be so expensive. Next time I'll just mix real maple syrup into my homemade almond butter for cheaper & superior flavor; really regretting I bought 3, even at the reduced promo price.

review/text: Out of all the Justin's we've tried this one is by far the best--it's like a dessert but not too sweet.  I don't even like nut butters all that well but can lick this stuff by the spoonfulls.  If you try no other Justin's products--try this one--it's dangerously addictive

review/summary: The best
review/text: A peanut allergy has made almond butter a frequent part of our family's diet. We tried a couple different brands but kept trying because none of them were that great, and some even tasted like the almonds they used were rancid, eeew (a brand that starts with the letter "M", ahem). When I tried Justin's I knew that almond butter could not possibly taste better than this. I don't know how they do it. And yes, the stuff is not cheap. Price is a frustrating part of going from peanut butter to almond butter but in this case, you really get what you pay for. The stuff is insane. It's so good. We eat it straight out of the jar. It's satisfying because all that good protein fills you up, and it's got the salty/sweet thing going, yummers!

review/summary: The best Almond Butter out there!
review/text: My personal trainer wanted me to switch from peanut butter to almond butter because it is healthier. I tried almond butter and didn't really like it. Over a couple months I tried 4-5 different brands. One day when I was at whole foods I saw the single serving Justin's Maple Almond Butter and decided to try again. WOW! This Almond butter is the first one that I didn't just like, I loved it. And now I crave it more than peanut butter which used to be my favorite. The taste is a perfect blend of almonds, salt and a touch of sweetness from the maple. So delicious! I love buying on amazon as it is much cheaper than Whole Foods. Yum!!

review/summary: Bliss in a jar
review/text: Justin's nut butters are amazing, and the Maple Almond Butter is my personal favorite. It's also my husband's favorite. So much so that I'm reduced to selfish hiding and hoarding! Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but not far from the truth of my desire. Second to the blissful taste is the fact that it is surprisingly low on sugar grams. You would think you were eating almost candy, though it isn't over sweet. And it tastes great on just about anything you would want to put it on. But then again, go ahead and eat it straight from the jar! The chocolate variety is my second favorite for similar reasons.

review/text: This is the creamiest nut butter I have had to date (it is very creamy, but not runny).  The maple doesn't impart a strong maple flavor, but does make this delicious spread as sweet as it is salty (making it ideal for both savory and sweet snacking). I've enjoyed almond butter before, but this is the fist time I have found myself eating it out of the jar...

review/summary: Best Almond Butter out there
review/text: Justin's Maple Almond Butter is, hands down, the best almond butter on the market. It's a bit pricey, but worth every cent. Nut butters, outside of peanut butter, are expensive anyhow, and this one is reasonable by comparison. I have made my own almond butter, but it doesn't taste anywhere near as good as this stuff. Maranatha, another leading brand, tastes like Crisco...blech! Justin's has the perfect blend of flavors, not too much or too little of anything. I also find that my consumption doesn't get out of hand the way it tends to do with more processed brands. Just a great product all around. Try it!

review/text: I grew up in maple country and was so excited to see a non-artificially flavored maple nut butter. The problem is I can't detect even a hint of maple flavor. It might be good almond butter but I can get that a lot cheaper than this brand. Their chocolate varieties are to die for, I won't try the maple again.

review/summary: Skeptical but tried it anyway ...
review/text: I've had almond butters in the past ... nothing special and nothing to write home about.  This one is different.  Maybe because of the maple syrup added (I can't resist maple) that gives it an extra kick of goodness that regular almond butter doesn't have.<br /><br />Since I'm into good health - this almond butter was like dessert/treat for me.  I had 1 slice sourdough bread, topped it with this slightly toasted, slightly sweetened almond butter then topped it with the wheat sprouts I grow.  It was wonderful and knocked my chocolate craving away. (since I haven't eaten chocolate in months I wasn't craving it too badly)  I like this much better than Nutella and I'll switch to this for my treats.  Tastes delicious right off your spoon.  You do have to stir this up as there was an oil layer on top. (I'm in hot California)<br /><br />I would love to try the regular almond butter...maybe next time...or not.  I'm loving this one for now.  I'm weaning off of peanuts so this one here is excellent when you are used to Skippy Chunky...although no chunks in this...it may be a bit too sweet for you if you are sensitive to sugars.  I can see kids taking a liking to this one if they can't eat peanut butter.

review/summary: lol better than nutella.
review/text: I havent bought this on amazon yetbut I will.  I bought this at Target and 2 dollars cheaper in Whole Foods, but its really cheaper on aamazon so my next buy would be here thru amazon.<br /><br />This is so much better than Nutella.  Nutella is so sweet and it has more unnecessary ingredients.  It's cheap, abouit 4 bucks but I could only eat it twice a week if I tried.  This is more expensive and I could eat it all day, everyday.  But it's so expensive that I have to cut down  on it, plus its fattening.. so i just use it pre-workout.<br /><br />Maple almond butter is better.  Chocolate is too bitter, and classic is just plain meh.<br /><br />If you need to, buy the small packet and taste it from there before buying in bulk.  This is my new obsession.

It has a nice taste, but if you are going to sell this as maple flavored almond butter, I really do want to taste the maple in it. I will not purchase again.

review/summary: Beware if you have peanut allergy
review/text: I've purchased at least a dozen of the 16oz. Maple Almond Butters without incident, but the most recent container has caused an allergic reaction from peanuts.  I actually tried the nut butter from this container on 3 separate occasions to rule out other causes and the reaction occurred every time (oops).  I have had this allergy since I was extremely young, and this is the first time I've EVER had a reaction from something with the (frankly lame) disclaimer "may contain traces of peanuts".  Luckily my allergy is on the mild side, although nausea and vomiting are still not pleasant.  To be honest, with what they charge for their nut butters they should be able to process them without ANY cross contamination.  Sorry to say they've permanently lost a customer as I'll be sticking with Blue Diamond, who boast a 100% Peanut Free almond butter.

review/summary: too sweet...don't need maple or honey...
review/text: People are switching from peanut butter to almond butter mainly for health reasons...doing so means giving up Mr. Peanut, and this is sometimes tough to do...so, in order to make the switch easier, gimmicks are employed to help with this...adding honey, sugar, and maple syrup are a few of the ways this is done (and yes, they do this with peanut butter too).  I purchased this product and I think it is quite good...problem is that it is too sweet.  I use the Trader Joe's almond butter with flax seeds and the taste is great...cheaper too....a little more of an oily consistency though.  I will now order the Justin's almond butter without any gimmicky sweeteners.  Truth be told...good almond butter tastes sweet provided the almonds are roasted thoroughly.<br /><br />If you have a sweet-tooth, get this..if you want to stay in line with health and not intake a little more sugar than you need, go with the one without the maple or honey...you shouldn't miss the unnecessary sugars...<br /><br />**Update...I got in the standard Justin's Almond Butter and YUCK!  Now I know why everyone wants to mask the stuff with maple.  It's like they forgot to roast the almonds...I don't get it.  I'm going back to Trader Joe's Almond Butter with Flax Seeds...yeah, it's a little looser, but the taste is vastly better.  I was hoping Justin's could do better...they simply can't...and for this price, they should!<br /><br />**UPDATE 2...OKAY, I'm back with the honey flavor and we enjoy...it just took some time to grow on us.  I upped the star rating to 5 where it should be...it's good stuff!!

review/text: I have been searching all over for a genuine South African-type biltong available online. The competitor, the South African Food Shop, makes excellent and authentic-tasting snapsticks, but its biltong is rather disappointing by comparison.<br /><br />So, I decided to try this product. The aroma, consistency, and taste of the biltong chips that arrived are indistinguishable from the kind of U.S. beef jerky one can purchase at any convenience store: It contains way too much sugar (like American mass-produced beef-jerky) and the flavor seems fake (artificial smoke flavoring and/or teriyaki sauce?). The stuff even smells like U.S. "teriyaki-style" beef jerky.<br /><br />What this product is *NOT* is South African-style biltong.

review/text: Binyamina, The Cave, 2007:  The boutique arm of Binyamina which is marketed as a stand-alone winery.  As I have written in the past, the first vintage I enjoyed of this wine was 2006 and I am happy to report that the 2007 version is great as well.  Not to be confused with the incredible Old Vine limited edition released last year which made my "Best of 2011" list, this wine stands on its own two feet (for US readers, note that restaurants have a mevushal version of this wine, while retailers primarily sell a non-mevushal version).  A full bodied wine comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), Merlot (33%) and Petit Verdot (2%), with each component aged independently for two years in mostly new oak before being blended together.  A rich nose of black forest fruit, cedar, chocolate and some herbs are backed up by a solid core or big tannins that are nicely integrating with the fruit and wood.  The palate has more black fruit, cedar and some spicy oak together with some Mediterranean herbs, wet forest floor and some more chocolate with a hint of pleasing bitterness.  A long, gripping and luxurious finish rounds out this wine.<br /><br />To sign up for Yossie's free weekly newsletter on kosher wines and see his reviews and articles, check out: [...]

review/summary: an OK yogurt bar
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JNF8CG">Nutri-Grain Yogurt Bars, Strawberry Yogurt, 10.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I have had better yogurt bars. The strawberry filling has a slightly bitter taste. I don't think I will order these again since there are other yogurt bars available that are more palatable.
