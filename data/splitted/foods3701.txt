review/text: I was happy to see varieties of Starbucks coffee here in Amazon especially my favorite kind, so I ordered it right away.  However, I underestimated the size although it comes in 3 bags.  But for $27 something, I'd rather buy it directly at Starbucks stores because they are cheaper there.  Otherwise, very good coffee.

review/summary: If you see it, swipe it- and use slowly
review/text: I remember my mom coming home with the distinctive jar of Red Cherry Favorit she saw sitting on a shelf at Ross, making a point of telling me she managed to snag it for only five or so dollars where it might have been even more expensive outside. I was a little thrown that it would be so expensive and hard to find. How good could it be if I'd never heard of it-? But one dollop of the stuff on a biscuit erased any doubt. The preserves, though very sweet, have a good consistency, are easy to spread, and have an uncommonly strong and pure cherry flavor that had me carefully rationing the jar to make it last as long as possible. It would be a long time before I saw another; imagine my delight to find the brand on sale for three dollars a jar at Harris Teeter. I bought several.

review/summary: a great tasting snack (small meal) substitute
review/text: If you're a former junk food junkie like me, then you'll get an idea of what these things taste like when I describe them as a more fibrous (chewy) version of rice kripy squares with a chocolate coating on the bottom.  They really are that delicious.  And at 170 calories with 4gm of fat (1.5gm saturated), 9gm of protein, and 5gm of fiber, they are a healthy alternative to many other types of snacks that one could indulge in (pastries, candy, etc).<br /><br />These are easily my favorite protein bar and I've tried over a dozen kinds.<br /><br />Edit on 9/27/07:  This review pertains to the chocolate peanut Go Lean flavor.  I just noticed that Amazon is grouping reviews for all of Kashi's bars together, so without specificity in the review it's impossible to know which product is being reviewed.

review/summary: Tasty AND healthy... how weird!
review/text: This is one of the best nutrition bars I have ever eaten.  As another reviewer stated, it is like a rice krispy treat.  However, dare I say, this bar is better-tasting than a rice krispy treat.  It's made with rice, oats, nuts, sugar cane juice, and a chocolate underbelly.  The bar is good for a quick snack if you're hungry between meals, and if you divide your meals up to five a day, then it's basically a meal.  Each bar has 6 grams of fiber and 9 grams of protien, so it will help fill you up more than that junky Snickers.  They're a little on the expensive side, but it's worth it.

review/summary: good, but not quite as good as Kashi's Chocolate Peanut Bliss bar
review/text: I just submitted a review of the Chocolate Peanut Bliss bar, a product I've been enjoying regularly for the past couple of months.  This bar is very similar to the other flavor in terms of nutritional information as well as consistency, but I don't like this one quite as much.  To me the "caramel" flavor in this bar does not much resemble caramel and actually has a bit of a malty flavor.  I do enjoy these on occasion for variety, though, and obviously some other reviewers liked the flavor of these more than I did.

review/text: I don't eat these bars during the day as a mid-meal snack (I like the Kashi TLC Chewy Granola Bars for that). I love eating these after I get back from my hour+ runs.  With 27g of Carbs, 8g of protein they fit the 3:1 carb: protein ratio for post-runs, plus they have 5g of fiber to boot.  More importantly, they taste great!  I've tried other 'energy bar' type things, i.e. larabar, but can't stand the dense, moist, chewy texture. These are more in line with the texture of a Kashi granola bar.  Surprisingly they are cheaper ($13.99/box or $1.19/bar) at Wegmans.

So, I've spent a long time trying to find the right snack and I have finally found the best granola bar ever! Kashi's bars do not taste like cardboard and their texture is so much better than any other health/protein bar I've ever tried. The flavors are fantastic and I'm officially addicted to them, especially the chocolate & peanut bar. I personally love everything that Kashi makes but these granola bars are a real find!! I think I'm gonna go have one right now...

review/summary: Kashi Go Lean Crunchy Chocolate Almond
review/text: This was an ok bar.  Not my favorite of the Kashi line-up, but still not bad in a pinch when I have nothing else for breakfast.<br /><br />The chocolate almond bar tasted mainly of chocolate.  In fact, I really didn't taste the almonds at all.  I'm sure they added to the crunchy texture, but predominately I tasted the other grains in there all liberally coated with a milk chocolate.  This was made even more chocolatey by the thick coating on the bottom as well.  So all in all, definitely chocolate if you couldn't tell from the description thus far.  I do enjoy the crunchy aspects of this particular type of bar as well, but compared to the Chocolate Pretzel and some of the other ones, I don't think it was quite as crunchy as it could have been.<br /><br />These are definitely a fitness bar.  8 grams of protein, 5 grams of fiber, and 170 calories are packed right in.  This makes it the perfect choice for exercise or as a meal replacement.  I wouldn't recommend just snacking on it when you're hungry.  Choose a lower calorie snack for that type of meal.  Sugars are 13 grams, which isn't high, but it isn't the diabetic special either.<br /><br />Ingredients are alright.  It doesn't boast the organic ingredients that some bars too, but it does have that Kashi special seven whole grains ingredient in it.  The main sweetener is brown rice syrup and there is some evaporated cane juice crystals and fructose as well.  They also add some vitamins such as folic acid and zinc oxide into the blend too.  And of course there are almonds in this bar, so those with nut allergies should probably steer clear.<br /><br />Not a bad bar but I'd choose other flavors over this one.  There just wasn't anything special or unique seeming about it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

A crunchy, nutty, nutritious, energy bar at 170 calories that tastes good is definitely something I'll keep buying.  Until I found them on Amazon.com, it was touch and go as to whether or not I could get them at all.  Very few places carry Kashi bars.  [...]

review/summary: Delicious, satisfying snack
review/text: I'm new to the Kashi brand of products but stumbled upon the chocolate peanut bars at my local Wegman's market.  I've tried a number of nutrition/energy bars, including Clif, Pria, Powerbar, etc. and the Kashi bars are by far the best.  They do not taste artificial like most of the other bars I've tried.  The chocolate satisfies your sweet tooth, and the peanut butter flavor is great too.  I'm a fan of granola so these are really the perfect snack for me.  They're very crunchy and are a decent size too, so by the time you're done you feel like you've actually eaten something substantial.  Now that I've tried these I won't be buying any of the other bars on the market.

review/text: I am one hardly to ever leave product reviews, and as much as I buy online, I should work on that. But, after trying the various Kashi products, these bars are by far the best and I feel the need to leave a review! I started off eating the Kashi Honey Almond Flax granola bars, which are very good, but definitley not as sweet as these (not a good OR bad thing, just a comparison). However, you will still get the protein, fiber and omega-3s if that's what you're looking for. If you love chocolate and almonds and are looking for a protein/fiber bar that tastes good and is more on the sweet side, this is definitely one to try!!! Whether you use them as a meal replacement or as a snack, they are absolutley amazing and I will definitely be a repeat customer.

But as soon as the chocolate wears out it's really like you're eating sawdust. The after taste is horrid, the texture is terrible.

review/summary: Tastes just like the Tazo Awake tea bags
review/text: If you enjoy the bold black tea Awake made by Tazo, you're going to love it just as much in these super convenient K-Cups. You get the exact same great strong flavor as you do from using the tea bags. I like my tea strong, and I find I can actually make about 1 and a half mugs of tea from each of these K-Cups, and still get a good strength. Another cheaper option is simply buying a box of the Tazo Awake tea bags and just use your Keurig to make the hot water for your tea, then just add a tea bag to it. But if you like using the K-Cups, you will be happy with the cup of tea these produce. I've used up about half of one of these boxes so far, and only once did I end up with any tea leave in my cup. There were just a few, and it only happened one time so far, so I think it's not that common an occurrence. It didn't affect the cup of tea at all, I just always check to see when I'm trying out new K-Cups how clear of a drink they produce. In all, Tazo has produced a better of a cup of tea than I've brewed from other brands of K-Cups, such as Twinings Earl Grey, which came out cloudy and weak.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the taste of this blend, it's a strong black tea with no real flavors to speak of. There's no citrus, no sweetness, nothing like that. If I was to compare it to coffee, it would be like a basic, black coffee with nothing added to it. Because of it's simple taste, this is a great anytime tea and a great replacement for coffee.

review/summary: Best K-Cup Black Tea on the market
review/text: If you're a tea connoisseur like myself, you will find that Tazo "Awake" black tea, is the best tea K-cup on the market. Other brands are incomparable in taste and quality. It's true, that it's a little pricier than other brands, but you get what you pay for. Tazo black tea has a bold taste without the bitterness that often accompanies strong black teas. So far, this is the best black tea K-cup that is available. I'm hoping that Revolution comes out with their version of the K-cup because that is my favorite bagged black tea and I'm curious if their K-cup will be able to beat out Tazo. However, for now, Tazo definitely has a corner on the tea K-cup market.

review/text: Unfortunately, these are not the same Black Cows from the past.  Only the name is the same.  Even the press release states there is a difference:<br /><br />"Originally, Black Cow� was a Slo Poke� caramel dipped into a compound chocolate," says Rich Warrell, director of sales and marketing for Classic Caramel, a subsidiary of The Warrell Corporation and current manufacturer of Black Cow� and Slo Poke� brands. "Our version is a firmer, full-flavored caramel with real chocolate in the piece itself--like a much richer Tootsie Roll�, which is also a type of a chocolate caramel."<br /><br />If you are buying these expecting the resurrection of the delicious treat you once knew, then you'll be highly disappointed.  If you just want a chocolate-caramel candy, then the new formulation of Black Cows will probably suffice.

review/summary: These are toasted! Not raw!
review/text: I looked all over the package before I bought these to see if they were raw or toasted. Since it didn't say "toasted," anywhere, I thought they were raw. They are not! They are toasted and are shriveled and dehydrated because of it! Raw almonds are nutritious and delicious and plump. These are dry and chalky and small; they are wrinkled up like raisins, and are slightly chewy instead of healthfully crunchy.

review/summary: Extraordinary Almonds
review/text: Diamond Almonds -- yum!  We eat them raw by the handfuls, and we toast them the way the package says in a single layer on a baking sheet for 10 minutes at 350�F.<br /><br />We tried the following recipe, which was on the bag, and loved it!<br /><br />DIAMOND CHILLED SPICED ALMONDS<br /><br />Ingredients<br />3 cups whole almonds<br />4 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil (We use olive oil.)<br />1 1/2 teaspoons paprika<br />1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder<br />1 1/2 teaspoons oregano<br />1 teaspoon ground cumin<br />2 teaspoons garlic salt (We substiuted powder to cut the salt.)<br />1/8 teaspoon black pepper (And we added a few shakes of red pepper!)<br /><br />Procedure<br />Combine almonds and oil in large skillet.  Cook over medium-low heat until lightly browned, about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. While almonds are cooking, combine all spices in food processor or blender, turning on and off, until finely ground.  When almonds are done cooking, immediately transfer to a large bowl and toss with seasoning, blend to coat thoroughly, spread on baking sheet to cool completely.  Store in airtight container up to 1 month.<br /><br />About storage:<br />For good shelf life it's good to store them well.  We don't worry about that because we eat them rapidly!  I placed the bag between our computers to write this review, and Paul thought I was giving him a snack.  For once, I'm resisting though, because if I get started, I'll never finish this review.<br /><br />When you store them, you want to keep them from becoming rancid, and you want to keep the bugs out.  Don't store them in an open container in the refrigerator because they will absorb the flavors of pungent food. The ideal temperature is 35-45�F.<br /><br />Almonds, which are the cousins of peaches, have an interesting history.  They are native to the Mediterranen area and are mentioned sixteen times in the Bible. Most of the almonds we get today grow in California. That's where Diamond almonds grow.<br /><br />We like Diamond almonds better than the others we have tried.  We've never bought any that were not satisfactory.  Our poodle loves almonds!<br /><br />Because we like them so much and because we know they benefit cardiac and respiratory health, we eat them often.  What needs to be considered is the density of this food.  There are 170 calories in 1/4 cup. If we keep eating them the way we do, we will cancel out the health benefits!<br /><br />I hope this review has been helpful.

review/text: Just a handful of almonds (about 22) a couple of times a week will help reduce your blood fats, lose weight, and generally feel good.  These Diamond almonds are great, because there's nothing added to make them bad for you like salt, oil, etc.  The six ounce size is great to sneak into the movies and share with a friend.  You can even use that size of bag as a heart healthy stocking stuffer for a health conscious person.

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: Diamond Whole Almonds are some of the best almonds out there! These come in a see through plastic bag and they're at their best until the expiration date printed on the rear of the package. In addition, you may want to keep these refrigerated so that they stay fresh as long as possible.<br /><br />Almonds contain fat; in fact 140 of each 170 calorie serving comes from fat. On the brighter side, there are no trans fats, no cholesterol and no sodium. The lack of sodium is important since some companies package their almonds with a fair amount of salt. A serving has 4 grams of dietary fiber; and they are certified kosher as well.<br /><br />Almonds may indeed be an important part of a healthy diet. Dr Mehmet Oz, a famous and accomplished heart surgeon, believes that a handful of almonds before eating could help people feel "full" sooner than later; and almonds appear to reduce levels of LDL, or "bad" cholesterol while giving you vitamin E--but don't overdo it! One fistful of almonds per day is one way to eat these almonds as part of a healthy diet.<br /><br />If you have ANY questions or concerns about almonds, allergies to nuts or how to use almonds in a diet properly, ask your doctor before eating these.<br /><br />Overall, these are excellent, tasty almonds by Diamond Foods. I highly recommend this brand of almonds for people who want almonds to snack on, to cook with or to eat as part of a diet.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Very good Raw natural almonds at a GREAT price!
review/text: Almonds are very healthful! (Eat a handful every day per nutritionists.) But bags are often NOT fresh. Freshly harvested nuts are a treat like none other, but most nuts in stores are very stale, or outright rancid. The origin and the packaging matter a lot! So, be aware of the different origins, especially of almonds and walnuts - the crops from California being the most delicious. Also, Almonds and Walnuts are harvested in the Fall - Walnuts in October, and Almonds earlier. All nuts are fragile and go rancid quickly, but especially walnuts, due to their concentration of healthy fats - so buy directly from the grower, or look for vacuum sealed containers - bags just are NOT good protection. (Most grocery store nuts are at least slightly rancid, and some people think THAT is what nuts taste like, so they "don't like nuts" or "nuts upset their stomach.") Then freeze the fresh nuts, taking them out as you need them. Frozen nuts will taste as fresh as the day you bought them, even a year, or more, later. California growers, and [...] sell fresh nuts directly to consumers. Two really good growers are Haag and Winter Creek Ranch. You can get on their mailing list and they will contact you when the "new crop" nuts are harvested. Once you taste what a really FRESH walnut or almond tastes like, you will order from them every year! You can get fresh English Walnuts at [...] or Hartley Walnuts at [...]. For fresh almonds, contact the Diamond Store at [...]. The prices and shipping are very reasonable. (In 2009, a pound of the Haag shelled walnuts, finest in the world, cost [...], with discounts for large orders!)

review/summary: Your body's many cries for salt
review/text: When I first began seeing one of the doctors who has been most helpful with my chronic health issues, he did an assessment. One of the first things he checked was whether my body was dehydrated, or not. It was - even though I drank over 80 oz. of high quality water per day. He explained that it is necessary to also consume salt so your body can properly metabolize the water. Good quality salt - not "regular" table salt. There are quite a few good, pure mineral laden salts available these days fortunately. I've found that this product "Real Salt" is one of the most readily available and economical. It also has quite a pleasant taste - not overly salty. I carry a cannisted in my purse as well as using it in our cooking and dining. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: And you thought you knew salt..............
review/text: I was surprised to see several reviewers who said, "salt is salt is salt, right?".  WRONG!  That refined salt in the grocery store is extremely damaging to your body, causing many problems like high blood pressure for one.<br /><br />Your body desperately needs natural salt, but the refined versions most of us grew up with have had all the nutrients processed out of them.  There are something like 70 or 80 trace elements in a good sea salt that are essential for your body's health. Under ideal conditions, we would receive these from our food we eat.  But in today's world, the soil is depleted of these critical nutrients - so that even if you try to eat good natural food, it no longer contains what you need.  So sea salt to the rescue.<br /><br />Having learned all this a few years back, I bought some Redmond's and gave it a try - and promptly went into shock.  I knew it would be good for me, but I still expected it to taste the same as all salt - but it was, "OMG! THIS IS WHAT SALT IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE??!!!"  It was a delightful bouquet of flavors and so satisfying to the taste buds.  Even if regular salt wasn't so bad for you, I could never go back just because of the taste - there is no comparison.<br /><br />And don't be fooled by most grocery store brands - even Morton's sells sea salt - and it tastes just like the same old crap that's been in our salt shakers all these years.<br /><br />One other tip to try:  I noticed another review mentioned that it helps with dehydration.  I also found out that if you become dehydrated - it is not a simple matter of just drinking lots of pure water to get re-hydrated.  I recently had a health professional suggest drinking a pinch of good sea salt in a glass of water before going to bed at night to help remedy the problem.

review/summary: wonderful flavor and a good price
review/text: I'm the primary grocery shopper for 2 households. My dad's and my own. I switched to this salt a few months ago and we've been using it in place of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTKQWK">Hain Pure Foods Sea Salt -- 26 oz</a> for table salt and cooking in those months.<br /><br />It's been a success. My dad has his doubts about the color and "dirty" look of it because he's used to standard white table salt, but the flavor convinced him. The rest of my family didn't have the reservations he had.<br /><br />The flavor is wonderful, and it's doesn't have the chemical taste that iodized salts have. It's fine enough to work with my salt shaker and I haven't noticed any caking issues.<br /><br />My daughter really loves the flavor, as do I. My husband doesn't notice a flavor difference and uses it happily.<br /><br />It has some of flavor profile of more expensive finishing salts with a price for every day use. I'll still use my coarse and flake salt for candy making and other things where presentation matters, but for every day use and cooking, this is my new salt of choice.

review/summary: The Best Salt No Question
review/text: You could take my word for it.  I really don't make many reviews on Amazon or anywhere else, but I feel so strongly about this product that I just must.  If you've any question, research the product on their website and I think you'll be convinced too.  If you like or prefer "sea-salt" either for health or taste, this is simply the best, especially for the price.  This is sea-salt, just that it comes from ancient ocean deposits left millions of years ago, way before any possibility of man-made contamination.  Himalayan salt is the same thing, but look at the price!  Seriously, one taste and you'll never go back to table salt.  Real Salt is purer, and way cheaper than any of the "sea-salts".  It doesn't clump and it's even a nice color, unlike grey "sea-salts" that are so popular.

review/text: Forget the bright white, perfectly crystallized salt you're used to seeing in your grinder - Real Salt is the completely unprocessed version of the same thing, retaining all of the minerals and beneficial compounds that are lost otherwise. Apart from the pinks, reds and grays you'll see in the packet, the most obvious difference is the taste and it can really help draw out the flavors in your cooking. Regular table salt apparently has a range of chemical additives, none of which are present here so if you like your food unprocessed, Real Salt is an essential ingredient in your kitchen.

review/summary: It is pure joy to use.
review/text: I love Redmond Real Salt. It is pure joy to use. The flavor tickles the tongue with the combination of the salt and the natural minerals found in the ground with it. To taste it by itself; it tastes really good. It is salty without being over powering. The minerals give it hint of sweetness that compliments the salty flavor. It is rich in flavor and makes the most humble of foods taste great.  This is the best salt I have found.<br /><br />It is great for other uses besides food. I use it regularly in a salt and sugar face scrub. My skin comes out glowing and silky smooth. In combination with the use of their Redmond Clay, my blackheads are going away and my adult acne is almost gone. The salt and minerals in Redmond Salt really help my skin. Every winter my skin on my wrist gets painfully dry and cracked. I have tried many things (lotions, oils, meds, etc). One day I decided to start pampering my hands with the salt and sugar scrub. It went away.<br /><br />Redmond Real Salt is a joy to use. I use it daily in my home, from any where from cleaner, cleanser, and beauty product, to food seasoning. Including Real Salt into daily use at my home has lowered the amount of money I spend. Beauty products alone can be expensive. It never surprises me when I find another use for Redmond Real Salt.

(Have you ever had a Hawaiian pineapple actually in/from Hawaii?  It's a totally different fruit.  That's how this salt is.  It's just completely different, and excellent.)<br /><br />I feel great about using this, too, because it isn't the result of a harsh chemical experiment (like most NaCl table salt).  Instead it is old, from the sea, and it contains minerals, like salt is supposed to.<br /><br />If you haven't been using this salt yet, you're missing out!  I recommend this to anyone who uses salt...so, pretty much everyone.

review/summary: RealSalt for RealPeople
review/text: When it rains, natural salt does not pour. It is essential that any natural salt be kept in airtight sealed containers to prevent caking. The Redmond RealSalt pouch does that very effectively, but I don't understand why the pouch is called `refillable'. It certainly is not practical to refill it at home. Do we send it back to the factory for a deposit refund, or to get it refilled?<br />RealSalt is very GoodSalt. We have used it for years at the table and stove. I use it to brine turkey and for making our own corned beef. Whenever obtaining preprocessed foods I look for low sodium varieties so that I can salt them at home with RealSalt to suit our tastes. Unfortunately some products, such as beer, are not available is low sodium varieties.<br />RealSalt is not CheapSalt, but is less costly than any other comparable natural salt that must be imported from outside of the country. If you have a nearby health food market that buys RealSalt in bulk, and repackages it for retail sale, it can be obtained more economically. Otherwise, the Amazon sources are the best way to obtain this product. Or, if purchasing larger quantities, Vitacost.com charges more for the salt, but much less for S&P.<br />Do your homework, but get some of the salt. You'll never what to go back to the white stuff that pours when it rains.

review/text: I love this product for how natural and whole it is. I think the salt has a wonderful mild flavor and I know my body is benefiting from all the minerals that are in it.<br />However, I have one MAJOR issue with this product and that is the fact that it contains a lot of hard crystals, some send, etc. These crystals do not dissolve and if you bite on it, it will sound crunchy and even painful.<br />Unfortunately, I've tried this product on 4 different occasions to make sure it wasn't just a bad batch, and they all had crystals that don't dissolve.<br />I'm sad to report that I chipped two of my teeth over a period of 2 months. The chips are microscopic, but I do have quite a bit of sensitivity in those teeth. Also, if your teeth are naturally prone to sensitivity, I would presume this product would irritate them even more.<br /><br />Great idea, but the filtration process leaves little bit too much of inpurities behind.

review/text: I have always felt that salt is salt is salt.... my husband however is another story all together. He brought a number of his own customs to our marriage and Real Salt Sea Salt was one of them. He won't use anything else and scowls ferociously at all other inferior salts I've tried to introduce to our kitchen over the years. I will give him this... the Real Salt does taste better than any of the other stuff out there, but it is a bit more expensive than the plebian grocery store stuff. I finally decided it's worth the price difference if he's happy and cooking (means I don't have to!) The fact that I can find this stuff on Amazon AND use our Prime shipping totally made my day!

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: I first bought Real Salt in Utah at a small gift shop when I was vacationing near Kings Canyon.  When I came home and tried it, it was the best tasting salt I ever had.  I don't know what's in this stuff, but it just tastes so good.  Kinda crazy because, salt is salt is salt, right?  When I ran out, I found it online and my kitchen has not been without Real Salt last 3 years.

review/summary: THE ACTUAL REAL SALT!
review/text: This salt is truly unique, just like the ocean exactly, when compared to other brands like Morton, this is on is the best; you can feel a sweet taste at the end. Truly natural and makes huge difference. If applied to skin it makes it smooth and healthier cuz of the Ocean's salt natural healing properties.
