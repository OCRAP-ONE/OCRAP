review/summary: Big bag, interesting taste
review/text: These make a great snack to be left in the glove compartment of my vehicle. Available when I need them. They don't seem to melt together when they get warm.  The white belly texture is almost like a toughened up version of marshmallowish texture. Interesting on the tongue.  The flavour of the frog is interesting as well.  Some say a pineapplish sort of green tea pear flavor. Same flavor as green frogs I've found in department store/food places, so I'm guessing its the universal frog flavor or the same brand more likely.

review/summary: Green hoppy frogs
review/text: One of my medical assistants always talks kids into giving a urine sample by telling them that we have to check to see if there are any green hoppy frogs in their urine.  Well, as you can imagine, many a reluctant preschooler is willing to pee in a cup with that in mind.  How wonderful to show them that there are green hoppy frogs!  We just put a couple in a (clean) Dixie cup and return it to the children.  I wish I could download the expressions on their faces when they see these little creatures!  Oh, by the way, 5 lb bag lasted over 6 months in my solo rural pediatric office- that is a lot of urine samples!  Many  siblings insists on giving a sample also just for a taste of these gummies!

review/summary: soooo good
review/text: The top of the frogs have a slight lime taste and are like big gummi bears. The white bottom is a foamy sugar similar to marshmallow. The combination has a nice feel to it when you're eating them. They're also great for sticking to your friend's forehead, just lick the frog's white belly.

review/text: Just looking at the bag of these yummy frog candies makes my mouth water. I love these frog candies and always added them to my candy bag when at the candy store. I like them a little less fresh when they are harder and chewier. I just love to gnaw on these things and chew them and taste them and eat them. I can end up eating so many of these and not even realize it so a 5 pound bag for me might be a little dangerous. I love the white bottom that feels like a tough marshmallow. The texture and taste is delectable. Highly recommend these.

review/text: I recently bought a bag of these on here to try, my fiancee and I love Haribo candy, especially the Gold BEars and wanted to try these...I must say, I usually do not like candy with a marshmallowy texture(like that strawberries and cream type candy) But these are so GOOD! The bottom is marshmallow, and the top is apple flavored gummi. Not too sweet either, just right. Nice and chewy like you'd expect from Haribo candy, I just love them!!!

review/text: I always used to stick a ton of these in my bag whenever I'd go to the candy shop in the mall. They are amazing, and the Haribo version is as good as any. They combing having an interesting taste, with an interesting texture as well. The flavour is fruity, tropical in a way. They are pretty chewy, and not too soft (like alot of cheaper gummies), and combing a smooth, chewy texture on top, with a slightly softer, marshmallowy bottom. I will always like these.

review/text: These were the first "non-bear" gummi I tried from Haribo.<br /><br />The quality, price, flavor = exceptional. Even my reluctant DH went crazy for these little froggies. The kids 4 and 3, also loved these little guys.<br /><br />The only minor downfall is that after 4 pounds you start to look at them and get a little "flavored out" - so I suggest sharing the joy cause our family of 4 just got a little apple weary. (but finished the bag anyway LOL!)

review/text: I prefer the two textured gummi's over the regular gummi's. Haribo's are among the best and the frogs are addictive. The current price, combined with the free shipping and no tax make these a nice buy. The only drawback of buying in bulk is that I tend to eat more of them. These are aslo a big favorite of my kids who would also give them 5 stars.

review/summary: FedEx Smartpost is the StupidPost!
review/text: I have no qualms whatsoever with the product. Haribo gummy frogs are my favorite candies and will always manage to put me in my happy place. My problem is with the means by it was delivered. If I had known it was being delivered through FedEx, I would have gone and bought the product through some other means.<br /><br />Here's my beef with FedEx. They are totally and completely unreliable and incompetent. Through the USPS, It take 4-5 days to deliver mail from New Jersey to New York City. FedEx so far is taking 7 days. What the fudge?!<br /><br />If you're willing to pay extra bucks to have it delivered quickly then you're not going to have a problem. However, if you don't plan to spend that much money on a bag of candy, I suggest you have it sent to a P.O. box or buy it somewhere else.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/10/12<br /><br />Still no sign of my package. An order from the UK showed up in one week. I strongly recommend paying the extra dollars for expedited delivery and/or ordering it through a website that does not use FedEx Smart Post.

review/summary: Haribo Gummy Frogs are my BF's fav!
review/text: Ok, living in Chicago one would think we would have everything, right?  Well, these little green apple flavored wisps of goodness are very hard to come by.  Walgreen's use to carry them till one day, a year ago, they all of a sudden disappeared.  We tried to find them at any and all Walgreen's and CVS, but to no avail.  Now we knew the only place that we could find them was Fry's Electronics, but we do not go out there all that often.  When we do go to Fry's you can bet your butt we stock up by taking most if not all of them off the shelves (21 bags last time).  Some people we know were in town from NH over Memorial Day weekend and we took them out to eat, in return they sent us a 5lb bag of gummie frogs!  You could imagine my surprise when I walked back to my desk from lunch and found a box from Amazon that was squishy.  I opened that puppy and was like OMG!!!  Yeah, the bf breezed through the 5lb bag in about a weeks time sharing them with co-workers (mostly consuming them himself) and with myself (i still have my little zip lock baggie in my camera bag :-) ).  I just ordered 2-5lb bags of these yummy frogs and hopefully they will last a lot longer then the first one :-)

I bought these at the request of a friend of mine whose husband loves them, so I bought myself a bag too. They are a little too chewy for my taste, but my friend and her husband just love them. Seem to be a lot chewier than a regular gummy which is why I give them 4 stars.

review/summary: Not for everyone
review/text: Haribo makes a wide range of candies, including some world class goodies, but this is not one of them. The frogs are made of a hard gummi, and are all green except for a thin white layer on the frogs' bellies. You might not recognize them as frogs unless you're told. There is no discernible taste or texture difference between the white and green substances, and in any case, the flavor is unidentified, unidentifiable, and not very good. It definitely is not lime, as advertised. Maybe somebody likes this stuff, but I didn't. I set the bag out at the office after my first sample.

review/text: I first heard of jaffa cakes while reading the Gold Box forum. I was pleasantly surprised when we opened one box, they are wonderful! These are angelfood type cookies with a thin layer of a tasty marmalade, all covered with a delicious dark chocolate coating. You taste each distinctive flavor all at once. We bought 2 boxes and managed to make them last 4 days (not easy considering how light they are) and tried them with coffee, hot tea and milk. All good but my preference is the hot tea. A great afternoon treat.<br />The only drawback is that you pay shipping per box and the shipping is higher than the cookies, but still worth it.

review/text: The Ribena 1 Litre Case of 12 was packed well and received in a timely manner.  Very happy with this concentrate.  Nice and strong which means you only need a little bit with water.  Worth every cent.  In American shops we haven't been able to find any cordial concentrates and was really missing it.  Thank goodness for Amazon!

review/text: i bought this in a local grocery store of mine today in curiosity, i expected it to be frosting and not in anyway buttery (it just didnt seem possible) i popped off the top of the jar and smelled it. It had a very weak smell i still wasnt expecting much i got a butter knife and slapped on a thick bit of it onto a graham cracker i then proceeded to eat it. WOW this stuff tastes great!!! it has a buttery texture and a nice cocoa taste it isnt horribly sweet but a very subtle chocolate taste, this is great as a dessert with graham crackers or breakfast with toast and a very cold glass of milk. and its a great treat for kids if they arent sugar junkies and can take a less sweet product. overall i would reccomend this 100%

review/summary: Delicious way to turn anything into a dessert
review/text: I had seen Nutella in the States growing up but didn't really become a heavy user until I lived in Europe for a year. This stuff is amazing - it's super chocolatey with a hint of hazelnut that gives it a really full-bodied, mature flavor. I usually put it on bagels or English muffins as a quick, satisfying dessert. It's also great for baking (Nutella brownies are awesome!)<br /><br />In terms of nutrition, the calories per tablespoon of Nutella is pretty close to the American sandwich staple, peanut butter. Nutella doesn't have quite as much protein as peanut butter but it also doesn't have as much fat or sodium, so there's a trade off.<br /><br />All in all I LOVE this spread and I always have a big jar in my pantry.

review/text: Do I really need to make a review about Nutella??? I don't think so. If you've grown up in Italy like I did, you know that this product is not just a delicious hazelnut and chocolate spread, but a direct line to the heavens. Italian kids don't eat peanut butter (therefore, no pbj sandwiches!) but have Nutella on a thick slice of bread instead. We eat this for breakfast, dipping the slice in some nice hot caffellatte, or as an afternoon snack. And if you've been good, you get Nutella gelato on the weekend. Nutella is also advertised as a sports food for athletes who need the extra "energy kick".. yeah why not get it from a slurpalicious, divinely decadent chocolate cream spread!

review/text: I am in love with this hazelnut spread made with skim milk and cocoa.  Grownups and kids both enjoy and it's a nice way to get picky eaters to consume whole grain breads.  Don't let the healthy breakfast commercials fool you, there is a ton of sugar in the recommended serving size.  My answer to that is that I don't indulge in the recommended serving size of two tablespoons.  You can get by with less and it's still a tasty way to start the day.  I am hooked on this stuff and my local market doesn't always have it in stock.  I went to two stores that didn't have it and resolved to buy it here on Amazon.  Big jar, twice the size of the tiny ones at my local stores.  It should last me a while but next time I'm ordering double jar package!

review/text: Nutella the amazing treat<br /><br />Are you a chocolate lover?  Well if you are, Nutella is what you want!<br /><br />Every day when I come home from school and have a banana I think "well I don't want just a normal banana." So I go to the cupboard and get some Nutella and boy is it yummy!<br /><br /> One of my most favorite thing about this product is it's smooth and creamy. It's  practically good on anything! One time I had it on a potato chip and it actually  wasn't that bad!<br /><br /> If you're on the go they sell little mini jars with crackers on the side, so your kids stay happy and entertained!<br /><br /> Another thing I love about is it is healthy for you so it keeps your kids happy and healthy at the same time!  Nutella is not like normal chocolate. it never melts and it stays good for quite some time. You know how some chocolate is a bad habit? Well this one is the complete opposite.<br /> If you're a chocolate lover this is the chocolate for you!

review/text: Zapps potato chips are absolutely delicious.  Every flavor is marvelous; we buy them at the grocery store and order the multi-flavor packs online.  Voodoo is our family favorite; it has a perfect amount of Cajun zing but is not hot, just very flavorful.  A bag has never lasted more than one meal at our house - it is constantly being passed and devoured.  The lucky winner is the one who steals the seasoning from the bag liner at the bottom of the feast!  After finding Zapps, we eat no other type of potato chip.  Certainly everyone has his own opinion but for us, Zapps Voodoo is as good as it can get.  Bon Appetit and Laissez Les Bontemps Rouler!

review/text: I have tried several of the Asian Home Gourmet spice packets, and so far I have been pleased with them all. The Korma curry was fantastic. You just saute onions with some oil and the spice packets. Add your chicken and stir until it is browned, add water and let it simmer for 15 minutes. Finish off with some coconut cream or yogurt. When I mix yogurt into this dish (or any curry dish) I mix a bit of flour in with the yogurt. That keeps it from curdling. Give it a try. It is a smooth, mild curry.

review/text: Impressed with a couple of other Asian Home Gourmet Products I gave this one a try. I was not disappointed. I've been longing for the creamy Korma like the Indian Restaurants. While not quite the same it is close.<br /><br />To fix you use a finely chopped (finer the better) onion that is sauteed till cooked, then add your meat (I use chicken) till browned, then throw in water and cream and let simmer. Serve over rice.<br /><br />The first batch I made was a tad on the watery side, I had used a knife to chop the onions and powdered coconut milk for the cream. I thought it was ok but the rest of the family loved it.<br /><br />Understanding the dish a bit better the second time around I used the food processor for the onion, this gave a more even smooth paste like base. Then I used coconut cream on a 1:1 basis for water. That turned out MUCH thicker and tastier. Everyone in the house loves it, personally I'd prefer a bit more punch but if your looking for something with good flavor and no heat this is an excellent choice. I will be stocking up on it.

review/text: There is way to much surgar in this hot chocolate it's like having sugar flavored chocolate, I am going to have to buy some pure powedered chocolate and mix it in the bag, other then that I would say it would taste good if it was not so sweet.

review/summary: Loving hot chocolate in Denver
review/text: The first time I tasted this Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate was in a restaurant in Southern Colorado. It was a cool rainy day and I was in love with it after the first sip.I have never tasted anything this good. I took down the name of the product, googled it, and quickly ordered it from Amazon. I will now be ready for the first snowy day in Denver. It is the best hot chocolate mix ever!!!

review/summary: Mexican Hot Chocolate
review/text: I first tried this product after visiting the Chocolate exhibit in Chicago six years ago and it reminded me of a tasty coffee I had in Canc&uacute;n in the late 1990s.  It makes a great cup of hot chocolate and I occasionally enjoy mixing some with coffee to make a mocha.

review/summary: Overpowering spices
review/text: I am a big fan of chocolate and cinnamon, and was looking for a stronger cinnamon flavor than Stephen's Gourmet Chocolate Cinnamon (which is very good, but very subtle).<br /><br />This one has way too strong of a generic spice flavor for me.  It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away - if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first.

review/text: This is a great treat for the Fall and Winter months hunting, camping or just snuggling up to watch a movie. The cinnamon is not too overpowering with the chocolate and has a rich cocoa flavor. My wife drinks it as an alternative to coffee so she can sleep at night.

review/summary: Mostly a bag of sugar
review/text: To me it seems like too much sugar, not enough chocolate, a little heavy on the spice. Sugar is the first ingredient. But if not for the sugar problem I wouldn't complain about the spice. I tried adding 1/2 pound of powdered cocoa to the 3 pound bag and it was still too sweet. It's amazing to me how far this is from "the best hot chocolate ever" like other reviewers rated. Def try a small bag first to see who you agree with.

review/summary: delicious, full-flavored cocoa mix
review/text: This is probably the best-tasting cocoa I've ever had at home.  A friend gave me a small tin of it years ago as a holiday gift.  We enjoyed every bit of it but had trouble finding more until it turned up on Amazon.  Smells great, tastes great, and is made with real ingredients (not artificial sweeteners and weird chemicals).  Really fantastic stuff.  It's also great in brownies and cakes - adds some spices above and beyond what most people expect.  Tastes like fall, in the best way possible.  Here's a recipe to try:  a few frozen bananas (for chill and body), about a  cup of crunchy peanut butter, about half a cup of almond or regular or soy milk (more milk if you like a thinner shake), a scoop of this cocoa, and blend.  Drink it right away.  Filling, lots of vitamins, and naturally sweet.  I know people who swear by it as their daily breakfast.  Yum!

review/summary: Tasty Iced Spiced Chocolate
review/text: I got the 3lb bag and the recipes on the bag call for "scoops." A scoop was not provided in my bag, but they say that 2 scoops is equivalent to about 8 tbsp. However, the nutrition information is given by 38g serving, not by tbsp or "scoop." I measured it out with my food scale and 38g came to exactly 3 level tbsp, so if I made the Iced Chocolate as directed (2 scoops/8 tbsp), I'd be getting almost 3 servings of chocolate mix (420 cal before the milk!). I cut the milk in half (3oz hot and 4oz cold) and use one serving (38g/3 tbsp) chocolate, served over ice, and to me it is delicious with a nice strong spicy chocolate flavor, and it is a reasonable 217 cal when using skim milk.<br /><br />Different palates are going to have different preferences as far as the balance of spice and chocolate, but I can tell you that I like it. My husband does not care much for cinnamon but he also likes it, and my children like it too. We have only tried it cold so far and are looking forward to trying it hot!

review/text: My husband is not a coffee drinker and the nippy mornings left him a little jealous of my warm cup of coffee.  Having just returned from a trip to Santa Fe where I had purchased it originally, I introduced him to the pleasures of morning hot chocolate.  He was hooked!!  Now for the other use, today , the day after Thanksgiving clean up we were at breakfast without any milk in the house, but an abundance of leftover decaf coffee from the celebration, his long face was brightened when I spooned in a bit of MOCAFE Mexican Spiced Chocolate into a cup of decaf.  WOW! a new taste and he loved it!<br /><br />What else can I say, it's a hit around our house.

review/text: I first tried it about seven years. Trader Joe's use to sell it in their stores and at the best price ever!  I am a hot cocoa fanatic AND I'm Mexican.  Per my qualifications, I say this is a great blend.  The ingredients are fresher than Abuelita and the sugar isn't as gritty.  I only wish I could find it wholesale.  Price is a bit steep at Amazon...<br />16 oz. (3-pack) - 34 cents/oz<br />14 oz. (4-pack) - 43 cents/oz.<br /><br />The 3-pack is the best deal (just over $1.00 per 8 oz. serving).  You can get 69 servings for $32.67.<br /><br />I have yet found a better prepared Mexican hot cocoa, seven years later.

review/text: This product is, in fact, a spiced, chocolate drink.<br /><br />It is yummy.<br /><br />It is not super-chocolatety, but it does have enough chocolate flavor to warrant it being labeled a chocolate drink.  It *is* very sugary, but what reasonable person believes that a chocolate drink should be anything other than a treat?<br /><br />I give it four stars because while very yummy, it does not send my consciousness into the higher stratosphere of the realm of pure, abstract deliciousness.  It is, however, a product I will purchase again.<br /><br />It tastes sweet, cinnamony, and chocolatey and has some other flavors I cannot identify.  I recommend it if you like or are curious about such things.
