review/text: These are my husband's FAVORITE jellybeans! He always gets so upset when the end of Easter season comes around because stores stop selling them. I am SO GLAD you guys had them! I sent them to him in a care package since he is in Afghanistan, and he was so excited to get them! Thanks, guys!!

review/summary: I like these pretty well...
review/text: I like these.  I wish they were on subscribe and save, so they would be cheaper.  Anyway, I put Texas Pete Hot Sauce on these (it's not very hot, but good taste), and eat them with regular saltine (unsalted tops) crackers.  Good to have several choices for lunch.  These seem to always have a fairly good amount of chicken strips in them.  Try them at the store first, if you're going to just eat them with no hot sauce nor crackers.  They do have a fair amount of cheese sauce on them, but look at hamburger commercials - must be what the people want?<br /><br />The shelf life on these is maybe a year or more (vacuum sealed), so they can be used as survival food, I would think.  I could eat them at room temp.

review/summary: Way too bland for my taste
review/text: As with any food product, your opinion may differ. I found that this meal was very short on flavor, and not visually appealing. It does not look at all like the picture on the cover. The pasta, the chicken and the 'sauce' were all the same color. The 'sauce' appeared to be some melted cheese food product. I should have tried this first from the (more expensive) store that sells them in units, not packages, because with this item, eating it once was more than enough.

review/summary: Great alternative for allergy sufferers
review/text: My 3 yr old son has dairy and egg allergies so hard to find good cookie substitutes.  He loves these.  You can't roll them out and use cookie cutters but can still decorate with sprinkles.<br /><br />I think they're a pretty good substitute too.  I originally made these with a soy margarine that I later noticed had trans fats.  Now I use a heart healthy one without trans fats.  The cookies aren't as moist but they're healthier.<br /><br />I've also tried the chocolate chip cookies and they are awesome.  The brownies were good but more cakelike.  The pancakes were good but need extra flavoring like blueberries.

review/summary: Crazy for Cookies!
review/text: Regardless of whether you have food allergies or not, these are great tasting cookies. My son has outgrown his dairy and egg allergies but I still use this mix.  Why?  Super easy and quick to make plus they taste good! I like to make them with a dab of strawberry preserves in the middle of them topped with sprinkles for a festive look.  Consistency of dough is not good for rolling out so if you like to make shaped cookies that might be hard.

review/text: I bought this because it used evaporated cane juice, which I use often to bake desserts.  Even though I've had several vegan products in past, and ones which I loved, I thought this tasted terrible!  The 2 kids I baked it for, who love the vegan desserts I've given them, also thought it was terrible.  I'm confused as to how the previous 3 reviewers could have possibly given this product 5 stars.  The cookies weren't even so-so.  I threw them all away!

The cookies come out very yummy, not at all dry like other allergen free products we've tried.  Cute packaging, great company website and rewards program.  They make their mixes in an allergen free environment, and test every batch so you KNOW it's safe.  Would work for vegans, too.<br />They make another version for persons with Celiac.

review/text: This sauce is very well balanced between fire and taste.  I was afraid it would be overpowering in heat, but was very pleasantly surprised to find that its flavor is more prominent than anticipated.  It has a very good blend of peppers and spices so that it is an everyday sauce (not one of those mutant novelty sauces that people try just to suffer from a drop).  This sauce is great and will purchase again because the bottle I bought is being depleted very quickly.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037BP6RQ">Mad Anthony's Hot Sauce - Van Halen</a>

review/summary: For Inner Beauty fans
review/text: Lottie's is a reasonably close version of Inner Beauty Hot Sauce, what many hot sauce fans regard as the best hot sauce ever sold.  Unhappily, Inner Beauty is no longer available--although home-made recipes are available on the Web--but Lottie's is excellent in its own right.  I would judge it as very hot, but not quite as hot as IB, with IB complexity of flavor--a dimension that so many extremely hot sauces lack.  After all, anybody can buy some habaneras or ghost peppers, throw them in the blender with some dried chiles, vinegar, salt, and a little fruit, and call it a hot sauce.

review/summary: Pink salt!
review/text: We know the whole pink salt story.  If you don't, just google it.  We are using it mainly because it's supposed to be better for you health-wise.  We both like salt and this seemed like a reasonable deal.  There isn't much difference in the taste... cleaner and you have to use less I'd say.  The salt isn't quite as fine as we expected... a bit many grained size, but they all come out of the salt shaker well.  We found out that our local upscale grocery store carries it in bulk, but it's "rock salt" size.  We've bought a Bodum grinder that grinds both pepper and salt for when the salt we have now runs out.  The Bodum is great and they sell it on Amazon...<br />P.S.  Fairie's Finest had the best prices for both the pink salt and Red Hawaiian sea salt...

review/text: These treats smell good. I actually bought them for my rabbits because I didn't know dogs eat pumpkin, and like it. When the rabbits hear me open the package they run to the cage door and climb over each other to be the first one to get a treat. And, the dog loves them too, although he is jealous of the rabbits so I don't know if he eats them because he likes them or because he doesn't want the rabbits to get any. I actually ate one myself to see what the fuss was about only to find out they are rather bland, but the crunchiness was nice. As long as my pets are happy, then I am happy. Thanks for the speedy delivery and the discount prices.

review/text: I bought this because my dog loves to eat sweet potatoes. Since don't have them all the time I figure he would love these. He's eaten a few and seems to enjoy them. He's not overly crazy about them, but I guess he's gotten use to the real thing for so long. However, the list of all natural ingredients is really amazing and good for any dog's health. I even ate one myself and found it to be pretty good. Remember if your dog doesn't like it, then  it's because everyone has different tastes. It's still a very solid product. I'm very happy with it.

She loves them and I love being able to identify what ingredients I am feeding my dog.

review/text: Both of my dogs LOVE raw nuts, the more you pay the better they like them. So I thought that they would like this treat. The 8 year old wont even take them from your hand like she will other veterinarian treats. They are not in the favorite list of the younger dog either although she will eat them with no fuss but given the choice she will take a different vegan treat. It was worth a try. Comes down to it doesn't matter how good they are for your dog if they don't want them they are not a treat.

In fact, they are a little stiff and best when warmed in your hand or pocket a couple minutes.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars? A little small for an adult (maybe eat two at a time). Made in China. A lot of plastic in this box -- 12 bags containing 6 wrapped sticks each.

review/summary: They taste pretty good, but...
review/text: These are a pretty good price per treat, and they taste decent. However they are nearly impossible to get out of their individual packaging and by the time you do, you're covered in sticky mess. Even if you eat them in just two bites, they melt in your hand causing even more of a nasty sticky mess.  I persevered through the first bag, but threw away the rest after the second bag revealed the same results.

review/summary: My wife and kids HATE them
review/text: In BIG LETTERS on the front of the box it proudly claims,"Made from AMERICAN grown fruits".<br />On the back of the box and on the individual "stiks"(where it's almost illegible) it states,"Made responsibly in China"*.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the process is. Is the fruit grown in the U.S. and shipped to China for processing and then shipped back to the U.S. ? [Doesn't sound very responsible to me.]<br /><br />Maybe it's all the miles those fruit stiks log but whatever the reason, they taste awful.<br /><br />We're going look for similar products with fruit grown here and processed here even if we have to pay a bit more for the product.<br /><br />*Is that according to U.S. or Chinese standards ?

review/summary: Great Mellow Chocolate Mint Flavor, Beats All The Rest!
review/text: I picked up a tin of Republic of Tea's Peppermint Chocolate today at a local store, not knowing what to expect. I've been in the market for a new favorite tea lately and had been trying countless varieties without much luck... everything just tasted too bland, or too strong, or just kind of "off" in general. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the balanced taste of this peppermint chocolate tea.<br /><br />The mint flavor is definitely present, but quite mild in comparison to many teas (think Celestial Seasoning's Peppermint Tea). Surprisingly, you can also taste the chocolate in this blend as well which is a problem I've had with other things I've tried recently like Guayaki's Mate Chocolatte. That's one of the things I really enjoy about this particular brand... no one flavor buries the other.<br /><br />Don't expect to take a sip of this tea and be reminded of hot chocolate though! It's nowhere near that rich of a chocolate flavor, and I'm glad for it. It makes for a nice cup of tea after a meal, and reminds me just enough of my favorite mint chocolate chip desserts to make an impact... and better yet, no fat or calories! If it's not sweet enough for you after brewing, it tastes pretty good with a little bit of Stevia added in my opinion and it'd probably be good with a little bit of cream added as well, although I don't think this particular blend needs it.<br /><br />Best of all, many of Republic of Tea's blends are Rooibos based which is a fantastic caffeine free tea chock full of antioxidants that are good for your body and help ward off illness.<br /><br />If you're bothered by the price it's possible to find this tea in stores a little cheaper, although the availability in your location may vary. I found mine at a World Market store for $10.99, which I first thought was still a bit steep... but upon tasting the tea and realizing that (unlike Zhena's Gypsy teas) this tin is sufficiently air tight which will allow me to reuse the tin for my loose leaf tea purchases in the future, I find the price to be quite reasonable.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this tea to anyone who enjoys chocolate mint, and for long time tea enthusiasts like myself who are looking for something new!

review/text: I picked this up at my local health food store where they have loads of tea. While I normally don't like tea from bags, I LOVE this and have been drinking it more than my other teas lately. Without milk and the slightest bit of sugar, it ends up tasting like a healthier, more natural version of when one puts a candy cane in hot cocoa (come on, you know you've done that! :P)<br /><br />Also I've found I can get 2 uses per teabag! Yes, the second cup is a little weaker but not unbearably so. Woo, 72 cups! :)

review/summary: You'll either like it or dislike it
review/text: This tea stands out to me as a tea you'll either like or dislike. The aroma and taste is enticing. For me I first tasted the chocolate - a good-tasting chocolate! Next I tasted the mint - not too strong, that's good too! Then, to my surprise after I drank a few more sips I tasted vanilla. Vanilla, to my knowledge is not in this tea - but I DO taste it, and like it!! So....it must be that the blend of this tea can cause a possible interaction on ones palette that resembles a tastes of vanilla (At least in my case). I like the tea, but not love it!  It's unusual and might take a glass or two, or a cup or two. of getting use to. On the other hand my son did not like it at all. So...........that's why I say "you'll either like it or dislike it". Only your taste-buds can let you know for sure.

review/text: This tea is a great treat - even for those who don't normally drink tea I would recommend giving this one a try.  Great flavor, doesn't taste a bit like one would think of when they think "tea".  Great smell, reminds you of winter holidays.  This is difficult to find in many stores unless it's October-December timing so Amazon may be the best and easiest place to purchase this tea.  I've tried many Republic of Tea flavors and this one is a continuing favorite.

I have never attempted to eat both tarts in the package though so take caution if you plan to scarf them both at the same time. I can totally see a sugar crash if somebody ate these with no "real" food in their system. I don't even want to imagine what a toddler or adolescent would be like on a sleeve of these suckers for breakfast.

review/text: I first tried Champion raisins on a breakfast buffet while on vacation, they are softer, and more juicy than the brands our local store sells, so I have bought them at Amazon before. This purchase arrived in a padded mailing envelope, and one of the sealed packs,(each containing six small boxes)had been torn open, presumably to fit everything into the envelope. I would not trust eating food when the wrappers have been removed, no matter what the reason. It just got worse, the raisins had set someplace on the shelf,and were not as plump,and juicy as I remembered. Got to find another source !

review/text: Do not buy grass fed beef from Australia or other countries where we only add to the carbon footprint by importing foreign grass fed beef. America has some of the best beef in the world, and Rocky Mountain beef sells for the same price as upscale grain-fed beef, with a better flavor and a healthier content. I recommend ordering over $200. of beef- try the ground beef as well- as you save on shipping. It arrives frozen and stays fresh in your freezer until use. Excellent customer service.

review/summary: Not nutritionally sound
review/text: I had been using this food mixed with the canned science diet for my lab puppy (because that is what the shelter had used), and didn't have any issues.  However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products.  He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)  Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather).

They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise. try something like orijen or evo.

review/summary: These don't even taste like licorice these were awful
review/text: I KNOW EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT TASTES BUT THIS DIDN'T EVEN TASTE LIKE LICORICE !!!<br /><br /> I love licorice and I am always up to trying  something new but this was an expensive mistake. I read the reviews and thought these would taste pretty good. But if you  like red vines,twizzlers and Aussie brand than chances are you will not like these. Don't waste your money!!!!<br /><br />I have even tried to give these away and as soon as people try one they are not interested.<br /><br />I don't like leaving negative reviews but if I can save someone time and money this would be the perfect item to do so with.

review/summary: Simply put - the best dark roast I've had
review/text: I received this as a gift. I love dark roasted strong bodied coffee. That's the only kind of coffee I drink. My first cup was brewed in a small french press. The aroma was succulent. It didn't have the acidic aroma some compare to cat urine (my wife, a non-coffee drinker). The smell was potent, in a good way. It filled the whole downstairs with the small 2 cup press.<br />The taste was something delightful. Very bold in flavor with zero acidic flavor that I have grown accustom to with other dark roasts. There is a great nutty or woody background flavor with this coffee. Add a touch of cream to really bring out the nutty overtones. I have always been a Colmbian fanatic until I tried Caf&eacute; Altura's Peruvian Dark. Though this is beyond my regular budget. I will get it occasionally for a treat.

review/summary: Great coffee when fresh
review/text: This coffee is one of my favorites especially when the bag is freshly opened; however, it takes a while to go through two pounds of coffee. It looses some of the flavor over time, but regardless it remains pretty darn good. I just wish I could find a way to keep it really fresh. I have tried freezing it in an airtight zip-lock bag, refrigerating in an airtight zip-lock bag, and storing at room temp in an ceramic airtight jar. Regardless, this coffee is a amazing (especially when brewed with a french press), and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Excellent for espresso or americano
review/text: Let me start by saying that I used to live in Seattle and traveled the worlds to acquire a taste for both good and bad coffee.  After some experimentation, my favorite use for these beans is iced coffee - a simple espresso shot with ice loaded, then cold water poured in to fill the cup.  The dark flavor comes alive this way in my opinion.  The espresso shot is good, but I have tasted better.  Drip coffee is okay, but Americano works better.  For some reason, I can't pull full flavored latte - doesn't seem to pair too well with milk (ref. Starbucks or Gaggia Intenso works great).<br /><br />Note to self: buy these on sale, but not at regular price.

review/summary: Wow.  Perfect coffee!
review/text: I am somewhat of a coffee snob.  I tried many different kinds, flavors, strengths, brands etc.  This coffee is just strong enough to really give you that jolt in the morning without being too bitter.  Perfect balance.  When you open the bag up, the coffee beans are still wet from their natural oils.  The aroma is strong.  I keep it in a pyrex container which is inside of a ziplock bag to keep the beans fresh.  Every weekend we grind enough coffee to last us throughout the week.  I tried the french roast but didn't like it b/c it was too bitter.

review/summary: "solid coffee," from picky people
review/text: Simply put we are picky coffee drinkers who enjoy a nice dark roast coffee in the morning to get us going.  We take our coffee black, without any sweetness, so we know when the coffee is good & when it isn't worth drinking.  While this coffee is pleasantly balanced, without unwanted bitterness or acidity, it does lack some depth. Cafe Altura's Peruvian Dark Whole Bean coffee is not THE BEST coffee we have ever had, but it is a DARN GOOD cup!<br />We are happy to support, "Organically Grown Under Shade Trees & Family Farm & Fair Trade Grown."  We like it very much, indeed, enough to enjoy Amazon's subscribe & save feature.  Cheers!

review/text: As a regular drinker of Altura's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KSTYBS">Cafe Altura Organic Coffee, Biodynamic French Roast, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag</a> for two years, I was looking to try something different.  I found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KSVLG4">Cafe Altura Organic Coffee, San Francisco Blend, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag</a> to be too light and found the earthiness of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KSRTM4">Caf&eacute; Altura Organic Coffee, Colombian Dark, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag</a> a bit off-balance. Then I tried the Peruvian Dark: strong but smooth, rich chocolate tones, and bright aromas.  The beans are slightly less oily than the French Roast, and the acidity of this coffee is very low.  If you love dark roasts, you will look forward to waking up each morning to this brew.  This is also a wonderful deal on Amazon for high quality organic.

review/summary: perfect for Aeropress
review/text: This coffee is the best I've found so far and I LOVE that it's organic. I was using Major Dickason from Peet's Coffee, but this is less expensive AND organic and just as good or maybe even better. I got it to use with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS">Aerobie 80R08 AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> and it's perfect. I was going to give my boyfriend a sample to convince him to switch from Peet's but I was afraid of running out. 2 pounds is a lot of coffee but apparently I go through more than two pounds of coffee in a month!<br /><br />I should mention that I ONLY make coffee with the AeroPress, and they say that coffee made that way is smoother, so while I have compared this coffee to other coffees made the same way I don't know how it'd be in, say, a drip coffee maker.

review/text: I decided to try this coffee despite some of the bad reviews.  I LOVE Cafe Altura's French Roast. It is wonderfully rich and smooth and so good that I crave it.  This Peruvian Dark smells wonderful but tasted like it had been sitting on the warmer for an hour or two. To me it tasted burnt. It was bad enough it made me feel sick to my stomach and couldn't drink more than 1/2 cup.  Maybe if you use a flavored creamer it would be ok, but I don't like cream in my coffee. Altura makes wonderful coffee as long as you pick the right flavor.  This wasn't the flavor for me.

review/text: My wife and I ordered this coffee several times until July 2011 when the batches started tasting bitter.  We really enjoy dark roasts with strong, robust flavors in the morning, so when I saw this coffee, we decided to try it out.  Some initial bags were quite good but got somewhat bitter as new bags were delivered monthly.  We stopped delivery after a really bitter batch.  We now drink an expresso roast from Costco/Kirkland/Starbucks.  Three stars for good initial bags, but got inconsistant roasts down the line later.
