review/summary: Can anyone be addicted to these???
review/text: If so, then sign me up!!  I first found this flavor a few years back, and I thought it was "stress food".  Then, I noticed it was no longer being stocked on the grocery store shelves,or at Wal-Mart, Target, etc.  Talk about a let down...of course I got over it!  Imagine my girlie glee, when I did a little quick search and discovered not only could I find them online, but they could be delivered to my door and I could just about hoard as much as I wanted???  Oh, the little evil, mini me on my shoulder was pleased....very pleased!  The various flavors and combinations cannot be described, you just have to experience them for yourselves! The joy....it is the Jelly Bellly.....

review/summary: Good but very tart, almost like grapefruit
review/text: The flavor seems to fall between a tangerine and a grapefruit; but these don't capture the unique appealing qualities of either of those two citrus fruits really.  These taste rather like fresh, juicy, but slightly under-ripe regular oranges.<br /><br />The segments are larger and paler in color than traditional mandarins.  In essence, I don't think that these are really mandarins, but some other type of tangerine or orange.  Maybe these are a citrus that is labeled as some kind of "mandarin" but these aren't the original mandarins.<br /><br />In any event, it's still a decently fresh fruit available canned, and thus is much better than a lot of other canned fruit options.  Since it can be very difficult to purchase real mandarins fresh (even in Florida), I was hoping to have a few cans of high quality mandarin segments on hand; but I think I'll keep looking.  There are other brands I've tried that were much better and definitely use real mandarins, that were also packed in fruit juice.<br /><br />You might like these though, if you like your citrus pretty tart.

review/summary: My Husband Swears That This Muesli Helped Him Win a 5K Race!
review/text: We bought this Seitenbacher muesli mostly because we liked the kitschy packaging, and it's unusual name, "Musli #3 For Active People".  Also, since we enjoy running, hiking, etc., it seemed like we might be part of the group of "Active People" that would supposedly really benefit from this blend of muesli.<br /><br />The cereal is tasty, full of nuts and dried fruit chunks, including dried apple, banana, apricots and pineapple.  It doesn't seem to contain any wheat, so people who are allergic to wheat might really enjoy this muesli since it uses spelt, corn, oats and barley as its whole grain ingredients.  However, people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance might want to check out Seitenbacher's specialized gluten-free muesli cereals, such as "Seitenbacher Musli #7 Gluten-Free--Your Personal Activator". With a name like that, it's got to be good, right?<br /><br />I liked this cereal because it tasted pretty good, and there is something very cheerful about the packaging it came in and the assortment of colorful ingredients that it contains.  I liked this muesli as a topping on yogurt, and my husband really enjoyed eating it with milk, like he would normally eat his cereal.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as taste goes, I think that I still prefer Familia brand Muesli, but my husband is a now a huge fan of Seitenbacher Muesli #3.  Why? Well, after eating it for breakfast for two consecutive days, including the morning of a 5K running race, he won the race.  Now this muesli has become his "lucky" breakfast.  I can't argue with that!

review/summary: THE BEST MUESLI AROUND!!!!
review/text: I love muesli. I've tried every store brand here in the U.S. and they all fall short when compared to Seitenbacher Muesli. This muesli has the perfect texture (texture is huge with me) and combination of nuts/oats/fruit. I currently prefer #3, but have also immensely enjoyed #1, #9 and #2. I really appreciate that Seitenbacher makes all of these various "flavors." I can't imagine it's very profitable to make over 22 different variations of muesli. My grocery store only carries #2 and #1, and so I love that I can stock up on #3 on amazon! If you've been on a search for the perfect muesli, you've found it! If you don't like #3, just try a couple others, you're bound to find one you love. I also love that it's all natural. Take my word - no american brands compare!!!

review/summary: Starbuck's Barista rates this a 10 out of 10!
review/text: I am a Barista at my local Indianapolis Starbucks, so I am very picky about the coffee I drink. It is rare that I will ever drink anything but the best that we provide at Starbucks, but every once in a while I step out of my realm and try something new. The original Folgers just doesn't do it for me. I can taste what your money is worth in it. But in this Brazilian Blend by Folgers, you cant tell a difference between it and the Starbucks Brazil Seasonal Blend. It is a great way to get that smooth Brazilian bean flavor year round.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you haven't had it you are missing out. Give it a shot and you won't regret it. Goodluck finding it at your local grocery. Get it here at Amazon and it comes fast and fresh.

review/text: Folgers Brazilian Blend Ground Coffee is a medium blend coffee that is one of my favorite coffee's for my morning wakeup. We have the Kuerig K-Cup coffee brewer and bought a couple of Solofill Refillable Single Serve Filter Cups for Kuerig Brewers from amazon so as to be able to use ground coffee from different manufacturers at a much cheaper price per serving. I like my coffee black and I find this coffee has a good taste which does not leave a bitter or an acid after-taste in your mouth. The coffee also has a pleasing aroma. I find that this 27.8 ounce tub will last two months with using between one and two cups of coffee a day.

I have found Kashi cereals to be of high quality in the past (as well as being healthy), so I had high hopes. I just had my first bowl, and I am sorry to say that my high hopes have been dashed--at least in one major way.<br /><br />The cereal is a nice size (small bite-size), and has a nice crunch, not over-sweet, but the "kiss of berry flavor" the box promises ends up tasting like berry-scented candles, perfume or bubblebath. VERY fake-tasting. Eesh.<br /><br />Unless my tastebuds get used to the fake-tasting berry flavor, I expect this to be the last box I ever buy. Too bad, because I liked everything about it EXCEPT the fake berry taste.

review/summary: Top Tier and Best Buy
review/text: Fallot is one of the top five usually available.  If you cannot find locally, this is the best buy on Amazon.  It is fine in flavor and properly strong.  Shipping is expensive, but stale on the store shelf is 100% waste.<br /><br />Fallot is one of the top tier because of several factors:<br /><br />It is an independent mill in Burgundy.<br /><br />They source their particular strains of Brassica seeds carefully.<br /><br />They use verjuice instead of other liquids.<br /><br />The three pack is a better deal.  But, unless you use a lot of this mustard and fairly regularly, big is false economy.  Do not get a 13.5 oz jar if it takes you six months to use.  It will go first flat and then in another six months completely dead.  So stick with 7 0z. unless you really need it.<br /><br />Dijon is time, heat and light sensitive.  If you buy the three pack, keep all in the refirgerator.

It's so great to be able to eat pizza again. I've been eating a pizza every day since I received them. This is my first exposure to Ener-G foods and I am very impressed. After amazon warehouse deals sent me some moldy and fermented shells, the staff at Ener-G sent me a replacement at no cost. They were overwhelmingly friendly and professional. Highly Recommend!!! Just don't expect it to taste like pizza made from wheat.

review/summary: ZiwiPeak is made in the US, consistency problems
review/text: Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.

review/summary: Neither cat will touch it :( But dogs go wild...5 Star for Dog Food Treat
review/text: We all know how picky cats can be.  It may be grain free, but food still smells, looks like, and fine details in label indicate "highly processed" with all the extra vitamins & minerals, which I think is the "turnoff" for the kitties. Doesn't say up front, but also contains New Zealand Green Mussell, which I am not sure how that ingredient fits in as I am not from New Zealand, but suspect locals rely on that for nutrients as we do mussells in this country.  They are spoiled on the real thing - minimally processed or raw rabbit, chicken, bird, wild caught salmon.  They will eat canned only if minimally processed.  Another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat! 1 STAR for not knowing about the New Zealand Mussell & for still being highly processed & therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit. 5 Star for a dog treat without the added hormones, grains, etc.

review/text: One of my favorite flavor combinations is orange and dark chocolate. I saw these on my grocery store shelf one day & decided to give them a try.  I wasn't totally sure of what I was getting. The word 'biscuit' confused me, but I'd heard that the British use that word for cookie.  The biscuit is more of a soft cookie about 1/4" thick; it's topped with a stiff orange jelly & iced with a thin layer of dark chocolate icing. One of these cookies will satisfy my craving. I tried the raspberry flavor, but prefer the orange.<br /><br />Serving Size: 2<br />Servings per 5.29 oz Container: 6<br />Calories: 100<br />Total Fat: 3 g<br />~Saturated Fat: 1.5g<br />~Trans Fat: 0<br />Cholesterol: 10mg<br />Sodium: 35mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 17 g<br />Dietary Fiber: 0<br />Sugars: 14g<br />Protein: &lt;1g<br /><br />Ingredients listed on product page under Important Information<br />Made in Belgium

review/summary: Great little dessert cookie, or "chocolate and orange, together at last"
review/text: My late father's favorite flavor combination was orange and chocolate. His confection of choice was candied orange peel covered in dark chocolate. When he passed away in his 80's we found a small stash of chocolate-covered orange jellies in the cupboard--his treat. He'd have LOVED this cookies. They are soft sponge biscuits with a layer of stiff orange jelly and a brittle dark chocolate topping. The combination is delectable--the soft biscuit, orangey jelly and the crackle of the bitter chocolate on top. A few of these make a great dessert with a cup of espresso. They come in raspberry flavor as well, which I tried and it's also absolutely terrific. So keep a tube of these on hand and if required to produce a dessert or afternoon refreshment for a sudden visitor, make a cup of coffee and put a few of these on a nice paper doily. Done.

review/summary: Best cookies ever!
review/text: Someone gave me a box of these, and they were the best cookies I ever ate -- tasty, chocolaty, and just the right amount of crispiness. When I couldn't find more at any of my local stores, I had to order a 6-pack here! And the LU Le Chocolatier cookies I bought from Amazon arrived in perfect condition and just as excellent as the first box I tried.

review/summary: Excellent LU Cookies
review/text: The LU Cinnamon Sugar Spice cookies are simply wonderful . . . especially with a cup of tea during the winter months!  Although many of the LU brand cookies can be found in local markets, none of these stores offer this delicious treat.  Kudos to Amazon for keeping me well-stocked with these tasty treats.

review/summary: I've loved them since i was a child
review/text: I've been eating these Belgian cookies since i was a child growing up in Belgium.  They're a very old cookie called Couques de Bastogne (Bastogne cookies, from the town where the Battle of the Bulge took place). They were first marketed in the U.S. under that name but since that didn't mean  much to Americans the name's been changed several times over the 20 or so years I've seen them around. My local grocery store (I live in the Rockies) was carrying them, then Nabisco took over the LU brand and quit carrying the Bastogne here.  I just bought several boxes in NYC at a deli next to Time Square and really wanted more.  So happy to have found them on Amazon.<br /><br />They're a bit sweet, that's true, and that is a bit unusual for a European cookie but they make the best dunking cookie: cold milk, coffee of hot chocolate. They're similar to the the Lotus cinnamon cookie also made in Belgium that Delta serves on its flights. sorry the name escapes me.  I prefer the texture of the Cinnamon Sugar Spice; it's lighter.

review/text: I am always looking for something to send to my sons (one is in college the other in the military). I sent these cookies along with some other LUs to my college son. He called me almost immediately when he received them (and suprisingly it wasn't for money, lol) to thank me. He told me that all his roomates devoured several boxes within just a few minutes. So, these cookies passed the college frat test. Combining it with Amazon Prime shipping and it's all good. Kudos!

review/text: Seems France knows what to do with butter (beurre).  If you've ever sampled the delicious butter made in the north, in Brittany and Normandy, you know what I'm saying.  The French are masters of using butter in cooking.  So, in turn, the French know butter cookies.  These are French butter cookies, and it's quite a treat finding them on Amazon. Vive Le Petit Beurre!

review/summary: Buy Them Off the Shelf
review/text: For years, the only Lu's I could find at my local market were the USA Lu's, which aren't as good as the Belgium biscuits.  So, I was happy to find them at Amazon this past July, 2012 and bought the case of six boxes.  Unfortunately, they didn't taste fresh and had an expiration date of Dec. 2012; that explained the stale taste, but I chose not to return them.  Instead, I nuke two in the microwave for 5 or 6 seconds and it sort of revives the flavor.<br /><br />Well, last week, Sept. 14, 2012, I found the Belgium Lu at my local supermarket and bought a single box.  That box expires Dec. 2013, over a year from now, and the cookies definitely taste better.  Moral of the story: Buy them where you can read the Expiration date.  I surmise that having a year or two shelf life should be about right.

review/summary: PIMS ORANGE
review/text: This is the second (and last) time in a few years that I buy Pim's Orange from Amazon. Like the first time, I was disappointed, not because of the cookie itself, which is normally delicious--as a French person, I am very familiar with PIM'S cookies and know what they should taste and look like--, but because of the improper manner in which the packages are stored and handled along the way (I cannot figure out at which end). Obviously, the packages go from cold to hot temperatures (or vice versa), possibly multiple times, which is the worst thing that can happen to cookies incorporating chocolate and filling: this alters their appearance and consistency--chocolate surface becomes discolored and collapses due to melting before regaining some firmness, and the cookie part and filling become too soft. The taste is not affected too badly, but you cannot serve them to guests, because of the cookies' miserable appearence.  In order to save them anyway for my own consumption, I wrap the individual packs in a bath towel and store them in the vegetable compartment of my refrigerator. That helps regain some firmness in the cookies, but of course the chocolate surface remains discolored. So my advice is:  buy individual packs at your grocery store if they carry PIM'S, because the cookies are normally delicious, but do not buy them from Amazon.  It's too bad that Amazon has done nothing so far to correct this storage problem. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, to my satisfaction 99 p.100 of the time, including LU "Petit Beurre" cookies (these are rarely available in US grocery stores). Since they include no chocolate or filling, the shipments are usually in perfect condition.  I give PIM,S Orange three stars because the product is excellent under normal conditions, and the problem is not caused by the manufacturer.

review/text: My French teacher (native French) introduced these cookies to me. I tried to bake these at home following a reliable recipe but it just didn't taste/feel the same. As a healthy eater, I usually don't consume much butter. But the "petit beurre" biscuits are now my favorite companion for tea or coffee. They are not heavy or too sweet--just perfect in its texture, taste, and design. I just received a box of 6 just 2 days after ordering (go Amazon prime!) and couldn't help but enjoy two biscuits right away--yum! Probably going to order more once these are gone.

review/text: I'm always on the hunt for the best Scottish Shortbread and after several other brands, I found Lu's to the the BEST for any mass made shortbread cookies out there.  Visitors always comment how good they are and often switch to this brand after trying it just once.  Scottish Shortbread is supposed to be buttery, dense and not sweet, just a bare minimum of sweetness.<br /><br />Don't even bother with Wxxxxx's...blech!  If you like Scottish Shortbread, almost like homemade, then this is the one!  I'm so happy it's available on Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" program.

review/text: These "soft biscuits" are less like biscuits/cookies and more like really really dense cake. It was quite a surprise when I first tried one because I was expecting something similar to the soft cookies you buy in the grocery store. Never the less, the taste is very good with the raspberry filling being nicely complemented by the dark chocolate.<br /><br />The flavor is nice but the cookie part was too odd for me so I won't be buying this again. Still, I think there are probably a lot of people who would enjoy this product and if you like raspberry and dark chocolate you may want to give it a try.

review/text: These shortbread cookies are amazing. They are made of only 4 simple ingredients (wheat flour, butter, sugar, and salt), and they taste heavenly. If you made these cookies yourself, at home, you would use the same ingredients. There is nothing artificial added.<br /><br />Besides all of that, they are crispy, very satisfying and not too sweet. My grandchildren love them as much as I do. If you like shortbread, you will love these cookies. If you haven't tried shortbread cookies, I suggest you give these a try and start with the best, right from the Scottish Highlands.
