review/text: Bold, but not bitter...can easily use the "hold for more" option if you dont like your coffee as strong. This is one of the only cups of a bolder coffee I can drink without cream/sugar in it. It's THAT good. Kudos to Starbucks and Tassimo.

review/summary: Excellent Bold Coffee
review/text: I am a lover of Starbucks Sumatra Bold Coffee.  I bought my Tassimo a few weeks ago because of the affiliation with Starbucks.  I bought the Cafe Verona as that was what was sold at BB&B.  I thought the flavor was bold and bitter especially compared with my Sumatra.  I ordered the African Kitamu from Amazon and I am in love!  It has an amazing bold flavor with no after taste and can replace my Sumatra.  I bought 10 packs from Amazon.  This is my favorite bold coffee.  Please beg Starbucks to keep this in stock.

review/text: April 30th, 2011 -<br />I'm pissed at Amazon ... as a few days ago, I took the time to write multiple, extended Reviews on Starbuck's Coffee Products, but, they were all Rejected by Amazon, because they had a 'link' to my previous review on the Tassimo Bosch Coffeemaker (RED), 4500 Series.<br />My Newest (unpublished) Reviews were focused on the 'Holy Trinity' of combining certain Starbucks Coffee's + Tassimo Creamer + the Tassimo Bosch Coffeemaker, as they are all integrated as one ... since you can not speak about one, without mentioning the other two side kicks.<br />And I'm NOT going to re-post my long/extended reviews, just keep it short & sweet this time!<br /><br />The Starbucks Cappuccino Primo, Latte Primo, Breakfast Blend & Africa Kitamu - are Absolutely Superior to any other product lines, that I have used in the past 4 months.<br />The amazing integration of Tassimo Coffeemakers, with Starbucks T-disc technology is the "Key", with the way the hot water (@ perfect temperature) is pushed thru the coffee so well, thereby, `extracting' the perfect coffee solution, AND, by mixing that with their Fantastic Milk T-Discs, it makes it an Absolute Dynamic Duo! This is as close as to what you will get your local Starbuck's ... while in the comfort of your PJ's!<br /><br />5-Stars!

review/summary: As Stringer Bell would say, it's a 40 degree day
review/text: The best way to describe this coffee is to use a line from the Wire - it's a 40 degree day. If you're not familiar with the series or the saying, it means that there's nothing distinctive one way or another with this coffee. No, it's not bad, but it's not memorable either. Makes just a plain, rather bland cup o' joe.<br /><br />I wanted to try this brand since there aren't any Biggby's shops around me. I've heard they serve a decent cup, but their beans (at least this particular blend) are just so-so.<br /><br />There was no roasted-by date on the package so I may be dealing with some stale beans.<br /><br />I found them to be much more palatable when mixed with some Italian roast beans I recently bought which were a bit too intense. The Biggby's helped cut the strength and make it more enjoyable. Just alone, however, the Biggby's lacks sufficient body to stand up and be noticed. It's just the coffee equivalent of a 40 degree day.

review/text: I used to love Twizzler's licorice. Then I tried this soft liquorice from Australia. Wow, what a difference. The flavor is amazingly zestful. The liquorice is soft and chewy (unlike Twizzler's, which sometimes you have to pull apart to eat). Looking back, I can hardly believe how I lived without these in my life. I know these things have sugar and might not be great for my health, but what the heck - it's worth the price!

review/summary: Good, Healthy, Vegan-Friendly and lacks 'inert ingredients'.
review/text: I don't even like licorice-not until I happened to stumble upon this in my local gourment grocery store in September, 2009. I originally bought this because it was the perfect snack according to the information label for my hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) attacks that I sometimes have while stuck in traffic. Each piece is 10 grams of carbohydrates so 3 pieces is all I need to get the sugars back to where they need to be. It is extremely portable as it is not perishable and will not melt in the summer heat of your car. The packaging is plastic lined on the inside to prevent it from going stale while on the shelf.<br /><br />The texture is not quite like any previous licorice that I've tasted. It is not tough and does not crumble when chewed. It is more like a very soft taffy but not as sticky. It truly is a great product and if you like fresh fruit, eating healthy, and non-fat snacks then you will love this.

review/summary: It's bitter. And lemon. And I love it.
review/text: I love this lemony tonic both on its own and with gin. The cost is high, but it's a worthwhile splurge for me.  It's definitely for those who like bitter notes, and it's less cloyingly sweetened than some of your standard tonic waters. I tried adding a dash of bitters to a Bitter Lemon G&T, and it was too much - I take that to mean that Fever Tree's recipe is just right. A fresh mint or basil leaf doesn't hurt, though.<br /><br />I like their tonic also, but the lemon is really something special. I even asked for it for Christmas :)

review/summary: Low Calorie Large beats Dentastix
review/text: My dog loves this treat and I like it better than the Pedigree Dentastix. I'm comparing the two products to each other because they look so similar in color, size, shape. But my dog will tell you that the texture is definitely different. The Zoe appears tougher and chewier. It last minutes longer than the Dentastix per serving. My dog will sit and take his time to chew through the Zoe chew stix, which I like. Compared to the Pedigree stuff I get from my local Target which seems to disappear in his mouth and he's begging again after just a few seconds. The manufacturer's feeding directions says to feed two sticks a day. The calorie count is 90 per stick. I can't recommend that to your pet. I'm going to give this as a once a week treat, alternating with other stuff since my cocker is prone to getting fat. Unlike Dentastix, this does not indicate any dental health benefits. Still, this is made of quinoa and is gluten free, in case you care about that stuff. Cute packaging and is conveniently resealable. I would buy again and recommend to others.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have bought this again since my dog loves it so much. The second package I got, I actually decided to count houw many sticks came in one bag. There are only 6 if you get the large size like I do. 6 stick for $6. They tell you to give one or two sticks a day. Nevermind the calories (90 per stick)... but one bag might not even last you a week if you follow manufacturer's directions. Kind of pricey at $1 per stick. Greenies on Amazon (regular size) are less expensive. Anyway, I still think that this is a great product and I would still buy it... but believe me, I will be buying less often and only give it to my dogs on special ocassions!

review/summary: Unfortunately caused an allergy to my poochie
review/text: This treat did not have good reaction with my Jack Russell terrier mix, he ate it fine and even enjoyed it, but then he suddenly became quite hyper and nervous like he was having caffeine shakes.  I definitely will not be feeding this to him again.  It is too bad also since this looked to be a great treat, I looked at the ingredient list and did some research on all the ingredients and the only one that can cause an allergy is carrageenan, which is the vegetarian equivalent of casein, used as filler.  It is a natural ingredient derived from seaweed, but is said to cause digestive problems.  Most doggie treats do not contain carrageenan so this is the only ingredient that may have caused a reaction in my dog.  I am giving the treat two stars for the effort and intention, but there really should have been more research regarding the fillers.

review/summary: Variety is the spice of life
review/text: I have 2 dogs and while I don't give a lot of treats, I like to have a variety of items on hand to put in the everlasting ball, Kong etc., to keep them interested on days when the weather is not conducive to getting out.  My thought with these sticks was that if I cut a little off one end, it would be a perfect fit for the everlasting ball.  It turns out, they are hard as a rock!  I tried a couple of different knives and even my meat cleaver, but none of them made any headway in cutting off the 2" I needed to remove.  Then I picked it up and tried to break it with my hands, and it snapped in two right on the line I had been trying to cut (perhaps I scored it a little).  Anyway, it turns out that is the secret to these things - breaking instead of cutting.<br /><br />I am not in the least concerned about the caloric value of them so that was not figured into my perception of the treats in any way.  One of my dogs is slender - the other downright skinny (has a high metabolism and is offered plenty to eat but never finishes a meal).  The older, slender dog got the 2" bit I cut off and the younger skinny dog got the remainder of the stick in her everlasting ball.  May not be fair but she had to work harder to get it so it all comes out in the wash.<br /><br />The older dog practically took my hand off to get to the treat quickly.  Once she had it, she ran off and put it back on the floor so she could take her time with it.  I will say that the little 2" stick lasted her much longer than I would have expected so I rate them high for that reason.  The chewing action is good for their teeth/jaws and is far preferable to a treat they gobble down without tasting.<br /><br />The younger dog went racing after her everlasting ball and stayed busy for a long time trying to get it out.  I wasn't around when she finally succeeded to know how long it took her to eat it but am glad it kept her interested for awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is cute and the bag is resealable.  I believe they are kind of pricey and for that reason I might not order them again.  Otherwise I am completely satisfied.

review/summary: The dog loves it!
review/text: Normally, I spell out the ingredients off of the package when I do these reviews; but I'm learning that people do not mark that as helpful.  So, if you are curious about the ingredients...please read the description!  And, I obviously have not ate one of these dog treats personally!  But I can tell you this much--my dog loves these treats.  In fact, I have never seen her run so fast to get a treat.  If I leave the package out on the counter...she hangs around and sits until I give her one.  She actually will mind perfectly if she knows these treats are out.  It's kind of funny, really!  I honestly have to hide them...because other wise she will keep sniffing under the pantry door.  The product itself smells like a dog treat, and it's a good sized treat for my dog.  (She is a 78 pound boxer)  So for smaller dogs you could probably break it in half and make the bag last longer.  My dog has eaten the sticks on the carpet...and I have not noticed any stains, so I don't think there is a lot of coloring to them.  I clean up after her anyway because that is my preference...but I don't get the brown color like other treats.  Anyway, because of my dogs response to them...I am getting them again.  They'll make a great stocking stuffer!!

review/summary: My Aussie kinda likes them
review/text: My 5-year-old Australian shepherd, Pete, has put on a lot of weight in the last 18 months, so I was curious to see how he would take to a low calorie treat.<br />I placed a regular size Milk Bone, a small Beggin' Strip, and a Zoe treat stick side-by-side on the carpet and invited Pete to help himself.<br />Being wary like most Aussies, he cautiously sniffed each offering, then took the Milk Bone. When he was finished with the Milk Bone, he picked the Beggin' Strip. Finally, when there was only one choice left, he took the Zoe treat stick.<br />I did this test with him four times to see if he would develop a taste for the Zoe treat sticks, but the results were always the same.<br />From a health and caloric point of view, the Zoe treat sticks may be the better choice, but Pete's interested in them only if nothing else is available.<br />I suppose that's true of people and diet food too.<br />At any rate, Pete gives 'em 2 stars.

review/summary: Healthy treat!
review/text: Zoe Lifestyle Treats for Dogs are a healthy alternative to the typical high-calorie dog snacks which you find in stores today. The product is gluten-free and is a good source of soluble fiber. These treats are as hard as a rock which would probably be troublesome for older dogs with poor teeth. I tested these treats on a 2-year-old lab and a 9-year-old golden retriever. Keep in mind...they will eat just about anything. Both dogs threw the sticks on the ground and proceeded to sniff them.  I am not sure, but I think the cinnamon spice flavor threw them off a bit.  After rolling the sticks around on the ground, I am happy to report that they ate them. The next day, I offered them another treat and they didn't seem too excited. Overall, if you are into healthy dog food, these snacks are sensible treats. Personally, I wouldn't buy them again due to the price and the firmness of the product. I would be concerned that my dog would break a tooth.

review/summary: Great item, disappointing price & shipping service from Amazon
review/text: Love these treats for my puppy and my veterinarian was pleased with this product since the pup is slightly overweight and made in the USA, unfortunately they are quite pricey.  But when I started on the automatic monthly shipments from Amazon at the reduced price, Amazon cancelled the automatic shipments before the first shipment, for whatever reason, so now I have to buy them at the full higher price.  I guess someone wanted MORE MONEY so I will have to either buy them less frequently or find somewhere else to get them at a better price or look for something else.  How sad for my puppy, she really, really enjoys these treats.

I thought I would try Zoe treats since they had all natural ingredients and I have very few choices so far my dog likes. Well - So far so good, she loves the treats and no problems with her stomach. Because of her sensitive stomach and size I give her � of a stick at a time and she likes then so well she begs for more. It's nice to find a healthy treat that my dog likes.

That would be my only negative, in that I like a treat this size to take a while for my dog to chew it down.

review/summary: A great dog treat for special diet or sensitive needs
review/text: I saved these treat sticks for my German Shepherd who had been licking her paws a lot to the point of bleeding.  When I told the vet about it she suggested a wheat free diet. These treats went right along with that new diet since they are gluten-free, wheat-free, corn-free, and soy-free.  They are also good for the dogs teeth.  She liked them and enthusiastically ate them all. The vet was right..... along with diet changes, to include these low calorie treats, my German Sheppard quit her over-licking problem.  They are somewhat solid, but chewy for the dog and it's evident the dog enjoyed the taste.  I will continue to use these treats for my Shepherd and will purchase the medium sized treat sticks for my smaller English Setter.

review/summary: Low Calorie Dog Treats
review/text: I have a dog that is a Jack Russell Terrier that will eat anything and her weight shows it... So it really isn't saying much that she likes these treats. On the plus side, they are low-calorie and it takes her longer to eat one of the Zoe sticks than it does to eat one of her nightly Dentastix (the two products look very similar) but I suppose the Zoe sticks are denser and a bit tougher to chew through and so last longer.  If they are low-calorie and she'll eat it, I consider it a good product!

review/summary: 3 out of 4 dogs found this treat acceptable
review/text: One out of one owner-and-buyer-of-dog-treats thought they were not worth the cost.<br /><br />A few additional thoughts:<br /><br />I cannot see an "item count" on the package.  In the picture, the treats look like skinny pencils.  In fact, each treat is the size of four skinny pencils, with eight in the bag.<br /><br />"Cinnamon spice" is a people-flavor.  "Rancid road kill" is a dog flavor.  "rancid road kill" does not sell well.  That said, buy treats for your dogs, if that's who will be eating them, not yourself.<br /><br />My larger dogs (70#, excellent teeth, and 30#, bad teeth) inhaled these chews, taking just a little longer than they would take to eat fresh meat.  For this price, chews have to last a bit longer.<br /><br />I do not understand how the chews could be considered "hard" if used straight from the package.  YMMV.  My Chihuahua took two days to eat his.  He left a mess.  The bigger dogs didn't.<br /><br />My larger, 55# and underweight, young girl dog would not touch these chews on two different days.  She is one of the last dogs on the planet who needs either low fat or low calorie treats, so perhaps she was using good doggie judgement in not wasting chewing-effort-calories on a treat that may have a negative caloric payoff.

review/summary: Good treat, but pricey
review/text: My dogs love chewy treats and these seemed like a good possible option to combine a safe and healthy treat with the opportunity to chew.  On the positive side, there was no excess packaging, the treats arelow calorie, gluten free  and safe/healthy for your dog if given in the recommended amounts and even for dogs on strict diets.  There's a nice cinnamon smell that's appealing to humans.  Both my dogs appeared to enjoy this treat and were eager for a second once they ate the first, so in addition to the positive aspects for a cautious owner, it was also popular with the intended audience.<br /><br />However, I'd also caveat this with a few other issues.  First, the package says a medium dog could get 2 sticks per day.  There are six sticks in a bag and the cost is $6 - that's fairly pricey given that my dogs (admittedly expert, hardy chewers) ate their sticks in less than 5 minutes.  While the cinnamon scent is appealing to humans, one of my dogs didn't seem excited about it at first.  She did decide to eat it after a couple minutes (she initially put it down and backed away), but only because the other dog expressed interest.  Once she ate the first one, she seemed more than willing to take another, but there was an initial hesitation.  I'd expected something that might take longer to chew through.  I'm the first to admit my dogs are super-chewers, so if your dog doesn't have jaws of steel, you might get more out of this treat, but it took between 2 -4 minutes (depending on which of the dogs) to eat the strips.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't mind the price, it's not a bad treat.

review/summary: Yorkie likes!
review/text: It can be difficult writing reviews of pet food/treats for obvious reasons and most everyone can read the nutritional information in the item description area, so I will just say that our large build 12 lb Yorkie LOVED these treats! There are a lot of times where she will tire of biscuits and seem reluctant to take them, but that was not the case with these things. When she heard either one of us messing with the packaging, she would be right there to make her presence known and show us her "puppy dog" eyes. As you bend down to hand one to her, she would jump up on her hind legs and excitedly grab it from you and run off to consume it.<br /><br />On a practical level, these things seem to be a bit pricey (as healthy foods tend to be) at about a dollar per... If you believe that your pet could benefit from these for a short period of time, then go ahead and try them. However, if your pet already seems to be in good shape, stick with what you are doing and don't over do it.<br /><br />This will not cost the product any stars, as all necessary information is provided for you to review before your purchase and the fact that our Yorkie likes them. In the future, I would buy them again to throw in a bit of variety, but not as an everyday option.

review/text: I have a 9lb dachshund and I didn't notice the size on these when I ordered them and they are recommended for dogs 30lbs and over.  They are large sticks that most adult dogs would eat in a few bites, but this one lasted about 30 minutes for my dog.  She loved them, begged for them and when the package was empty, knocked the trash can down to get at the wrapper which she licked clean.  These are all organic and smell wonderfully almost like cinnamon.  With a smaller dog, they do make a bit of a mess since she has to chew it slowly so put something under your pet before letting them go at it.  I think they even helps clean her teeth a bit which is a real bonus.  I am now looking for a smaller size to order for her.

review/summary: No wheat, corn, or soy - my dog loves them
review/text: First of all, these chew sticks are made in the U.S. which is a must for us when it comes to feeding our dog. Well, maybe not strictly U.S. only but definitely not China as so many dog treats come from there. I don't trust China for edible dog products and never will.  My dog Sheila usually tears through her treats in a hurry - but what we like about these is that it takes her a while to get through one. She has to work at it for a while, which is good for gum stimulation and teeth cleaning.<br /><br />We don't feed Sheila anything that has wheat, corn, or soy in it. These treats contain none of those filler ingredients. The main ingredients are rice flour and quinoa flour.  We always feed grain free food, but we make some exceptions for treats (again, as long as it is not wheat or corn).<br /><br />The cinnamon spice flavored sticks smell very pleasant and they keep Sheila busy for a while. The large size works well for her - she is about 50 lbs.

review/summary: The tails wag for this one
review/text: I assembled my canine product testing panel - Hunter, a 65 lb. Golden Retriever who has some weight issues and Boston, a 35 lib mixed breed who has some dental issues.  I offered the treats, both testers took them readily.  Boston retired to a comfortable spot and began to chew quite eagerly.  Hunter took the entire stick into his mouth which caused me some concern that he would choke on it.  I ordered him to drop the stick, which luckily he did.  I gave him back the stick but held on to one end so he could not take the whole thing in his mouth again. I kept hold of the (now slimy) stick until Hunter chewed off a couple appropriate size chunks.  Once the pieces were a safer size I let him enjoy, which he definitely did.  Boston, meanwhile, was holding the stick between his paws and chewing on it, taking off bite size pieces.  I had no concerns about how he was managing the product.  Both dogs were quite interesting in repeating the test.<br /><br />I offered the product again the following day.  Both dogs were quite eager.  Again Boston had no problem managing the product in a safe manner.  I gave Hunter the stick but retained control of one end so he could not gulp it whole.  He began to chew off a piece, and did eat the product safely.  I inspected Boston's teeth after he finished his portion and was pleased that there seemed to be some lessening in the tarter buildup on the back teeth.<br /><br />Both of my dogs liked the product, although to be fair neither is very picky.  I also offered the product to two other dogs, a 50 lib mixed breed who managed it quite readily and a 10 lb Yorkie who chewed it a bit and then buried it.  I am concerned that a larger, greedy dog like Hunter could choke on this.<br /><br />I like that the product is low calorie but I think that at nearly a dollar a stick it is a bit pricey.  I like that the sticks are hard enough to make the dogs chew.  Boston did seem to get some teeth cleaning benefits from the product.  Unfortunately due to the high price and the safety issues for Hunter I probably will not be purchasing this again.

Obviously these are all big dogs so I can't speak for small dogs but when all of ours enjoy them I can recommend these to all big dog owners.

review/summary: High Quality Treats
review/text: Chock full of power-house ingredients like quinoa and flax, these treats are thankfully free of wheat, soy and other common allergens making them nice to have on hand for puppy play dates or visiting furry friends who might have dietary restrictions. They have a neutral smell and don't leave smudges or stains on carpet the way many treats can. My dog loved them.<br /><br />The compact, resealable bag is great for travel. My only word of caution is that with only six treats per bag, they go quickly!

review/summary: Dog loved them!
review/text: My 50-lb Beagle/hound mix loved them! Definitely a good choice if you want to give your dog a real treat (and not a frozen carrot or an ice cube) and your dog is on a diet. I wish they lasted longer, though. Our dog is food-motivated so eats quickly, so maybe it will last longer for your dog, but she finished this in about 3 minutes.<br /><br />The treats aren't super-large, either. I'd say they're just right for my dog, so for a bigger dog they might be a bit small (but not a choking hazard or anything, I don't think).

review/summary: My dogs loved them
review/text: I have two labs who love to eat and will eat everything. I also have a foster Lab who is more choosy about what she likes to eat. I offered this treat to all three dogs and they loved it - there was no hesitation about taking or eating it. While they enjoyed the treat, it didn't last very long (I would say at most a minute). If you're looking for a treat that your dogs will take time eating, this isn't it (or maybe it is if you have a smaller dog). But if you're looking for a treat that's healthy and an alternative to the other dental chews out there, this is a good option though a tad expensive (almost $1 each).

review/summary: Surprisingly, All 3 of My Dogs Liked These!
review/text: I say surpisingly because the ingredients were sort of unusual - Cinnamon was one of the main flavors and 1 of my dogs is picky.  All three of them took off with them as if they were special treats, and I had wanted to try them because one of my dogs is on a diet, and this was a low-fat treat.  Unfortunately, there were only 7 in the package, so it's doubtful I'll be buying them again.  I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AYL9NU">Get Naked Low Calorie Dental Chew Sticks for Dogs, Small/6.2-Ounce, 18 sticks/Pack</a>, because although they are smaller in size, they lasted about as long as this treat, and they weren't all gone after the 2nd one.  Still, The ZOE Low Calorie Chew Sticks would be great for a household that had fewer dogs.

review/summary: My dogs love these!
review/text: I have a Doberman and a Sharpei (they are both 4 years old) who love these chew sticks. They smell like cinnamon and are not messy or gross in any way. They are gluten free which is important for many breeds who may have allergies or skin issues. I would recommend these to other dog owners as long as their dog does not have dental issues. They give the dog a nice chew and crumble a bit so that your dog won't swallow a big chunk by accident. They also have healthy ingredients which more and more dog owners are paying attention to these days. No corn, white flour, or unhealthy animal fats here. Ditch the crummy milk bones and get these.

review/summary: Daisy likes them
review/text: I give 5 stars to anything my dog likes because she's so picky.  People will give her a doggy snack/biscuit and she'll let it drop out of her mouth and onto the ground. So embarrassing.  When I first gave her one of the Zoe Low Calorie chew sticks, she trotted off with it and then laid it down, seemingly forgotten.  I was was ready to say she didn't like them, but, when I gave the stick back to her during her brushing(I have give her something to chew on so she doesn't chew on me), she gobbled it up, and in fact, it took 3 sticks to get through her half hour brush-out(she's a rough collie, like Lassie).<br /><br />Though  Zoe treats are low calorie, something my dog doesn't have to worry about, they still apparently taste good.  They smell like doggy-treat with cinnamon to me, nothing I'd want to eat, but then I'm not the one testing the product.<br /><br />These treats are gluten-free, something I watch out for with my dog because collies are prone to skin problems.  The ingredients are as listed:<br />Brown rice flour<br />organic quinoa flour, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch(I've heard this is good in prevent cancer)oat fiber, oat groats, chicken, natural chicken flavor, calcium carbonate, organic flaxseed, carrots, chia seed, cinnamon, carrogeenan, furtooligosachride(A natural probiotic found in bananas), L-carnitrine(helps turn fat into energy).<br /><br />With all this good stuff going on, I wish the kids were still young enough to get them to eat these sticks.  It would be a whole lot healthier than most of the human snacks out there.  And they were never as picky as Daisy.

review/text: I have two large dogs, one is 80lbs and the other is 140lb.  They both took these treats immediately, without even the usual once-over sniff and inhaled them in under 3 minutes. You'd think with the cinnamon flavoring they would have hesitated but not in the least.  Both dogs then licked the carpet to make sure they'd got all the crumbs and then looked at me for more. At $6 a bag I will definitely limit these to once a week.

review/summary: If my dogs could shop they'd buy these treat sticks
review/text: Zeus, my 11-year old, 120# Alaskan malamute is fussy about treats. He approaches all treats with suspicion. And cinnamon spice is not exactly his favorite flavor. He prefers chicken or salmon. Even though these contain chicken and natural chicken flavor they smell like cinnamon and nutmeg. I assumed he would turn up his nose. I set a treat stick at his feet. He ignored it for several minutes so I figured that was that. When I turned my back he started eagerly chewing on it. He devoured it. He begged for more. He loved it! Hey Pep&eacute;! Pep&eacute; is my 2-year old Chihuahua/mini-dachshund. He'll eat anything. I cut one in half for him. He was thrilled. He also loved it. But I knew he would.<br /><br />These treat sticks contain really healthy ingredients like brown rice flour, organic quinoa flour, oat fiber and oat groats. I had to look up FOS - aka fructooligosaccharide. It's a probiotic, which is great. However FOS can cause gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort. So I recommend one treat per day for large dogs and one half per day for small dogs. My dogs like these treat sticks so much I just set up the subscribe and save for the small and large, low cal for each dog. It's a good deal.

review/summary: Zoe Chew Sticks: "the lifestyle treats for dogs"
review/text: Cinnamon Spice Flavor 6.6.ounce, large size sticks - here's our review, and the opinions of our dogs!<br /><br />Today our dogs tried out the Zoe Chew Sticks.  These sticks were a hit.  They are similar to Pedigree Dentastix, but I think these last longer.  The 6 sticks are each about 5 inches long and the cinnamon flavor actually smelled pretty good.  The packaging says gluten-free, low calorie, and high protein grain for excellent source of energy.  Our Basset Hound, who usually inhales her treats, actually took some time to get through hers.  Our Rat Terrier chewed hers in great gusto.  She's a bit overweight right now, so it was encouraging to find a "low calorie" treat.  We have a visiting Springer Spaniel and she enjoyed the odd treat to her normal rawhide chips.  I did not give it to my older Beagle as she is on a "low protein" diet and the packaging says "high protein".  As the dogs ate them, there were a few that broke off larger pieces to work on.  I wondered if I could break a stick in 1/2 for the smaller dog, but they do not break, or even bend.  They are not greasy and the packaging has a re-sealable zip top for easy storage.  Overall, the dogs really enjoyed the Zoe Chew Sticks and I enjoyed the fact that the sticks seem to be a fairly healthy alternative to raw hide chews.

review/text: If Chewy could write this review himself, he would tell you how much he loves this treat.  He went nuts when I gave him the first one, and actually played with it a little before consuming it.  Then he stalked me through the house trying to beg for another (actually nudging my hand trying to get to the bag).  I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised by this product.  Normally these "organic" dog products that promise to be so healthy just aren't attractive to dogs.  A lot of good a healthy treat is if the dog won't eat it.  But apparently this one delivers all that plus taste too.  Slightly pricier than other brands of chew sticks, but in this case I would say it was worth it.

review/text: These chew sticks are just the right size for small to medium size dogs.  Ours went to the baby pomeranians and they were an instant hit.  It helps to know that you are providing them with a low calorie snack (especially for those who have more sedentary pets, not a problem here).  These are substantial for their size measuring in at approximately 5 inches by 1/2 inch.  They are also gluten free and full of soluble fiber.  Now, I haven't heard any of our pups complaining about needing to be on a gluten free diet or needing more fiber, but certainly it can't hurt.  All in all, a healthier alternative to some of the other brands out there.

review/summary: Jilly Loved It
review/text: I have to start out by saying that I don't like it "fancy or gourmet" dog products. Dogs will eat just about anything, except for broccoli and carrots with my baby Jilly, and to get some item when you are paying mostly for either package design or brand name isn't something I buy into being that stuff impresses me, not her.  That being said I did like this product and more importantly Jilly loved it.  These have the same X shape as a dentastix, so I have to assume it would help getting rid of some plaque buildup, although there are no claims on the package.  The cinnamon and spice flavor was potent enough that I could smell it when I opened the package, which I liked, being I knew what she is getting.  And even though the flavor might be more for me than for Jilly, it sure is an improvement over liver flavors etc.<br /><br />Compared to similar products this was harder and took her more time to eat, which I liked.  It took her about 8-10 minutes and a lot of similar type products she eats in just a few minutes.  All that being said, I really did enjoy the product for what it was, but I am not so sure about any weight loss or health benefits.  The L-Carnitine proudly displayed on the front of the package, right next to the antioxidants came off as something like lycopene does for people.  Sure it's good for you and you should eat more of it but when you do do you honestly notice a difference in the way you feel?  As to the weight loss aspects, my dog is only about 8 months old and she's normal weight, but a bit husky being she's a lab. She has some small milk dud sized treats that are her absolute favorites that are 3 calories each and a handful would have less calories than this bone, if weight was an issue and Jilly prefers a natural bone (real bone not rawhide) and it takes her a LONG time to eat and I can't believe the amount of calories she gets per preserving is more than 92.<br /><br />Basically, for what it is it's a very good product, that being said there are most likely better options out there if you aren't willing to spend money on the nice smell and nice packaging.  I'm not sure if I would order it again, but maybe being I like to give her a verity in treats being she eats the same old same old kibble.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars.

Well - So far so good, Sophie loves the treats and no problems with her stomach. Because of Sophie's sensitive stomach and size I give her � of a stick at a time and she likes then so well she begs for more. It's nice to find a healthy treat that my Sophie likes.

review/summary: Doggy likey, wallet not so much
review/text: Thought I would try something new since my mixed breed senior stopped eating the daily morning bone (!) we would give him for breakfast (Iam's brand).  He immediately took to these, which kind of surprised me given they are..."spicy" and I never knew him to like things like that.  Who knew dogs like cinnamon?!<br /><br />Anyhoo, seems to like them fine, and I definitely like the fact that they are lo cal, but the price...geez...a little overpriced!  I always thought the Greenies were good, but crazy expensive, and these seem to be priced at least as high as Greenies.<br /><br />Also, the fact that the manufacturer instructions indicate two of these sticks a day, and the fact that there are about 6-8 a pack, seems a little crazy.  So buy 2 packs a week?!  Come on...make a box with 30 or 40 if you want people to actually follow your instructions without buying a silly amount of bags of these things (and hopefully to help get cost down)!  They probably don't do this because people would get sticker shock if they saw these priced in a box (would be approx. $30-$40!)<br /><br />Pricing is way off, but product seems to be good.<br /><br />Edit:  After trying these out, I signed up for a "subscription" to have the larger version (in the shape of bones) delivered via Amazon...and for my biggish dog, I like the bone version much better...he spends more time chewing it (partly why I wanted these was to use as a teeth cleaning device).  If you have a big dog (>70 lbs or so I guess), you might want to check out the Large Zoe dental chew treats instead.  Also note that the "subscribe and save" option via Amazon makes the cost much more palatable, so diminishes my complaint about price somewhat.

review/text: These are sticks with ribs protruding.  I am going to use the same review I did for another ZOE product, because it is as true for this product as it was for the other one:<br /><br />I have an older dog - Lab/Pit mix = and a puppy - Maltese/ShiTzu mix, about 5 months.  They fight to take these away from each other.  They growl when the other approaches.  It's funny to watch, and they are usually fairly good about sharing.  If Big steals from Little, Little finds Big's treat and steals it for herself.  And vice versa.  Not these.  They go to opposite ends of the house and glare balefully at t'other while they chew.  I would certainly buy these - if my local store carried them and I had a coupon and they were on sale.  I'd like both a coupon AND on sale, but for these, I might only require one; the dogs love them that much.

I ignored this instruction, and didn't get whipped cream. It was thick, and slightly fluffy, but after more than 5 minutes of continual whipping, it didn't whip. Please note this was user-failure, not product-failure! MimicCreme provides Healthy Top whipping instructions on their website here: [...].

review/text: First off, the plastic bag option of getting this spice is awesome!  It's dirt cheap!!!  I just saved my old McCormick Pumpkin Pie Spice jar, and now I refill it from these bags.  This method makes these prices unbeatable!!!<br /><br />Okay the spice itself:  it is good.  Not great, but not a problem at all.  It's considerably milder than McCormick's.  So, to compensate, depending on what I'm making, I simply modify the quantity of spice.  I use about 50% more of this than I would with McCormick's PP Spice.  In any case, this brand is so inexpensive, it's still a good bargain.  And the flavor is great!!!  Just know that it is a little bit mild, and it will work great for you!

review/text: I eat about 3 tablespoons of VCO per day.<br /><br />I have used Garden of Life and Spectrum Brands, both of which were the UNREFINED versions.<br />Those brands were delicious and Bronners Fresh Pressed Virgin Whole Kernel is no exception.<br /><br />I prefer unrefined, flavorful coconut oil and this is exactly what I got.  I eat it straight from the bottle and it does not make me gag at all.  I love it!<br /><br />Not only is it delicious with a taste of toasted coconut, it really smoothes the skin out.<br /><br />I think that I will start cleansing my face with this rather than soap, I have read that people do this.  I will try that and write an update.<br /><br />BTW, Bronners sells two version of their VCO, this Whole Kernel Unrefined and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052AIF00">Dr Bronner's Fresh-pressed Virgin Coconut Oil White Kernel Unrefined 14 Fl Oz</a>.<br /><br />According to Bruce Fife, an expert on Coconut and Coconut oil,<br /><br />The difference between the "white kernel" and "Whole kernel" is that the whole kernel includes the brown membrane that separates the kernel from the shell. According to Fife, this membrane has a higher content of unsaturated fatty acids.<br /><br />According to the manufacturer's website, "Whole kernel oil, which is made from the kernel with its "parings" is more nutritious and has a slightly nuttier flavor whereas white kernel oil offers a choice to consumers who are familiar with this grade. Both grades are versatile and healthy along with being organic and fair trade."<br /><br />UPDATE:  I missed this the first time.  Bronners' VCO is made from dried coconut as is Spectrum. Whereas Garden of Life VCO is is made from freshly picked coconuts that are used within 24-48 hrs, the coconut meat shredded (not dried) & cold-pressed using the water from inside the coconut, then fermented to extract the oil.<br /><br />I just received some Tropical Traditions coconut oil and will review and compare shortly.

review/summary: Great for skin!
review/text: After reading on a blog that coconut oil is good for the skin, I had to order this product and see for myself. I have combination skin that is fairly sensitive and I would ALWAYS use moisturizers/facial products that are "oil-free"... so I was a little skeptical about putting oil on my face and I truly thought I might break out from it.<br />Well, 5 days later, after applying it in the morning and evening, my skin has never looked better or felt softer! I haven't developed any pimples at all (and if I were going to, it DEFINITELY would have happened after only 1 day for me). I didn't use a lot of it and made sure to dab any excess oil off with a tissue when I finished applying it. Also, I found that it works GREAT for razor burn or minor skin irritations. I've got my mom using it too and she loves it.

review/summary: Great Quality
review/text: I bought this stuff at my local co-op. I've used a lot of coconut oils and this brand is my favorite. I'm a coconut lover so I get the whole kernel version, but there is a lighter version as well. I use this oil for my skin, cooking, baking, and just eating plain. It's good stuff.

review/summary: Excellent taste, wonderful for skin!
review/text: I eat about 3 tablespoons of VCO per day.<br /><br />I have used Garden of Life brand prior to using Dr. Bronners.  I would rate them just about equal in terms of texture, taste, smell and freshness.<br /><br />Both tasted like toasted coconut, very fresh tasting and pleasant.<br /><br />I prefer unrefined, flavorful coconut oil and this is exactly what I got. I eat it straight from the bottle and it does not make me gag at all.

review/summary: The Best Tasting Coconut Oil We've Ever Tried
review/text: We've been testing and trying coconut oils for about six months now. We love the taste and health benefits of this wonderful oil but had not found a favorite product until now. Bronner's Magic All-One Coconut Oil is our new fav! There is just the faintest hint of coconut sweetness when you cook with it, and the aroma when you open the jar is just - well, magical! It's light and tasty and we can't get enough of it. Just like all of the other wonderful Dr. Bronner's products, you're bound to be satisfied with your purchase.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052AHU38">Bronner's Magic All-One - Coconut Oil Org Fresh-Pressed Virgin Whole Kernel Unrefined - 14 fl oz.</a>

review/summary: Magic in a jar
review/text: If you haven't fallen in love with coconut oil yet, you are behind the times my friend. Honestly, this stuff is as close to magic pixie dust as we will ever get. It's an all over body moisturizer, fantastic hair conditioning treatment, great to cook with, and it has incredible health benefits if you eat it raw. Put some on your toast, in your smoothie, to pop stove popcorn, etc. It's a great makeup remover too. I have THE most sensitive skin of anyone I've ever met- I can't use most sunscreens, soaps, perfumes, etc. and this stuff is great. Put it on cuts and bruises- it makes an antibacterial seal over the cut and fades dark splotches. You can put this stuff on your newborn. THIS is the definition of 100% natural. Plus, this particular brand is organic and you have a cute jar when you're done. Seriously, magic in a jar.

review/summary: The best Coconut oil
review/text: This is the best coconut oil I've ever had.  It's delicious just eating it out of the bottle.  My wife who is not a fan of coconuts actually likes it alot. If you are looking for good coconut oil, look no further.  Definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Yummy product.
review/text: I bought this yesterday at a local organic grocery store and I must say that I am very impressed with it. I love coconut products and this is a great tasting coconut oil. I am aware of and have read many articles online about the health benefits of virgin coconut oil. I ate a little bit straight from the jar and it tasted amazing. I will be using this brand from now on. I also like the fact that it's organic and fair trade. Coconut oil is so amazing and works well for the hair too. Great product.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I bought this from my local health food store, It has a wonderful coconut taste. I use it in everything from my morning oatmeal  to yogurt. I put some in my dogs food and their coats have been so shiny and soft. I also suffer from a dry flakey scalp so i massage a small amount into my hair and let it sit for 30 minutes before i shampoo it out, it leaves my hair so soft and shiny. it is a great waterproof mascara remover too. I will be buying this item in bulk! I love all the benefits coconut oil has to offer.

review/summary: GREAT for vegan baking!
review/text: The title pretty much says it all. Coconut flavor doesn't pop out in baked goods, but it definitely yields a rich undertone which can't be identified as coconut.  Wonderful in banana bread, cranberry nut bread, pumpkin cake, etc. Price is high, though.  Fair trade, I can understand, but it's real high for the quantity.

review/summary: omg!  fabulous!
review/text: Based on other online reviews, I couldn't wait to taste these cookies. I brought the box inside the moment I saw it on my front porch, grabbed a box from the larger box, and sampled.<br /><br />Holey moley, these shortbread cookies are fabulous! Be warned that there is a tiny down-side, though. Each 23 g cookie contains 4g of saturated fat...that's 20% of the daily value, folks. However, there is no denying that these are wonderful.

review/summary: Shipment damage
review/text: I ordered the Pecan Shortbread and the Chocolate Walnut cookies in July 2006.  They were shipped in the same box.  The Chocolate Walnut cookies arrived in perfect condition, but the Pecan Shortbread cookies were all broken up into little pieces, in all of the 6 individual boxes inside the case pack.  I tried to return them online through my account login, but it says this item is not eligible for return.  So I'll be phoning Amazon on Monday to figure out how to remedy this.<br /><br />Regarding the cookies themselves, I love the Pecan Shortbread cookies, and I've been buying them locally for about 4 years.  I like them better when they're kept in the fridge, it just gives them a better crunch for my tastes.  If you need to avoid gluten, these are a winner.  I just hope the warehouse people stop giving these things the drop test...  ;-)

review/summary: I can't believe it's gluten-free!
review/text: These cookies are so darn tasty. I've made a lot of my own tasty gluten-free baked treats at home, but these cookies are SO worth buying. The pecans are such a tasty and delicious addition to the buttery shortbread. They aren't particularly mealy or gritty like some gluten-free products. Perfectly delicious, and highly recommended... if not particularly healthy ;-P

review/summary: Crumby Cookies
review/text: These cookies taste good, BUT they didn't arrive intact.  I may have had two out of the 9 cookies in full shape.  The rest were pieces; mainly crumbs.  I have 6 boxes of crumbs ( because I used the subscibe and save) and will probably use for pie crusts or cheesecake crust.<br />Its  disappointing so far as just wanting a couple yummy cookies once in awhile !  Didn't want to have to bake to use. : (

review/summary: Best Ever Cookie
review/text: I bought two cases of the Pecan Shortbread cookies since I can't find them in the grocery store anymore. The other flavors are not so good. These are a great value when you combine with free shipping. They have a very good taste and you wouldn't even guess that they are a gluten free cookie. My shipment arrived unbroken but I have bought in the store and they were crumbs. I love this product.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Walker's shortbread (Scotland) but tried this out cuz it was on sale and I was curious about the gluten-free lifestyle. Definitely happy with the rich taste. A bit dry because it doesnt contain eggs but overall I was impressed enough to buy a second box. These are good enough to serve at a party though children will not like it as much as adults.

review/summary: An excellent corn and gluten free cookie that does not hold up in shipment
review/text: This is rare find in gluten free cookies when it comes to flavor and texture.  Unfortunately rice based products tend to crumble and these cookies are no exception.  Mine were purchased locally and one third were broken.  It is possible that better packing would reduce breakage as the current packing does not restrict movement of the cookies. Worse, this packing does nothing to distribute G forces evenly across each cookie when the box is dropped.  Old style cookie tins have crinkled paper cups and shock absorbing corrugated cardboard.  Pamela needs to take advantage of our ever expanding knowledge of the physics of how things break.  Put another way, Pamela,s package is like a car with no seat belts, no airbags, no safety cage and no crumple zone. Additional cost would be small in my opinion.<br /><br />Rice cookies made with honey or molasses hold up better as these sticky sweeteners have gluten's glue like binding power.  It may not be possible to make shortbread cookies more durable while maintaining the excellent taste.<br /><br />I cannot eat real shortbread so breakage is better than nothing.
