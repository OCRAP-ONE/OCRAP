review/summary: Disappointing...
review/text: I wanted to like this, Im a fan of the whole natural Ital way of eating/living, but this drink sucks allot. I am NOT a huge coffee drinker nor am I particular about my coffee. Some discribe this as pretty mild with not much of a bitter after taste...to my family it is wartered down coffee flavored old boring plain tea. It is coffee flavored water! All of that said if you like SUPER mild coffee flavored water give it a try, but its a no go here.<br />bummer...

review/summary: Pretty good medium roast flavor.
review/text: This is a good companion to a french press device.  I didn't find it too strong, which means coffee enthusiasts that prefer their coffee too strong, might not like it, but hey, if you think its a good idea, why not use two bags instead of one?  Marley coffee also claims to be organic, so if you are into organic stuff, this could be worth your while.

review/summary: Smooth taste
review/text: Coffee has very smooth taste.  I had to do some research as to how to use the pods.  Best way I found to use pod was to cut open pod and place into coffee filter or just place unopened pod into coffee filter.  It worked quite well and the coffee was not weak, but had a strong smooth taste.

review/summary: Coffee that is exotic hits the mark!
review/text: We were surprised when the packages were for one cup portions.  We are not used to brewing coffee this way.  However, that aside, it is very easy to overcome the simple obstical and brew.  We put the packages (out of the freshness wrapper of course)in the basket where we normally put the grounds.<br /><br />We had to guess how many for a full pot, but we decided that one per cup would do the trick.  It did and we were very happy with the results. This is a full flavored coffee and since we do not add cream or sugar, got the full benefit.  This is a good product and if you have one of those single cup brewers, then this will be even better.<br /><br />The only downside is that if they had some good instructions on how to brew a single cup included they would most likely have higher sales. The roast is really full flavored and delicious.

review/summary: This is a coffee lovers coffee
review/text: When we got this coffee my wife promptly told me she would make if for us the following morning.  She did, and it was one of the best tasting cups of coffee I had ever tasted.  I'm not a coffee addict or a person who would be able to notice much of a difference between a good Starbucks coffee and a cup of Maxwell House, but I certainly noticed how wonderful this coffee was. Great aroma and a full, rich taste!!!  The following morning I was looking forward to another cup of this coffee..... the first thing I notcied was the aroma was different.  Then, as I tasted the coffee I immediately told my wife it didn't taste the same a the previous day.  It was then that she admitted to me that the Marley coffee was too good to waste on my unappreciative taste buds.  She was keeping it for herself.  This coffee is very good.  I'll be buying some more of this just for me and I obviously recommend it.

review/text: This has a very mild flavor to it and no bitter after taste. If you want it stronger you can just let the bag steep longer. I think the price reflects the fancy box and individual packages it comes in. If all you want is a milder tasting coffee with no bitterness there are plenty to choose from in your local grocer that will give you that with a lot less price.

review/text: I got this for my husband, and he drank a few of these pods, and has yet to use anymore. I think this coffee is too weak, so less water is recommended. Thanks for the free sample, it's fun trying new things. This isn't the best of coffee's yet it's worth a try. Update: I cut up five packets, and put it in a five cup filter, with full amount of water, and the coffee brewed perfectly and tasted really good. I tried this instead of using the one shot packets, and it worked for me.

review/text: I am very impressed with this coffee.  The taste is smooth and mellow, but rich as well.  It's a medium roast.  I'm a coffee freak and have tried too many brands and varieties to count, but only a handful merit buying again.  This is definitely one I'll buy again and again.  I hope to find it in a regular drip-grind version so I can make it by the pot instead of just by the cup.

review/summary: Serviceable, very convenient coffee
review/text: I'm used to grinding my own beans, but occasionally I run out, and I like to have some 'backup' coffee at hand.  Sealed in convenient single-dose foil pouches, this coffee fits that bill admirably.<br /><br />Marley is a name I associate with Jamaica, home of some of the world's best coffee.  This coffee isn't Jamaican, though; it's an Ethiopian medium roast, ground and put into a little multi-purpose sealed filter.  It's not a 'pod' as that trademarked term is used, but it's about the right size to lay flat on the floor of your small four-cup drip coffee maker.  Or, it can be torn open and the  ground coffee used any way you wish.<br /><br />I generally tend to like a fairly weak brew compared to my coffee-hound friends; this is enough grounds for me to make 12 oz of coffee, not more.  The flavor is not particularly dynamic; there's no French-roast "burnt" flavor but little of the floral or buttery aromatics that I like in my light roasts- as stated, it's a 'medium' roast.  In fact, 'inoffensive' is probably the right way to describe it, few coffee drinkers would throw this one out of bed.<br /><br />Summary:  sealed packet for long shelf life; single-dose amount; boring flavor; not going to compete with fresh-ground.  For what it is, it's good.

review/summary: GREAT SMELL. BROWN WATER.
review/text: Sooooo disappointing. The coffee smells great but what emerges from the coffeemaker is what my mother used to refer to as "dishwater." In fact, that's actually kind. I added cream, as usual, and the liquid turned almost white. This is a product packaged with no instructions whatsoever, except for "this side down" on the serving itself. Single-serving coffee pads have been around for a long time. I encountered them first in England in the early 1960s. They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again. This company would do better to spend less on the fancy packaging and just put the coffee into a generic-type bag (with some instructions, perhaps) and allow buyers to build their own brew. For now, save your money. This stuff makes Dunkin's regular taste like a gourmet blend.

review/summary: This is not the way to make a cup of coffee
review/text: There is an inherent problem with this tea bag style coffee. The bag traps air inside, and so it wants to float on top of the water, which means it doesn't really brew. You can stab at it with a fork, or weigh it down with a spoon, but this still just results in it sitting in the water. There's not water flowing threw it. So the result in my tests was some very weak coffee, and more time spent preparing it than the elaborate packaging warrants. This is no easier than just tossing some grounds in a regular coffee maker with a filter, or using a French Press, and either of those methods will result in a good cup of Joe.<br /><br />The flavor of the coffee was good, hence the 3 stars, but the coffee was weak and trying to brew it was a bother. I would not purchase this product.

review/summary: I like it
review/text: There are some witty little things about Bob Marley's dad on the package, that make you kinda feel like you are "livin' the dream" alongside the Marley's just by sippin' on a cuppa joe.  This actually struck an emotional chord with me.  I like the idea of helping others achieve/live/enjoy their dreams.<br /><br />But the flavor of this brew didn't really match up to my locally freshly roasted coffee beans.  In fact, I even preferred some whole bean stuff that Kroger made.<br /><br />I understand that there is a world of difference between the Marley Pods and actual beans that you grind.  I took this into account when I gave the product 4 stars.  I like the Marley Organic, and I'm keen on Organics anyway..  But I don't think I'll be buying it again.  At the current price of .67 per unit I can throw out a half pot of freshly roasted coffee and still save money... I'm not sure that the convenience of using a pod is worth the premium.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I am jumping on the bandwagon with all of those reviewers who said this coffee is weak. I am disappointed that the Marley name is on this. I used two of these pods to make two cups of coffee. Yuck! Not only did it taste terrible, but it was incredibly weak. From my standpoint, you would need to use a minimum of two of these per cup of coffee. And that would probably have to be demitasse size to have it taste worthwhile. There also was none of that wonderful coffee aroma that you get with a good coffee.<br /><br />To make matters worse, there are no instructions on the box to tell you how much to use. I wasn't sure if it was my drip coffeemaker or not, but my guess is that the water would have to soak like a teabag. This is a case where you have to sacrifice convenience and go with regular coffee grounds. Not recommended.

review/summary: Good, tasty coffee. The grind works in an EkoBrew cup for Keurig as well.
review/text: I use a Keurig brewer, so when I brew this coffee I just snip open a pouch and dump it into my Ekobrew (reusable, refillable coffee cup for Keurig brewers).<br /><br />This is good, strong coffee. The sticker says "exotic floral and berry". I didn't detect this, really -- It has a bold flavor and you can definitely taste the medium roast. I'm not a coffee connoisseur (just drink it because it tastes good, and wakes me up), but I think this stuff has good flavor.<br /><br />I like this stuff because it's organic, Fair Trade, and the Marley coffee company also kicks back some of the proceeds from coffee sales to a cool sports-themed children's charity.<br /><br />It's a bit expensive for my taste, but it's flavorful and ethically produces by a hip company. So  give it a shot!

review/summary: 4 experiments, 4 different tastes
review/text: I drink 2 cups of coffee from a Mr. Coffee each morning. I prefer the medium roast and like to smooth it by using creamer or milk to cut the bitterness. If I want something hot later on a winter day, I make some tea. I read others comments before trying this brand so I would know how to compare my taste with others.<br /><br />First experiment: I made one cup of coffee using one pouch. I liked the smooth taste and did not have to add creamer. It was weak. But the more I thought about it the more I recognized that this was just like drinking tea. So I think a tea lover would enjoy this as a different flavor.<br /><br />Second experiment: I made a second cup of coffee by piling a new pouch on the one I had used previously. Now the coffee was definitely stronger. It was still very smooth. I would rate this as a medium strength but on the light side.<br /><br />Third experiment: I made two cups of coffee using one pouch plus a scoop of my regular coffee. This tasted just like my normal coffee but retained the smoothness so I did not need creamer. So this may be the answer for those who wanted more flavor.<br /><br />Fourth experiment: I brewed two cups of coffee using one pouch. Then I moved the pouch to the carafe and squeezed it about 6 times. The coffee darkened noticeably and got a stronger flavor. This turned out to be the most satisfying for my taste.

review/summary: Nice Cup Of Coffee In A Convenient Pack!
review/text: I don't drink coffee every day, more like once or twice a week, and when I do I prefer a mild cup of coffee. I like good flavor but not too bold, and not bitter. Basically, I would opt for a Dunkin before a Starbucks, just to give you an idea of what I normally drink as I review Marley One Love Coffee.<br /><br />The box contains 15 single serving pods, individually sealed in foil. Each pod contains about 1/3 of an ounce of coffee. They are very convenient for storage or taking on the road. The cardboard box has a cutout near the bottom to easily dispense the pods (or you can just open the box from the top). The coffee is advertised as "100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe."<br /><br />I typically make my coffee in a Keurig or a standard coffee maker/filter. I tried One Love four ways, ONLY ONE OF WHICH IS THE RECOMMENDED USE, as the coffee is advertised as "for use only in single serve home coffee pod brewers". Why did I order this coffee without said pod brewer? When I travel I find more and more hotels have pod brewers, so I am interested in a good coffee to use on the road. Anyway, I made the coffee:<br /><br />1) In a single serve brewer, a Black and Decker Brew N Go,<br />2) By filling a Keurig reusable K-Cup/filter.<br />2) In my standard coffee maker, a Braun, using the pods in the same amount/weight as I would any loose coffee.<br />3) Steeping a pod in a coffee mug, approximately 7 1/2 ounces in size.<br /><br />Unlike many coffees, where I think "Wow that smells really good", only to be disappointed by the flavor, Marley One Love hit me just the opposite. When I smelled the unused pod, as well as the brewing coffee, I thought "Hmmm, that doesn't smell too great." But wow, the result is a really nice cup of coffee. One Love is not at all bitter, and I wouldn't even call it bold. It is mild to medium in taste, while not being weak at all. I found I got the best results using it in the Keuring or regular coffee makers. Steeping it was OK, but it was somewhat weaker that way.<br /><br />I would get this coffee again, either loose in the bag or in pods.

review/text: Usually, I'm a fan of a very deep, dark roasted coffee, with a full-bodied, smooth flavor. This coffee is a very deep flavored mild bodied coffee. I'm usually not a fan of mild coffees but, this is one that I like to drink at night if I want a cup.<br /><br />These are individual pods, for making one cup of coffee. I like the handyness of just grabbing one to take to work to use in my single cup drip coffee maker.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this coffee for anyone that likes a deep flavored coffee. Though, if you like a deep roasted coffee, such as a French roast you might think this one is a bit too weak for your morning java.

review/text: If you appreciate coffee with a social conscience and you want a delicious light blend, this is for you. The little pods are fine for making a 4 oz coffee but anything larger will be too pale for most people's taste. So, while the coffee is very good, you will likely need to use two of the bags to get your morning buzz. The packaging is an entertaining read that gives you snippets about the Marley family and the origin of the coffee. Plan on waking up to a lovely day while your supply lasts.

I'm used to Starbucks coffee, as well as the occasional Pete's coffee, as well had coffee in France, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands.  On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being strongest coffee, this Marley brand coffee is like a 2.  Weaker than the old-style McDonald's coffee (before McCafe's came about).  Weaker than instant coffee.<br /><br />I'm sure there are other flavors and nuances to this coffee, but I honestly can't get past the weak flavor.  Perhaps, if you like weak coffee, this may be for you, and maybe the organic process leaches stuff out, but for me, this one's not to my taste.<br /><br />At least the flavor's not bitter.

review/text: The first thing you will notice with Marley Coffee is it smells really good.  Unfortunately once you brew it is not as strong as I would like it, but still a serviceable coffee.  These are single pod coffee packages, individually wrapped to keep them fresh until you use them with fifteen per box.  And even though it does not mean anything for the overall taste, the packaging is attractive with a slit you can make at the bottom of the box to remove the pods (or just open the top normally is you like).  Just do not ask me what it has to do with Bob Marley.

This is the best cup of pod coffee I have tasted so far.<br /><br />In addition to the pod brewer, I also tried this coffee pod in a pour-through basket with boiling water and also steeping it like a cup of tea and found that the flavor was pretty consistent, if not better when brewed outside of the pod brewer (I was able to steep the coffee much stronger and to higher yield in a cup with boiling water -but slower than the pod brewer).  The pods are marked with which side up/down and should be tucked down tight in the pod brewer for the best results.  Each pod is individually wrapped airtight, and tasted as fresh as any other pre-ground or pod coffee I have tried.  Sustainably grown.

review/summary: Decent coffee
review/text: As the description says: this is for single-serve "pod" type brewers, and it will be quite the pain to use if you're using a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee. Keep that in mind...<br /><br />Now, to the coffee: it was good in a 6-8oz brew, with the flavors being pretty much as described. However, at 15 pods to a pack, this a week's worth of coffee if you drink a 15 oz mug every morning, as I do. So, while it is a good coffee when made properly, the value just is not there for me with this product.<br /><br />If you're okay with that, because you see value added by the social marketing related to this product, then go for it.<br /><br />If you're just after good coffee, you can probably get just as good a cup with a different brand for a little less.

review/summary: Coffee that hits the spot
review/text: This product makes a great cup of coffee. Just pour boiling water into the cup containing the coffee bag and let it steep for three minutes. I used about eight ounce per bag. Some reviewers have complained that coffee was weak, but by limiting the amount of hot water you can control the strength of the coffee. I found about eight ounce of boiling water per bag would be sufficient.  In this age of flavored coffee make sure that you are willing to try other brands. This is an Ethiopian coffee, if you are not used to this brand it may take a while get used to the taste of this coffee.<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TIR38I">White Coffee Kahlua French Vanilla Gourmet Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GIL650">Gourmet Ground Coffee from Costa Rica.

review/summary: Great pod coffee
review/text: I received this trial coffee pod and the bonus was the organic part of this product.  I heated up a 10 oz of hot water and placed this pod in the hot water.  After simmering about 5 min., I would enjoy my organic cup of coffee.  This might be stronger if I had a pod like coffee machine but I didn't want to have another appliance in my house.  Overall, if I had a pod machine, I would purchase this product.  Of course, I liked that this product was fair trade and grown without pesticides.

review/summary: Yeah, I can't use these...
review/text: Receiving coffee pods was a first for me.  I wasn't quite sure what to do with these.  I don't have a pod coffee machine and so I initially thought that I could use these pods much like you would a tea bag.  I steeped it in my boiling water and then smelled the rich aroma and gulped down murky flavored fiery hot water.  It was bland and unappealing.  I've read that you can empty the contents into a conventional coffee machine and use it that way, but it would take a lot of pods to equal out a pot of coffee, and I don't have a conventional coffee maker so that wouldn't help me much.  I actually snatched this up because I thought I could make this like tea, and I wouldn't need a coffee maker.  It smells amazing, but like some other reviewers here, the pod process is a bit of a stumbling block.  I know that they make coffee makers specifically for these pods, but I can't see myself rushing out to buy one.  Just be aware before you buy that this may not be what you are bargaining for.  I do use these pods though, in my cooking.  They serve as a wonderful way to flavor stock and I'll simmer them when preparing different meat dishes.  Coffee is a great flavoring tool, and so I actually like these pods for that.  I recently cut one of these pods open and crusted pork with the contents.  It was wonderful.

review/text: If you like a light-flavored coffee, you will probably go for this one for convenience as well as flavor.<br /><br />It is in coffee bags (like tea bags) so you never need to make more than one cup at a time.  The bags are round, which makes it steep better than square bags.  There is no string on the bags to leach coffee from the cup onto the surface where you are steeping it.<br /><br />I shared this with friends.  Upon opening the packaging for the bag, every single one commented on the wonderful smell.  All those who liked a mild coffee described the flavor as SMOOOOOOTH.

review/summary: Robust coffee heaven in a cup (made with a Keurig)
review/text: This review is based on brewing with a Keurig using a reusable plastic kcup. I use a Keurig for my morning coffee on work days because it's fast and can make a decent strong cup with the right brand k-cup, like Emeril's Bold. Since I've been wanting to try Marley's coffee anyway, I thought I'd get these pods, open one, and pour the contents into the reusable plastic kcup that I bought on Amazon. And it worked!<br /><br />This coffee, when brewed as above in a Keurig on the medium cup size, produces a deep, rich, robust cup of coffee heaven. There's no bitterness,  just smooth, rich, deep flavor with a slight acidic tingle. It's not the blend for someone who likes light to medium blends. This is for the stout-hearted coffee drinkers only. I plan on buying a bag of beans and brewing them in my regular Cloer coffeemaker.

review/text: I will say that I was a bit skeptical when I first got the coffee pods, having tried several, various other pods in the past that were less than what anyone would expect for the price. However, to my pleasant surprise, the Marley Coffee was VERY GOOD. It has a very organic taste to it, with slight floral overtones and a smooth finish, no bitter aftertaste. I use the pods in my SENSEO coffee machine and the pods work quite well with it, producing a glorious crema every time. I would recommend this coffee, especially to owners of the SENSEO. Marley Coffee is good stuff!

review/summary: Good Stuff!  .....but you will need a packet brewer for it...
review/text: Vine is such a great innovation to get one to try or discover things they otherwise would most likely never become acquainted with.<br /><br />This is very good coffee, but the fact that it is one of the packet varieties leaves the necessity to have one of the brewers designed for such in order to obtain the correct results. I found a really inexpensive Mr. Coffee here for under $20 that I can "always" use to keep on hand in my seldom used cupboard above my fridge so it is available but out of the way. In lieu of this solution, I would suggest perhaps a french press setup that one could really squeeze the packet in order to get the full benefit of the ingredient....which, by the way, is an excellent Ethiopian yirgacheffe, totally organic (yeah), and of medium strength....just right (for me at least) on those yellow-sunshiny-mornings that seem to be quite frequent here in my area of the country of late. Back deck, wonderful spring sunshine, a croissant and a cup of this yummy brew is perfect for starting a beautiful April Day!<br /><br />Many have complained here about the strength, etc., but they are not processing the packets properly, thus I would recommend discounting most of those reviews. This really is great coffee....you are hearing this from a lifelong coffee-hound who appreciates almost all blends and harvests of beans from the world over. Trust me, Ethiopian is one of the Very Best Beans, along with Kenyan and Sumatran....all three of them are unbeatable for a "true" coffee-lover!<br /><br />Enjoy this exceptional coffee.......(while you're at it, give a few thoughts to it's Namesake...Bob Marley...it will further brighten your day.<br /><br />~operabruin

That being said, these Marley pods make a nice cup of coffee when used with a pod system.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, these pods are probably not going to get good results with anything other than a pod brewer. I use a Keurig at home, so like others I'm going to take these on trips to use in the hotel brewers.<br /><br />If you like a lighter blend, the Marley Yirgacheffe is a good choice.

I made the coffee in more than just the coffee pod, including taking the grinds out of the pod and putting them through my own filter, but the result was still the same--the taste was forgettable.<br /><br />The packaging, like I said, was marvelous, but each packet had to be opened with scissors because there was no tear cut. Just a little thing, but noticeable.<br /><br />If you like want organic coffee and you like Ethiopian beans, this is still a good option over other non-organic pods.

review/text: I actually googled this, so bear with me.  This is Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, not Ethiopian Harrar, which apparently is different.  "Yirgacheffe is known for its orange flower scent."  Having never smelled an orange flower, I couldn't tell you.  What I can tell you is that is Ethiopian that isn't burned like that well-known chain's version.  It also has cute life-affirming things on the box like, "Profits donated to sport", which is probably more meaningful if you live somewhere where they use "sport" as a noun.<br /><br />It can also be cold brewed, and I think I almost like it better that way.  The caffeine kick isn't quite what I expected, but then, this isn't that chain's Ethiopian, either.

review/summary: OK Coffee - Wasteful, Escessive Packaging
review/text: I found the coffee in a single serving pod to be pretty weak for an 8 oz cup.  Since I don't have this style of coffee maker, I opened the pods and poured them directly into the coffee filters I normally use to make coffee.  Two packages makes a pretty tasty, full bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />My biggest concern with this product was the incredible amount of packaging for very little product.  15 small pouches of coffee, wrapped up like tea bags, each one individually packaged in a foil packet which are all placed in a fairly large box.  The box is wonderfully designed with multi-colored, foil embossed design (it would probably make a great gift for your favorite Bob Marley fan), but the amount of packaging is unbelievably excessive for, maybe, six or seven ounces of coffee.  The elaborate declarations of "fair trade," "ethical treatment of farm workers," "biodiversity" and "sustainable cultivation" (among other first world catchphrases) ring hollow for me.  This all may be true but it's hard not to be cynical and slightly suspicious of the true motivations for the lofty rhetoric on the box.<br /><br />The company's declaration of "we believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial," sounds absurd when compared to the amount of waste in the packaging of their product.  How pure can it really be after it has gone through this much processing?

review/text: This Marley Coffee has a beautiful strong aroma before brewing, like fresh ground beans, I am amazed it smells so good and strong then brews up very mild, almost weak, but that sounds like a negative and that's not what I mean, I drink a lot of coffee and have for years and love a strong brew most the time, this coffee is so mild I can drink it plain. I usually like a splash of cream, or lately a dab of honey.  So I give it a four, because it may not be as strong as I like but comes in individual packets so stays fresh, portable for my frequent camping/hiking trips, brews up to a taste that can be sipped plain, and organic with a amazing pre-brew aroma.

review/summary: A promising coffee!
review/text: I am a lover of coffee and will try almost any coffee product once. I own a coffee pod maker at work, and I have been using Senseo's medium roast and espresso pods for a few months, but after trying Marley Coffee, I do not think I can go back to Senseo. I am not demeaning Senseo's quality, but I am certainly highlighting my preference for Marley Coffee. I will admit that when it comes to pod coffee, I do not expect much, and that's probably why I have stuck to only one brand; Marley Coffee, however, went beyond my expectations. I like my coffee strong; therefore, I recommend one pours no more than 6 oz. per pod for a strong flavor (this is coming from a person who drinks `straight' coffee; I never add other ingredients or sweeteners)). On a side note, there was no particular exotic/fruity taste to this coffee, but the overall quality met my expectations and passed the "will continue to buy" test. Other perks: it's organic, natural, and tasty, which, in my book, is worth the price.

Alternatively, you can add hot water to a cup and mess with the pouch with a spoon, use a French press, or a small drip coffee maker.

For traveling, these will be perfect when you want just a cup and don't want to go out or go to a lot of trouble.

review/text: I took the box of Marley Coffee pods to work for a group tasting.  The general consensus was that the coffee is very good - 4 stars!  Common terms used by my taste testing group included: light, hints of citrus, crisp, acidic, and brisk.  One close friend admired the clean taste and commented on how well this would go with a cheesecake or similar heavy dessert.  I couldn't agree more.  The pods worked perfectly in our office's Senseo machine, and we all enjoyed the chat and the coffee.  For the price listed, most of my friends, and I, agree this is well worth the cost.  Given that it's organic and free-trade, the cost is very good.  I normally only use coffee that is grown and traded under these circumstances.  I would highly recommend trying this coffee if you enjoy types such as breakfast blend from other coffee companies.

review/summary: Good coffee, but needs to be made strong
review/text: Like many others, I don't actually have a pod coffee machine. I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014CVEH6">Melitta Ready Set Joe Single Cup Coffee Brewer</a>. The first cup of coffee I made with this was very weak. By dropping the bag directly into the coffee and swishing it around tea bag style, I was able to get a stronger flavor. For my second cup, I just cut open the pod, dumped in the grounds and only let it drip until the color started to lighten. That made for a good cup of coffee.<br /><br />The Marley One Love coffee is an Ethipian Yirgacheffe, which is supposed to be a pretty reputable bean, and it delivers a good coffee. Properly prepared, it is full bodied, with only a slight hint of bitterness - much better than some other highly recommended coffees that I've tried. And the amount of coffee in the packet is just right for a strong standard cup of coffee if you prepare it right - only dripping through until the drip starts to get light. However, it sounds like some people using standard pod coffee makers are getting week coffee and my experience with my first cup indicates the water goes through the pod casing too fast, not giving the grounds a chance to get truly wet so that the water drips through them too quickly and doesn't carry enough of the flavor. So I would say that there's good coffee inside but maybe the delivery process needs work.<br /><br />If you're using a proper pod coffee maker, you're on your own. But if you're looking for something better than the office brew, the contents of the 67 cent pouch are great for using in other single cup setups. 4 stars for the coffee, but 1 star off since it sounds like my roundabout way of making a cup gets better results than the easy way the pod is supposed to provide for.

review/text: When I selected this, the description at the time did not say it was pods, or I would not have chosen it. I don't have a pod coffee maker (as much as I think they are adorable!)<br /><br />I just started drinking coffee beverages last year, I've always hated the taste of coffee but found I can stand it with cream and some flavored syrup (thanks McDonald's and Starbucks!). Cost being what it is, we started making these drinks at home, with coffee we bought at the store or Sam's. (Folgers and the like) So, since I'm a coffee newbie, I'm not up on all the varieties and tastes and roasts, and just thought that all coffee was the same.<br /><br />I brewed up a small batch of coffee in my pot, using one pod and 2 cups of water. I took a sip of the coffee before putting anything in it and I was shocked that I actually liked the taste of this. Normally coffee is so bitter and strong tasting to me, but this had a sweet floral-tinged taste to it. When I made my usual cream/syrup contribution to it, I found that the background taste was wonderful! It was so smooth and didn't have any kind of bitter aftertaste as I am accustomed to when making coffee.<br /><br />The package is pretty enough that you could give this as a gift to a coffee lover! I would serve this to company and be proud that it tastes better than the Folgers I normally have. This was a nice surprise, and opened up my taste buds to the possibility of better quality coffee than I am used to.

review/summary: Marley "One Love" organic coffee pods: Better than a cup from the donut shop
review/text: Marley "One Love" organic coffee pods are targeted at hip people who like Bob Marley, only need to brew one cup of coffee at a time, have pod-compatible coffee makers like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a>, and prefer organic coffee for health reasons (no pesticides, more antioxidants), political reasons (you support the organic foods movement), or aesthetic reasons (no bad-tasting additives, you like the cool packaging). It is advertised as 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee -- Yirgacheffe is a coffee-growing region in Ethiopia, and Ethiopian coffee in general is known for its fruity or wine-like notes.<br /><br />My impressions? Be warned that I am not a coffee connoisseur and I don't have a pod coffee maker. I brewed one cup in a mug in the microwave, which I subsequently turned into a reasonably satisfying cafe mocha. I cold-brewed several additional cups by letting pods soak in water for 18-24 hours (6oz water/pod), which I drank cold with ice, milk, and sugar. I found the cold-brewed iced coffees to be very tasty, clearly better than the cups I've made with the much-cheaper <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1KJO">Folgers Classic Roast Coffee Singles, 19-Count Single Servings (Pack of 6)</a> for example.<br /><br />Are the pods worth 67 cents apiece? Well, you're not going to find a better cup of coffee at the donut shop around the corner for 67 cents. Beyond that ... you're going to have to try it yourself.

review/summary: Okay, for a not very strong coffee
review/text: I like my coffee kind of medium, not too strong, not too weak, and these pods made fairly weak coffee.  I compare them to my own home made pods (using the "Ecopad"  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007INM5A/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details) which I use in my Senseo, and I was fairly disappointed.  It was easy to see that the Marley Coffee Pods made much weaker coffee (lighter color, almost watery appearance).  I think I will stick with my Ecopad coffee pods.<br /><br />Incidentally, I want to put in a good word here for the Senseo coffee maker.  It is great for making a single cup of coffee (or maybe even a few cups of coffee but not at the same time).  The Ecopad pods are just as economical as regular coffee (you just spoon ground coffee into the Ecopad and make coffee as usual).

review/text: I didn't realize this was a single brew coffee.  However, I cut open four of the filter packs and used it in my drip coffee maker.  It worked beautifully.  Delicious coffee!  Ahhhh....I love coffee.  I would compare the quality of taste to that of Starbuck's dark roast.  It may taste differently if used the intended way.<br />If you have a single brewer, this is definitely coffee you will want to try.  Or, if you're like me, I will be taking some of these individually wrapped foil pouches with me on my next trip.  They will work great in the hotel' room's coffee maker--You know, they never do give you enough coffee for those things.

review/summary: A Work of Art
review/text: The box containing Marley Coffee Single Serve Pods is exquisite -- a work of art. The description of the product is fascinating. There is one little problem though. Nowhere on the package or on the individual packets can I find instructions as to the way to use the product. I determined that information by experimentation.<br /><br />The square packets inside are also works of art. There is only one little problem with them: the absence of a notch in the edge to make it easy to tear the packet open. When I manage to open  a packet with a knife, the aroma takes me away. Every time I open one, the marvelous flavor makes me rush to make the coffee, which is as good as it smells.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: So I must admit that when I ordered this coffee, I thought it was one of the new fancy instants like Starbucks now has.  When I got it and found that it was pods, for which I do not have a maker, I almost sent it back.  But what I wanted it for was those afternoon coffee emergencies at work, where single serves would be perfect. Soooo - I used one of the pods like a tea bag, steeped it in very hot water...and ended up with a great cup of coffee!<br /><br />The flavor is very rich and fruity - not over burnt or weak like I would have expected given my McGyver-type preparation.  I enjoyed the coffee a great deal and will keep this at my desk for more than just emergencies.

review/summary: Great Coffee (from a non-coffee drinker)!
review/text: I'll admit outright that I don't normally like coffee.  I'm a big drinker of hot tea though (and that's usually what I drink).  The only coffee I've ever had seemed terrible to me (then again, cheap crappy coffee probably really is terrible).  I wouldn't have normally ordered this, but the description sounded so nice and tasty that I decided to give it a try.  I went in not expecting to like it much though.<br /><br />So, I pulled out my boyfriend's tiny coffee pot to brew up some of this coffee.  The first thing that struck me as nice was that each packet of coffee is individually sealed, and each packet is contained in its own little filter (which is very convenient).  When I first brewed up a batch, I accidentally brewed it too weak (I made about 4 cups when the directions say to only make 1 cup).  I liked it a lot anyway; it reminded me of my favorite blend of carob tea.  To be fair to the coffee, though, I decided to brew it again following the directions properly.  It came out stronger (and I didn't enjoy the coffee bitterness as much) but it was still good.  I was able to drink it with only sugar and no creamer to dilute it's flavor.  I must say that in my limited experience, this is the best coffee I've ever tasted, but I think that I much prefer a light brew coffee.<br /><br />So, this is a great coffee for people who don't normally drink coffee.  Would a coffee lover actually enjoy it?  Well, if you like a really strong bitter coffee, then you really wouldn't care for this.  If you like a light or medium strength coffee, then you'll really love this one.  If you are just starting out with coffee drinking, this would be a good one to try out to ease you into it.  I liked it well enough that I'd even consider drinking it regularly along with my tea!  So, if any of this sounds appealing to you, go ahead and give it a try!

review/summary: Surprisingly good brew.
review/text: This coffee smells a bit like Starbuck's Breakfast Blend, but it doesn't taste anywhere near as strong which, in my opinion, is preferred.  There isn't, however, any guidance whatsover on the box regarding preparation.  Thus, when I made my first mug of Marley Coffee, I wasn't sure how much water I was supposed to use or how much time I was supposed to wait, so I chucked in two packets and let them steep for two minutes.  The result tasted fine; not the best I'd ever had, but good enough for a sample run.  My second go with the coffee was a bit more involved, but met with better brewing results.  My household had run out of ground coffee, so I cut open several Marley packets to use in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S4DI2S">Technivorm Moccamaster Coffee Brewer With Thermo Carafe - Technivorm 9587</a>.  I measured out coffee as I usually would with a scoop and brewed it up.  My wife and I both enjoyed the result.  I would get this product again.

review/text: Wasn't expecting much but these pods make smooth lattes. I used the pods in my Krups psuedo esspresso machine. They worked fine. The coffee came out great. Add some milk and froth it, and you have one smooth latte. No mess, easy clean up. The pods smell pretty strong when you open the individual packet so that's a good sign. I also made some for friends just using the pods like tea bags. They were happy and said it was smooth coffee. So you have several options how to use them. I just might be buying more though I am usually a grind my own beans kind of guy.

Each portion was more than the spoonfull I might have used, very generous portion, and made a grea tasting smooth brew with just the right amount of bitternss that even my wife commented on the taste being "really good". I did the same on Sunday morning and diluted the amount to almost half strength and it still more than held its own as a great tasting brew. Don't know if I would use it as a replacement to the one I use consistently but would most definetly buy it as a replacement if I was unable to find my brand.

review/summary: Marley Coffee is tasty but needed a lot of trial and error to make it
review/text: I selected Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count based solely on a five sentence blurb in the amazon.com/VINE offering to me in its monthly newsletter to sample and to review. There were no instructions on how to prepare the brew. I did not worry. I expected the shipped coffee to contain enough instructions on arrival. It did not.<br /><br />If, however, I had gone to the non-VINE website of Amazon I would have received a clue how to brew the coffee: "Directions<br />For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers."<br /><br />I don't own a "single server home coffee pod brewer," so the test was going to prove difficult at best, although I did not think so at the time.<br /><br />Then came in the mail an attractively packaged, colorful cardboard box, full of small print texts extolling various aspects of the product with Lion of Judah logo, photo of a Rastafarian man and a statement from musician Bob Marley about how he had founded his organic coffee and tea company as a tribute to his father who had come from Nine Mile, Jamaica.<br /><br />Very instructive. But no brewing instructions anywhere. I scissored open the air-sealed plastic cover for one of the 15 small pods enclosed of ground coffee. No instructions.<br /><br />Here are the various ways I went about making Marley coffee:<br /><br />(1) Were these 15 like similar pods I had seen in motels with DIY coffee makers?Where you toss pods in a plastic  filter and add hot water into the back of the machine. Then throw a switch. Expect two cups of coffee to emerge. So I scissored open four plastic bags, detecting in the process a beyond faint aroma that I had years earlier come to associate with kidneys for breakfast in bed and breakfasts in Ireland. I tossed four pods into my Mr. Coffee Machine<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041847R4">Mr. Coffee CG12 12-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, White</a> and added enough water in my to make eight cups of coffee. No paper filter. Result: tasty, several ingredients detected. Very weak!<br /><br />(2) After discussion with my wife, I next decided to make a mere two cups of coffee using only two pods in Mr. Coffee, this time placing a paper filter beneath the pods. Same initial urine smell. Same good taste. Stronger.<br /><br />(3) Still my wife and I, in the absence of written instructions, decided there must be a simpler, cleaner way. We next treated a pod as if it were a single serving tea bag -- minus a string. We therefore put one pod in a coffee mug and poured boiling water over it. Same Irish kidneys smell. Decent taste when done. Rather a mess, however, fishing out the pod with a spoon.<br /><br />Bottom line: even when weak, Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count offered a strikingly better than average taste. I would drink it again if only I had the right equipment.<br /><br />-OOO-

The pods of course are ultra convenient, but I would quibble with the fact that the individual pouches do NOT have a notch in them for easy opening. I have to cut each pouch with a pair of scissors.

review/summary: Nutty and Intense
review/text: First impressions of this coffee was not positive as the box contains no instructions what-so-ever as to what kind of coffee-maker is required for these pods. Additionally there is no mention of how much water to use with each pod, or whether it is a single or four cup serving.<br /><br />HOWEVER... Once that was settled (It is recommended between 6oz and 8oz of water per pod and it can be used in any traditional drip coffee machine, or used in the same fashion as a tea bag)... I was ultimately surprised and delighted at how dark and rich the resulting coffee looked. I brewed it at full strength the first time, to see what its got. I don't normally like my coffee super strong, but I was overwhelmed with the delicious aroma of this product. The first waft was clearly rich and nutty, although the packaging says exotic floral and berry. The taste was beyond anything I could hope for. I was shocked at how much flavor this coffee contained since it is also very smooth without being bitter. The second time I brewed this coffee, using the tea bag method and hot water, I actually let it soak until I was finished dressing for work, so around 15 minutes or so. Keep in mind I do not usually care for coffee that is overpoweringly strong, but the addition time only created a more intense flavor and aroma which, after only two experiences with it, I found myself craving a repeat experience. I added a little Splenda and plain creamer to it and rather than masking the flavor, the coffee-nutty-berry flavor came through with perfection.<br /><br />All in all I would say this coffee has performed better than any other brand of coffee I have had my hands on in the last year or two... which is saying something since I am considered fairly obsessed with quality coffee. The price is around sixty-three cents per cup and is MORE than worth it!!

review/summary: Good if you like Coffee
review/text: This coffee is moderate in flavor (not to weak, not too strong) and I would recommend it to coffee drinkers who want a flavor in that range. It is "coffee flavored coffee", in other words, no fancy flavoring. Being organic, it is (hopefully) sans all of the nasty chemicals that tend to get added. I want to note I used it unconventionally. I cut the packets open and ran it through a regular coffee maker. Five packets for a 12 cup pot. Came out just fine doing that. If you're looking for organic coffee, this one will do nicely.<br /><br />My only real issue is the packets do not have an easy open to get the little coffee bag out. I had to use scissors. That might make you mad if you're jonesing for that cup of coffee to wake up in the morning.

review/summary: Coffee good. Packaging not.
review/text: When I chose the Marley Coffee and Tea One Love coffee, I did not realize they came in "pods". (I don't even know what a pod brewer is and wikipedia was no help.) The box containing the coffee does not have any instructions as to how to brew the pod. When I researched the Marley website, it referred only to pod brewing. So, with only an espresso machine in my possession, I decided to be inventive and brew the pods that way.<br /><br />I like my coffee STRONG, and I found that 1 pod was too weak for my usual morning cup. If I can see through the coffee, it's not strong enough. Two pods are perfect; I just jam both into the ground holder. The taste is smooth, dark, slightly bitter, but still enjoyable and makes for a nice caffeine buzz. It's 100% organic and Fair Trade-very important to me. With the grounds contained in pods, it is easier to remove and keep the ground holder clean.<br /><br />The downside of the pod coffee is the separate foil packaging for each individual pod. I would prefer it packaged as a group in the box, like tea bags. However, the company does offer bags of beans which I find more preferable than ground coffee in a pod.

review/summary: Pretty good, if you have the right brewer
review/text: I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy a good cup of coffee (with creamer) every now and then.  While I did not like the aroma of the organic coffee pod straight out of the foil pack (the box says it is 'Exotic Floral and Berry' whatever that is), I did enjoy the taste of the brewed coffee, once I figured out how to brew it.  Like others, I was unaware these were for 'pod' brewers, although this has been since updated to state in the product description.<br /><br />In fact, the box has NO instructions whatsoever.  I had to come back to Amazon to find out about using 8oz of water per cup.  A little less Marley/Jamacia on the box, and a few more instructions would be helpful.<br /><br />Since I don't own a pod brewer, I tried using a pod in my 'cup at a time' brewer.  All I got was slightly flavored hot water.  Not recommended.  Next I tried brewing one directly in a cup by adding boiling water.  While I got flavor, I also got sediment and aftertaste.  Again, not the recommended method.  Finally, I tried snipping open a pod and just using the loose grounds in my 'cup at a time' brewer with a standard paper filter.  I realize this is not the way the manufacture intended their product to be used, but as I said, since I was unaware this product was for 'pod' coffee makers, it was the best I had to work with.<br /><br />At last, I got to taste Marley's Organic Coffee in a good way.  Overall, I did like the taste (I drink mine with creamer).  Although I have to admit that I would not buy these at such a high price for just 15 cups of coffee.  Maybe if I had a pod brewer, I would.  But I really don't taste that much different to any other cup of good coffee.  As I said, I am not a coffee connoisseur, just someone who enjoys a good cup on occasion.<br /><br />This box of Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee includes 15 individually foil wrapped coffee pods, so that each cup will be as fresh as the last.

review/summary: Good smooth coffee for the right machine
review/text: My husband and I both enjoyed this coffee, it was smooth and easy to drink. I especially enjoyed it with a little bit of almond milk, it was perfect. I'm usually not much of a coffee drinker, I need it sweet or extremely smooth, so I was happy to find that this coffee was not as bitter as most. For those who need a nice, fresh easy coffee, I think this is perfect.<br /><br />It's important to note that these packets are for pod brewers, not your regular 8-10 cup coffee maker. They come conveniently packaged and my first thought upon opening them was that they're perfect for the small business! Hotels, bed & breakfasts, small offices, etc would all love this style of coffee that is convenient and individually made. I would definitely recommend it for someone in need of a good coffee for use at their small business. But also if you're a 1-cup a day sort of drinker, or someone who occasionally likes to make a very small pot of coffee--this is the perfect set up for you!

review/summary: I had to improvise but I LOVED it
review/text: By improvising I mean that I have no coffeemaker other than my humble gold mesh basket that fits into a cup. So I put the pod into the bottom of the basket, added a little water to pre-prime it -- and then added hot water. With a soup spoon I imitated the process that a coffeemaker that uses pods would do: I pressed the spoon into the pod several times, and VOILA!! A WONDERFUL brew emerged in the cup. I enjoyed a cuppa with NO residual stomach acid and no bitterness -- I didn't even need sugar. Later, I added some soy milk and the taste was just as enjoyable.<br /><br />I liked reading the dedication on the box. This coffee was grown with care, and lovingly dedicated to an incredible individual, Bob Marley.<br /><br />Even though I will continue to have to improvise when brewing this coffee, I look forward to enjoying every single pod.

review/summary: OK coffee, but there are better alternatives
review/text: I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find "burnt", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars.

review/summary: Good coffee, good price, NOT for a Keurig!
review/text: First, I have to admit that when I was offered this coffee to review, I saw that there were 15 single serve pods and assumed that meant it was for a Keurig. Not so. Apparently there are actual coffeemakers that take these pods. Duh.<br /><br />I received them and had to do a bit of maneuvering to actually USE them, but it worked out fine. I just cut open the pod and put the coffee into one of my reusable Keurig cups and it brewed perfectly. I would imagine they would also work well in the proper machine ;)<br /><br />The coffee itself is a tad more bitter than I normally like, but that's just my own taste. I was able to try the medium roast, so I would personally go for the light, if possible. The flavor is great and I absolutely love that it's Fair Trade Certified, Organic, AND that partial sales are put towards youth soccer programs (kicksforcause.org). I love me some Dunkin Donuts coffee, but they are definitely not fair trade, organic, or donating any of their money.<br /><br />The packaging is perfect for the pods and the box is actually quite attractive.<br /><br />If you have a pod coffeemaker, I would definitely recommend this coffee for it's taste and the company's moral values. If you're buying pods anyways, you might as well make it from a company that offers portions of their money to charity and pays it's workers well!<br /><br />I was impressed!

review/text: Bob Marley's son Rohan, besides being a noted athlete and musician, is also a successful entrepreneur, having started "Marley Coffee," the maker of "Marley Coffee, Stir It Up, Exotic Floral and Berry, One Love, Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffee," (fifteen single serve pods).<br /><br />Everyone in my family tried some of the coffee this morning and the results were generally very good; "smooth" x3, "nutty," x2, "nice taste," "I like mine a little stronger."  Pretty good comments from these life long coffee drinkers.  No one gushed that they were going to rush out and place another order, however.<br /><br />Bob Marley's name has been used to sell lots of things Bob probably wouldn't have endorsed while he was alive. To his credit, Rohan's signature actually appears on the outside of the box, so he is not technically appropriating his father's name.  He is asserting his own name and standing behind the product himself.<br /><br />Several of the drinker's this morning were hoping for a little THC mellow-out over their bacon and eggs.  Didn't happen.  However, everyone agreed that this coffee (which curiously doesn't smell that attractive before the pod is brewed) is worthy of the high-end packaging and its Ethiopian (and Jamacian) heritage.

review/summary: Delicious coffee - convenient single serving - size pods..
review/text: This medium strength coffee has a rich, full bodied, pure coffee flavor.<br />And the single cup serving pods couldn't be more convenient.<br /><br />With many family's becoming more health conscious,<br />this organicly grown coffee is just the kind of product thats needed.<br /><br />We found this coffee to be wonderfully aromatic while brewing.<br />The 100% Arabica beans make a delicious cup of coffee,<br />which gave a definite pick-me-up with-out jitters or an unwanted after taste.<br />Our family thinks this is a five star coffee!

review/summary: rich and smooth coffee
review/text: Marley Coffee in individual cup pods is something new for me. I have a DeLonge espresso maker with the feature to use it with coffee pods. So my review is based on using this device to make the Marley coffee. I made very large cups of coffee and tried them with cream and sweetener (stevia or agave)and also just black. I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap. At about 75 cents a cup, it is for me not an option to drink several each day. I strongly and smoothly recommend this product.

review/summary: Good coffee, but no directions for use or preparation.
review/text: I ordered these thinking they were an instant single serve coffee beverage similar to the Starbucks Via product. (Just add hot water and dissolve the single serve packet.) When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty.

review/summary: Intended for pod brewer; works used loose in French press
review/text: Packaging is very inviting, but there is not one word of instructions on the box or on the individually wrapped pouches.  When I opened the foil packet,the coffee fragrance was tantalizing. One side of the little pouch of coffee did say, "This side down." Not realizing they were for a pod brewer, I put them in my single cup drip maker with the appropriate side down--this yielded tasteless brown water like bad motel coffee that I threw away. Finally I saw one line on the Amazon product page that indicated these were for a pod brewer. Unfortunately, I do not have one, so I cut a little coffee bag open and dumped it into my single serve French press. This brewed a good, very strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />This is a decent product, but cries out for directions!!

review/summary: Great taste, but the packaging is strange to me.
review/text: The coffee has a very nice, chocolaty taste, very smooth, but the drawback was the packaging.  It comes in individual serving coffee bags, and I just have no idea how to use it.  I tried one cup like tea, pouring the water over it and letting it simmer, but by the time it got dark enough (I didn't know how long to steep it) it was cold.  I tried some other bags in a glass tea press, and that seemed to work better, but again didn't know how long to steep it.  There are no instructions on the package.  We usually make drip coffee, so maybe next time I'll just try stuffing a bunch of the coffee bags into the coffee maker.  I see the Amazon page says &lt;&lt;For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers>>.  I guess my problem is I have never heard of a Coffee Pod Brewer.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP:  Today I put 8 of the pods in my drip pot and made 8 cups' worth and it was very good.  I called it chocolaty before, but maybe it's more like a mild cocoa flavor, slightly almond.  Very smooth and not at all bitter.  Great!

review/summary: Jamaica Mon
review/text: Four and One-Half Stars<br /><br />This coffee's packaging is a send-up of Jamaican style down to its name:  Marley Coffee.  (By the way, I actually saw Bob Marley walking by himself on West 57th Street in the late seventies).  Anyway, this coffee is meant for Pod coffee makers - did not realize this when I requested the coffee.  I do not own a pod coffeemaker.  You get 15 individual pod packets.  Each pod holds a single serving/cup of coffee.  To enable brewing in my coffee maker, I just cut the pods open and dumped into a coffee filter, and voila!  Coffee has nice rich aroma, and it has a full flavor.  It's definitely a better coffee than I had been drinking, which was your basic old school supermarket stuff.  For reference, I am not someone who tolerates strong coffee well.  Starbucks can give me a panic attack!  So, I thought the kick and richness was very nice and just right for me.<br /><br />As others have commented, if you're into that deep & dark, caffeine laden French roast, this may not be the coffee for you.

review/summary: A Safe coffee that won't offend anyone
review/text: Comes in round, flat, pods so beware before purchasing. I just dropped one in the filter holder of my regular coffee maker used about 1 cup of water and it worked out OK. There are no instructions on the box on what to do with the pods, how much water or what machines it might work with.<br /><br />Evaluation:<br />Comes in single serving pods.<br />Nice packaging.<br />Light to medium strength coffee.<br />Tastes very slightly burnt.<br />Unlike what the advertising says, I taste no "berry notes".<br />No acidic taste (a plus).<br />Organic<br />Fair trade certified means farmers are paid a fair price for their coffee beans.<br /><br />In my opinion, there's better coffee out there, but worth a try. This coffee is fine for the average coffee drinker. It's not bold enough for the purist, but won't offend them either.

review/summary: Nice coffee but a little acid
review/text: It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.  I'm going to disagree, however, with the reviewer who found the coffee too weak if the pods are used like tea bags.  I found just the opposite.  The coffee produced in my machine was far weaker than that produced when I just stuck the pod in the cup and poured boiling water over it.  The result from the "tea-bagging" approach was strong and a little more acid than I like, but it had a good coffee flavor.  In the machine I got more of a "coffee-flavored water" result even when I used three pods together.<br /><br />It's worth a try if you have a single-serve machine and it's a handy way to carry your own coffee on trips as it truly does do fairly well in either machine or tea-bag use.  I suspect the flavor will be a matter of personal taste, so give it a try and decide for yourself.  There are other Fair Trade organic coffees out there, but this is the first I've come across in pods.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds "single serve pods" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said "teabagging" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: "This side down"  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.  At least to the point where you let us know if any special equipment is required to use a product.

review/summary: Great Concept, But Where Are the Directions?
review/text: There is really nothing I love more than a great cup of coffee. However, if you want to make a great cup of coffee, then you need directions to show you how to get the most out of the coffee you are using.<br /><br />Although this coffee should be foolproof,(they are single serving bags, similar to a tea bag) there are no directions in the package to tell you how to make the best cup of coffee possible.<br /><br />I would like to have known things like:<br /><br />How much water do I use?<br /><br />Will filtered or distilled water make a better cup of coffee?<br /><br />How long should I soak the little coffee pack in the water?<br /><br />How hot should the water be for the best brewing?<br /><br />The company has a great concept. They want to offer you a great cup of coffee, that's environmentally friendly, and they want to help kids at the same time. You've won my heart. However, they had all the information you need to know about the company, its ideology, causes they support, and even where the coffee comes from and how the coffee is produced.<br /><br />Like I said, there were no brewing recommendations/directions on the package or in the box. If you don't mind a little trial and error, this is a great product. Get it right, and the coffee tastes great.

review/summary: Good Taste but Expensive
review/text: I make my own coffee at the office.  I have a coffee cup, water, and a microwave oven.  I have been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1KJO">Folgers Coffee Singles</a>, which resemble tea bags. I place water in the coffee cup, heat it in the microwave, and then plop the Folgers in the hot water.  The result is acceptable, but not great,<br /><br />Although, the Marley coffee may not be designed for tea bag use, that is how I tried it.  I have found that the flavor is good and the taste is strong enough depending on how long the packet is left in the water.<br /><br />On the plus side, the Marley coffee can be used in a tea-bag manner, has good taste, and is fair trade coffee.  On the minus side, it costs around twice as much as the Folgers.  I will have to continue to experiment with it to see if it justifies the extra cost.

review/text: I tried a bite out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised by how aromatic and delicious this is! My 9 month old loves it too, but she also likes spicy and herby foods (probably because I eat a lot of garlic). It is VERY potent, so I can see why a lot of babies wouldn't like it, but if you have a little one who seems bored of Gerber's cardboardy "mixed dinners" then I strongly recommend. Garlic is a great food to introduce to your babies anyways because it's loaded with nutrients and fights infection, and if you're worried about the smell just mix in some chopped parsley.

She made another cup and put another pod in with the first one and used less water - and it was still weak! She came up after that and made this coffee, dumped it out and said she was going to use my decaf and don't order anymore of this crap - and that girl wouldn't EVEN drink decaf before.  So for us - cancel that subscribe and save and stick with the decaf.  Seriously, this is not even close to medium roast!

review/summary: Thanks Amazon!...Fresh & Good Price with Auto-ship...
review/text: Amazon rocks!  We go through quite a bit of Walnuts (well, between the people & parrots who live in my zoo, I mean home) - Amazon's price with auto-ship is fair and saves me a trip to the Market.  Nuts arrived fresh and quickly.  Thanks Amazon for making life just a little easier!!

review/summary: Diamond Walnuts
review/text: Hurrah, I had walnuts in my oatmeal this morning.  These walnuts are fresh & delicious and full of Omega3 oils.  Just what my doctors ordered to get my LDL cholestrol in line.  Cheaper ( with free shipping ) than I can buy in the U.P. of Michigan.<br /><br />It is fun to buy stuff from California even though I no longer live there.

review/summary: Damaged Goods
review/text: Diamond Shelled Walnuts, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)<br />I was greatly disappointed. The Bags were damaged - cuts in them - but there was no damage to the box they came in - so, of course, I got stale walnuts.

review/summary: Always fresh
review/text: The Diamond walnuts I've received from Amazon are always fresh and have a good taste.  That's important because I've bought walnuts in the grocery store that either did not have any taste or were rancid...ew!  I've never received a bad batch of Diamond walnuts sent by Amazon.  The price is better than buying in a local store.  I receive six bags every other month.
