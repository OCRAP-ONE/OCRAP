review/summary: It's alright....
review/text: Well i bought this because it was all Whole Foods had that was organic and I wanted a dark dutch process, I don't use it for baking I make cocoa from scratch so thats all i use it for. My cocoa had absolutely no chocolate taste, it was incredibly bland. The next day i made Hershy's cocoa from scratch and found it to be much more chocolatey than this which isn't saying much as many people seem to think Hersheys isn't that hot. Perhaps the flavor is more pronounced in bake goods, but i do like that it is not treated with chemicals as I too get migraines, but I don't think that's what gives people the migraines is the actual chocolate chemicals.

review/summary: Perfect velvety cocoa
review/text: Really pleased with this product and so elated that I am getting all the benefits of organic + the non alkali version of cocoa. It is so difficult in this age to get a 'clean' product that has not been tampered with - and with purity you can taste. I was nervous this cocoa powder would do not the trick but it by far exceeded all hopes and I will never try another brand or stray from this one.

review/summary: Tastes Just Right
review/text: These are 6.7 oz. cans, 190 grams, with a 3.5 recommended serving that contains 250 mg of sodium per serving.  This herring tastes great, in my opinion.  If you're concerned about ingredients, visit [...], where they always list the nutritional content of all the products they sell.<br /><br />I hate to cook, and I'm always looking for easy foods that are nutritious, taste good, and take little time to prepare.  This canned herring fits the bill, offering 7 grams of protein per serving and 1 gram of sugar.  The tomato sauce gives it the added flavor; I've tried the same brand with peppercorns and it isn't as flavorful, but it is passable.<br /><br />I've had this herring in tomato sauce with roast squash and broccoli, as a sandwich, and added to garden salad.  With a drink of choice, it becomes part of a good meal.

review/summary: Fine Brandy + Rich Dark Chocolate = A Decadent Delight!
review/text: A German friend, returning to his home in New York City after visiting with family in Frankfurt am Main, brought me back a gift box of ASBACH URALT Assorted Brandy-Filled Chocolates. That was about six years ago and I have been hooked ever since. I have tasted chocolates filled with liquor before, but the contents usually taste like alcohol, (the rubbing variety), made palatable only by the candy covering. For that reason I preferred my occasional after-dinner brandy in a snifter. Now, Asbach Uralt, which is recognized by connoisseurs to be the ultimate in liquor-filled chocolate, allows me to have my dessert along with a small taste of superb cognac in one bite. Actually, it is more like one long savoring session between me and a piece of chocolate.<br /><br />Hugo Asbach's company has been producing fine cognac, "Weinbrand," since 1907 and it is this excellent brandy that is used to make the unique gourmet confection. A thin sugar crust separates the rich dark chocolate and the fine Uralt Asbach Brandy. It is important that the candy be consumed while fresh so the alcohol does not evaporate, and the middleman who sells this product through Amazon has consistently provided me with chocolates as fresh as I would get in Germany. I have ordered frequently over the years, for myself and for friends, as this makes a delicious and unusual gift.<br /><br />The Large Asbach Assorted Gift Box contains a variety of the liquor-filled chocolates. The assortment includes cherries marinated for over a year in Asbach brandy, praline, coffee and pure cognac. The chocolates are as fine as any I have had in Belgium and much less expensive. This is a real winner. 5+ Stars!<br /><br />JANA

review/summary: White Coffee's Viennese
review/text: We enjoyed First Colony Viennese with Cinnamon coffee for many years prior to White Coffee taking over the brand.  Since then, limited supply and fewer sources, and what we've gotten is not really the same coffee.  The true First Colony had pieces of cinnamon sticks with the coffee beans, and this coffee apparently has none.  This coffee is also a stronger flavor with a bit more bitterness.  It's not bad, just different and not better.  We're using it, doctored with added cinnamon sticks and with some adjustments in our brewing, but we wish they would bring back the original.

review/summary: Tasty decaf
review/text: My physician has suggested that I try to use more decaf and less regular coffee. Indeed, I have experimented with a number of decaf products over the past several months. Some are good, some aren't. Some have a nice coffee taste; others are pretty bland.<br /><br />I have tried some of Newman's Own K-cup flavors and have generally found the whole line pretty satisfying. This decaf is no exception. It has a nice coffee taste (it is labeled "extra bold). It isa organic, to the extent that that has value for the person wishing to try a cup out. For me, though, the key thing is that it has a good coffee taste and I like starting the day off with a decent cup.<br /><br />So, if you'd like to trey out a decaf, this isn't a bad starting point.

review/text: I'm really surprised that it's just as good as the caffinated coffee I've been drinking for years. Being organic and water processed is what sold me..and I can tell the difference between the Newman's and other regular decaf. Newman's is the best, at least for me anyway. It may be slightly milder in strength than the Starbucks but it didn't take me long to get used to it. It's still a great flavor, less acid for sure - and no caffeine.  I'm a satisfied customer!

In fact, I'm going to go brew some now for myself :)<br /><br />I bought this from Amazon and have always been very happy with their shipping, packing, etc. This order was no different! Thank you!!

Swing and a miss on both counts.<br /><br />I made my cups on the standard 8 ounce setting, and even that couldn't produce any concentration of flavor. A tiny dab of milk reduced it even further.<br /><br />The worst decafs have all the allure, flavor and aroma of melted brown crayon, and this K cup struggles even to meet that very low bar. Good decaf isn't that difficult to obtain, but it was apparently a cup too far for this brand.

I continue to be a K cup lover, despite my feelings of overpaying for "home-brewed" coffee.  The K cups are just so darn convenient and easy to make.  I keep my K cup cooker right on my bedroom lavatory shelf.  Turn it on when I get up and the coffee is ready to brew before I have finished with my morning tasks.  And the Special Blend is oh so good.

review/text: Newman's Special Decaf is one of my favorite decaf coffees for drinking in the evening. The flavor is rich and can fool many into thinking they're drinking caffeinated coffee. There is no aftertaste and never keeps me awake overnight.

review/summary: Makes smooth, but watery decaf coffee
review/text: I like that it's not too bitter, but like a bunch of other reviewers, I find that the coffee comes out a bit too watery.  My cups are 12 ounce.  I use creamer, but it's the powdered kind, not the liquid, so it shouldn't water down the coffee.<br /><br />I will probably not buy these again.  I think I'm going to try the eco filter cups, or whatever they're called, with regular decaf coffee grounds from the grocery store.

review/summary: ...decaf.organic.very light coffee...
review/text: pros: organically processed organic beans<br /><br />cons:  very light - tastes light a very watered down cup of java, even when brewed using 8oz setting.  I'll have to try a smaller setting, but really, it feels like it'd just be a waste as I'd like more than just a 6 or 4oz cup.  It's is quite lght however that I'm not optimistic that I would make much difference.  *FYI : I drink my coffee black.<br /><br />Good news: I purchased these for my teens who sometimes like a cup of creamy coffee, and... this satisfies their coffee cravings.  So three stars because it's not what I would usually purchase again, but the teeners like it.

review/summary: Tasteless
review/text: I recently got a Keurig coffeemaker and tried out different brands of Decaf to come up with a favorite. Newman's Own is definitely not among them. Taste very much like a cheap restaurant coffee, watered down with hardly any coffee taste. I happen to like robust coffee taste, and this one doesn't even qualify as "medium".<br />If you like good coffee taste in your decaf coffees, I would highly recommend the Green Mountain Robust Magic and for a little lighter touch the Donut House Decaf or Tully's.<br />Also, of all the different brands I tried, the Newman's Own was the only decaf that gave me an acid stomach reaction.<br />NOT recommended!

review/text: Okay, so it wasn't one of my proudest moments.  I didn't check my order or I would have realized I had ordered Newman's Own "DECAF", when I meant to order Newman's Own Extra Bold!!!  My bad!!  Needless to say when I got the order I was very upset.  That being said, I kept the DECAF and found that now I can enjoy the awesome flavor of Newman's coffee late at night while I read or watch TV, and I can still go to sleep when I'm ready.  It is a double edged sword though.  I am disabled, and therefore I can't afford to order what I intended to, which was Newman's Own Extra Bold.  It is absolutely THE BEST coffee ever.  Add a little Bailey's Creamer and what a great way to start your day.  Those 80 decaf K-Cups are going to last me well into the cold weather, which is great.  Lord only knows when I can get my Newman's Extra Bold.

review/summary: An Average Tasting Curry Powder
review/text: I was a huge fan of the Cross and Blackwell brand of curry powder, having eating it since I was a child 55 years ago, and have been searching all over for a close replacement ever since it was taken off the market. Needless to say, I was quite excited when I read the positive reviews that I read on the Madras brand and quickly placed my order.<br /><br />After receiving it, we tried it twice with our favorite chicken curry recipe and I am sorry to say that it did not come even close to the flavor of Cross and Blackwell. To us, the Madras is an average tasting off-the-shelf prepared curry power; it tasted bland and the aroma was just okay. The first time I used 3 tablespoons in about a cup of liquid. In the second try I doubled it to six tablespoons and it still came out tasting bland.<br /><br />BTW - When I say it tasted bland I was refering to the powder's flavor; not heat (it is not a spicey curry).

review/text: I originally bought this cereal at my local grocery store.  When I went back to get more, they didn't have it.  Fortunately I found it on Amazon.com.  If I hadn't I would have contacted Quaker and bought it from them.  It is the best granola I have ever eaten.  Not only is it incredibly tasty, but the fat content is lower than most granolas.  I bought two large boxes from Amazon and froze the second one for use later.  It was just as good after being frozen as it was right off the shelf.  Great product.

review/text: I find it humorous that people would reduce their star rating for a product on Amazon over the price (see other reviews).  I love this brand, I've been eating it since I was a kid along with a good selection of other cereals. It's crunchy and a naturally sweet and the raisins sticking to your teeth once in a while is part of the enjoyment.  Think of it as burning calories while you chew.  This is definitely a top favorite for me.<br /><br />Costco may have a better price but they won't drop it off at my door, and I hate fighting with the lineups in that huge store.  Shopping for groceries on Amazon is extremely convenient.

review/text: This stuff is cheap at costco, and it tastes pretty good. But the problem is, the raisins in it stick to your teeth, and not only that, but it's hard to chew in the first place with all the granola...I could see this making some decent granola bars though if you bind it into such, or if you use it for an ingredient.  I just finished a small bowl and my jaw is already tired, and my mouth hurts slightly.  Take my word for it, if you're gonna have this as cereal, buy something else.

review/text: I have recently taken a liking to Chai tea thanks to a store in the mall called Teavana; Couldn't afford their prices, so the next best thing originally was some loose Chai tea from Marshalls, which was great -- but they only had one can of the stuff. So I thought this would be a nice flavor -- spicy chai, plus a hint of chocolate. Turns out, this tastes more like chocolate than Chai tea; it's missing the sweet-spiciness that I've come to love w/Chai.<br /><br />That said, it's not awful, just don't expect anything phenomenal. I'll likely be switching to a different brand after I'm done w/this bag.

review/summary: Good X-Bold Dark Roast for the Price
review/text: Really my title sums up my opinion of this cup altogether. It does make a nice, heart large cup of dark roast coffee, and $25 for 48 cups as the preorder price was outstanding. At that price, I don't think I've ever really seen better, but at the same time the brew doesn't seem quite as bold or earthy tasting as a cup of Green Mountain Dark Magic or Emeril's Big Easy Bold. I prefer a robust large cup on almost every brew, and I've realized that even the Ice Brew K-Cups are basically the same thing; a cup of coffee with extra grounds for brewing a small amount stronger...so I brew iced coffee with my Extra Bold k-cups. I did the math on weight, and these weigh in at just under a cup of Dark Magic or Sumatran Reserve, but I'd still say my favorites (by taste,) are the brands I've listed above or Tully's Italian or French Roast, Caribou Obsidian, Starbucks Dark Sumatra, or even Barista Prima French and Italian Roasts. The only other thing I can note about these is that the construction of the pods is about perfect; I didn't find any grinds in the box leaving me to believe there were no leaking pods. Almost all the pods had a little air puffing the foil out; which I've noticed a lot of the Keurig brands have flat foils, anyways, so I'm not even sure if it matters that much, although I've had grinds brew through on some of the flat pods. The only other difference I can mention is the  material of the foil top is different than Keurig brand pods; these are slightly harder and smoother (almost like a plastic or polymer,) but it doesn't seem to effect the brew process at all, and I didn't seem to get any grinds in my cup, so all in all it just doesn't matter to me. Still better than brewing through a regular coffee pot (even from fresh ground beans,) and I don't think I'll ever get tired of my Keurig coffee maker.

review/summary: Best K-Cups I have tried so far
review/text: With K-Cups being so expensive, I haven't ordered much for a while.  Most prices are over .60 per cup.  That's a lot of money a month for two daily cups of coffee.  Nothing is cheap, and neither are these at about .50 per cup.  I remember the good ol' days when the K-cups were not more than about .35 each, and it wasn't that long ago.<br /><br />I have been buying K-Cups at Costco most recently, and the Tully's they carry are okay.  Newman's Own are just okay too.  Those run .475 per cup, so that's been a little better.  This Martinson coffee comes close to the same price as the ones at Costco, but the flavor is superior.  This is the first cup of coffee I have in the morning. It's got a richer flavor, fresher somehow, than the others I have tried.

review/summary: Kinda tastes like instant
review/text: I really like a bold cup of coffee.<br /><br />Generally if I want flavored coffee I will flavor it myself as flavoreds don't come in dark roast bold, however I expect to not have to flavor it to drink it. I want my base coffee to be an experience in itself and something that I look forward too.<br /><br />Martinson Dark Roast K-cup does not give me that coffee experience. Although the coffee is smooth, I will give it that, it is bland and kinda tastes like instant.<br /><br />Honestly I didn't spend the money I did on a Keurig machine to get a cup of instant coffee. I can do that with a pot of boiling water and a cheap jar of whatever.<br /><br />While I do not expect the same experience as I get when I grind my beans fresh and brew it in my french press, I do expect a reasonably fresh ground taste.<br /><br />On a positive note the presentation of the K-cups and the box are top notch. The black/gray combination makes the coffee look like it is presented in a tuxedo. 5 stars for the marketing department on this one as the look on the shelf is bound to grab lots of attention so that people will buy it at least once.

review/summary: Better than Most of the Other So-Called "Bold" K-Cups!!
review/text: As one of the previous reviewers said, this is the first "K-cup" that doesn't taste at least somewhat watery.  I've tried LOTS of the Green Mountain sanctioned "extra bold" varieties (Jet Fuel, Dark Magic, Black Tiger, Double Black Diamond, etc.), but the new "RealCup" Martinson Dark Roast is in a class by itself.  Not necessarily a better "flavor" than the others mind you, but definitely more full-bodied and robust....not to mention significantly less expensive!<br /><br />BTW, absolutely no "sludge" or "dust" to be found at the bottom (or anywhere else) in my mug.  Only a good, satisfying cup of Joe! Highly recommended!<br /><br />Next, I plan to try a few of the Brown Gold RealCup varieties.  Look for even more choices to hit the market as some of the Green Mountain K-cup patents expire.

review/summary: RealCup Is Great!!!
review/text: If you have a Keurig brewer you need to try this coffee.  I just received the Martinson "Dark Roast" and I ordered a box of the "Brown Gold" (single origin coffee) as well.  I don't know if it's just the RealCup (new K-Cup filter) technology, or the Martinson coffee, but I love this stuff.  This is the first "K-Cup" I've used that doesn't taste watery.  Don't get me wrong, I love my Keurig, but the coffee always seemed to be missing something.  According to Martinson, the RealCup uses a new filter that allows essential oils to come through (like a french press) and it provides better mouthfeel and taste.  I can't wait for my next shipment.  As a bonus, some of them are available on subscribe and save.

review/summary: Inconsistent
review/text: I purchased the House Blend --and-- the Donut Shop Blend.<br /><br />BUT I can only leave one combined review so I will try to make this as clear as I can.  I averaged the star rating for both (hence the two stars) - Hopefully this isn't too confusing.<br /><br />*I give the House Blend one star because:<br />This coffee tastes cheap, old and stale.  It reminds me of the time I accidently drank a gulp of coffee someone had put a cigarette out in. I am tiny bit of a coffee snob and can't stand 'cheap' coffee but even my husband, whom will drink (almost) anything, can't stand it.<br /><br />***I give the Donut Shop Blend three stars because:<br />To my taste it is slightly stale but drinkable it has a mild and smooth taste BUT it's weak.  I prefer medium roast --I got this for my teenagers and they like it well enough that it won't go to waste but they don't want me to buy it again.<br /><br />Also, with this brand the  cups are made of a plastic that have a little more resistance than the other 'k-cups' that I've used so they require a little more pressure to pierce when I load them into the Keurig... I worry a mite that this could damage the machine.

review/summary: Martinson Coffee Capsules, French Roast, 48-Count
review/text: This French roast coffee is very good. Since purchasing our Keurig brewer we have tried almost every coffee we could find (except flavored coffee), and found most of the French roast varieties to have a bitter aftertaste. This coffee is a bold, dark roast, strong (like we prefer), yet without the bitterness of other brands. The 48-count package was a good value, considerably less than the "Super-store" where we usually purchase our K-cups. The most amazing aspect of this purchase however, was the AMAZINGLY quick shipping. This  order was placed with "Amazon Prime" on Thursday and was delivered to our door in just over 24 hours after the order was placed. Amazon continues to give us more and more reasons to not have to deal with the wally-world-weirdos! Thanks!!

review/summary: Martinson Dark Roast
review/text: I have been drinking Martinson Dark Roast for five days now and have been very impressed with the flavor profile. This is the closest K-Cup style product to traditional pot brewed coffee that i have tried. This product has an extremely smooth Dark taste along with full body finish without tasting burnt. I also ordered Donut Shop and look forward to trying, but am now hooked on the Dark Roast. Very impressed with this coffee -clearly the best K Cup style product i have tried (although have not tried Starbucks yet). I will be trying all the other Martinson blends when they hit the market.

review/text: As an avid lover of Dunkin Donuts coffee, and the owner of a Keurig brewer, I have always hoped for a coffee whose flavor was close to my Dunkin!  Well I finally found one-- Martinson Donut Shop Blend is just as good or better than Dunkin Donuts coffee and I now do not have to spend over $2.00 per cup to get the flavor I love.  Even the K cups sold in the Dunkin Donut stores are not as good and Martinsons cost a lot less!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OSBEY2">Martinson Coffee Capsules, Donut Shop Blend, 48-Count Package for Keurig K-Cup Brewers</a>

review/summary: My new favorite K-Cup!  Replaced Veranda
review/text: Wow, what can I say!  When I first got notification about this new product from Amazon, I was a bit skeptical.  The price was the lowest around of any k-cups I've ever found and I figured that the quality probably wouldn't be far behind the price.  Boy was I wrong.  I'm not into the insanely strong, bold coffee, but I'm also not into water either.  Previously, my favorite flavor was Starbucks Breakfast blend, also known as "Veranda", or "blonde".  It had the right flavor, not bitter, and was delicious.  The problem was the price.  It was way too expensive and I ended up using an ecobrew single serve cup and a bag of it to cut the cost down.  It made it a lot cheaper, was just as good if not better, but was a pain to have to dump the grounds, clean it out, and refill every time I wanted to use it.  My Martinson Breakfast blend cups arrived today and I didn't waste any time.  Straight out of the box and right into the brewer.  It smelled good as it was brewing but the surprise came when I took a taste.  This was better than Veranda!!  Full flavor with just a hint of nuttiness, exactly how I like it.  After one cup, I'm officially hooked.  This is my new favorite coffee and I'm just about to order a much bigger box!  Thank you Amazon for offering it here at such a great price.  It's about time these things got cheaper!

review/text: I purchased the variety pack of Martinsons and the Brown Gold they are both from the same vendor.  I did not like the taste of the Martinson product at all.  I threw it away, not the product I expected at all.  The Brown Gold was more palatable, however certain flavors with this brand also feel short in particular the Costa Rican named product was extremely too bitter.  I would agree with most that this does give you a lower cost per serving, but when the coffee is inferior and the taste match is also, I think the best descriptor is cheap.

review/text: I received the offer from Amazon and had never tried this brand before.  I thought since Martinson's had been in business for a long time that I would order.  I was disappointed.  The flavor was not what I expected and each cup of coffee had a residue in it. I have not had any of the other brands do that so I know it had to be the coffee.  I am guessing that the coffee was ground to fine for a K-Cup.  I only have 8 more left and will be glad.  I will not buy this brand again.

review/text: Martinson's Dark Roast k-cup was a very nice surprise. My only complaint was that it came in a 48-count box. I had never tried this brand and bought it based on other reviewer's comments. Now that I know how good this coffee is, the larger box is not a problem. I prefer a full bodied cup of coffee in the morning and this brew met my needs and is one of my favorites. It is not over-powering, just very good.  I shared this coffee with two friends that have Keurigs and they liked it but said they couldn't find it at the store.  I would definitely buy this again.
