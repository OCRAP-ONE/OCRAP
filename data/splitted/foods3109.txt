review/summary: Bali's Best Coffee Candy
review/text: This is my FAVORITE coffee candy.  I used to buy NIPS, since it was the ONLY coffee candy available in stores in my area.  It was OK (since I did not know any better at the time).  Then I discovered Bali's Best Coffee Candy at one of my local stores and found it to have a far better taste than the NIPS.  When that store stopped selling Bali's, I was afraid that I was going to have to go back to the NIPS or find another brand.  I searched online and found that I could still get the Bali's from Amazon.  I decided to "Subscribe and Save" for this candy so that I do not have to worry about running out or trying to find it in a store.  With "Subscribe and Save", I have an automatic delivery of a case of candy every 6 months, at a discounted price and free shipping.

review/text: I discovered these candies at a Fry's electronics store of all places. They are WONDERFUL! Robust coffee flavor with just the right amount of sugar. They make a great pick me up or little something to tide you over between lunch and dinner. Delicious and addicting. I have gotten four colleagues hooked on them too. Could not find them for sale any longer at Fry's or anywhere else in town. I located them on Amazon and got a smoking deal. Definately worth a try.

review/text: I am beyond dissappointed!  After trying these in December, I decided to order a whole case!  It took over a month to get here...and now I know why.<br /><br />They taste like some VERY VERY watered down coffee - mixed with DISHWATER.  Yes, I would have to say that these are now the WORST coffee candies I have ever had.  If you happen to have any made in 2006, you should savour them because that's the end of them.<br /><br />I just scraped off the new label so I can tell you the original ingredient list: Sugar, glucose, milk powder, coffee extract, coffee flavor, vegetable oil, salt, caramel.<br /><br />If your first ingredient is Glucose Syrup (tapioca)...then put them right back where you found them.  You will be wasting your money & insulting your tastebuds.

review/text: I've tried numerous coffee candies and this is by far the worst I've ever had.  I should have known, seeing the main ingredient as Glucose syrup.  Not only does it break up in your mouth, but the texture of the center goop is nauseating like a blob of snot.  It breaks into sharp shards first, then you get the gross inner surprise...bleh!!!  If you like high fructose type syrup, then this crap is for you.

review/text: I found the taste to be OK but certainly not "wild." The teriyaki flavor wasn't unique and didn't provide the spicy "kick" I was expecting. My main disappointment was with the consistency of the jerky. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it went down like cardboard and left a chalky taste in my mouth. Not a fan.

review/text: I love this stuff! Wild Ride Kickin' Teriyaki has NO nitrites and NO MSG. It is made with natural ingredients, which is about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only 280 calories, or 70 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat. I'm watching my weight, and Wild Ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet.<br /><br />Essentially, it is sliced steak in a bag. An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them). While this is an inconvenience, the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is slightly sweet (like Teriyaki sauce) and not too salty. It is one of my favorite Wild Ride flavors. MMmmmm! Yummy!

review/text: I have not been able to eat pre-packaged jerky in a long time due to my severe migraines and the fact that nitrates and MSG triggers them. When I saw this jerky I had to try it. I was very glad that I did. It had a great flavor and was tender. My only complaint is that I couldn't put the 4oz bag down, so I think that I'll try the 1oz bags next since I obviously have no self control when it comes to this jerky! I also am back to try some of the other flavors but I did love this flavor.

review/text: The texture on this jerky is similar to other bad jerky, like Oberto. It's very dry, not hard but firm, and kind of falls apart in your mouth - but not in a good way. The flavor is dominated by smoke, whereas most jerkys also include soy sauce or worcestershire sauce.<br /><br />All in all, I'd eat this instead of stuff at the gas station like Oberto or a Slim Jim, but when push comes to shove I'll order Wild Bill's jerky, Big John's, or pick up some jerky at the local meat market.

review/summary: Dry, Tasteless Jerky...
review/text: * This is a review for the 1.25oz Kickin' Teriyaki  flavor Beef Jerky *<br /><br />Beef Jerky has always been one of my favorite snacking foods. I even used to make my own when I was younger. I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything "kickin" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn't contain "added" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided

review/text: I received this in the mail this morning and tore the package open excitedly, because I've been craving some beef jerky lately.  But oh my goodness, I couldn't even swallow the first piece.  Even my dog stopped eating them after 2 pieces.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the flavor other than salty and metallic (I got the Teriyaki).  The jerky is also alarmingly thick and covered with this sawdust-like powder, and most of the pieces have broken up into crumbs.<br /><br />I will definitely not be finishing the bag I opened, and hopefully I'll be able to give the other 5 bags to someone who is hungry enough to take them.  I'm not one to complain about products, but I've also never felt so strongly about spreading the news to stay away from this stuff.

This beef jerky comes in perfectly sized pieces and is very tender, probably even more tender than my favorite brand, Pemmican.<br /><br />As for the flavor, it's not very strong. There is some flavor but the tenderness of the beef makes up for the lack of flavor. It also isn't as salty as other brands of beef jerky that I've had before. Overall it's a great buy and I recommend it.

review/text: I am someone who LOVES beef jerky and I was hoping this tasted better than it does.  It has a very strange texture (a dry mushy testure - if there is such a thing) and the taste was strange (carboard like and bland).  I like to buy healthy snacks and food items so I was hoping this would taste much better.  I was expecting a difference in taste and texture due to the lack of MSG which does add a lot of salt flavor and texture to traditional beef jerky BUT this just out right does not taste good. I can sacrifice for the benefit of a more natural product but I found this jerky to be beyond my threshold of tolerance.<br /><br />  I am hoping to try and use it as dog treats so the purchase is not a complete waste and also add a bag to my hurricane supplies (as a food of last resort).  I would suggest trying to locate this product locally and trying it before you buy it in the bulk 6 bag size from Amazon to make sure it is a taste and texture you would like, we didn't!

review/text: I have tryed the majority of spicy jerky on the market.  I can't say that Wild Ride Gallopin Pepper was my favorite, but it does have decent flavor.  The character of the poduct is a smoky flavor with a little spice, but being one who likes hot foods, it didn't have enough to get my engine running.  I think it is a decent product, but at least the shipment I got was extremely dry.  I know it is jerky, so it's like it is supposed to be dry, but other brands I have had like World Kitches seem to retain a little more of the natural oils and juices.  I would eat this again, but given the choice other brands seem to give me the kick I'm looking for more than this.

Found this zero carb jerky, which I just went back and double checked the page from which I purchased it and it definitely says "zero carbs" under product description, abut turns out that it has 5 grams of sugar per ounce and 6 grams of carbohydrates. I already cracked a bag open and started eating it before flipping it over to discover this. Very unhappy and disappointed, I already had great beef jerky (with sugar in it) at home and didn't buy this expensive jerky so that I could have more. They need to be clear on the product description because the little picture isn't big enough to see if it says zero carbs on it or not.

review/summary: Wild Ride Jumpin Hot and Spicy - NO GOOD Don't BUY
review/text: Bought the Wild Ride Beef Hot & Spicy -  Wasn't hot or spicy and was the worst tasting Beef Jerky I have ever had.  Also, they sent me an expired package, but that should not have effected the taste..it is bad regardless. You should pass on this jerky regardless of the price.

review/summary: good intentions, horrible taste
review/text: I like the things the product does not contain, but the company missed one thing.  A good taste.  This jerky has almost a medicinal type flavor with a little heat thrown in to try and mask the awfulness.  I could not be more disappointed in a purchase and would return to Amazon if I was in to cheap to pay shipping.  I highly suggest you try and find this brand locally to test it out before buying the bulk here.

review/summary: Nasty taste, horrible texture
review/text: I've been a fan of Jerky for years.  I bought, tasted, and nearly gagged on the GALLOPIN' PEPPER flavor Wild Ride Jerky.  It is not spicy, it is mushy, lacks the expected standard beef jerky texture, and is like eating (I imagine) sour-ish cardboard. Save your money and pass on this one.

review/summary: Good, solid product - worth eating.  Somewhat spicy.
review/text: First this product excels because it isn't loaded with nasty preservatives, chemicals or other nasty junk, just the good stuff.  The meat itself is perfection, I haven't ever found any fat or hard bits, always just the right moisture and texture good quality tender meat.  The only reason I give this 4 stars is because I personally don't care for the spice they used (it is a powdered type and not hot enough for me.)  It tastes good but isn't my favorite.  If you aren't into inferno heat out of your food give this a try as you may just like it a lot!

review/summary: Not so great
review/text: I like beef jerky and I have tried many different brands so far.  Some were good and some were bad.  Heck, I even tried ebay jerky and thought it was okay.  This jerky would be the first jerky I would rate below average.  I even thought Golden Valley natural was acceptalble which is rated at 2 stars.  Smalls like jerky, looks like jerky and it is all natural beef jerky without msg/nitrate.  So what could be the problem? Texture.  I have pretty weak teeth so I prefer softer jerky. This jerky however went beyond that.  This jerky ALMOST litterally melts in your mouth.  When I chew on it, it crumbles and I am left with beef powder in my mouth.  If you are a denture wearer, this jerky might be a good option since it is very easy on your teeth.  I am not at that stage yet so I want something to chew on!  Perhaps it is because jerky was TOO fresh out of the factory and I need to let it age (dry) for some texture?  Also some strange reason, this jerky tastes really salty while having not that much salt over some other brands.  I honestly don't know how I am going to finish 6 packs...  Try 1 bag before ordering a half dozen bags.

review/summary: Natural taste and low sodium
review/text: I probably like the Cowboy Strips more from Wild Ride Beef Jerky but will admit that the natural taste is a good taste and you can tell that this contains less sodium so the taste isn't as strong as normal jerky.  We had noticed our daughter seems to like this product better because it was more tender than other jerky and like that it doesn't contain MSG.

Plus, they provide me with a way to get more of a whole food in my protein requirements.  Nice job, Wild Ride.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars?  The flavor could be the tiniest bit better.  The price could be a bit lower.  Reduce the sodium content of the other flavors, and the line would be more well-rounded for me.

review/summary: definitely not premium jerky
review/text: I had high hopes for this product, but I was seriously disappointed. I was expecting good quality beef jerky, but it is definitely not.<br /><br />The good: it's not tough like leather - it's actually pretty moist and unlikely to go stale once you open it because of the individually wrapped packages. It's also sold at a good price.<br /><br />The bad: I could detect basically no taste of black pepper at all, which was supposed to be the main flavor. Instead, it has a strange taste I can't put my finger on -- more chemical than natural. I've had plenty of black pepper-flavored jerky, and none of them tasted like this.<br /><br />Unless you're on a serious budget, I would avoid this product. Perhaps the other varieties taste better, but I'm not willing to risk it.

review/summary: It's okay..
review/text: I think the idea that there aren't any artificial flavoring or nitrates in this beef jerky is more appealing than the taste.  It is definitely an acquired taste, but once you get used to it, it isn't so bad.  It'll take care of your jerky craving.  Once warning of note, the bag will mold after you open it, so make sure you finish it off pretty quickly.  I realized the bag of mold only after I took a bite.  Didn't kill me, so now I have an immunity to something out there, just not sure what.

review/summary: Awesome taste!
review/text: I love this stuff! Wild Ride has NO nitrites and NO MSG. It is made with natural ingredients, about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only 200 calories, or 50 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat. I'm watching my weight, and Wild Ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet.<br /><br />Essentially, it is sliced steak in a bag. An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them). While this is an inconvenience, the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality.<br /><br />Jumpin' Hot & Spicy is zesty but not so spicy as to be unpleasantly hot. I would rate it as mild to moderately hot. It is one of my favorite flavors. MMmmmm! Yummy!

I tried the syrups that were sweetened with maltitol and they gave me a very upset stomach. I threw out the maltitol sweetened bottle and went in search of what other sugar free maple syrups were out there.<br /><br />I have been using mainly stevia for sweetening so I was SO happy to find this syrup, which is sweetened with Lo Han which is another natural herbal sweetener.<br /><br />It's a little on the thick side, but the flavor is great and you only need a little to get some great maple syrup flavor.

My verdict/opinion is: Almond, Maple Syrup and Vanilla are pretty good; the Raspberry is okay (if you crave some fruit taste); but I couldn't handle the taste of the Blueberry, Butter Pecan, Caramel, Hazelnut and Vanilla Cinnamon.<br /><br />The syrup is not thick like most syrups on the market; it's more runny and I find myself pouring some syrup out on to a plate and then dipping pieces of torn waffles.

I think I bought maybe 6 or 7 packs of them. Sadly they stopped stocking them after a couple months.<br /><br />I haven't found them in other stores (though I am sure they exist somewhere out there), so I decided to give it another go from Amazon. Everything arrived fine and on time.<br />However, from the first sip it tasted different. I think it is due to fact that it is stored in metal cans instead of bottles, but the taste was noticeably not as awesome as I remembered. Still quite good, but didn't quite live up to my memories.<br /><br />I don't think I'll be buying it again, but if you know you'll love them, don't hesitate to buy them.

review/text: These Peanut ginger candies are so good we eat them as candy at my house! Unfortunately my local health food stores only sell plain (original) but I've talked to them about ordering this kind. I also have tried the Spicy Apple. It's intense but I like it, most of my friends don't though. I can't wait to try a sample of the Hot Coffee variety! (hint, hint)

review/summary: Ginger Peanut Chews
review/text: Peanut chews are the best snack item ever. It gets a little hotter as you chew but it is a good bite. I like the peanut ones better than the hot cinnamon apple or any of the other because of the texture. It isn't as gummy to chew so it isn't as bad for your teeth either.

review/text: These chews are great. While I like the original chews too I prefer the milder flavor of these, and they still do a good job as a digestive aid (if I don't eat them all as candy first!) One caution, sometimes there are chunks of peanut in the chews. Personally I like these, but use caution when giving them to children or anyone with chewing or swallowing problems.

review/summary: Best Oatmeal EVER!
review/text: I won't even delve into the fact that this oatmeal is gluten free, because it doesn't matter. This is by far the best instant oatmeal I've ever tasted, and I've tasted them all. Take it from this died-in-the-wool oatmeal addict, you don't want your cupboard to be bare of this product. Forget the dried out packets that lurk in your grocery aisle, because they not only look but taste like cardboard. These oats have a higher moisture content already, and so they are naturally more plump in the bowl, and their taste is more consistent with long-cook-time oatmeal than any of their other counterparts. The added ingredients really are only the finest, and the taste proves it - raisins are yummy when plucked directly from the packet! I don't care for cooked bananas, but the banana oatmeal is just as delicious as my favorite maple flavor. The price is reasonable for this organic, gluten-free product. The taste is without parallel. This is a product I can recommend at the highest level without a single doubt or qualification!Glutenfreeda's Instant Oatmeal, Variety Pack Instant Oatmeal, 6-Oatmeal Packets (Pack of 8)

review/summary: Boxed Joy!
review/text: I have been gluten-free for over 5 years and dairy and soy-free for 9 months. My daughter has been corn-free for quite some time and gluten and dairy-free for the past 10 months. We were ecstatic when we learned about Glutenfreeda's Oatmeal being safe for both of us. It had been soooo long since I could make a packet of flavored oatmeal in a jiffy. And with my daughter's corn-allergy, it has been even longer for her. We are now in heaven and love all three flavors, but my favorite is the Banana Maple and mu daughter's fav is the Maple Raisin. We eat it for breakfast, snacks, whatever. It isn't as sweet as we both like it, but a spoon of demerara organic sugar and we're both ready to enjoy.<br /><br />Anyone who can buy any brand or kind of instant oatmeal off the shelf just can not fathom our excitement, but it is truly a wonderful thing to be able to enjoy instant oatmeal again!!

I was  delighted to see them come out with instant oatmeal and I  wasn't disappointed.I was doubly delighted to see the oatmeal offered on Amazon.com. Win,win!

My husband who is not on the gluten free diet loves this oatmeal.He says the oats taste fresher. And for my Celiac college  student this product has made his life so much easier.He can have a healthy breakfast in his dorm room or at the food court with no worry of cross-contamination.Like me he always has a packet in his backpack for snacks or a quick lunch.<br /><br />Thank you Glutenfreeda!

review/summary: Delicious GF Instant Oatmeal
review/text: Oatmeal is a tough one for people who are gluten-free out of medical necessity. Technically oats are naturally gluten-free. However, oats are a rotation crop with wheat, barley and rye particularly in the United States; your mileage may vary in other countries, making it even more confusing! What a "rotation crop" means is the verboten grains planted in other years pop up in the field with the oats, thus cross-contaminating both in the field and within the harvesting & processing. Gluten-free oats are grown like organic oats, requiring the field to be unused for four years prior to planting, and then processed on specific equipment only for the gluten-free oats.<br /><br />Up until recently, the only option was Bob's Red Mill gluten-free oats. Don't get me wrong -- their oats are great, especially for baking into recipes, but it is complicated and time-consuming to make oatmeal as a dish on its own the old-fashioned way. I've found they rarely come out the way I want them for that purpose. Additionally, they only come in plain.<br /><br />Enter Glutenfreeda with flavored instant oatmeal. Let me repeat that: flavored instant oatmeal. And it's delicious! It comes in several flavors: apple cinnamon, maple raisin, banana maple, natural (plain), strawberry & brown sugar, cranberry cinnamon, and a variety pack containing the first three listed flavors. All of them contain (extremely healthy) flax except for plain. Like any "normal" instant oatmeal, this product can be prepared with piping hot water from a kettle or in a microwave. Easy peasy!<br /><br />I buy this variety pack almost exclusively; I prefer the apple cinnamon & maple raisin flavors and my toddler daughter prefers the banana maple, so it works very well for us. Like most if not all gluten-free packaged foods, it's not cheap but it is so worth it for the pleasure of having instant oatmeal and being able to easily give it to my child.  We both love this instant oatmeal!

review/summary: Gluten Free Curious
review/text: I've been researching going Gluten free, or at the very least drastically cutting dense carbs from my diet like breads and certain pastas (no white rice or bread), and paying more attention to blood sugar inducing foods. I've found I'm happiest and healthiest when I do this. I don't want to cut things out like oatmeal, I love oatmeal. It has many great benefits, isn't going to max out your blood sugar, and improves lipid numbers. But the majority of the store brands are loaded with various so called "healthy grains" along with the oats, sugar & sugar substitutes, and ingredients that have to be googled in order to understand what they are exactly. I don't want emulsifiers, fillers, preservatives, and binders, I just want some tasty oatmeal for breakfast. This isn't bad for gluten free and I can recognize everything listed on the ingredient panel. Again, the flavors are not as intense as other brands. Your "taster" has to adjust when you are recent to cutting down on sodium, sugars, etc. Eventually, you won't notice that the sweet in this isn't ridiculously cloyingly tart, and appreciate the subtlety of the flavors.

I like the price!<br /><br />As for the product, it's good. It's not the best instant oatmeal I've ever had. I'm not a big fan of flaxseed. It seems to be an unnecessary addition. But the cereal is by no means unpleasant.<br /><br />The product serves its purpose well. I no longer need to eat a cold, bland GF cereal bar while watching my friends eat hot instant oatmeal on a cold morning deep in the mountains.<br /><br />Thank you, Glutenfreeda!

review/text: I am a fan of many Glutenfreeda prodcuts and the instant oatmeal is no exception. This oatmeal cooks up moist and flavorful; my favorite flavor is the apple but the other two flavors are just as good. I like the added flax to this oatmeal because its just an extra boost of nutrients when many people that are gluten-intolerant are lacking in that area. This oatmeal is gluten free but you would never know otherwise -- there hasn't been much taken away or added that usually creates a "different" flavor or texture that is so common in many gluten free products.

review/summary: Finally an amazing gluten-free instant oatmeal that doesn't cost a fortune!
review/text: When my son was first diagnosed with Celiac disease years ago, one of the hardest things for him to give up was his oatmeal.  He was used to having a bowl of it nearly every morning.  Back them, gluten-free oatmeal was terribly expensive.  I started buying Cream of Rice and Grits as a replacement.  While he did like the other hot cereals, he still really missed his oatmeal.<br /><br />I was so happy to come across this.  Not only is it REASONABLY priced - it tastes REALLY good.  It's better than instant Quaker Oats by far.  The texture is nice.  It's not too mushy.  There's a nice variety of delicious flavors.  It's super easy and quick to prepare.  Sometimes my son even uses it to sprinkle on top of yogurt instead of using gluten-free granola.  My son also has never experienced any negative digestive issues with this.  It's definitely a staple in our house!

review/summary: So good, I eat it almost daily!
review/text: This oatmeal is amazingly good - not sugary-sweet like many of the conventional instant oatmeals, and incredibly satisfying.  I'm not usually keen on banana-flavored anything, yet I enjoy the dried bananas in the Glutenfreeda Banana-Maple oatmeal.  The dried apples blend well with the cinnamon (which isn't overwhelming like in other products).  My favorite is the Maple Raisin - perfectly maple-y, not syrupy, with raisins that are soft and plump, not dried and hard.  Any of the flavors makes for a warm, satisfying breakfast - one I'd enjoy even if I wasn't wheat/gluten allergic.  The fact that these oats are certified gluten-free is a bonus.

review/summary: It's Oatmeal.....
review/text: It is oatmeal alright....It is ok. Not as good as the sugar ridden gluten ones, but it is a good alternative if you are trying to be gluten free. Good value for the money too.

review/summary: Tastes Great
review/text: This oatmeal is very tasty and is just as good as Quaker Instant oatmeal without the potential of gluten cross contamination. This oatmeal, along with Udis bread, makes a great quick gluten-free breakfast. Ordering the pack of 8 from Amazon is the way to go for me; much cheaper than buying at the store.  If you need to be careful about gluten, order this oatmeal; it's made at a 100% dedicated gluten-free facility.

review/summary: Great Gluten Free Instant Oatmeal
review/text: This instant oatmeal is great.  I have tried all the flavors and like them all.  It is sometims difficult to find good tasting gluten free items that are also healthy.  On Weight Watchers, each packet is only 5 points plus values but are also really filling.
