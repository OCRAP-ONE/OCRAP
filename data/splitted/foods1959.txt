review/summary: Tea with a Kick
review/text: I've enjoyed Good Earth tea especially when the restaurants were around.  Absolutely loved it!  Within the past several months, the only thing i could find is "decaf" good earth tea at local stores.  Don't know why they only carries the one without caffeine but the taste is totally different and i missed the "kick' from my morning tea.  Luckily, my husband found the Original Tea with Caffeine on Amazon for the best price i could find anywhere.  The tea tastes like spiced cinnamon and i serve it to many friends who love it.  Recommend it highly.  - couldn't live without it!

To Amazon's credit they refunded my money immediately (there are no returns in the grocery department).  However, I would have rather saved myself the hassle of placing the order at all had I know that it contained artificial flavors.

review/summary: Does NOT taste like tea. SO sweet.  If looking for a good black tea look elsewhere...
review/text: I ordered this tea based upon it having so many positive reviews. I was looking for a new good black tea and this seemed like it might be a good choice. Let me say it again, if you are looking for good tea then this is NOT what you want. This stuff does not taste like tea at all. It is REALLY sweet (not sure how, there is no sugar or artificial sweeteners). Its as if they just grind up a bunch of cinnamon and put it in a tea bag.<br /><br />If you notice, most positive reviews here are from people who do not like tea normally. Just do not be fooled into thinking that you are buying a quality black tea. I may be a bit of a tea snob, but I honestly cannot stand this stuff and ended up throwing away the entire order because neither I nor my friends can stand drinking it.

review/summary: Best diet food ever
review/text: Take time to prepare properly (rinse, blanch,dry fry) and you wil find that they taste like whatever else you're eating. I also suggest snipping them into small lengths as you drop them in the boiling water-it makes them easier to consume, because, out of the bag when you pick up one, you pick them all up. Try this: as you prepare the noodles, bring a cup of chicken broth to a boil, after dry frying drop the noodles in there, let 'em simmer while you saut&eacute; 100g of diced chicken, onion, celery, pepper, whatever.  Toss it all together, grate some ginger on it, and you've got a giant bowl of stir fry weighing in at less than 200 calories.  Amazing!

review/summary: Pretty Good Stuff...
review/text: I ordered the Heartland Blueberry Waffle Mix, the Heartland Malted Vanilla and the Carbon's Malted Original.  This is by far better than the Carbon's in my opinion.  The batter tastes like cake batter.  I was expecting the waffle to be sweet like cake, but it was just a really good waffle.  My 15 year old and I liked it the best.  My 11 year old and 17 year old liked the Heartland Malted Vanilla better. I know others have mentioned liking the Vanilla better so you are just going to have to try them both.<br /><br />The mix could not have been simpler.  3 parts mix to 2 parts cold water.  Mix.  Let sit for 15 minutes.  One thing that I've seen mentioned here and it bears repeating.  After it sits for 15 minutes, you are going to have to add a bit of water to the mix as it sets up too stiff.  Just a tablespoon or so should get it to waffle consistency.  Another thing mentioned is that your go to ladle is probably going to put too much on the waffle iron.  My first waffle spilled out of the iron.  (That is when I tasted the batter.)  The next waffle, I was careful to put a few tablespoons less on the iron and I got a perfect waffle.<br /><br />3 cups of mix yielded two Belgian waffles.<br /><br />I am using the Waring Waffle Maker Pro.  Setting 3 1/2.  Cook until only the faintest wisp of steam is coming from the iron.  You don't want to leave too much moisture in the waffle in case you want to freeze them.  Moisture creates water crystals that damage the waffle.

review/summary: Snikiddy Southwest Cheddar Cheese Fries
review/text: This review is for the Southwest Cheddar cheese fries by Snikiddy.  I've tried the regular Cheddar cheese ones as well, but that's a separate review.  I do have to say, the Southwest is much better than the regular flavor.<br /><br />Snikiddy is an all natural brand.  They use better, pronounceable ingredients.  Although there still is corn content.  They claim they are gluten free, vegetarian, no msg and even kosher.  This particular flavor has ramped up spices in its flavoring mix.  It even has white pepper, which is unusual for a snack food.  But good!  There's jalapeno powder too.  So you can definitely tell they took the Southwest aspect of this snack seriously.<br /><br />I really liked the taste of this snack. Unlike the regular cheddar, it had a tastier cheese flavor.  But wow, was it ever spicy.  My nose started running while I ate it because it was so spicy.  But even with the spicy, you could still taste the cheese.  The texture was still a little chewy while eating after the initial crunchiness, but with a better flavor it wasn't as bad.  The spiciness is a little much at times, but definitely worth it for the flavor.<br /><br />I really did enjoy this particular flavor of Snikiddy fries.  And considering there are limited flavors of Snikiddy snacks in my area I'm glad I liked at least one of the flavors.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

I'm kidding, but I do disagree and if I had read that review before trying, I may not have tried them.<br /><br />Anywho, found these at a local grocery store first. Took a chance on them and we were very surprised about how good they are, so I came here to buy them in bulk (quite a bit cheaper). They taste fresh and they don't leave me with a heavy feeling like the "andy capps" (or however you spell that) hot fries do. Super good snack and quite a bit heather than the others for sure. Every one we've shared them with ends up eating a bunch.

I received one shipment that was noticeably "muskier" than I thought typical of English Breakfast, with more of a peachy scent. It was in some ways more reminiscent of Twining's Prince of Wales rather than their English Breakfast. It seemed more weighted towards China rather than India or Ceylon, but there has been a bit of variation in the shipments. The one that was particularly "peachy" came in the middle of summer, so it is possible that the summer heat affected it in transit,. Alternatively, perhaps I received one mislabeled shipment. The majority of bags I have received have been recognizable as English Breakfast, but would take on a musky character if over-steeped.<br />This tea blend does not get bitter with prolonged steeping, but (as with many teas) its flavor is dependent on steep time. Three or four minutes will yield a character more like traditional English Breakfast, if you prefer that.<br />BOTTOM LINE: This is a pleasant cup of tea, and will stand up to milk or lemon just fine. It is potent without being bitter. However, If you are expecting something like standard English Breakfast blends, this may surprise you a bit if you are a long-steeper.

Now I drink this tea every day, well, multiple times a day. Sometimes plain, sometimes with splenda. It brews very well, even with filter-style automatic tea-makers. I make a liter at a time and take it with me to work. It tastes great hot or iced. If you're looking for a plain tea that goes with pretty much any meal or time of the day, this would be it. Also, it doesn't seem to be extremely strong in terms of caffeine.

No other tea has been this good and had such a robust flavor before. At first the flavor seemed too strong for me but then I tried with some milk and sweetner, and it is was the best thing I ever tasted. I recommend buying this online because it is very expensive in the store and you get a six pack for only [...] bucks, well worth its value. I recommend the red tea too, it is super delicious but sells out quickly.

review/text: I grew-up drinking tea. One thing about 'premium' teas is that after a while you get tired of their distinctive flavor and start longing for the 'regular' stuff.  Have been drinking the Good Earth Chai Tea for about 4 years now.  It used to be readily available on grocery shelves, now much harder to find. So get it from Amazon.com.  I drink it a couple times a week.  Pair it with a couple of regular teabags in a large mug.  That way you get a strong mug of tea, but the flavor doesn't get overpowering.<br />The aroma of this tea is simply awesome and I still enjoy it tremendously.  By comparison a gift of Mariage tea leaves (touted as the best in the world), got tiresome quickly.

review/summary: Costco fixed a problem!
review/text: :Update:  November 4 2011.  I was in Costco yesterday and looked at the 3 lb bag of "Kirkland Signature Almonds, U.S. #1, Supreme Whole".  These almonds were clearly labeled "Product of U.S.A.",  and "Grown in California", so I bought them.  They are absolutely delicious: chewy, rich, and flavorful. Costco wised up.  Good for them.  These delicious Almonds are a bargain and move from -100 to 5 stars.<br /><br />I do not believe these almonds are "Californian".  I believe they are a product of China or Turkey, and were dehydrated to bone dry for shipping and spoilage reasons.  These are not "Almonds" or even food.  They are rock hard almond shaped industrial crap.<br /><br />The language used in the labeling is very clever, and very vague.  If these Almonds were actually of Californian origin, they would say so.  I do not believe they are, since they are tooth breakingly rock hard and tasteless. I believe this this product is fraudulent.<br /><br /> "Take our Kirkland Signature California Almonds, for example."  very clever...  these are not California Almonds.  The copy writers use "California Almonds" as an "example". But that is not what is in the bag.  Lawyers checked off on this description as our bought and paid for USDA is too small to deal with these sorts of everyday consumer frauds.<br /><br />From the bag:<br /><br />"Kirkland Supreme Whole Almonds<br /><br />  * U.S. #1<br />  * Highest Quality.<br />  * All Natural.<br />  * Value Pack 48 oz (3 lb).<br /><br />Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest ones. Take our Kirkland Signature California Almonds, for example. The idea was simple: We wanted to provide the best quality, the best value and the best taste to our almond-loving member.<br /><br />Rich in nutrients, fiber and protein, yet low in saturated fat and free of cholesterol, our all natural, preservative-free whole almonds are 100-percent satisfaction guaranteed.<br /><br />Kirkland Signature Supreme Whole Almonds simply the best.<br /><br />Every Kirkland Signature product is guaranteed to meet or exceed the quality standards of the leading national brands."

review/summary: Amazing espresso on a budget
review/text: To get great espresso, you need the grind to be perfect.  Unless you're willing to shell out $350+ for a professional level grinder (like a Rancilio Rocky), you've got to buy pre-ground espresso (a less-than-professional burr grinder will cause your espresso to taste burnt and watery).  Most espresso connoisseurs will agree that Illy (the brand in the silver cans) produces the best pre-ground espresso; the only problem is the price: an 8.8 oz can will run you around $15, which puts the price per pound a little under $30.  I had tried the standard Lavazza before, and was unimpressed.  However, on a whim, I picked up a can of 'in Blu' a few days ago.....<br /><br />Let me cut to the chase: I would say that Lavazza in Blu is actually BETTER than Illy -- the taste and finish are perfect, and even in an inexpensive machine like a Krups, you can still get an amazing amount of crema.  With minimal effort, 'in Blu' will allow you to make, at home, espresso drinks that rival the quality of the nicest coffee shops (not to mention the subpar brews of S-bucks!).  The fact that over 2 lbs. of 'in Blu' goes for $22 is just the icing on the cake!<br /><br />A quick note about the actual flavor of the espresso; it's a tad sweeter than the usual dark roast, and works extremely well in a macchiato (just a small dollop of frothed milk on top of a solo espresso).  Even those who don't usually drink espresso will appreciate an 'in Blu' macchiato with a ginger snap on the side.  Seriously, try it!

review/text: This is excellent espresso and works great in my DeLonghi EC155.  The decaf version is also very good.  If you are new to making espresso, save yourself some stress and start with this.  One of the keys to gaining proficiency is reducing the variables.  Yes, grinding beans yourself will get you slightly fresher espresso, but when there are problems what do you need to fix?  The grind?  The roast?  Your tamping?  The espresso maker?  Once you are proficient with this excellent expertly ground espresso, you will be in a much better position to experiment with grinding your own.

review/summary: I love it for my my morning latte!
review/text: I am not that picky, but because I can't afford a good burr grinder, I need preground espresso. And I mostly use espresso for lattes. I know, I know, I'm not a purist. I tried several brands from the store and they were absolutely terrible. Then a friend recommended Illy. I tried both the Illy dark and medium roast, and they were great on their own, but the dark roast overwhelmed my latte and the medium roast wasn't quite strong enough. I needed to find a "middle ground."<br /><br />Enter Lavazza in Blu. It makes the best latte. I DO like the Illy better on its own than the Lavazza in Blu. But for a latte, hands down, the Lavazza in Blu wins. This is going to sound odd, but I think it's because it has more of a "generic" taste than the Illy. With the Illy, I could never get the right amount for a latte. It was either too strong or weak for my latte (even when I weighed it on my food scale). With Lavazza, it feels almost fool-proof. I've made about 20 lattes with the Lavazza. Every single one has been fabulous. (As an aside, both the Illy and the Lavazza win hands-down over Sbux, even in my cheap espresso machine.)<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this is great preground espresso. The grind is perfect for my low-end (Mr. Coffee) pump espresso machine. And it makes a fantastic latte! No bitterness or noticeable acidity. And it's half the cost of Illy. The only problem is that I have yet to find this particular Lavazza product in any stores in my area.

review/text: I was introduced to Lavazza coffee in Victoria, BC.  Everyone who visits me loves it.  I make it in a regular coffee maker, not an expresso machine, and drink it for my regular morning coffee.  I am thinking of getting an expresso maker just for it.

review/summary: So far, the best Espresso
review/text: I've tried several brands and blends of espresso, but they all seem to taste very similar.  Most have a strong aroma and dark color.  Seems they all have a twinge of bitterness or a "bite".  It could also be an effect of the caffeine.<br /><br />This was very different.  It was smooth, yet strong and it was perfect in my machine over a 15s pull.  It was nice in cappuccino as well, but better as a straight espresso.<br /><br />For the price, this is the best value in espresso!

review/summary: Excellent Taste - Very Fine Ground
review/text: So I was very excited to get this - (being deployed to some far off location, this is up-town). We smuggled our espresso machine into country and were looking for good grinds. If you want something out here it must be ordered. Anyway onto the good stuff...<br /><br />The grind is so fine that my machine has trouble forcing enough pressure through without clogging the filter, or grate, or whatever the cup is that it sits in. I have a 15 bar pump machine and using the Lavazza Creama de so and so - it works perfect but it seems the grind on the in Blu is just too fine for my machine. I get barely a shot out of a 2 shot fill. This is very disappointing because...<br /><br />... after drinking my first shot - my eyes lit up and was like WOW! It was very smooth tasting and a nice mocha/cocoa taste to it. I was very pleased with the taste. I hate that it doesn't work that well out here. Looks like when I get home I will have to order a better machine JUST so I can brew this one. I'm considering just mixing the Crema de whatever with in Blu so I can get a good shot...<br /><br />I'm giving this product 5 stars for the taste and the grind  - Bad on my machine for letting me down... if I weren't deployed in some far off place.!.

review/summary: excellent buy at a very reasonable price
review/text: 4 cans showed up in a box. The shipping was just over 13 bucks but that's about the standard rate for USPS type package. Can't blame the guy for charging a couple of extra bucks for supplies and handling. fair deal.<br /><br />the coffee is good coffee but i'm only giving it 3 stars because of freshness.<br />it's may 2012 now and the coffee expires in october 2012. that's pretty darn short and the batch is relatively old i'd say.<br />it should run out to at least 2013. so that's where 3 starts are coming from.<br /><br />i would order again but next time i will definitely drop seller a note to ask about the batch expiration date. If not fresh, i'd cancel the order and shop elsewhere for a few more bucks unless you can burn through 4 cans quickly. But coffee is coffee.. no matter what you want it as fresh as possible.<br />i have the same can bought on amazon and it expires in mid 2013.<br /><br />so minus the freshness part, the deal is good.

review/summary: Brews a Superior Cup of Coffee in My Senseo
review/text: Wow.  This Lavazza in Blu has brewed what is by far the best cup of coffee I've had from my new Senseo coffee maker.  If you are looking for a way to use your Senseo machine in the US now that the coffee pods are hard to come by, look no further than Lavazza in Blu brewed using the "Coffee Duck" permanent coffee pod.  The flavor is far superior to that from Senseo pods.<br /><br />For those who don't know, Senseo is a line of single-cup coffee makers and coffee which is extremely popular in parts of Europe.  It's sort of the Keurig of Europe, although the machines operate differently and in my opinion, Senseo is superior.  The Senseo brews using coffee "pods" (sort of pre-filled and sealed paper filters) and one of the best things about it is that while it brews regular coffee (this is NOT an espresso maker) the pressure-brewing process results in a thick crema, very similar to that of espresso.<br /><br />After a recent trip to the Netherlands, I decided that I wanted to buy a Senseo maker, and discovered that Target offered American versions online.  Of course I didn't think to check whether the pods were available - after all, if the machines are made available to the American market, all the other things necessary for using the machine should be available. Alas, right after receiving my machine, I learned that the whole Senseo line was being discontinued in the US, with the pods (both Senseo brand and other brands) disappearing from stores before the machines stopped being sold.  My machine came with one 18-pack of Senseo brand coffee pods, and then I was on my own to buy more from very limited online sources! The coffee pods are only made by Senseo and a couple other manufacturers, unlike K-cups which are everywhere now.<br /><br />I discovered that there are some after-market "permanent pods" which you can fill with any coffee of your choosing.  I purchased the Coffee Duck (which I like - will write a review of it) and tried a few different kinds of coffee.  Lavazza in Blu is hands-down the winner (and, has a fine espresso grind which is the preferred type for use in any after-market pod.)  I will soon be trying in Blu in my Bialetti Moka stove-top espresso pot, as well as a standard drip coffee maker, and expect fabulous results, too.  Unfortunately the Coffee Duck changes things a bit, so less crema is produced when coffee in brewed in the Senseo. But, I can give that up for the smooth taste of the Lavazza.  This is definitely the coffee for someone who loves full-bodied flavor which is also smooth and non-acidic.  I'm a fan of coffee with skim milk, but I can even drink this black.  I liken this to my discovery of more expensive hard liquors, which can be sipped straight rather than being covered up or toned down by mixers.  It is pure and smooth.<br /><br />I apologize if my review seems to be just as much a review of the Senseo coffee maker as of Lavazza in Blu, but I know that those with the Senseo are looking for ways to make it work now that the coffee pods are hard to find.  Even when the coffee pods were available in US stores, many Senseo owners chose to use after-market pod holders in order to save money, or brew a better tasting cup of coffee.  Senseo brand coffee is "just okay," and many have viewed the Senseo as an okay machine for brewing a fast cup of coffee, but not a machine which can produce anything special.  But, I believe it's all in the coffee.  There are many better brands of coffee than Senseo and the other kinds which have been available in the pods.  Lavazza in Blu makes an all around great cup of coffee for both coffee afficionados and everyday coffee drinkers. It seems like the rare coffee which everyone will like.  Some might prefer something stronger, but no one can really find anything offensive about it.  It's definitely worth the extra cost.

review/text: I am not a huge fan of coffee, but I love cappuccino though, so I have a red Gaggia espresso machine, which makes great cappuccino. And I used illy's espresso pods first, but then switched to loose espresso and went with Lavazza's in Blu after reading positive reviews. I am quite happy with the purchase; the taste is lovely and it works great in my machine.

review/summary: Perfect preground espresso
review/text: I read somewhere that this was the only espresso worth buying preground and to give it a try if you didn't want to spend $300 on a Rocky or similar big-buck grinder. The taste is smooth and sweet, not overpowering or bitter. It's a great espresso, affordable, proper grind, and works with my Sylvia - which by all accounts can be a temperamental machine. I've been using Blu + Sylvia for over a year now and get perfect espresso for shots or latte/cappuccino drinks every time.

review/text: I bough this elsewhere but wanted to put my $.02 in. The coffee is good, but it drips slowly from my machine where others flow very well.

For the same price, I'd get the black can.

review/text: A friend served us some coffee -- among the best I've ever had.  She said it was unconventional -- an expresso grind used in a automatic drip pot.  And she gave us a can.  Now it's all we drink.<br /><br />Use it as if it were a grind for automatic drip pots -- you'll be glad you tried it.  Smooth but full-bodied.  A perfect drink, in our opinion.<br /><br />And Amazon's subscription of 4-cans for under $24 makes it most affordable.

In the midwest, where I brought them home, those who'd not seen them for years (having lived in Japan or on the west coast) were thrilled to have them again.  All my friends and family love them.  You CAN get them in the big W big box store, but they are shorter, you get half the weight per box, and you end up paying more.  Buy them here!  That's what I have been doing repeatedly since coming back from the west coast.

review/summary: Good and not overpowering.
review/text: I've tried almost every pocky flavor there is to try and if not mistaken, milk chocolate is the original pocky flavor.  In the range of pocky this falls straight in the middle, perhaps slightly over to the + side. I want to say the cookie type pretzel stick is virtually tasteless.  You wouldn't want to eat it alone.  The chocolate is smooth and not very sweet, which I like. Pocky also has a nice snap to them which satisfies the crunch addict me. If you've never tried a Pocky and don't know where to begin, I recommend starting at the beginning with milk chocolate.  (3.5 stars)<br /><br />By the way, don't forget to try my favorite, almond pocky.  The grade of chocolate is better so usually they cost more.  I think they're geared towards adults.  The banana dessert pocky is pretty good, too.

review/text: I have to admit, that Glico sometimes have made some exceptional snacks with their Pocky range, such as their Pocky Strawberry, which is a blast. With this milk chocolate version, I was not so impressed.<br /><br />The idea is the same: pretzel stick dipped in chocolate. It is not as sweet as some, so those who do not like sugar-induced psychosis will appreciate these snacks.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is ok, but I found myself rather quickly bored with them. Other varieties of Pocky were much more interesting. Having said that, they make a great reading snack, as they do not leave your fingers covered in garbage, and your pages stay clean.<br /><br />Not a bad snack, but a little boring for me.

review/text: ****<br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to "Weightless" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: "For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming." So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: "Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs."<br />****

review/summary: Loved it
review/text: I wanted a dark rich tea for my mornings. I use a coffee pot and brew 10 cups at a time. This was perfect. Strong, not bitter, good all-around flavor. Yes I suppose a purist may quibble, but I found this to be much better than other straight Assam teas (like the Davidson).

review/summary: TGFOP  Organic Assam Tea
review/text: The leaves are large and dark suggestive of heavy processing. Very few tips if any are visible. Good fragrance/bouquet--flowery.<br />Steeped 1 tsp in boiling hot water -- large cup; the result was a heavy dark brew -- like coffee. Not the light golden brew of a good FOP Assamese. The liquor heavily tainted the inside of the cups with a dark film residue. Taste slightly corky.<br />Tried 1/2 tsp and later a large pinch. Same dark  brew and film residues.<br />The product appears to heavily doctored/colored and not organic or tippy FOP as claimed. Disappointing.

review/summary: Authentic Costa Rica sauce
review/text: We first leaned of this after being in Costa Rica, where it is served with every meal.  Soooo good!  Excellent on omelets and also a dish we call Costa Rica Chicken, make some rice and black beans, saut&eacute; chicken in light oil, achiote and Lizano, add green peppers, onions at end, cook to blend flavors but keep crisp.  Serve over rice and beans, maybe with a little extra sauce to top it off and prepare for a savory, delicious dinner.  Scrumptious meal.

review/summary: Heat up the chocolate disc
review/text: These taste great as long as you warm up the chocolate disc before brewing it. I run hot water over it while the milk disc brews.<br /><br />If it is too cold in your house, they will be too solid and hardly anything will come out. It will just taste like hot water-milk. I'm guessing thats what any complaints are caused by. Check the disc after you brew, it should be empty.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: My family loves this beverage. I "brew" the chocolate disc first and then the milk disc, not sure what is recommended, but this works for me. I typically press the manual brewing button to add just a bit more water to the chocolate disc. To make a "mocha" I add an espresso disc, really, really good!

review/summary: It Doesn't Deserve ANY Stars.
review/text: After trying this for myself, I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, the Jacobs Latte Macchiato isn't bad if you add sugar. This morning though, I drank it after I tried the Voluptuoso and my mouth has a metallic taste to it. Not sure which one is responsible. Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there. For the 2nd decent beverage, you can take the Kenco Crema with some Coffee Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount) creamers, with enough sugar, and have a nice smooth cappaccino. I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee, as well as, having your mouth taste like you just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the coffees I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema and Jacob's Macchiato. After finding one inferior brew after another, I've given up looking for a good cup of black coffee and/or cappaccino, for the Tassimo. Don't do what I did, which was believe all the positive reviews and downplay the critical reviews. My curiousity has been appeased after spending $34 in Tassimo beverages. Thankfully, 2 packages were free. Now I can either spend more money in S&H to return them, or drink all 56 cigarettes...coffee I mean. Oh by the way, for a tasty hot chocolate beverage, try Celestial Seasonings "Tuscanny" 1 bag made strong, followed by 2 pkgs Carnation Instant Hot Chocolate, with mini marshmellows, and hot water in a tall to-go insulated mug. Amazon sells both, but you can get the chocolate mix on sale for about $1.50 in a grocer.

review/summary: melts in your mouth, not in your hands
review/text: These candies were offered at a great price, with amazon prime shipping.  They arrived very quickly and were very fresh tasting.  Plus, no broken candies, so they were handled very well, by amazon.  The only problem is they were eaten too fast.  I would definitely order them again, from amazon.

review/summary: Apricot Pit Cookies
review/text: Apricot Pit Cookies? Say what? That's right, motherflippers. It's an apricot cookie and it's mighty tasty. I bought this using the "add on" feature and it was the bomb! I just absolutely love these very tasty Italian cookies - they really are made out of apricot pits and they are way too tasty.
