review/summary: Vanilla and Coffee, excellent combination. But Starbucks burnt flavor is overpowering.
review/text: This coffee smells fabulous. Brew a cup and the whole house smells great. Vanilla and coffee together is a match made in heaven. Allow a small piece of dark chocolate to melt in your mouth with this coffee, and that is even better. I just didn't care for the Starbucks burnt bean flavor.<br /><br />If you love the Starbucks burnt roast flavor of their coffee, it is possible that you will love this coffee. The vanilla flavor is clearly present at exactly the right level, not so overbearing that the coffee tastes like vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this is not a shot of vanilla sugar syrup for your coffee. Nor is it a Mini-Moo French Vanilla cream addition. The flavor is one of coffee, pure very dark roasted Starbucks coffee, and vanilla, no sweetness or milk flavor.<br /><br />The package directions, 2 tablespoons of coffee per six ounce cup is extremely strong, especially if made in a French press. I love espresso, am addicted to Nespresso (three each morning), really strong coffee in France and Italy, and Turkish coffee without sugar. I drink all coffee black. So I am not afraid of a strong coffee. The problem for me, Starbucks burns their beans, and it imparts a flavor that I just don't enjoy. Clearly a bazillion people disagree with me. However, these directions made coffee that was just way too strong. It might be fine in a drip coffee maker, but certainly not a French Press with water at exactly 180 degrees.

review/summary: Mild, but great, great aroma.
review/text: Have this handy when entertaining guests; great aroma.<br /><br />It is a milder coffee, perhaps perfect for those folks who don't want the strong coffee that most of us prefer, it seems, these days.<br /><br />It will not be my first choice for myself, but I will keep it on hand for guests. Very nice.<br /><br />By the way, all packages of Starbucks (when empty) entitle you to a free coffee at your local Starbucks. Practically cuts the price of a package of Starbucks coffee in half. Don't throw those empty packages away!

review/summary: Excellent when perfectly brewed.
review/text: Being a major Starbucks fan and lover of vanilla, I couldn't pass up the chance to try the Vanilla flavored coffee. I expected the coffee to just have a hint of vanilla to it like most flavored (unsweetened) coffees do. I was, therefor, surprised when I took the first sip of this delicious coffee. Following the directions to the letter, I brewed a full-bodied excellent cup of vanilla flavored coffee. Way to go Starbucks! Adding a little sweetener and creamer to your coffee makes it taste like a vanilla latte. You can jump up the flavor with a shot of flavored syrup or creamer. My son added cocoa to his cup and said it was like having a tuxedo. I would recommend serving this coffee to guests for the holidays. It fills the house with the soothing and warm scent of vanilla.

review/summary: Packs A Punch
review/text: Although the vanilla & sarsaparilla flavor is best described as "subtle", this Starbucks coffee<br />must surely have the highest caffeine content of any coffee I've tried short of Espresso. Several<br />hours after I finished a normal-sized cup, I still felt wired! That, combined with the bold flavor<br />of the beans themselves, makes the Natural Fusions a brew not for the faint-hearted. It's also not<br />too highly priced compared to certain others, which makes it a very good buy of its type. You may<br />wish to start with a lesser amount than usual when trying this coffee for the first time, then<br />make adjustments according to your taste. If you are used to traditional supermarket coffee, this<br />Starbucks blend will blow you away. You can bring the empty bag to a Starbucks location to receive<br />a free 12-ouncer, which sweetens the deal. I recommend this blend, but new users are advised to<br />proceed with caution!

review/summary: Nice coffee...
review/text: Opened the pack, took a smell & found fresh coffee inside which smelled nice so I brewed my first pot. Poured a cup then tasted a few sips black. What I found was a light body somewhat like Starbuck's brand Breakfast Blend with a hint of vanilla flavor that wasn't too strong or overpowering with no off flavors of any kind. Great I thought, now to add the usual 2 spoons of sugar. Did that, took a sip & found the coffee to be pretty good with some vanilla flavor still there. To sum up it's a nice coffee that I'll enjoy drinking even though I'll admit that I prefer the darker roasts like French Roast, Sumatra & Italian Roast. Not quite a 5 star coffee but still good enough for drinking anytime during the morning, throughout the day or in the evening. Will be sharing some of this pack with two friends who like light body coffee's to see what they think of it. But as for myself I don't think I'll be buying this coffee very often, Maybe once or twice per year.<br /><br />Edit to post: This coffee seems to be weaker in the caffeine content than the Starbuck's darker roast coffee's. Not a complaint, just for your information if you like less caffeine in your coffee.

review/summary: Slightly better than other flavored coffees
review/text: Because your baseline tastes may well differ from mine, here's where I'm coming from: I'm not a fan of artificially flavored coffees, but I do like an occasional shake of cinnamon or cocoa in my coffee--and a pinch of cardamom is awesome. I do like Starbucks coffee--some people say it tastes burnt, though, or is over-roasted. I take my coffee black or with cream, and only occasionally add some Splenda -- I don't "do" sugar. I dislike the "Bailey's Irish Cream"/butter pecan/you name it -flavored-type coffees--they taste of artificial flavors to me, and the quality of the coffee isn't that good. So I set out to try the new Starbucks ground "naturally" flavored coffees...<br /><br />Well, this was rather disappointing. I know that "natural flavors" doesn't necessarily mean "natural vanilla flavor"-- all it means is that the flavorings are derived from plants and not petroleum--could well be from pine trees. This coffee lists in order the following ingredients: ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root. .... Now, we don't know what the "natural flavors" are, but they are something different from ground vanilla beans, and listed before them. The sarsaparilla root is kind of weird too-- sarsaparilla, the beverage, tastes like root beer! Well, this has that "artificially flavored coffee" taste--smells and tastes a lot like Bailey's Irish Cream flavored coffee, although the underlying coffee is much better than you might get from a supermarket brand of flavored coffee--it's Starbucks, after all.  I put Splenda in mine, as well as cream--not very pleasant on its own.<br /><br />On the plus side, you can control how sweet you make it, and use the sweetener you prefer--but why not just put a glug of natural vanilla extract or some ground vanilla beans in your regular coffee yourself? That way your coffee maker doesn't get all flavored up, either.<br /><br />and--it's not the 3/4 lb. (12 oz)  bag you might have become accustomed to (remember when all coffee came in a full pound bag?) --it's only 11 oz!! I guess they think we aren't paying attention.

review/summary: I don't love it
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of Starbucks regular coffees, although I admit to buying their specialty drinks (like the pumpkin spice latte). I tend to think their coffee is too strong and a little bitter. I thought the vanilla would be smoother, and if brewing it myself, I could keep it from being too strong. When I opened the pouch, the vanilla smell was definitely there, and I thought this would be smooth, delicious coffee. After brewing a pot, I really couldn't taste the vanilla at all, and the coffee tastes just like the usual Starbucks fare -- strong and a little bitter. I sweetened it, I put some milk in it -- still not very pleasant. If you like Starbucks coffee, you'll probably like this, but don't expect to get the vanilla flavor.

I have been using this for about a week and am very happy with this product.<br /><br />I grind my own Columbian beans and then add a spoonful of Starbucks Vanilla Flavored Coffee to the ground beans.

review/summary: Delicious but expensive
review/text: We really liked this coffee - it smells great and the taste is rich, intense, smooth and delicious. Brewing instructions state that two rounded tablespoons should be used per cup which is way too much unless you want to grow hair on your chest. Another tip - some reviewers have mentioned bitterness - a pinch of kosher salt added to the coffee grounds which counteracts bitterness. After drinking this, I'm looking forward to trying the caramel flavor. However, the price of this small 11 oz. bag is way too expensive and I can find equally good coffee for half this price at my local market.

review/summary: Disappointing - Not a Premium Roast
review/text: This Thanksgiving evening, four of us tried the Starbucks Vanilla Roast. All of us were disappointed. Comments included: 'bitter', 'too acidic', 'flat', 'vanilla smell overcomes the coffee aroma'. When drinking the vanilla roast, the bitterness outweighs the coffee taste and the vanilla is all but invisible. Most coffees are average and this one is no different. It is no star when it comes to the coffee field. If you are a serious coffee connoisseur or would like to find out more about great coffee, you will be best served by investigating premium roasts available from other (often less mainstream) roasters.

It doesn't even really taste like vanilla to me -- just like some kind of flavored hot beverage.

review/summary: Pleasant flavor
review/text: As soon as I received Starbuck's Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee, I brewed up a few cups.  This is conveniently packaged, since one can scoop out what one wants, and re-seal the package for the refrigerator.<br /><br />I use a Chemex coffee maker because it's all glass, and uses a quality laboratory-quality filter, so off-flavors are minimized.  This lets the coffee flavor shine through.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is apparent from the time one opens the package, with the wonderful smell of vanilla wafting up to your nose.  Brewing it is a breeze; it's got a good blend size that permits the Chemex to function very well, and percolate through the coffee quickly.<br /><br />The flavor and taste of coffee is why we drink it.  And here the Starbucks comes through fine.  But beware; this is not overly cloying flavor masking the taste of the coffee; instead, the vanilla flavor adds to the coffee taste, rather than overwhelming it, as you can get in those 'international flavor' instant coffees.<br /><br />Recommended.  This is a full-flavored coffee, perhaps even more on the dark-roasted side (at least that was the flavor to me).  I'm more of a fan of the regular roast, so it was a bit heavy for me.  Even so, it was a nice cup of coffee.  And if one is a full-bodied roast fan, this would be very, very good.  Four stars for the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Coffee.

review/summary: I like vanilla, but this is pretty intense
review/text: This is ground Starbucks Arabica coffee, which has been infused with intense vanilla flavoring.  My first impression was the aroma of the coffee upon opening the package - very nice vanilla aroma, but strong. When I made my first pot of coffee I used the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla alone.  For me, this was a mistake.  WAY too sweet, and I like vanilla flavored creamer in my coffee, but used plain half n' half for this one and it still tasted too sweet to me.<br /><br />The second pot I chose to mix this coffee (50/50) with a Kona blend from the local market.  My husband still thought the blend to be too sweet, but I liked it.  I guess the bonus here would be that if you like a more subtle, less sweet vanilla flavoring to your coffee the package will last you that much longer when you blend it with something non-flavored!<br /><br />I give it a 3-star rating because to me, it's just OK.  I can't say I like it, but I don't dislike it either.<br /><br />The packaging says 'an accent of vanilla' and 'an understated vanilla highlight'.  I'd beg to differ.  I'd say something like infused with a 'strong vanilla overtone'.  The ground coffee contains ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root.<br /><br />Maybe it's the root that does it?  Whatever it is, be prepared to enjoy this arabica coffee only if you really enjoy sweet, intense vanilla flavor.

review/summary: Brew it cold!
review/text: Okay, here's the deal.  I make salad dressing from scratch.  I get out a nice, green fruity extra virgin olive oil and spices and some decent white or red wine vinegar, and make something entirely superior to, while still generally cheaper than, those supermarket blends of indifferent grade spices and chemical thickeners, swimming in mostly-canola oil.<br /><br />And why the heck am I talking salad dressing in a coffee review?<br /><br />I make coffee, I tend towards the similarly purist.  Whole bean.  You can get a basic grinder model for the price of a pound or two of the beans, and pre-ground is pre-staled, under the best of circumstances.  As for flavoring?  Flavoring is something I've long believed was invented by coffee brokers to get the lower grade stuff off their shelves.  And those flavors are generally lab-created, both for economy and for more precise/consistent control of the product.<br /><br />So I obviously come to this coffee with my biases, but I also love Starbucks coffees, bought whole from a Starbucks storefront.  I do notice a quality difference right away with the supermarket blends - I think in their own stores, the beans just turn over faster.<br /><br />Yet, as it happens, Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla coffee has (for me) a few advantages - chiefly, natural flavoring.  In this case, vanilla, and sasparilla, long a favorite ingredient of old-fashioned carbonated beverages.<br /><br />Brewed my first cup in my coffee maker.  And I hated it.  Very odd, unpleasant, cloying, bad, chemical taste.  Any vanilla taste or aroma, stayed behind in the bag.  Now, other reviewers clearly, have loved it.  Did I get a bad batch?  (This happens.  What one reviewer says about one bag has to be taken as one data point only.)<br /><br />Unwilling to give up on a perfectly, well, full bag, I decided to try cold brewing.  You can buy a fancy appliance (Amazon here carries no less than 4 systems for the purpose), or you can acquire a largish (6" or so) fine mesh strainer and a quart jar.  Stir together � lb of ground coffee with 4.5 cups cold water, and refrigerate overnight.  Strain the next day, and the resulting concentrate stays fresh tasting for a week or 2.  You'll need to add water in a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 ratio, with the "1" being the concentrate.<br /><br />The cold brewing technique has its pros and cons.  Pro:  it's really convenient to make a week's worth of concentrate, as most of the "work" is just giving it the time to steep.  For the acid sensitive or just those who just prefer a smoother brew, it is a miracle.  But for the "Con": the real nuance and complexity of some of the best coffees comes along with the coffee oils that release under HEAT, and I do notice some flavor loss with some of my favorite coffees, cold brewed.<br /><br />Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla was made for cold brewing.  The delicate essence of non-lab created flavors held up much better un-"cooked".  I tasted vanilla, and yes, even the sasparilla, which people tend to know from Root Beer.  The off notes were still there in the background but more carbonated-soda reminiscent than they were harsh or offensive.  And yes, this is darning with faint praise, but...<br /><br />I'd buy this.  If I had a group to caffeinate for a hot summer event, and minimal time to futz with grinders or syrups or vanilla beans or cooling and icing hot coffee, this would be the trick.<br /><br />For home use...sorry.  Whole beans.  An extra 30 seconds of effort for 10 times more taste, and maybe a dollop of the Torani syrup, if my heart is set on flavoring.<br /><br />So, Starbucks, if you can "infuse" a whole bean with all natural flavors, I'd love to hear about it.  Maybe you could just sell the beans with a bottle of ground vanilla/cinnamon/nutmeg/whatever powder like you have in your stores - low tech, but lovely.  In the meantime, 3 stars for a catering/get-together blend that is admittedly worlds better than you average foodservice pre-ground.<br /><br />Just brew it cold.

review/summary: understated, natural-flavored coffee
review/text: I have a bad image of flavored coffees because, so often, tons of artificial flavor is used to cover up bad coffee and sell it as "premium".  This coffee is better than that.<br /><br />This Starbucks Natural Fusions (Vanilla) is decent coffee, with a modest amount of natural vanilla and sarsaparilla flavor added.  The result is more balanced and drinkable.<br /><br />- The grind: not as uniform as some pre-ground brands (Melitta).  It left considerable dust on my hands.  Minus one star.<br /><br />- Freshness: no noticeable staleness.  Smells good but not as sweet as freshly roasted coffee, of course.<br /><br />- Packaging:  Easy to open, easy to reclose.  Was shipped with minimal air space.<br /><br />Verdict: The best pre-ground, flavored coffee I've tried, only loses a star for a non-uniform grind.  It just tastes good, and I'm not a big flavored coffee fan.

review/summary: Good, just not...really good
review/text: I'm not any kind of coffee snob since I usually kill it with creamer anyway, but I do love my flavored coffee, vanilla expecially.  I've had some mixed results with Starbucks coffee, generally preferring their plain roasts, but I've never tried Fusions.  I think I'd rather stick to another brand for my flavored.<br /><br />The bag itself was a lot different from nearly any bag of coffee I'd ever purchased pre-packaged.  It was sealed, but not vaccum-packed, and the loose grounds only filled about 2/3s of the bag.  This isn't a brick.  It also was extremely easy to open, which was nice for my fingers, but considering what I usually end up wrestling with in other mail-order coffees, I wonder if the other stuff was unnecessarily difficult or if this was just packed the right way.<br /><br />The grounds had very mild vanilla scent, nothing like the beans you grind in the stores or even inexpensive stuff you buy in cans.  It didn't get any stronger when I brewed it.  I was afraid I hadn't used enough grounds, since I hadn't used the recommended amount (it was double what I use with my usual grounds), so I made another pot and had the same results.  While the second pot tasted better overall, it wasn't really any more "vanilla" than the first and it still had a little bit of a medicinal flavor to it.<br /><br />My recommendation if you really want a good aromatic vanilla flavor would be to stick to another brand coffee; Millstone and Melitta make good versions if you want to go the fancier route and if you're lucky and live in the area or can get it mailed to you, Steep and Brew is the best I've ever had.  Honestly, the various kinds of Folgers vanilla give better taste bang than this.

review/summary: Better than in the store
review/text: I am not a real big fan of starbucks coffee but I do occasionally drink it and I can taste that undeniable unique flavor that starbucks has. The think about buying the coffee like this is that I can tailor it to my taste. The instructions say two tablespoons per 6 ounces of water. Me? I use 1 rounded teaspoon per six ounces and its perfect. Good starbucks flavor with a hint of vanilla and that unique starbucks flavor (and aroma). Good coffee. This is why I say buying it this way is much better than getting it in the store. Much cheaper too.

review/summary: Mellower than other Starbucks coffee with a slightly vanilla-ish flavor
review/text: Just so you know where I'm coming from:  I find most Starbucks Coffee to be a bit strong for my tastes, and I prefer flavored coffees (the horror!), like hazelnut or vanilla.  So I was very curious to try this new blend from Starbucks.<br /><br />I quite like it.  It's definitely stronger than the stuff I'm used to, although Starbucks diehards will probably find it a bit weaker than they prefer.  It doesn't have an overbearing vanilla taste; it's more of a hint than a strongly defined flavor.  I drink my coffee black, and there is a nice complexity of flavors that comes through.<br /><br />All in all, this is a nice, somewhat strong coffee with a hint of vanilla aroma.  It'd be a nice after-dinner coffee, with the hint of vanilla complimenting dessert.  Best of all, it splits the difference between heavy-duty coffee drinkers like my husband and more wussy coffee drinkers like myself.  With this blend, we could brew one pot of coffee and each drink it happily.

review/summary: Goodbye Plain Vanila Vanila Creamers
review/text: Starbucks coffee, in particular the dark French Roast blend, is one of my favorites. When Starbucks came up with the Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />First impressions:  The vanilla flavored coffee is full-bodied and smooth. It is best described as a dark French Roast with a *hint* of vanilla flavor, which complements the coffee quite nicely. Now, for folks who are into vanilla-flavored creamers, you will appreciate being able to use as much creamer as you like without worrying about overpowering your coffee with vanilla.<br /><br />I'm not a particularly big fan of flavored coffee, but I am surprised I actually enjoyed this coffee a fair bit. I'm glad that it's flavored with real vanilla beans, not with artificial flavoring. Give the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee a try. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

review/summary: "Natural Infusions"...kind of.
review/text: If you are a fan of vanilla, which I am, this is a fine tasting coffee with a nice overlay of flavor to the usual Starbucks roast. The grounds have a rich, nutty aroma and it brew up nicely. My only issue is that even with its fancy name, it still tastes like an added flavor and not "infused" with the beans themselves. To me, it tastes very similar to products from other big American brands -- suitable for most general purposes but for a truly exceptional cup of coffee you'll have to pony up a little more.

review/summary: Very Rich and Dark
review/text: Every Starbucks coffee I've ever tried brews up so strong and dark that I always have to reduce the amount of coffee from what the directions recommend (usually by as much as half.) This flavorful, rich coffee is no different in that respect. First off, I must admit that I really don't care much for flavored coffees as I prefer actual coffee-flavored coffee. I also use a standard, automatic-drip machine (think Mr. Coffee), so I guess I'm not expert. But I do drink coffee daily and I love a good cup of rich, smooth coffee with a little real cream added. If you like your coffee VERY strong, brew this one according to package directions. I brewed it with half of the recommended amount and mixed in some Folger's decaf to round it out. You may be surprised to know that the result was a still-very-strong coffee (that some folks in my house wanted to dilute with water) that was smooth and tasty with just the right touch of vanilla. My husband drank it black and said it was "fine" but his only requirement of coffee is that it be strong, so this fit the bill. I added my usual cream and a distinctly unusual half-teaspoon of sugar. The result was a delicious, smooth, creamy coffee with a kick of sweet vanilla. Although I'm still no big fan of sweet or flavored coffee, I give this a big thumbs-up for taste. Since the holidays are approaching, I can see our family drinking this with dessert (or even as dessert after some turkey and dressing), and I also am considering picking up a few bags as holiday gifts. If you like Starbucks coffee this may be one you'd like to try.

review/summary: good, not great, flavor
review/text: I've tried three different flavors of Starbucks "Natural Fusions" coffee so far.  Even though I love cinnamon and sometimes add some ground cinnamon to my coffee grounds to flavor regular coffee, I didn't much care for the flavor of Starbucks cinnamon flavored coffee.  This vanilla flavor is pretty good, however, though I will say that I don't like it enough to buy it again.  The real winner of the three is the caramel flavor.  While drinking it won't make you think you're eating a caramel candy, it does have a very pleasing flavor whether consumed hot or cold.  That's the only flavor of the three that I have purchased repeatedly and will purchase again.<br /><br />As for the underlying coffee flavor of this particular flavor, I think it suffices to say that it tastes like a medium roasted Starbucks coffee.  I happen to like Starbucks' coffee beans, but I know some people don't care for the brand.  If you're a fan of Starbucks, this roast/flavor is consistent with what you've come to expect from them.

review/summary: just a hint of vanilla goes a long way
review/text: I'm a Starbucks junkie.  I need my daily soy latte.  But I've never been a fan of their coffee.  I've tried a couple different brews and thought they had a strange, bitter after taste.  I think their coffee is undrinkable black.  I've tried to add sugar, cream, milk, half and half in different combinations and it just didn't taste good to me so I stopped wasting my money.  But since this was free through Vine, I thought I would try this one to see if it was more of the same and was pleasantly surprised.  Instead of the recommended 2 TBS for every 6 ounces of water, I just use one heaping tablespoon, which may have toned it down a bit.  Because the vanilla is infused, it gives a subtle sweetness to the coffee but doesn't overpower it.  All I needed was a little milk to top it off!<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it's good but not my favorite.

review/summary: A Great Cup of Coffee
review/text: NOTE: This is a VINE review.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect from this bag of "Natural Fusions Vanilla" coffee from Starbucks.  Here's what I got: The coffee out of the bag smells and looks great. The ground beans have a medium to fine consistency.  Two thumbs up so far.<br /><br />I brewed a few cups with filtered water and the excellent aroma exploded.  The aroma gets a 10 out of 10 in my book.  The coffee in the mug also has a nice color and texture (brewed strong with filtered water it is medium-bodied).<br /><br />The overall taste of the coffee is also very good.  The vanilla is sort of "behind" the coffee, so it doesn't jump out at you but you know it is there.  I've had other vanilla coffees in which the vanilla overpowers everything; the Starbucks vanilla doesn't do that at all.  I like that.  Along with the vanilla, there may be some hints of butter and cinnamon in the cup.  The expert taster might even notice the trace of sasparilla root hiding in there.  As far as acidity goes, the cup is more soft and sweet than sour and acidic (in my opinion).<br /><br />I was also surprised that this cup does not have the typical burnt (after)tastes that some Starbucks coffee has - there is no murky/dirty lingering flavor.  The cup is pleasant from start to finish.<br /><br />All in all, I was nicely surprised by this cup of coffee and do recommend it.

review/summary: Very nice aroma, but lacking a bit in vanilla flavour
review/text: I like Starbucks. My partner does not much care for them. So you get both sides of the spectrum in this review.<br /><br />On opening the bag (which didn't seem to be vacuum packed ??) the coffee smells slightly of vanilla and you can see little bits of bean (or something non-coffee) in the mix. While brewing I have to say I didn't smell much, but when the coffee is poured into the cup there is a nicely subtly hint of vanilla aroma. (Nothing like the Folger's we often buy, because...hey! We are cheap).<br /><br />My partner says: it's ok. It almost tastes like someone put vanilla extract in the pot because there is an almost alcoholy aftertaste to the brew.<br /><br />I get almost no vanilla flavour, but the scent is pleasant. It tastes like regular Starbucks coffee which is to say slightly more bitter than grocery brands and more drying to the tongue with a nice roasted aftertaste.<br /><br />At $6.50 (if you buy enough to get free shipping) a bag this is OK, but you might find it cheaper (if you like it) at your grocery. They just got it at our local store & it is on sale for about the same price. We liked the Melitta coffee we tried better...and--well to be honest the Folger's Gourmet has a lot more flavour.

Probably not, but I'm cheap; I don't even go to their stores. But I think Starbucks fans will think it's worth it.

review/summary: Not much bang for your buck
review/text: As stated on the packaging, this vanilla flavored coffee by Starbucks has a "subtle flavor and an indulgent aroma".  So much so, in fact, that brewing the coffee is a more satisfying experience than drinking it.<br /><br />Going off of the recommended 2 Tbsp of coffee for every 6 oz. of water, I found the brew diluted and weak-willed.  Stepping up the dosage does deliver a more powerful vanilla taste, but you'll find yourself plowing through the 11 oz. bag at a much quicker rate.<br /><br />All told, if a light, mild vanilla brew is what you're after, this offering by Starbucks will suit you.  If, however, you're after a more potent brew, you would likely get more bang for your buck with a less "subtle flavor."

review/text: Although Starbucks isn't my favorite brand of coffee to use at home (that distinction goes to Godiva Breakfast Blend), I do like experimenting with different flavored coffees, and so I was interested in trying this new offering from Starbucks.<br /><br />The coffee itself is reminiscent of a light-to-medium roast.  The vanilla flavor is a nice addition, but it is VERY subtle.  I made this coffee in both my drip coffee maker and my french press, and surprisingly, I found that the vanilla was more detectable in the former (usually the french press provides a more pronounced flavor).  There was a decent vanilla aroma to the coffee as well--not enough to fill the house, but noticeable in the individual mug.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would recommend this coffee to those who enjoy the Starbucks brand and prefer flavorings that do not overpower the overall coffee taste.

review/summary: Wake Up to Vanilla Coffee
review/text: Usually flavored coffee is made by masking low quality ground beans with artificial flavors, and usually Starbucks roast their beans to oblivion, eliminating any subtle flavors, leaving a harsh, bitter product.  Fortunately, neither is the case here.  The beans are mildly roasted, giving a flavorful, satisfying brew.  The flavor is a complementary vanilla that blends well with the coffee.  Not a cloying, overwhelming flavor that is too common with flavored coffees.  If you want your coffee to be robust, not bitter, with a mild vanilla flavor, this is for you.

review/text: The good thing here is that they didn't overdo the vanilla flavor, easy to do with the standard vanilla flavoring, (artificial) vanillin. Instead they used real vanilla beans and obtained a more subtle taste which goes nicely with the full-bodied, mildly bitter Arabica beans. If you want lots o' vanilla flavor, this ain't for you. But if you want a subtle top note of real vanilla, you'll enjoy this one.

review/summary: A better tasting flavored coffee
review/text: I am bit of a coffee fanatic, so I am always looking for new and exotic types of brew to indulge in.  This coffee by Starbucks is a vanilla flavored concoction.  Flavor coffees, I have found, are usually hit or miss, in my experience more miss.  However, in the case of this coffee I found the vanilla flavor to be rather subtle.<br /><br />This coffee is not a dark and/or strong blend; it is rather mild so the discreet hints of vanilla give this beverage a smooth taste.  I used flavored creamer when I drank this coffee. My first cup I used hazelnut and my second cup I used pumpkin spice.  I found the hints of vanilla gleamed out rather nice with both of these flavor creams.  I haven't used it with basic cream, but I am sure the taste would still be pleasant.  I think anyone who really enjoys coffee should at least allow their mug to associate with this Starbuck blend at least once.

The aroma is enticing and I can't wait to have my first cup of it in the morning -- I think it's a great "wake up" coffee. I realize that some people do not care for flavored coffees but this one has a very delicate vanilla taste and I'd recommend it very highly as it's not overpowering.<br /><br />Preference and taste are quite subjective, however, and it might not be for everyone but I sure like it and will likely purchase it again.

review/text: I tend to drink decaf far more than regular coffee, but will occasionally partake in a cup of the good stuff. This was a real treat - rich tasting, but not bitter. The vanilla is there more as an afterthought, which is a good thing. I like flavored decaf coffee since the flavor tends to "up" the taste quota since decaf tends to be lacking in body. But, with regular coffee, I prefer any flavoring to be secondary to the coffee taste. This hits that sweet spot - the vanilla is there, but it doesn't mask or interfere with the coffee taste.<br /><br />I tried this in a drip machine, a Senseo and a french press. The french press results were the best - the flavor really came out, but it was a bit more oily than other brews (I'm assuming this is because I'm so used to decaf). Served it after dinner to some guests and got thumbs up from everyone, even those who stated they don't care for flavored coffee.

This coffee has a definite bitter edge and the vanilla aspect is extremely light, definitely overpowered by the bitterness.  If I was going to have a house party, I'd probably brew this coffee just for the way it smells. This creates a great party-like atmosphere, but for day-to-day coffee drinking enjoyment, the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, probably won't live up to the expectations of most gourmet coffee drinkers.

review/text: I am by no stretch a coffee expert, but I drink around 4-5 cups a day and thoroughly enjoyed this brew.  It's ground very fine and has a full flavor.  One of my concerns was that I didn't want the vanilla to be overpowering.  I was happy when I tasted an excellent blend of the richness that has made Starbuck's famous and the twist of vanilla swirled in seamlessly.<br /><br />As for the price, I don't know that I will be ordering this more often than the occasional special event.  But, none the less, this bag was worth it.

review/summary: Not disappointed, not impressed.
review/text: As a self-confessed coffee addict for the past 20 years, I'd like to think that I'm a good judge of coffee.  Yes, if you poke through my previous reviews, you'll see that I rated a bag of Yuban (Breakfast Blend) rather highly.  So you may be surprised at my middling review of a bag of Starbucks and might therefore brand me a "hater". I am not. I love their Sumatran, Komodo Dragon, Anniversary Blend and their Christmas Blend.  AND, I was really looking forward a "subtle flavor" of vanilla in a cup of coffee. Now that we're all clear:<br /><br />Opening the bag of Starbucks Natural Infusions Vanilla, you'll immediately be hit by the scent of vanilla.  I was a bit scared that the coffee would wind up overpoweringly vanilla once brewed, but it wasn't so.  The vanilla is pronounced, but not overpowering once brewed.  HOWEVER, once brewed, the coffee beans' origin is immediately obvious.  The bag says "Latin American beans" but what they mean is Colombian. There's no mistaking that distinctive scent or taste.  Also, this is not a dark roast, not a bold coffee; it's a tame pseudo-breakfast roast.  It is a bit oily, but not overly so. (As another reviewer noted, this may be due to the added glycerin.)<br /><br />Point of interest: I drip brewed 6 cups for my initial tasting and did not add anything nor doctor the brew.  And onto the taste: very Colombian coffee, definitely vanilla, mildly sweet.  Starbucks not only added vanilla to the ground coffee, but they also added sarsparilla root and "natural flavor" including corn maltodextrin.  This is likely why it comes off as sweet when served black.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is there, make no mistake.  And the sweetness is there too.  No, this isn't as pronounced as adding a shot of flavored syrup to your coffee, but it isn't as subtle as the packaging would have us believe. If you like flavored coffee, this is right up your alley.  But, a note to coffee drinkers who like their coffee strong and bitter: this is not the coffee for you!<br /><br />I don't hate this coffee, but I don't love it.  If someone served it to me, I'd drink it (black) and not complain... until I got home.  ;-)

review/summary: We love coffee!
review/text: This coffee starts tempting as soon as the package is opened.  The aroma of the coffee beans and vanilla are sweet smelling and made me want that pot to brew fast!  While brewing I got a scent of what was to come - a smooth cup of coffee with just the right hint of vanilla and that bite that Starbucks coffee is known (and loved) for.<br /><br />I don't use sugar in my coffee - just a little more than the usual amount of milk, cream or half-and-half - whatever is available.  With that I had a nice smooth cup of Joe, and a nice pick-me-up to get through the afternoon!<br /><br />If you like Starbucks, like vanilla, and most of all, love coffee, this is good stuff!<br /><br />I don't usually buy Starbucks for home so will comment on the packaging.  It's a typical foil pouch with resealable top (both tape and wires that fold in).  This should keep the coffee fresh from first to last cup!

review/summary: Another Starbucks Winner
review/text: Being a dedicated Starbucks Coffee drinker, I was anxious to try the "Natural Fusion" flavored ground coffee. (Natural Fusion: a blend of coffee with natural vanilla "guessing") Following the recipe on the package, namely, using cold filtered water, adding 2 tablespoons (measured) for every 6 flu oz. of water in the 4 cup brewer (clean machine) - I was surprised at the smooth taste - Starbucks Shop Coffee with flavor is a great experience.  Couple recommended do/do not: (1) keep the back sealed tight in a cabinet (2) do not refrigerate (3) brew within a week of opening the package (4) Best use before date stamped on package.  An outstanding cup of Starbucks Coffee - vanilla flavored!

review/summary: Most people will like this; aficionados not so much
review/text: This Starbucks coffee is a (very consistent) medium grind which works perfectly either in a coffee press or for drip (filter) brewing.<br /><br />The aroma from the bag and the cup is distinctly, and strongly, vanilla.  If you actually like the flavor of coffee (as I do), you will not find it here.  Starbucks states that they used a lightly roasted Latin American bean that sets off the flavor.  In my opinion, it sets it off too well, as the only flavor I could detect was the vanilla (and "other natural flavors").<br /><br />Sipping the coffee, it had a round, smooth taste and feel and low acidity.  The coffee press let the oils through that were trapped by the filter in the drip test cup and felt a bit oily to me, perhaps from the vegetable glycerin added to bind the unidentified "natural flavors".<br /><br />I grind moderately to dark roasted beans for each cup prior to brewing and actually like the flavor of coffee with (rarely) at most some subtle additional flavor.  The vanilla flavor here is neither subtle, nor completely natural if you happen to be someone who has cooked with actual vanilla beans.<br /><br />Folks who like flavored coffee will probably like this as long as they appreciate the difference between flavored coffee and coffee into which a sweet flavored syrup has been poured.  Folks I know who typically buy ground coffee for an automatic coffee maker would enjoy this.

review/summary: Nice subtle-flavored coffee
review/text: I usually am NOT a big fan of Starbucks coffee as I think it tends towards being bitter/burnt tasting.  But I chose this with an open mind and am glad I did.  Since I typically drink just plain coffee (not flavored), I was pleasantly surprised by the nice hints of vanilla as I drank my first cup, and the coffee was mellow and smooth.  A friend who loves regular Starbucks had some with me, and she really enjoyed this flavored brew as well.  So whether you love Starbucks signature roast or simply want a nicely flavored coffee for a change of pace, I think you will enjoy this coffee.

review/summary: Light roast with very subtle vanilla tone
review/text: A smooth full bodied cup of coffee with a very faint hint of vanilla. Opening the bag is a wonderful experience as the bold aroma fills the air around you. Yum. The vanilla component is very strong with the fresh grounds.<br /><br />I made the first cup and drank it black to get the unadulterated flavor. The recommended amount of coffee, 2 tablespoons per 6 oz, is a very, very strong cup of joe. I like strong coffee but 2 T per 6 oz of water is too strong even for me so I brewed it at about 2T for 10oz of water which is still a really strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />My second cup I brewed the same as the first but added Coffee Mate Peppermint Mocha powdered creamer - super tasty. I like that creamer flavor and I wanted to see how the vanilla would stand out. Really it got lost in the stronger flavor of the creamer. There wasn't much vanilla to cover in the first place. I've used the creamer with non-flavored coffee and I cannot tell the difference in taste as far as the vanilla is concerned.<br /><br />So, good coffee with a very mild vanilla taste.

review/text: I tried this Starbucks coffee thinking that it would be a more mild roast coffee in order for the "real vanilla" flavor to show through.  It smelled good and I had high hopes for a true vanilla flavor mixed with a high quality coffee.  What I tasted was a very robust, deep roast, coffee with a bit of vanilla flavor.  It's just not what I prefer.<br />I can't say that i hated it but nor can I say that I loved and would put it on my groccery list.  I was unimpressed and will still hope for something better.

review/summary: Excellent roasting and (mostly) excellent taste.
review/text: I wish Starbucks would roast more of their coffee beans this way. I am not a fan of their tendency to char-broil their coffee beans. For my taste, this is the right amount of roasting and the taste is excellent. I said "mostly" excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees, the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking. For this reason I try to cycle through flavors, and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle. If you are a vanilla flavor fan you will probably rate this as a 5/5, but I am giving it a 4/5 because I would like to reserve a perfect rating for truly exceptional blends.

review/summary: Tastes like real vanilla, very subtle and smooth
review/text: I am sipping on this right now and loving it.  The vanilla flavor is not fake at all, and it does not overpower the flavor of the beans which is surprisingly good.  I don't like many flavored coffees because they taste like they were sprayed with chemicals, not this one.<br /><br />I am also not the biggest fan of Starbucks coffee that you can get in their cafes, it all tastes burnt to me.  I never had their DIY beans and grounds before and I like this much better than what they serve in their chains.  I think it is because I can use a bit less grounds and steep how I like; it creates a cup that is just as strong, but not so bitter or burnt tasting.<br /><br />I used 2/3 of what the bag recommended and it is still very robust.  I made it in a french press for 4 minutes, added 2 creams and 1 sugar, and it kept its deep java edge despite my add-ins.  I sipped it black too and was pleasantly surprised at how less acidic it was than the cafe offering.<br /><br />I took a star off for not being a 16 ounce bag despite the list price, its feels like they are charging for a pound, but skimming off the top.  The price here on Amazon is much better.<br /><br />I am really enjoying my 3:30 Mommy-pick-me-up.  We have 26 guests coming for Thanksgiving in a few days, so I anticipate many pots of this coffee will help make that happen :)

review/text: I'm used to going to Starbucks for vanilla lattes and I was hoping this coffee would have a sweet vanilla flavor to it.  Although I'm glad to be contributing to buying Starbucks products, this coffee flavor is a let-down.  If there is a hint of vanilla flavoring to it, it's extremely subtle and I was unable to notice it.  If you buy this and you're looking for it to have a sweet vanilla flavor, I would recommend buying a syrup to add to the coffee.

review/text: Starbucks is consistant when it comes to good coffee.  Usually it is a little pricey but worth it.  Still though I wondered if they could take a flavor that isn't too exciting and bump it up a notch.  And so they did.<br /><br />PROS:  Nice distinctive flavor.  The vanilla perfectly compliments the beans and blends together into a delicious blend.  The grounds were nice and fresh as well.<br />CONS:  The bag runs out fast.  That's because it's good though so I guess that's not really a con...<br />BOTTOM LINE:  Well worth the money.  Thumbs up.

review/text: I was skeptical about this coffee before I tried it.  Then I opened the bag, and the earthy scent of vanilla mixed with coffee wafted to my nose.  Score!  The vanilla and the coffee are ground together; you can actually see it.  The brewed coffee taste is crisp, smooth and distinct -- in my opinion a departure from the garden-variety Starbucks ground; and a real treat. If you're a fan of Starbucks and are in the mood for something different, I say give their Natural Fusions Vanilla a try.

review/summary: nice vanilla aroma
review/text: My mother in law loves this coffee. I find the aroma a little strong for my taste, but different people enjoy different things. I did like the flavor, sometimes flavored coffees seem like they taste plastic-y or something, this did not. I sometimes mix this with regular coffee in a half and half ratio...that seems to be my perfect amount. Just enough vanilla for me that way. I do that with many flavored coffees though, so it is hard for me to judge what is "too much" or "just enough" for someone else's taste. If you like vanilla coffee, then I think this is a good choice since the flavor is so good. Try it. If you find the aroma slightly strong, you can temper it with regular like I did.

review/text: I love good coffee.  So when I picked up this Starbucks Natural Fusion Ground Vanilla I was excited just to open it up and smell it. To make a long story short, I kept making excuses for the coffee several pots later and half way through the bag it sits on the shelf.  I've actually considered tossing it out but it's not terrible. So I'll use it when I run out of other brews or when I have guest who just wants an average cup of non flavored coffee. I've never heard, "oh this is Vanilla?"<br /><br />I made excuses for this brew because it is "Natural Fusion".  The thinking being that it was organic and little or no chemical process used, but even if that's true it just tastes average and hardly like the Vanilla flavored beans I normally use.<br /><br />Sorry Starbucks.

review/summary: The right balance of vanilla and coffee
review/text: Starbucks Natural Fusions ground coffee contains the right balance of (added) vanilla flavor and bold coffee. Normally, flavored (let alone pre-ground) coffees aren't very high quality; however, this Starbucks blend is very good. It's not stale or poorly roasted, nor does it have any kind of artificial smell or taste. There's no strange after-taste, either. It brews well, and I'll likely purchase it again. The vanilla "flavor infusion" doesn't overpower; the aroma is absolutely amazing - not flat, with the right amount of depth and complexity.<br /><br />I prepared this coffee drip-style (not in a machine), and found it required a bit more than usual to make the strength I prefer. Additionally, though I prefer black coffee, this coffee responds well to a bit of sugar (it heightens the vanilla flavor) and cream.

review/summary: Mmmmmm.....smooth....
review/text: I'm not a HUGE coffee drinker but I do like to keep some in the house so that once in a blue moon we can enjoy a cup or have some when friends or family visits.  Being that I'm not accustomed to drinking coffee, I'm VERY, VERY sensitive taste wise to coffees that are really bitter, have a strong, overpowering flavor and ESPECIALLY those who leave a nasty aftertaste in the mouth.  In other words, for an inexperienced coffee drinker, I'm VERY picky about my coffee.<br /><br />Right when I opened the bag to this Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, I smelled this wonderful, coffee and authentic vanilla aroma that I felt compelled to make a batch immediately just to try it.  Both my husband and I thought it was delicious.  It's very smooth - it doesn't have a harsh 'bite' to it at all, the vanilla flavor in it tastes very 'real' and not some horrid chemical rendition of vanilla and again, didn't leave a bad aftertaste.  I served it to family who visited who are AVID coffee drinkers and they enjoyed it as well - actually asked me what brand it was.<br /><br />For those of you who enjoy your flavored coffees, Vanilla is a GREAT flavor to have on hand since you can do so many things to it in my opinion.  I added some cocoa powder to the grounds one time to make a vanilla - chocolate coffee (YUM!), another time I added cinnamon (DOUBLE YUM!) and another time, Pumpkin Pie spices (hubby didn't like this but I did).  Two thumbs up for me!

review/summary: Worst Vanilla coffee I have ever had
review/text: There were a number of things I did not like about this coffee.  First, while most coffee is packaged in 12 oz to 1lb bags, this one is only 11 oz.  That may not seem like much but to pay thier price and get an ounce less than their standard product, seems like a price increase to me.  Next was the actual coffee flavor.  I tried making this coffee a number of different ways to make it taste good.  And every time it just didn't work.  Now, trying to be fair, I like a lighter roast which Starbucks is not known for.  So for those of you who like a darker roast, you may like this just fine.  The last problem I had was the vanilla flavor.  It was extremely overpowering. Just for the record, my wife, who only drinks flavored coffee, did not like this one either.

review/summary: Still bitter.
review/text: In two senses, this coffee leaves me bitter.  On the one hand, I've had several years of trying Starbucks home coffee of various kinds and in various ways, and in no way have I been able to get it "perfect."  On the other hand, I gave it another shot with this product, and, while it definitely tastes better than other Starbucks home coffees I've had (hence the three stars), it still has a sense of bitterness.<br /><br />My co-worker, who is much better at brewing coffee than I am, made a pot at the office and told me to try some.  I did, hoping to get that amazing taste other reviewers have mentioned.  After making the cup of coffee that I always do, I sat down at my desk, had a sip, and waited for the full experience: the taste on the tongue, the swirl to the rest of my mouth, the final swig down my esophagus, and, finally, the awaited aftertaste.  It was fine until the last step: the aftertaste.  Here is where I recollected the pangs that bitter coffees leave, and it'll be a while till I try home-brew Starbucks again.  My co-worker even admitted it was bitter.<br />Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not completely anti-Starbucks.  While this specific home-brew leaves a wonderful vanilla initial taste, the in-store coffees taste better (but are still bitter to me), and their specialty drinks are amazing.<br /><br />Because I've had horrible experiences with Starbucks home-brew coffee, I wait for my trip to my grandparents' to drink home-made coffee, and will settle with my Nescafe.

review/summary: Smooth, but not very vanilla
review/text: I don't drink coffee often, but when I do it must be mild to medium roast and very smooooth.  I don't like bold roasts or most flavored coffees. I try to keep a little something different on hand for guests, and figured I couldn't go wrong with Starbucks Vanilla.  I wasn't sure if I would like it, but it's actually pretty good!  In my opinion it tastes less vanilla and more hazelnut, which isn't a bad thing.  I like hazelnut.  That said, the flavor was nicely subtle - just a hint - and did not overpower the coffee flavor.  I was still able to enjoy a medium roast flavor and thankfully it was also very smooth :)

review/summary: Worst Starbucks Coffee I've Had
review/text: I am a huge Starbucks coffee fan. I love their coffee and drink it as often as I can. When I saw this Vanilla flavored coffee, though I am a coffee purist, I thought I would try it. Honestly, I've had pleasant vanilla coffee and this was far from it. The vanilla flavor was just strong enough to make it taste odd, but not strong enough to really identify the vanilla flavors. I would not recommend this coffee.

review/summary: Nice addition for Starbucks Lovers
review/text: No need to lie. Starbucks is my favorite brand of coffee. When I saw this offered on the Vine Program, I was totally overjoyed. I love using vanilla creamer and thought the experience would be the same or close. It wasn't, at least to my taste buds. It was much better.<br /><br />When I opened the pouch, specks of vanilla were visible. The smell was strong as well as the taste, much stronger than using vanilla creamer. Then again, the lightly roasted Latin American beans had a robust flavor and the combination was heavenly. I enjoyed it so much, that I ordered more. The cost at Amazon is competitive, especially when I used the $25 free shipping offer. That said, I can't always find the various blends of Starbucks at places like Wal-Mart or Target. Having it shipped is much easier.

review/summary: Usual Starbucks quality delivers the goods
review/text: Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee combines the usual Starbucks richness and "ooomph" with a subtle vanilla flavor, resulting in a more relaxing, down-to-earth coffee than non-flavored Starbucks varieties.  Or to put it another way, it's an enjoyable coffee for those times when you favor a comforting coffee experience over an eye-opening one.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Program, I also recently tried Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee, and liked that a lot, too.  That one was more like a regular cup of coffee, though, less strong and complex than the Starbucks variety described here, though the vanilla flavoring had about the same flavor and strength in both coffees.<br /><br />It's all a matter of personal taste.  Some people like a no-nonsense coffee like the Melitta and some like the gourmet richness of a Starbucks.  Myself, I go back and forth.  And when I'm in the latter mood, and also in the mood for a flavored coffee, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this quality Starbucks offering.

review/summary: Subtle hint of Vanilla and very rich flavor
review/text: I've been a fan of Starbucks coffee for years, but I've only enjoyed flavored varieties of their "holiday lattes". I also drink flavored coffees at Dunkin Donuts, but usually find their flavors a bit overpowering, possibly because "syrup" is used.<br /><br />This coffee, on the other hand, has a "hint" of Vanilla, that does not penetrate the entire cup of coffee and distract from the actual coffee flavor. There is a pleasant fragrance for each sip, but I am still able to taste the bold Starbucks flavor underneath.I'm a daily coffee drinker, and am drinking this coffee right now at work. While the vanilla flavor is subtle, it is effective in spicing up the regular cup.<br /><br />As a side note-Starbucks please consider a partnership with Keurig-it would be my # 1 K-cup choice!<br /><br />Great product and wonderful flavor!

review/summary: Simply put, I loved this coffee
review/text: Since I am a fan of flavored coffee, particularly coffee flavored with natural ingredients, I knew I had to try this coffee. As soon as I opened the package to brew a pot, my kitchen smelled of hints of vanilla (my four year old son even asked me if I was baking something).  If anything, the aroma is most satisfying when drinking this coffee, but the taste isn't too strong. In sum, this coffee is good because of its aroma and delicious taste.  I am certainly impressed with Starbucks' new vanilla addition, and I will most definitely continue purchasing this coffee. For a two pack purchase on Amazon, the price is quite reasonable. Bottom line: if you enjoy drinking a nice scented coffee, this one is a must-try!

review/summary: Great flavor - not overwhelming.
review/text: I am a non-committed fan of Starbucks coffee. I like their in-house coffee, but rarely buy the bagged stuff. I usually find it to be little better than Walmart brand off-the-shelf and have been spoiled in recent years by freshly roasted coffee from a local roaster. Far superior to "bagged" coffee which can be weeks to months old.<br />That said, I am pleasantly pleased with this particular coffee. I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees because most taste weak or painfully artificial, but this one is really enjoyable.  In fact, I just got some from Gevalia coffees recently, and I liked this one better than theirs.<br />My only reason for withholding a star is that the coffee disappears quickly and has a bit of a bitter aftertaste. It's not noticeable if you add cream and sugar, but those who like it black may be a bit turned off by that.<br />If you read the package, it calls for using about twice the amount of coffee per 6oz. water that most bagged coffees indicate. Brewed as directed, this will provide a cup of coffee equal to the strength one generally finds when purchasing it at the franchise stores. Not bad. Actually, pretty good. But you'll find your bag of coffee doesn't last long.<br />One big bonus...on the side of the bag is a keycode. You can take the empty bag to a local Starbucks and they will give you a free medium cup of their brewed coffee.  That's a nice compensation for the "end of the bag" delerium one might encounter.

review/summary: Finally, the Right Combination
review/text: I am really enjoying this coffee.  It took me a little while to get the right combination for my tastes, but I think I finally have it.<br /><br />First of all, it does not work well in a French press.  No matter what combination of water to bean I tried, it just came out off flavored and bitter.<br /><br />When I tried it in my automatic Mr. Coffee, I finally got the flavor I was looking for.  Two rounded 1/8th measures per 6 cups of water.  And don't cut this in half; one scoop for 3 cups is too watery.  I know, it does not make sense.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is good.  Subtle in the way that hints of vanilla without the over whelming vanilla syrup taste that some other brands have.<br /><br />Oh, and do not use artificial sweetener, that does something funky to the vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Also, as an added bonus, when you are finished with the bag, take it to your participating Starbucks for a free 12 cup of coffee.  That is a nice bonus.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good cup of coffee without having to get in the car and travel across town for a midday pick me up.  I suggest that you try it next time you are in the market.

review/summary: Great Taste that Does not Get Old
review/text: I have been a fan of Starbucks Coffee for a long time.  Although that is not a very unique thing in our time, I tend to avoid some flavored coffees because they tend to get old pretty quick.  During the Christmas season, you see cinnamon, gingerbread and other flavors that are to remind us that winter is here.  These wear on me pretty quick and I usually loathe getting through the canister or package of coffee after the first couple of cups.<br /><br />This Vanilla Flavored Coffee is really a nice treat.  My wife enjoys the aroma as it brews.  She does not like the smell of some coffees, but this one is pleasant and it really tastes like it smells.  One thing I like too is that you can get a more bold flavor if you wish by adding just a little more than the recommended serving, giving it a Vanilla Pikes type taste.<br /><br />I look forward to trying more flavors from the Starbucks Natural Fusions collection.  Enjoy this as the months grow colder.

review/summary: If Vanilla is the flavor, why is it the THIRD ingredient after "coffee"?
review/text: I tend to be a regular coffee drinker - 3 to 4 cups per day. And periodically drink flavored coffee. Most are too flavored for me. I like a dark roast (though not as dark as French Roast). I DO like Starbucks' varietals and SOME blends.<br /><br />So, I was hoping for the best of both worlds when Amazon sent me the 1lb package to try. But it didn't live up to expectations.<br /><br />The coffee was a lighter roast than normal - more like Dunkin Donuts. And the Vanilla flavor didn't taste like just vanilla. So I read the package. Though it says "Vanilla and other Natural Flavors" on the front of the package the ingredients list reads as follows" Ground coffee, Natural Flavor (with corn maltodextrine, vegetable Glycerin), Gound Vanilla Beans, Indian Sarsaparilla Root".  Hmm. corn sugar and a natural vegetable product BEFORE the Vanilla? And Sarsaparilla? It's not in the name. That explained the different taste and the aftertaste I got. How about just giving us coffee and vanilla beans? This is to be premium coffee.<br /><br />I think I'll pass on this line of flavors in the future. Coffee preference is a subjective thing. There are lines at Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks as well as McDonalds. And Maxwell House still sells well.<br /><br />So you may or not agree with me but I just want folks who read this review to know the ingredients when they buy this "Natural Fusion" product from Starbucks.<br /><br />Steve Ramm (who generally reviews CDs, books and DVDs but DOES drink coffee too!)<br />"Anything Phonographic"

review/summary: So-so coffee sold by union-busting Starbucks
review/text: I'm not actually a food reviewer. I'll do my best here, but don't expect anything special.<br /><br />This coffee is entirely decent, but tastes to me a little too much like I'm trying to drink candy. The flavor is less about a 'hint' of vanilla and more about sort of rolling your nose around in a vanilla extract smell.  The coffee taste itself, underneath all that vanilla, somehow manages to come off musty, if that makes any sense. It's almost a little too much in the morning, though I suppose it'd make a good dessert coffee.<br /><br />Then there's the Starbucks factor, of course. If you're socially conscious enough to care that this is labeled as a fair trade item, you probably also care about the fact that Starbucks is a union-busting company. All in all, you ought to take your fair trade business elsewhere, as it doesn't make much sense to try to support fair trade on the one hand, while contributing to the abuse of American workers on the other.

review/text: Starbucks Natural Fusions vanilla flavoured coffee is the same consistently strong taste you would expect from the Starbucks brand. The dark roasted taste is consistently strong to the point where it almost overwhelms the vanilla flavouring that was added.  You can taste the vanilla only slightly.  I do use a French press rather than a drip coffee maker for my coffee,letting it steep several minutes in order to maximize the flavour.  This particular batch of coffee came pre-ground and I am one of those hard core cofee drinkers who prefers whole bean coffee,  grinding the beans only when they are ready to be used. While the taste is pleasant enough, and it was a nice change from the usual French or Turkish roast that I drink, I am not sure that I would go out of my way to buy this particular coffee again.

review/text: I am a huge vanilla flavor fan. I love anything vanilla flavored. So naturally, I figured that I would love this coffee. The aroma is great when I open the package and dumped the ground coffee into my coffeemaker. I had high expectations for this.<br /><br />The coffee itself, once it is made is actually only decent tasting. I could only taste a very small hint of vanilla in it and it might have been because of my creamer and not the actual coffee itself. It was a bit bitter compared to other coffees that I have had and very rich. I usually take my coffee with cream and a small amount of sweetner and never really had problems with it being still too bitter.<br /><br />Next time, I guess I'll just use more cream and sweetner. Don't get me wrong, this is not completely horrible and I still enjoy Starbucks. It just surprised me as how bitter it was.

review/summary: Coffee and Real Vanilla A True Fit
review/text: I have been a Vanilla Latte devotee for several years, just ask my local coffee cafe. Only Vanilla Latte, I might add. I will at Christmas try a Gingerbread but always revert back to vanilla. I am also a fan of vanilla ice cream. I am a coffee lover, and went through the flavored coffee phase a few years ago, but quickly reverted to my regular coffee. I was very interested to see the Starbucks Vanilla Fusion on the market. Couldn't wait to try it.<br /><br />The package is very attractive, a subtle green with a picture of a vanilla bean on the front. I have discovered that coffee rarely comes in pound packages nowadays. The pound was decreased to 12 ounces for the price of a pound, and the Vanilla Fusion is 11 ounces.  Opening the package and a very subtle smell of vanilla and coffee is inhaled. I made my coffee in my trusty Cuisinart Coffee maker, and used the usual directions. I poured a cup of the coffee and an aroma of coffee and vanilla lingered. I usually taste new coffee, black, to get the full flavor and this did not disappoint. The taste is a strong medium dark roast. A mellow vanilla flavor blends. The after taste had a darker roast flavor. I then tried it with a little half and half, and this was delicious. My vanilla latte has come home to roost!  There are no chemicals in this coffee, but real vanilla beans are roasted with arabica beans and produce a marvelous taste. Not too strong and with a subtle taste of vanilla.<br /><br />The Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored could be one of the best flavored coffees I have had. This will become a staple in my home. I am anxious to try their caramel flavored coffee.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 11-27-10<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QKBDX4">Starbucks VIA� Iced Coffee by Starbucks Coffee</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ54DW">Starbucks Africa Kitamu Coffee, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>

So mild usually tastes medium, medium tastes bold and bold pretty much removes all tissue from your mouth.  This truly is a mild brew.<br /><br />Also with Starbucks I normally HATE the way the unbrewed coffee smells.  This was an exception and it didn't smell too bad.<br /><br />When I brewed as I normally would it was a smooth cup of coffee with a subtle hint of vanilla.  The next day my husband brewed it with an extra scoop to make it stronger and it was a hot mess.<br /><br />In short, go light on the coffee when you brew and you will get an excellent tasting cup of smooth & subtle vanilla flavor.

review/summary: Yes, I do like flavored coffees BUT.....
review/text: I just want to preface this review by noting that I do stop into Starbucks and get flavored coffees (current favorite, Peppermint Mocha, whipped cream on top). So I had positive expectations of a vanilla flavored coffee. Unfortunately, this was among the worst Starbucks blends I've ever tasted. Just to give it a fair shot, I tried brewing and drinking it four different ways:<br /><br />1.Mild with no sugar or cream<br />2. Strong with no sugar or cream<br />3. Mild with sugar and cream<br />4. Strong with sugar and cream<br /><br />I also had friends taste test this. We all hated it. We couldn't choke it down as it was truly bitter and unpleasant. Maybe we got a bad batch or bag. At this point, we have nearly a whole bag left and I'm feeling guilty about wasting it. But there is no way I'm going to brew another pot of coffee and try to create a tasty brew. I tend to like my coffee extremely strong but even making it overly strong did not make it better. Yes, the vanilla flavor came through but it wasn't a good addition to a possibly decent coffee (without the vanilla).

review/text: I'm an avid coffee drinker, but I stick to the basics: lattes, french roast drip,  espresso. Only rarely do I drink coffee with flavor added. But when I do, it's typically vanilla, so I thought this might be a decent product to have on hand during the holidays as an addition to my usual dark-roast, whole beans.<br /><br />I am drinking a cup as I type this and it's really good. The coffee itself has the full-bodied, robust taste I like. The vanilla flavoring is subtle and pleasant. It doesn't taste artificial and leaves no after taste. It's definitely a nice change from my usual coffee and feels festive.<br /><br />The Amazon price for two bags seems reasonable to me for Starbuck's coffee. Yes, it may be more expensive than other brands, but I think it's worth the delicate balance of flavors you get from the product.

At first when I took a sip it was all I had hoped for.  But then it hit the back of my tongue and I tasted a slight acidic flavor.  I hate that in a coffee.  It was not strongly acidic, very slight, and probably plenty of sugar would nullify the acid, but I don't want tons of sugar.  All in all I would say I like it, but it's not my favorite coffee.

It is definitely there, but not overwhelming. There is another nice flavor in there which I couldn't quite place, but after reading the ingredient list on the bag I assume it is the Sarsaparilla Root. The coffee is slightly bitter, which adds to the complex flavor. (There is a yin-yang thing going on with the sweeter flavors.) I like a very strong, dark roast and I find that this falls into that category although Starbucks advertises it as a medium roast. Overall, I think this is a winner.

review/summary: Not real big on vanilla but this is good...
review/text: I'm not huge on plain coffee but I do enjoy making myself Cafe Mochas and this is wonderful for that.  I've drank this plain as well and thought that was really good too.  I was a little worried that the smell would put me off because I'm one of the few people that don't like the smell of vanilla but this wasn't overwhelming at all.  I actually liked the smell of this.<br /><br />Smells great and tastes really good.  What more do you need?  I highly recommend this coffee.

review/summary: Not as good as their unflavored coffees.
review/text: I am a flat-out fiend for good coffee.  I ordered Starbucks by mail well before they had a string of coffee shops, and I'd venture to guess that were you to order a vanilla latte there, this is not what you would get.<br /><br />I basically never buy flavored coffees, having learned from a friend who worked for a local gourmet coffee company that if you want flavored coffee, you add the flavoring after it is brewed.  Because many delicate natural ingredients are destroyed by the heat required to brew coffee properly most flavored coffees are chemical.  I would not purchase a chemically flavored coffe, or drink it except as aq last resort (i.e., stranded at an airport).  I applaud Starbucks for the effort to make a naturally flavored coffee, and on thinking about it, vanilla beans seem like one of the better candidates to stand up to the heat; after all, they are used in baking at even higher heat.<br />However, this effort falls somewhat flat, or maybe I should say sharp.  While it smells just wonderful when you open the bag, the brewed coffee is bitter with only a faint odor remaining to remind you that it is flavored with vanilla.  I am not familar enough with the chemistry of vanilla (would have to consult <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> to see if vanilla is fat or water solable.  Maybe it's the butter in cakes and cookies which absorbs the flavor.... but whatever it is that does it in baked goods is missing here.<br /><br />I suspect that Starbucks released this to combat the rise of Dunkin Donuts coffees.  But to my mind that is like a steak house worrying over all the people who flock to McDonalds.  I am hoping that Starbucks maintains the standards which allow us to look to them for a reliably good cup of coffee.  This is a disappointment from a company which knows good coffee, and which should know better.  It would be a lot better had they packaged the coffee with single serve packets of vanilla sugar.<br /><br />The coffee is ground for drip brewers as is most of their ground coffee.  While it is described as a medium roast, it tastes like a French roast (but not a good one).  Because of the larger grind, I am guessing it can be used with a French press.  I will give that a try to see if the vanilla beans hold up any better, and return to this review forthwith.  It was not terrific brewed in a good drip brewer, which is, how I suspect most people would make pre-ground coffee.

review/summary: raises the bar for scented coffee
review/text: I was very excited to try this. I brewed it 3 ways: vacuum, press, drip.<br /><br />This a relatively fine grind. I'd call it the finest limit of drip coffee. Beyond that, we're getting into espresso territory.<br /><br />Against my better judgement, I tried it in my French Press. The fine particles plug up the steel mesh making the plunger difficult to press. The finer particles got into the brew. There was a very thick sludge at the bottom of the cup. Flavor-wise, it was intense but not bad. There was a slight bitter taste and a silky texture which I suspect was from the dust in suspension. So I ran it through a cone filter. The resulting brew was still intense but lost all of the vanilla aroma. The texture was too thin. It basically became a better than average cup of "diner coffee". Easy to drink, dark & tasty, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I expected great results from the vacuum brewer. While brewing, it filled the kitchen with vanilla, but when I tasted the coffee, there was only a hint of it. I don't think it brewed long enough to pick up the vanilla, or maybe it was so hot the vanilla vaporized rather than dissolve. In any case, the final product was only slightly better than the pressed-then-filtered coffee above. Not recommended.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the best results came from my drip machine. I used the freebie Gevalia gave me with membership (yeah, I'm a sucker for free stuff). I'm drinking the stuff now as I write this review and it's exceptional. I only used 2 Tbsp to 6 servings of water and the taste is just about right. It has a rich mouth-feel, a fair amount of vanilla aroma, a robust coffee taste.<br /><br />I've bought and tasted flavored coffees before and have come to the conclusion that most of the manufacturers are just masking cheap, dry, tasteless coffee with deceptively sweet aromas. Those coffees rarely taste like coffee and never taste like the additional flavor, which is why I call them "scented coffee" rather than "flavored coffee". So color me jaded. But the stuff from my drip machine actually TASTES LIKE VANILLA! And maybe my mind is playing tricks on me, but I'm getting a hint of ice-cream too! I'm drinking it black, no sugar so it's pretty fascinating.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: When brewed 2:6 in an average #4 drip coffee-maker, you get a delicious coffee treat with the usual Starbucks buzz to brighten up your work-day.

review/summary: lovely coffee
review/text: Update 12/7/10:  Now my law-enforcement, black coffee, no-frills husband wants me to always get this coffee. It's that good, and the vanilla just sortof creates a smoothness, or fullness that is very satisfying.<br /><br />I normally do not drink flavored coffee, and I don't add any sweetener to my coffee, either. I hate that chemical taste found with those artificially flavored coffees. I tried this because it said it has all natural flavors. They grind up actual vanilla beans and add that to the grounds. You can see them!<br /><br />Smelled amazing!  Wonderful flavor. Not overpowering. The vanilla (& sassparillo) give the coffee a delightful smoothness. Absolutely no artificial, chemical taste. You don't take a sip and say "wow, this is definitely flavored coffee." This will make a perfect after-dinner coffee, excellent in the morning, and any time of day. I'll be getting this again.

review/summary: No flavor
review/text: Purchased this coffee because I enjoy vanilla and coffee, and enjoyed a previously purchased bag of Starbucks ground coffee. It sounded good, but I was wrong. It just tastes like bad coffee. There's no vanilla in there anywhere. This would be fine if it still tasted alright, but I feel sad for wasting my money on this product.

review/summary: Not a fan of "flavored" coffees but like this
review/text: When it comes to coffee, I'm something of a purist. I expect it to taste like coffee, not hazelnuts, cinnamon, etc.<br /><br />Adding flavors to coffee just seems to confuse and overwhelm my taste buds.<br /><br />This coffee, however, provided the Starbucks coffee taste I enjoy with a slight vanilla "enhancement." Tastes real, not artificial.

review/summary: Strong; Flavorful
review/text: I liked it, although I can't brew it as strong as Starbucks recommends.<br /><br />The vanilla added a nice fragrance to the coffee (and, unlike what others have said, I -did- definitely taste the vanilla). Just remember Starbucks is formulated to be mixed with milk. It's really not at it's best when it''s black--with or without vanilla.

review/text: My wife and I love Starbucks coffee, so when had the opportunity to try their vanilla flavor, we took it. Just made a pot of it, and it is fabulous. I used to use sugar in my coffee, but this is perfectly sweet enough as it is. (Less sugar is healthier for you.) The only thing I would suggest is NOT following the directions of 2 tablespoons per 6 oz. of water... we use only 1 and it is plenty strong enough. But I guess that's a personal taste thing. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Milder roast, not bitter, and without any strong smell! Winner!
review/text: I like flavored coffee's but not as much as a good nice light to medium roast blend of just regular ol' Java. I find flavored coffee's to just be a bit too much. In general I actually don't like Starbucks beans that much because I find the coffee bitter with an aftertaste that stays with me for too long - and I get heartburn. Not fun. The key word on this package that got me to try it was Natural.<br /><br />I might be the only one but the biggest problem I have with flavored type coffee is not only the cloying taste but the extremely strong smell. If I want that strong a smell in my house I'll buy candles or spray. Usually, after about a fourth of the cup, I just don't want to drink much more - or smell it. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this coffee carries the trace of smell but it is neither strong nor overpowering. The taste follow suit - this is not a heavy roast and it does not have any bitter aftertaste. I found it exceedingly pleasant and finished the whole cup. In fact I found it so good that I would likely drink it on a regular basis. It is just perfect for me. Amazon's price is good as well. I'm kind of surprising myself by saying there's nothing not to like about this one. Give it a try!

review/summary: Smells great and tastes wonderful
review/text: The smell of coffee is the first step to a great morning.  Right out of the bag you can smell the deep richness of this Starbucks coffee.  The hint of Vanilla just makes it that much more enticing.  I'm sure that there are purists out there that would not hear of drinking a flavored coffee.  But if you are inclined to a subtle bump in flavor that wistfully plays with your taste buds, then you might want to try this coffee.  It is excellent.

review/summary: A very smooth coffee with a subtle flavor
review/text: Full disclosure: I don't generally enjoy Starbucks coffee, mainly because it often tastes bitter at the stores, and I haven't had a flavored coffee in quite a while. For both those reasons, I was pleasantly surprised with this pack of Starbucks Vanilla, which balances the flavor with a mellow, smooth brew. Made in a French press, it's the perfect afternoon shot-in-the-arm, and the vanilla really isn't as over-powering as I expected. From a pricing standpoint, it's well priced for two bags, and I can definitely see myself stocking up for holidays, which seem to be the perfect time of year for flavored coffee.

review/summary: An unfortunate truth about vanilla coffee...
review/text: ...is that it tastes like vanilla coffee. Any richness or flavor inherent in the coffee itself is obliterated by the chemical bite of the fake vanilla. I just don't think there's any way around it. Whether the coffee is decent Starbucks brand (and I'm a Starbucks drinker, admittedly), cheap grocery store brand or some kind of high-end bean, the result is the same: it's always going to taste like something you'd drink for free at a continental breakfast bar at a cut-rate hotel.

review/summary: Unique Real Vanilla Essence, Not Overly Flavored Yet Definite
review/text: I basically gave up "flavored" coffee years ago after a brief love affair with coffee beans laced with chocolate, vanilla, raspberry, gran marnier, etc. But this Vanilla Starbucks is different than the flavored coffees I used to drink. This does taste like a nice, full bodied coffee (and not bitter) with just a subtle hint of real vanilla taste and aroma. It reminds me more of a cup of coffee after adding a shake or two of the real vanilla powder. Its very satisfying. While I still prefer the dark italian roasts this is a real treat and fits perfectly into the holiday season. Excellent!

review/summary: Good if you like flavored coffees - Americano review
review/text: I ordered this to try as a different sort of coffee.<br /><br />My brewing method:<br /><br />I normally make Americano, which is an espresso with extra water. I have always just let my manual espresso machine continue to brew after it's normal double espresso, and the results are very good. I generally use a darker, bolder roast, and since I have tried Starbucks bold roast before, It felt this might make a nice change. This method of brewing really brings out the quality (or lack thereof) in a coffee.<br /><br />The results<br />This coffee makes a lot less "crema", which is what espresso machines put out as a sort of light brown colored foam at the top of the coffee. As to taste, it is (as expected) a lot less bold. My initial thought was that I found the vanilla to be a bit sharp or bitter, but then I'm using an espresso machine, not a french press or brew machine. At the same time, I didn't taste the coffee as much as I might prefer.<br /><br />However, after sipping a bit over half the cup, I find that it is actually a pleasant drink; by the time I emptied my cup, I decided that I will make more of this coffee - as a change of pace, not as my primary flavor or brand. I can taste the vanilla, and a bit of the coffee. Perhaps this means that the blend is very good - if they were aiming for exact balance. I would characterize it as a "vanilla and coffee drink" rather than a "vanilla flavored coffee" because that more accurately describes the overall flavor.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Flavored coffees are a world to themselves - one either likes the concept of putting additional flavor in coffee, or one doesn't - there isn't much in between. For anyone who likes flavored coffees, I think this one would be suitable for daily use. Recommended if you like this sort of combination, but not if one prefers more coffee taste and less vanilla addition.
