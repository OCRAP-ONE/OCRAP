review/summary: great value!
review/text: I have been using Coffee People Donut Shop for over a year and have no complaints, so I was hesitant to try something new.  I like a decent cup of Joe, but I am no expert.  I prefer a medium roast, something that tastes like coffee without knocking me over.  After reading all the reviews I picked this variety and I really like it.<br /><br />The non-cup kcup looks weird but it works just the same.  I keep the extra ones in a plastic ziptop bag that has been configured to fit in my kcup  drawer.  Even after a week of being open an resealed , the coffee still tastes great.<br /><br />This product is significantly cheaper, but it is not because of the taste or quality.

review/summary: Good Coffee
review/text: I don't normally write reviews on Amazon, however, I do really like this coffee.  It fit perfectly into my Keurig, though I looked at it quite skeptically when I opened the package this morning. The coffee itself brewed a very nice, balanced cup of coffee.  I am giving it 4 stars only because I'm concerned that without it being completely sealed in each kcup/pod hybrid, how will the coffee stay fresh over any extended period of time.  I usually keep my kcups in a bowl, in order to grab, brew and go quickly.  We'll see how it does over time.

review/text: These work perectly in my machine.  I have not measured the coffee weight between this and the K-Cups, however it seema generous.  The coffee is robust, more dark and smokey.  I can't give it a 5, as I think they could do better describing the flavor.  Definitley woth a try is you like coffee. Great concept and good execution.

review/summary: Pods work well in my Keurig brewer, but taste is too strong and acidic
review/text: Picked the Rainforest blend up at a local big box wholesale club because price was almost $10 cheaper (for an 80-count box) than my favorite Green Mountain brand, Colombian Fair Trade. I have been drinking the Green Mountain Colombian for several years, love the smooth, yet full bodied flavor. These San Fransisco Coffee Company pods were bitter and strong tasting and left me with an acidic stomach condition which I hadn't experienced in years. I will be returning these and continue to use my Green Mountain Colombian Fair Trade k-cups. I had high hopes for these less expensive pods, but to me it is all about the taste and I don't like the taste, period!

review/summary: STRONG!!!  But so good!  And "relatively" inexpensive...
review/text: I tried out this coffee because very few fair trade & organic subscribe and save options out there and it was almost half the price of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5XUGK">Coffee People, Tree Hugger, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA30XC">Green Mountain Coffee, Colombian Fair Trade Select K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers, 50 count</a> when ordered through Subscribe & Save.  That said, the truly price sensitive among us will point out that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RO5M1Q">San Francisco Bay 100% Organic Coffee Rainforest Blend Whole Bean 3 Lbs</a> allows you to make a whole pot of coffee for about the same price, or use a MyCup/eKobrew if you still are in love with the single cup thing.  (I'm forbidden from using MyCups because I can't seem to use them without getting some coffee grounds all over the place and my wife considers coffee grounds on the floor to be grounds for divorce.)<br /><br />First, the actual cups themselves are fascinating.  I think they are able to get the lower price because they are using a K-Cup compatible packaging without actually having to pay a licensing fee to Green Mountain (which has a patent expiring in late 2012).  Green Mountain is apparently suing them for infringement, so that may end up having an effect.<br /><br />These alternate cups are smaller and I suspect a bit more environmentally friendly than K-Cups, but not by a huge amount.  They have coffee filters holding the beans in, instead of plastic.  The downside of this is that they can dry out, so they come in plastic bags holding a six or so each.  The filters don't work quite as well as K-Cups, so I have ocassionally found some grounds in my coffee.  It's not a huge deal to me, but might be for you.<br /><br />They also advertise that it works in various non-Keurig systems, but I was a Keurig early adopter so I haven't tried any of the others.<br /><br />Okay, for the coffee taste test, this stuff is STRONG.  All the fair trade, organic, eco-friendly, hippiesh vibe (complete with a photo on the side of the box of the whole extended family smiling in front of rustic commune looking backdrop) does not prepare you for this.  This is coffee that drinks you back.  It's smooth without tasting burnt or overly bitter, but full-bodied doesn't really begin to describe it, unless that body was of a heavyweight boxer... and this coffee was a boxer, it would be Joe Frazier.  If this coffee was a spaceship, it would be the Death Star.  This isn't some coffee that gently wakes you up after being mixed with foamed milk and maybe a shot of flavored corn syrup, this is coffee that wakes you up by beating you over the head and shouting at you like the Drill Instructor from Full Metal Jacket.<br /><br />Okay, so maybe I'm a bit jacked up from my two HUGE mugs this morning, but this stuff has the caffeine to back up that taste, and with a newborn and a toddler, it's the only thing that gets me moving at this-clock-has-to-be-broken-it-can't-really-be-that-early AM.  And keeps me moving, because it leaves me with a mild case of the shakes.  Three will have me wired all day.<br /><br />So after singing the praises of this coffee, why would I rate it only four stars?  As much as I'm a huge fan of this coffee, my wife won't even go near the stuff... for precisely the reasons I listed above.  She'll stick to her sweet donut shop concoctions.  So YMMV.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I love the convenience of my Keurig, but HATE the waste that it creates.  I've tried the reusable baskets, and haven't enjoyed the resulting coffee much.  The format of these is fantastic... I store them in a mason jar in the dark, and after using one, it's really easy to rip open the filter material and add the coffee grounds & filter material to my compost.  Then, I'm recycling a small plastic ring and some (much lighter-duty than a regular K cup) foil, rather than adding the whole used plastic cup and coffee grounds to a landfill.  I tried to do the same with a regular k-cup, but it was much more difficult and messy to open and empty them.<br /><br />Rating a four because I really like the coffee blend, I don't love it.  I will definitely try other varieties in this format though!

review/text: My husband and I love the idea of single brew, but we were not having any luck at finding a coffee that tasted like brewed or drip.  This one was a very pleasant surprise!  First, if I can drink it black, it's a really good cup of coffee ... and I do.  Second, less plastic to go into the landfill makes me a little less guilty-feeling.  Third, it works out to less $ per cup.  Fourth, it's organic, which I strive for.<br /><br />All-in-all, highly recommended.

review/summary: San Fran k-cup all the blends
review/text: Since we have found the San Francisco brand of K-cups for Keurig brewers, we will NEVER go back to the enclosed K-cups.<br />We love ALL the San Francisco blends.  The French Roast is perfect for a bolder cup, it also seems to be the only one in Decaf which my husband uses...I like either the Rainforest or Breakfast Blend for a softer cup in the evening.<br />We live above 7,000 feet elevation in Colorado and had trouble with the enclosed cups because of the pressure created inside so we had to puncture the tops with a toothpick before placing them in the machine, otherwise the grounds would shoot up into the water spout and cause it to clog up...<br />With the mesh type cup of the San Francisco brand, this never happens and I have noticed there is no more coffee ground residue to be cleaned out of the cup area either.<br />I only put a few at a time in the 'coffee basket' each day and keep the rest in their package, folded and clipped to keep them semi airtight..<br />We LOVE them all and they have solved any of the functional problems we occasionally had with the brewer.

I store mine in a resealable air tight container next to my coffee maker and it keeps them perfect.

I was expecting a nice medium roast blend flavor, but it is bolder and stronger than that - even when brewing 2 cups from a pod. It smells awesome in the package and while brewing. And, the pods fit the Keurig perfectly. I will use what I have, but not reorder this blend.

review/text: I tried this special coffee last month, fell in love with the low acid notes in my morning pick-me-up, and have never looked back on other brands. Hands down, this is the best of the best in our household.<br /><br />The eco-friendly packaging, compared to other K-cups, puts other manufacturers to shame. In this case, less is more. And better. And environmentally-friendly. I like that the coffee is organic, and that rain forests around the world benefit from the production of their coffee beans (fair trade, shade grown), packaged and produced. Even with my coffee, I am looking for ways to help support eco-friendly businesses and products.<br /><br />And with this order, you receive eighty k-cup pods for thirty-three dollars. It is affordable and tastes great. Recommended.<br /><br />T.B. Grant<br />9.9.12

A $10 difference lower in price for the 80 count box as compared to Newmans or Green Mountain bold 80 count coffee. What a pleasant surprise. Great taste, rich flavor at small & medium setting. Who cares what the container looks like??? It tastes good and its much less expensive that comparitive brands. Most medium to full flavor coffee in the K cup or pod version are weaker when pushed to the Large setting.. This one is as well. Obviously the more water processed through a medium blend of coffee in a premeasured container the weaker it will be...Make two cups at medium setting and you should be happy.

review/summary: Best and Cheapest K-Cup Option I've Found
review/text: These k-cups are cheap because they don't have the plastic cup base. That means that they don't keep as long, but frankly I haven't had an issue with that. They are delivered in 12-pack bags with most of the air pushed out of a valve. I immediately put them in the freezer except for the current 12 I'm using. I drink about 3 cups a day, and keep the open k-cups in a sealed plastic bag on a shelf. Quality has not degraded to a point where I've even noticed.<br /><br />A few notes:<br />- This is apparently the same bean mix they use in Fog Chaser, but it clearly is a lighter roast. I find it suits my taste preferences better than Fog Chaser, and my understanding is that a lighter roast means more caffeine.<br />- A normal k-cup has a plastic base, the filter basket with the grounds, a plastic ring to hold the basket in place, and a metal foil seal. These are significantly cheaper in part because they don't have that cup. This leads to my storing the 12-packs in the freezer until I need them. I would suggest trying the ones with the full cup first to figure out if this (or Fog Chaser) can be your regular coffee, and if so, definitely get these.<br />- One issue that I don't care about, but others do, is that the cup isn't there to catch the really fine grounds. You will end up with some grounds at the bottom of your cup. If that bugs you, don't get these. The grounds are very fine and don't affect the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />Oh, the taste: it's a medium roast perhaps on the lighter side of the spectrum. If you like a darker roast (e.g., that popular coffee chain that burns their beans to ashes, IMHO),  then you'll like Fog Chaser more probably. The acidity and bitterness are well-balanced. I drink my coffee straight black, which is how I like it; if I kept the same taste but switched to cream and/or sugar, I would go with Fog Chaser. The thing I like about this blend/roast is that it has excellent flavor with a hint of nuttiness. It doesn't have a ton of body, IMHO, but that's just what I've found to be the case with the Keurig. I'm thinking about the K2, but I'll wait for more pod choices.<br /><br />Finally, I'll be honest, I don't buy these for eco reasons; I'm too picky about my coffee. However, there is less waste and, if I was the sort of person to compost, it would be very easy to separate the basket from the ring and compost the grounds.

I have tried all of the K-cups and mostly enjoyed Paul Newman's and the "Donut Shop" ones (the one with the doughnut on it and the one with the baker guy on it).

I never did see it in BJ's again?! so I searched online for it!<br /><br />Hot or simply poured over ice, hands down, my favorite.  I can't drink any other.  I am constantly recommending it (and reluctantly parted with some samples to prove it) to a few people and they ALL agree.  We are all hooked.  It is also great because it is environmentally packaged (no plastic cup)....I bet the lack of 'plastic' makes the taste better.  You can't lose.  I drink two to three cups a day (Rainforest) and each sip is as good as the first.  In fact, I am going to make a cup right now.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TGDXMK">San Francisco Bay Coffee Organic One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend, 80-Count</a>

review/summary: Tastes Great! Less Filling! (less filling for the landfill that is)
review/text: I will say I was skeptical.<br />I had my vacuum packer all ready to seal up all these cups since they wouldn't benefit the way the coffee in the k-cups do being sealed away from the air.<br />I opened the box, cool, 10 vacuum baggies!<br />They should really list that in their description!<br />So never fear, unless you only drink a cup a week your coffee won't go stale!<br /><br />Anyways, on to the coffee.<br />First off, something I've missed... the smell of ground coffee.<br />OMG! I cut open the bag and was knocked back back a beautiful and incredibly tempting coffee aroma!<br />This had a really good flavor, nice and full, not bitter.<br />After trying it at 10oz, i then re-brewed (@6oz) the same pack to fill my 16oz cup.<br />The filter held up extremely well and the coffee still tasted delicious and not watered down.<br />There were no chunks of bean in my cup as I finished, some fine powdery grounds, but I get more when i double brew a k-cup.<br /><br />So pluses:<br />Coffee tastes good<br />Slightly less trash than a K-Cup<br />A WHOLE LOT cheaper than K-Cup<br />Organic<br />Sealed into small quantity packs<br />To be able to smell your coffee beans<br />Multiple roast strengths and decaf are available.<br />Did I mention it tastes good?<br /><br />Cons:<br />Still pricier than bulk coffee<br />Sealed in 8 count pouches, so if you don't drink frequently you will have to re-vacuum.<br />Storage, it is a little more inconvenient than being able to stack the k-cups in the drawer, but I have plenty of room.<br />No selection of flavored coffees (yet, according to their website they are coming soon)<br /><br />I applaud the manufacturer for improving on the k-cup, and for producing a finely roasted bean!<br />I cannot remember the last time I actually thanked a company for their product, but I will now!<br />Thank You San Francisco Bay Coffee!<br />You have a new fan!

review/summary: Renewed Enthusiasm
review/text: Like some other Keurig coffee maker owners, I have been buying less and less coffee because the price of K-cups has been going up and up.  I was for a time ordering all kinds of k-cups online but it just got so expensive that I quit ordering and started buying those little boxes of 12 at the grocery store when I needed more coffee.  At last I have found coffee at a really good price!!!  This San Francisco Bay coffee is not only affordable, but it tastes like a good cup of coffee should taste!  I ordered 72 cups and when I tasted the first one I ordered 72 more!  It smells good too when you open the package.  I was about to give up on my two year old Keurig coffee maker because the k-cups were getting just too expensive.  Thanks to San Francisco Bay brand, I think I'll keep using it.

review/summary: A great brew
review/text: This product had earlier gotten mixed reviews and I held off from ordering it, but it was on sale w/ more positive than negative reviews and I took a chance on it.  This is w/o question the best "K cup" type of coffee I've ever had.  Yes, it does come in a non-resealable bag, but I just took the whole bag and put it into a zip lock.  No problem at all.  The aroma when you open the orig. bag is outstanding.  This coffee maintains that aroma until the last cup is gone.  The flavor is really superb and tastes more like regularly brewed (drip or percolated) than the original K cups.  Not only is it a great coffee for aroma and taste, but it's a more degradable product thus making it more environmentally friendly.  Still not as good as just grounds, but an improvement over the other single brewing products.

review/text: I like the convenience of my Krueg, but was not happy with those all plastic cups.  I also didn't want the mess of filling the cup that came with my machine.  I tried many brands...all purchased from Amazon.  San Francisco Bay Fogchaser arrived when I had house guests so we compared Fogchaser to some other brands.  First of all I was pleased to see instead of a plastic cup, it was in a little bag with a plastic ring....still plastc but much less.  But the important thing is we all liked the coffee better then the other brands.  I am on my second order.  I am trying to determine how much we use so I can place an automatic order.

review/summary: good coffee, not as convenient
review/text: ordered this based on reviews, and of course, price. quite a bit less than k cups. initially thought coffee was too strong, but, after a couple tries i now actually enjoy the rain forest mix. packaging does make it less convenient - for most the k cup machines are bought for convenience, so, you will need to weigh that against the price. these come in a vacuum sealed package per 12. once opened you will need to move them to a reasealable bag to stay fresh, no biggie. my biggest gripe is the water, when brewing, tends to shoot down the back side of the front of my machine and the holder also drips water for quite a while after brewing. this is because these cups are not really cups at all but filters with a top. like the inside of the regular plastic k cups. so, the machine is just shooting water through a filter - the pressure is not really doing much as it does with the k cups where the pressure actually drives the water through and out of the sealed plastic cup. the coffee seems to taste fine even though it is working more like a drip coffee maker with a turbo boost. for my machine at least - i need to do a quick wipe down after brewing or there are some puddles around. so, less convenient. however, once my regular k cups are finished up i will switch over as the price justifies a bit less convenience. hoping they come out with some more flavors.

review/summary: Ive tried them all, these are the best - for flavor and cost
review/text: I was starting to get bummed about my fancy Kuerig machine because I was getting tired of the cost of K-cups all the time...it adds up!  Especially with shipping!  I tried these just the one time to give it a whirl, and I say, they are so delicious.  I do the monthly renewal for $13 (I think?), it is so inexpensive.  I am a starbucks addict and my husband is very picky about his coffee (we live in Seattle - that should say alot lol)  These look different that K-cups being the bottom is open and not a plastic cup, but it brews perfectly.  The only thing is I no longer use my kcup carousel because since the bottom is open to air and not the cup you dont want them getting stale, so I went and purchased an air tight container for the counter top. NBD tho.  Hope you try them! You will be happy!

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: The first thing I loved about this coffee was how quickly it was shipped and I loved the different type K-Cup. While I realize that some people were upset because it wasn't like the regular K-Cups...I actually like this style better. This style is more compact and much easier to store, once I opened one of the 3 bags, I just placed the open bag in a zip lock storage bag to maintain freshness. I hate bitter, strong, dark coffee and that is always my biggest fear when ordering an unknown. In my search for something that appeals to me I have found many that were too strong or too weak. At first taste, I thought OMG..this is the one!! Not too weak, not too strong and I could actually taste a nice flavor but about half way through the cup, I started to notice an aftertaste. So, while I won't have any problems drinking what I bought, I probably won't buy it again even though the price was awesome. I'll keep my fingers crossed that once I get used to it, I won't notice the aftertaste

review/summary: Hands Down The Best Bold K-Cup of Coffee!
review/text: I stumbled across these on Amazon, and since I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the usual 50 cent K-Cup, I figured I would give these a try - Am I glad I did!!<br /><br />For me at least, one of the issues with the Keurig K-Cup is that most make a cup of coffee that is too weak, especially if you want a larger cup.  This Fog Lifter brand does not.  The flavor is perfect, no bitterness and the strength is even good at the highest setting on my Keurig (travel mug size).  I only add a little heavy whipping cream to my coffee and it is the best (if you have never tried "heavy whipping cream", give it a shot), you don't know what your are missing, yes, it has fat, but no carbs, no sugars.<br /><br />Anyway I knew these were not traditional K-Cup, but who cares, in fact, I think this design is far superior.  The filter material is a bit thicker than the normal K-Cup paper filter, so the fact that the coffee does not drip through a single hole, does not matter, the flavor is still great.  The only thing that would make these better would be if they came in resealable bags, but then the price would go up.  I either just cut the corner off of the bag, then seal it with a plastic chip clip, or lately I have been buying Davidsons Tea.  The tea comes in a large foil-paper resealable bag. When my tea ran out, I started dropping my Fog Lifter cups in these bags, works great.  Both type of bags (the tea ones and the original ones that these K-Cups come in), have a small one way valve to get all the air out.  Super find, super buy

review/summary: Great Alternative
review/text: I was skeptical when I ordered these, but couldn't resist the opportunity of a lower cost alternative to K-cups.  When the box arrived, I ripped it open immediately and brewed my first cup.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that while it's a much lighter blend than I prefer, it was good coffee!  My husband is the light blend coffee drinker in the house, and he gives it his full approval.  I've moved on to the SF Bay French Roast. I'm now a happy Subscribe & Save customer of both blends.<br /><br />I have noticed more than one post concerned about the amount of coffee in these OneCups as compared to a typical K-cup.  While I haven't gone as far as actually measuring, I will note that the bottom half of all K-cups is in fact empty space.  The filter and foil top construction of a standard K-cup looks nearly identical to the SF Bay OneCups.  The SF Bay OneCups have simply eliminated the plastic "cup" part of the K-cup.  Yes, that plastic part is what keeps the coffee fresh.  This is easily resolved in the OneCups, as others have stated already, by storing the coffee in an airtight container or bag.

review/text: I was rather stunned when I received the SF Bay Rainforest Blend Coffee.  They are in a very different little packet than I was accustomed to with the regular Kerig type cups.  I decided to give it a try.  I really  like it.  You can, just like with the other type, run as much water through it as you want and thus make it as strong as you want.  I really see no difference in that part.  In addition, I really like the "flavor".  Try it -- you'll like it, I believe.

review/summary: Great Price, Great Taste, Great Company
review/text: We have been drinking this Rainforest Blend for a couple of weeks now and I personally enjoy this blend! My husband likes it, but it isn't his favorite. We have some good friends who come over to visit and the husband loves it so much he's going to start ordering it when he gets his Keurig back (a recent move has much of their belongings in storage temporarily). Taste is soooo subjective.<br /><br />Here's my take: I am not one who likes dark roasted coffees (they all taste "burnt" to me). This one is bold and strong without tasting burnt! I love that! I also don't like a bitterness in my coffee. I use very little sugar (about a half a teaspoon) and just enough cream to get a dark caramel color (like one - two of the little prepackaged liquid creamers). I want to taste the coffee, not my condiments. I enjoy that with this coffee blend!<br /><br />I'm ordering the Breakfast Blend now to find one that both me and my husband will like. We have generally liked the Breakfast Blend from most coffee makers. We want it to be bold enough without being an overly dark roasted bean.<br /><br />About the packaging. Their packaging is great, using less plastic with a filter for the casing. One thing my husband pointed out is with the whole bottom being the filter, the water really spreads throughout the whole "cup" instead of burrowing a path to the exit like most of the traditional kcups do. How smart!<br /><br />Another thing I am quite pleased with is their business practice for being good to the earth, fair to the growers, and making a difference with the community efforts in the lives of those people. That is awesome!<br /><br />I'm hooked on San Francisco Bay Coffee, now just working on finding the one blend that works for me and my husband.<br />Catherine

review/summary: Infested with Insects - Quick and Easy Return
review/text: After I received the tree, I was disappointed that my bonsai was noticeably different from the one pictured. It took a lot of careful pruning to bring the obviously neglected tree back in order. After pruning the tree, I noticed small insects infesting the bottoms of the leaves. When I contacted the seller, they gave me a full refund. For the price point, it's hard to beat. I actually considered ordering another one.

review/text: I am just starting to get into bonsai and wanted a small tree I can grow myself. This fukien tea tree is so adorable and it came packaged wonderfully. There was not one bad thing about the tree--in fact some of the flowers were in bloom (and they were adorable!) In addition to the tree, moss was included in the pot! I was really wanting some moss for my plant and I was happy it came with it. Essentially, the tree looks exactly as picture, and it's about 7" tall. I will definitely order from Hirt's again--my first experience with buying plants online and it was great. Thanks so much for your excellent products.

review/summary: Kona blend?  Not really.
review/text: If you are a Kona drinker you know there's a shortage now and has been since 2010.  Many of us have switched to blends and save our loved and expensive 100% Kona for special occasions.  This year even the 10% Kona blend I've been drinking for everyday coffee ran out, so I'm trying to find a substitute.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good Kona blend, this is not it.<br /><br />Not to say that's it is bad coffee.  It is fine as a light tasting cup of joe.  I actually enjoy it as an afternoon coffee.  It is mild with a small hint of sweetness, but no floral tones.  Although a nice, mild cup of coffee, it simply does not taste like Kona.  It tastes like a light roast of quality Colombian or maybe R&eacute;union - ie, good quality, but inexpensive and common.<br /><br />If any Kona beans really are blended in, they're so watered down as to be non-existent.

review/text: I purchased the Kona to use with a small coffee maker to use on a trip to Las Vegas.  I purchased the Kona because my wife loves Kona as a result of a Hawaii vacation some years ago.  Coffee upsets her stomach and she usually has to cut her coffee with water then add 1/2 & 1/2 creamer.  She can drink this Kona black without adding anything and no stomach upset.  I'm back to buy more after our trip.  By all means, don't buy this stuff, I want to make sure there's some left the nexttime I check in.

review/summary: Best kitty treats for my picky old kitties!
review/text: My kitties both recently started having to take medication. I wanted to give them treats, to show them how good they are for taking the medicines, and to give them something positive to associate that moment with. Thing is, historically they don't care for treats. Both of them are remarkably not food-motivated!<br /><br />So I bought a pack of the chicken flavored Greenies. I opened the bag, and both kitties sat up to attention! One of them has gotten over his mad love for the treats, but the other kitty asks for them in the morning. It's great to have a little treat/leverage with him! Viva Greenies

review/summary: Putting the ginger back in ginger ale!
review/text: I know, I know. These reviews are nothing but memories, but I can't help it! If I can drink a tasty drink that is good for me, gives me energy, and makes me think of happy things, well, why wouldn't I? This one is all my grandmother and my father. Every Thanksgiving, my grandmother would let us drink cranberry juice mixed with ginger ale, and we felt so grown up. So grown up! It's still my preferred way of drinking cranberry juice, and when the cranberry ginger ale is released around the holidays, all I do is think of her. Her son, my father, is a ginger ale memory for me too, it's his favorite soft drink. Vernor's, if you've got it, or Schweppes, but Canada Dry will do in a pinch and make him think of me anyway. When my wife is ill, it's ginger ale, if you please, not lemon-lime anything. You know that old adage that girls always search for someone like their father? It's so true in my case...my wife and my father are amazingly alike. So when I spotted it on the Red Leaf tea website, I had to grab it for my campaign to get her to like ginger ale. Who knows, I might convert my dad with it when he comes up to visit next!<br /><br />This is wonderful. Ginger and I are not the best of buddies, but I'm coming around to it. This reminds me of a local ginger ale found only in Middle Kentucky called "Ale-8-1". It's full of ginger flavor, but in a very good way. If you get this one, don't be put off by the overwhelming ginger smell, it's not nearly as strong as it smells, which is a good thing to me. It would definitely be a matcha I reach for when I'm headed into work with an upset stomach, but need a pick me up. I don't think it's one I'll keep in stock, but it's not one I'll be actively trying to swap away either. I'm excited to try it with the cranberry. If you're familiar with ginger ale brands, it's more of a Vernor's than anything else. Lord have mercy, I spend way too much time with ginger ale, apparently. But if I can talk my Dad into trying matcha, this will definitely be the one I lead with. Who knows, my father in law greatly enjoyed the French Vanilla matcha from Red Leaf Tea, maybe my dad can be won over as well!

review/summary: the best green drink I have ever tried
review/text: This green drink, (Raw reserve) is the best tasting green drink I have ever tried, and over the years, I have tried several. I add fresh lemon juice and cayenne pepper to it and I actually enjoy the taste.<br /><br /> But here is the best part: I recently bought Ph strips to test my acidity (or alkalinity) level at various points based on what I ate. So yesterday evening I had two glasses of red wine. I decided to test my ph (via urine)afterward and I was as acidic as you can be, not good. So I made myself a big glass of Raw Reserve (with lemon and cayenne)and then later tested my ph again to see if it got better. I was in the "ideal" range, in fact at the top of the alkaline range. This drink was the only thing that I ate/drank after the wine and it corrected the acidity that the wine had created in my body. I was very happy about that. Moral to the story--I will never be without this green drink. Other moral to the story: when I partake in red wine (which can be both beneficial and detrimental to one's health)I will mitigate the potential damage with Raw Reserve. This approach can apply to eating animal protein or other acidic foods: if you must eat the stuff, wash it down with Raw Reserve!

review/text: In my personal experience, taking this product (Raw Reserves) along with Wheat Grass in an 8oz to 12oz glass of water will reverse the symptoms one may have when eating out or on holidays (a/k/a pig-out).  In the past I have suffered from bad indigestion and once I take this product, it somehow start putting everything back to normal within half hour. You can feel the freshness of the product when mixed with water.  It does not feel like it has gone through a pasteurization process where all the enzymes and living substances of the plant have been destroyed.  If you are into juicing raw fruit and veggies, I recommend taking this product along with it as it will minimize a cup or two of juicing since it is practically equivalent to it.

My family is not a fan of the stevia aftertaste. And with Raw Reserve, we needn't worry. We can add a little juice to the raw reserve to sweeten our drinks according to our own tastes.

review/summary: Super Healthy not Super Tasty
review/text: This stuff has amazing ingredients, and is really great for you. It helped me recover from a few days of feeling really under the weather. However, the taste is just plain bad. It is bitter and reminds me of the emergency feed I give my rabbits (which is just ground up hay and vitamins). Even in a smoothie with bananas and other fruits I can taste the grassy bitterness. Green Vibrance is another product with a similar nutritional profile that I find much more palatable, so I have switched to that.

review/text: I have Celiac Disease and it is hard to keep my body healthy.  Because of the limit in diet, I always feel like I'm missing something and I'm usually at about 95%.  I never have gotten back to the 100% I was at before my Celiac.  I'm hoping that this will supply the missing pieces since it appears to have everything in it.  The fact that it is Gluten Free is a bonus!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first shake I made.  I mix various fresh fruits and juices with it in a blender but you can still taste the earthy freshness that the powder adds.  If you're looking for something that tastes like Kool-aid or Gator-aid this is not for you, but if you understand what Health Foods taste like, this should be right up your alley.

review/summary: Great Healthy Alternative to Solids
review/text: I travel for work quite a bit and don't have time to always eat healthy so I just drop this in to a gallon of water with some propel or crystal light and this fills me up.  It is also really healthy and gives me a lot of nutrients that I need.  I highly recommend for those on the go and also people who don't want to spend the $$ on expensive fruits/veggies but want the same result.  You still need to eat protein and get your calcium!!  But this is very convenient for a person who works in the field/hospitals as an outside sales rep like me and doesn't have time to go shopping or cook.  You can keep it in the car and just use it when you need to.  I take it with me when I fly or stay at hotels as well.

review/summary: Fantastic for Deployment!!
review/text: I am currently in the desert without much access to fruits and veggies.  This is a great way to get what I need to keep me healthy and alert.  My hair, skin and energy level have all improved as well as my digestion. The taste is definitely an acquired one. I mix it with whatever juice we have available and use my protein shaker to make it as smooth as possible. I will continue using this product when I am home in light of the positive effects I have read about in my research and experienced while here. However, I HIGHLY suggest this for anyone in a situation with restricted access to all the fresh yummy goodness we are used to at home.

review/text: Bought Amazing Grass Raw Reserve after consuming organic spiralina for a couple of months. This has a milder flavor and color. I mix it with orange juice (not from concentrate)in the mornings. Curbs the mid-afternoon slump. Skip my workouts less in the evenings. Recommended it to family and friends.

review/summary: Not that bad
review/text: Taste: I was wary about the taste after reading reviews before buying but as soon as I opened the jar, smelled the tea like smell and tasted it, I don't blend this with anything - I mix it in with water, which makes prep easy -no blenders, no counter full of fruits, or any of that. As soon as I opened the (glass) jar, I automatically thought of matcha powder. It smells and tastes almost like green tea powder: barely bitter and grassy. But of course, I could imagine blending it with other things to cover the taste, but imo it actually tastes pretty good for a hot day when some grassy flavors are ideal for a refreshing cool taste.<br /><br />Results: For a "Green Superfood" it hasn't altered or change my life in a significant super way or anything, but a plus anyway since it's full of great ingredients and that I notice whenever I'm tired, I start craving this and just a sip or two is an automatic energy boost for me. Maybe that affect is just me, but I would still recommend this as a tea or coffee substitute as an energy booster for those who try it and have the same results.<br /><br />For the Vegetable Haters: I also gave this to friends and family who I knew were trying to go on a detox/ incorporate more vegetables into their diet, but who I also knew detested anything green. I mixed it with some honey and diluted with twice the recommended water amount (bottle says 1 spoon/ 6 oz, I put 1 spoon/ 12 oz) and they happily drank it, loved that it was at par with what they were trying to achieve in terms of vegetable consumption, and agreed with the tea-like taste.

review/summary: Great product to keep on hand
review/text: I love having this product on hand.  I can't tell you how much is saves me both in money and time to be able to mix up whatever amount of buttermilk I need for a recipe.  I even add it to my chocolate chip cookies...makes them snappy!  I also keep the powder cheese (not sauce)on hand for cheese popcorn and I add a bit with milk to leftover mac and cheese when reheating.  My kids can't tell they're left overs.  What great money saving products.

review/summary: Buttermilk Powder
review/text: This product does not come with measurement directions so you don't know the ratio of how much powder to water to mix.  I contacted the seller twice to request direction with no response.
