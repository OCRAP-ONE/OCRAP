review/summary: I fell in love.....
review/text: When I went to visit my boyfriend in Boston and he had a few large assorted bags of Terra Chips left over from a function at work. I have always liked the mixed Terra Chips but when I grabbed the bag of these it was love at first bite!<br /><br />I was not aware that these are not salted until I had eaten half of the bag and decided to check out the ingredients. I am a salt fan and on a high salt diet so I was especially shocked to realize that I had not noticed the missing salt.<br /><br />Within 24 hours the bag was gone and he had no opportunity to sample even one chip! He also hates beets but will eat them in this form. So, I figure a fried beet beats no beet at all!!<br /><br />I also love that I don't feel guilty indulging in these as some of the other snack foods I eat are questionable in nature. So I keep these on hand and the other snacks drop by the wayside. These are my 'go to' snack now. The price here is also excellent as I'd pay a great deal more at the store per bag. They always arrive fresh and in very good condition.<br /><br />Thanks Terra and Amazon!

review/summary: I REALLY like these
review/text: The second dozen bags seemed to be a little less spicey.  I rather like the spice!  I know sweet potatoes are healthier than white/red potatoes. I'm eager to see their new Parsnip Chips!  I love parsnips. (FYI parsnips are offered in Terra's mixed veggie bag, but I avoid high-iodine content items like beets... not sure if I might be allergic to some of those other veggies like taro.. not willing to test!)

review/summary: A DIFFERENT CHIP
review/text: I like sweet potato fries, and so I wanted to try these chips.  They're spicey, and if you like a spicey chip, then you should try these.  I like spicey foods, but I was a little disappointed in not being able to really taste the sweet potato.  This chip was given a high rating by CENTER FOR SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST'S Nutrition Action Newsletter.  I'm going to try the plain sweet potato chips.  I give ten stars to Amazon's packaging.  With packaging and fast delivery, who needs to go to the grocery store for chips?

review/summary: Open Bags on arrival !! Check every one!
review/text: 7 out of the 12 bags were completely open on the BOTTOM. Taking out the first bag, it was not damaged and I didn't see the issue until I pulled out the second bag. Over half of this purchase is completely unusable and of course, unreturnable. The oil from the bags also seeped through the cardboard box...<br /><br />This is a good product, don't get me wrong, or I wouldn't have purchased 12 bags at one time. But be very very careful and check every bag when the box arrives. I don't agree with rating products poorly for bad shipping, but this wasn't bad shipping. The bags never look like they sealed, but they might have popped open. The cardboard box they all came in was not damaged in any way, so this looks like a product packaging flaw.<br /><br />I will purchase these from the store in the future where I can check the bag, but never again online.

This would be a good deal if the bags did not expire next month and in the two bags that have been opened so far, the chips are over cooked.

review/summary: Disorienting, but tasty!
review/text: I've had sweet potato fries before, and they really are delicious where I had them, so I wanted to give these a shot. From the first bite I'm pretty sure I got a hilarious look of astonishment on my face. It's like nothing I ever tasted before--weird, but quite good, which is about how I felt when I first bit into a properly ripe mango. Definitely the spices are unique when balanced with the sweet potato flavor. I think I tasted some garlic, but I know there's a very faint smidgeon of cayenne, and the cilantro was noticeable as well, but no one flavor or spice overwhelms the others, which is good.<br /><br />If you like any sort of spiced potato chips, like mesquite barbecue or jalapeno or the buffalo ranch doritos, I'd give these babies a try. They're healthy and you might find a nice occasional alternative to the not-so-healthy stuff. Hey, if it tastes good, why not? One thing these chips prove is that not all "health food" has to taste bland or nasty. Sort of like spelt bread and Newman's ginger cookies, and Izze's luscious pear soda. Terra's spiced sweet potato chips have a surprising flavor and are probably not for everyone, but if you like the spicy kind of regular chips, pick up a bag of these somewhere--they'll probably be just your sort of thing.

The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.  This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic.

review/text: The packaging is rather painful to open.  They should design these with parents of new babies in mind.  Most food products with peel tops have one corner which is indicated as the side to open and the hard plastic has a crack allowing for the user to easily bend and peel the top.  No such luck with these tubs of baby food from Gerber.  It's not clear which side should be opened by the packaging and whichever one you choose will be equally stubborn before you can finally peel the top and feed your hungry baby.

review/summary: Baby likes it enough to eat it however, I just found out it's plastic #7
review/text: I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.

These are a decent value for the price normally, but really good in this case option.  Normally at stores it's the 2 tub pack for $1 and change.  This case has 8 of the packs, making it a total of 16 tubs.  It's a lot of prunes but she eats them often and loves them.

review/text: I got 3 sets of food for my 6 month old to have some variety.  I didn't realize kids are on stage 1 foods for a very brief period so we had to mix these stage 1 foods in with stage 2 and 3 foods to use them. I'm sure these are great if you have multiple children, but for one child, these packs are too large to get more than one, but one box doesn't provide variety...

review/summary: Great Drink Product Plus Lower in Calories Than Most
review/text: I happened to try this at Whole Foods one day and I was very pleasantly surprised.  This is a terrific little drink and if you put it into a glass over ice, it looks great too.  Consider using it at any parties for friends who do not drink alcohol.  They will love it. My husband is one of these people and I know it is now his party drink of choice.  I love the flavor of both pomegranate juice and limeade.  This is combined with sparkling water and the result is a drink that is very light, refreshing and not heavy on sugar.  It is 90 calories for the can and it is very satisfying.  It will give you that energy boost with no caffeine.  I actually like this better than limeade now which quite surprised me as I like limeade very well.  I am trying to make my own to bring down the price further but so far I haven't gotten close.  I have a feeling I will just keep buying it.  A pack of 4 at Whole Foods is five bucks. I picked up a pack of this company's mango version of this drink.  It was ok but not nearly as good as this.

review/summary: Nice Iced Coffee
review/text: Mr. Brown regular iced coffee is what my family drinks every week. My parents were born and raised in Thailand, and a lot Thai people like to drink iced coffee. Many Asians from countries of warmer climates like to drink iced coffee. Mr. Brown Iced Coffee is a product of King Car Food Ind. Co., Ltd. This company is located in Taipei, Taiwan. One can has 103 calories. Anyways, the regular iced coffee from Mr. Brown is just right. It's not bitter, not bland, not sweet. I think this iced coffee is appropriate to drink during the daytime. My family members have been loyal to this Mr. Brown regular iced coffee for the past few years. My parents think that Starbucks iced coffees are too sweet and more expensive. Recently, I ordered Taste Nirvana's Tisane Cafe Drink Thai Coffee, and I liked it. I gave a whole case of 12 cans of Taste Nirvana Thai coffee to my father as part of his Father's Day gift. Taste Nirvana's Thai coffee tastes sweeter than Mr. Brown's regular iced coffee. My parents agreed with me. Taste Nirvana drinks are all products of Thailand. If you are a coffee drinker who likes to drink black coffee with nothing else added to it, then Mr. Brown's regular iced coffee is the iced coffee for you. If you are a coffee drinker who likes flavored coffees and dessert-style coffees, then Taste Nirvana's Thai coffee is the iced coffee for you. Now, if you're like me, a person who could drink any style of coffee, regular black coffee to flavored coffees, then I suggest buying both company's iced coffees. Drink Mr. Brown's regular iced coffee during the day and drink Taste Nirvana's Thai Coffee during the evening. Taiwan's Mr. Brown also offer iced coffees in other flavors besides regular - they have iced coffees in Macadamia Nut, Vanilla, Cappuccino, and Blue Mountain. I think it's great that we can order Asian iced coffees online instead of always having to visit an international food store/grocery to see if any of these brands of coffees are available or in stock. But at the same time, I believe in supporting the local international food stores. But there are times when they are not in stock or moments when people don't want to travel a long distance to go grocery shopping. And ordering online for those times makes life a little easier. Anyways, I highly recommend buying Asian iced coffees - particularly those from Mr. Brown and Taste Nirvana.

review/summary: Rolled Wheat Hot Cereal: Where are you??
review/text: I was raised on Fisher's Zoom, then a popular rolled wheat hot cereal. They still make it, but you have to buy it on-line in case lots. Oatmeal is everywhere, but just try to find rolled wheat on the retail shelves. I was in Houston last week on business, and figured H.E.B. would carry it -- they have just about everything else... Nope! Bob's Red Mill Flakes Rolled Wheat is the closest thing to Zoom, but you'll never see it in the grocery or health food stores. You have to buy it on-line, four bags at a time. (But that's better than in case lots, and unlike Zoom, Bob's never cooks up lumpy.)<br /><br />  Now, don't just pour milk and sugar on it. (Yuck!) Grow up and eat it British style, with butter (or your favorite margarine) and plenty of salt and pepper. (YUM!) If you have an aversion to butter, etc, try it with olive oil. (Mamma Mia!) Bob's cooks up in about 8 minutes on the stove top (yes I know, an eternity these days) -- 1/2 cup water to 1/4 cup cereal for one serving.<br /><br />  If you mistakenly cook up too much, don't fret. Just press it into a 1/2" slab onto a buttered cookie sheet, cover with waxed paper, and store in the refrigerator over night. Next morning, cut the slab into strips and fry 'em up with your eggs and bacon. We called it "fried mush" when I was a kid.<br /><br />  Anyway, try Bob's Red Mill Flakes Rolled Wheat cereal! You'll love it, and will forever be as regular as night follows day. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045VZQOK">Bob's Red Mill Flakes Rolled Wheat, 16-ounces (Pack of4)</a>

review/summary: Not gluten free.  Wow, in a bad way.
review/text: Amazon won't let me take all the stars off, or I would.  I had a really cool, Garrison Keillor-esque review of this up, complete with a discussion about how I made apple pie with this for Thanksgiving.<br /><br />What I didn't know yet, was that this is not, in fact, actually gluten-free.  Then I got a nasty surprise--two days of gluten-symptoms.  (The five non-celiac family members who very kindly had a gluten-free Thanksgiving with me didn't get sick at all.)<br /><br />I looked around online, and in some of the celiac forums--apparently Arrowhead Mills doesn't have dedicated, meaning 'gluten-free only', lines.<br />So, this isn't gluten-free.  It's not even close.<br /><br />Don't despair, though:  there are other companies that had the same idea, specifically, The Gluten Free Pantry makes a basic flour mix with the same ingredients.  I can't find anything online that says anyone has ever had a problem with them.  (In fact, they are on Clan Thompson's recommended gluten-free list.)<br /><br />Clan MacDuffie over here thinks we'll go with them instead.

Avoid this stuff if you like good texture or if you are watching your sodium intake.<br /><br />I should also note that the box I picked up had "Improved Texture" prominently displayed on the front.

I have been baking with wheat or unbleached flours for years and after reading numerous articles on gluten free flours, I was overwhelmed with the different ones available that are gluten free.  Rather than attempting an original mix this was available at my local Stop & Shop as was Bob's Red Mill.  The main difference between the two being Bob's main ingredient is bean flour, AMill's: rice flour  I prefer the rice for baking. I do mix in some White Sorgum (1/4 cup) & Xanthum Gum (3/4 tsp.) to 1cup of mix when making muffins.

I truly miss bread so I thought I would make the recipe on the back of the box for bread. It was okay, grainy, and tasted a bit like cardboard but it was the closest to bread gluten free product that I have eaten. My three year old, who is not on a gluten free diet, wanted to try a piece. He took a bite and made frantic efforts to scrape it from his tongue. He said, "that is gross" I have always baked homemade breads and sweets. He was prepared for something yummy and was unpleasantly surpised.

I will usually mix it 50/50 with the regular Rendezvous sauce and it still has plenty of zip. Don't just use it for barbecue, try it in place of your favorite hot sauce, its got great flavor for tacos, burritos, burgers, etc.

review/summary: I likes the sauce!!
review/text: Let me start by saying it doesn't get any better than Rendezvouz. When Asschowder plays Memphis, we always make rendezvous part of our trip to the bluff city. Yes, it's kind of irritating to be asked for our autographs during dinner, but the food is worth it. I tend to step the game up at the vous. The band, our roadies and some of our groupies decided to hit the vous a couple months back. They all showed up in casual clothes like most patrons do at the BBQ joint. Do you think for a second that bpimp dressed casual? Does Ryan Seacrest have any actual talent? I went out and bought a double breasted black pinstriped suit. That would probably be enough to change the game, but I don't just change the game, I reinvent it. I also bought some sperry topsiders, a top hat and a cane. I was rolling the vous.<br /><br />When we finally got around to eating some top shelf BBQ, we played a joke on j-abs. We put a mild sauce top on the hot BBQ sauce bottle. He starts eating and all of the sudden he is sweating. We ask him what is wrong and he says the sauce seems spicy. I asked him if he would like ketchup instead or if that is too spicy. THAT IS A VERY FUNNY COMMENT IN THAT SITUATION!! I owned the table at that point. We finally let him in on the joke and had a great dinner. I personally go with the hot BBQ sauce. It has some zip and tastes like heaven.<br /><br />I gave the patrons a treat after dinner. They all started chanting for me to sing the Dino classic "I like it". After some prodding, not only did I sing it, I put on a dance routine with my cane and top hat that makes Gene Kelly look like former Bills quarterback Frank Reich!<br /><br />I owned it again and average was left on the plate.

review/summary: Nothing special - and identical to Arthur Bryant's!
review/text: First of all, this sauce is really bland, which is disappointing since it's supposed to be "hot". It's about as spicy as Heinz ketchup, so if that does it for you, you'll be satisfied. I bought a bottle of this and a bottle of Arthur Bryant's (from their website) and ... it's the very same sauce! Close your eyes and you cannot tell which you're tasting - even the bottles are identical except for the labels!  At least the Rendezvous was less expensive. If you're looking for a bottle of spicy BBQ sauce I'd recommend Big Bob Gibson's or Willingham's.

Ground service should not be an option and if it is, then they should make sure the product is packaged properly to withstand the travel time.

review/summary: Moldy Shells
review/text: I've been buying the generic Jewel Foods brand peanuts the past 9 months to get my daughter to have more protein in her diet. When Hampton came out with the baseball labels, I bought the Cubs since I lived on the North side of Chicago almost 20 years near Wrigley Field, not really a baseball fan but a peanut fan that lived on the North side of Chicago. Anyway, so many of the peanuts were moldy on the outside shell (threw them out), or shriveled and black on the inside(threw them out), or not roasted enough and had that moist bite you don't want in a salted roasted peanut. Very disappointing I will continue to buy the store generic brand which was much better in consistency, taste, roasted and salted quality. Being a Chicagoan my whole life I did wonder if the Cubs bag got the rejects. Only added to the fact that I won't buy these again.

review/text: These peanuts are of low quality. I found myself throwing away more than I ate. About one out of five were even edible. Most are brown or black and if you eat one of those it is the nastiest thing you will ever taste. They are also very inconsistent in size from opening a shell and finding nothing, to getting very small hard brown or black un eatable peanuts. Not Only are they inconsistant in size but taste to, and the good ones you do find aren't that good. Don't let the big bag full of large good looking peanuts fool you.

review/summary: Very good ginger (young, tender)
review/text: Ginger is great, what is to say about it? You can eat it in a million ways, including raw -- just wash it with a potato brush and you don't even need to peel it, especially if it's young like here (mature ginger tends to be rather fibrous; young is much less so). But watch the prices: ginger is available at Wegman's for four sixty-nine a pound, no shippiing involved. And in my local Indian store they sell young ginger for between two and four bucks a pound. One has to marvel at how these little mom-and-pop stores manage to offer a better assortment of better quality produce at a fraction of the cost of similar stuff in large stores, including online. These days when I shop, I start my tour with the local Indian, Russian, and Asian stores/markets. Only then do I go to my Superfresh/Acme/etc. -- if at all. And I only buy online after making sure the price is good and stable (prices jump around a lot and can double overnight). Bottomline: this ginger here is very good, and it's come down quite a bit lately, but at my local Indian store is still cheaper (and just as good).

review/summary: Good salad dressing
review/text: I make a lot of salads for dinners (and sometimes create salad-based lunches, too). There are a boatload of prepared dressings in the grocery store (I tend to be too lazy to make my own, although sometimes I do experiment).<br /><br />Kraft Tuscan House Italian is a pretty dependable addition to our kitchen. As per material on this web site, first, the ingredients: "Canola and/or Soybean Oil, Water, Vinegar, Sugar, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic, Contains less than 2% of Salt, Garlic , Contains less than 2% of Salt, Garlic (Dried), Onions (Dried), Egg Yolks, Spice, Parmesan and Romano Made From Cow's Milk Cheeses (Part-skim Milk, Cheese Culture, Salt, Enzymes), Lemon Juice Concentrate, Red Bell Peppers (Dried), Carrots (Dried), Xanthan Gum, Calcium Disodium Edta As A Preservative." The dread Xantham gum and preservative aren't so hotsy totsy.<br /><br />However, when you add this dressing to your salad, the end result is pretty good.  There's a little zest to the dressing that adds a nice bite to the full taste of salad and dressing.<br /><br />So, in the final analysis, this is a good dressing and most people will be pretty happy with it.

review/summary: Excellent marinade & dressing
review/text: I've always used various Italian dressings as marinades for steak or chicken.  I stumbled upon this great dressing and marinade about a year ago at my local HEB grocery.<br /><br />We use this exclusively for marinating our chicken breasts. We typically will marinate 10 lbs for several days in the refrigerator, in two large Rubbermaid containers, typically shaking them once a day to allow the marinade to distribute.  We then grill the chicken, and we bag our chicken, 2 breasts per bag, for freezing.<br /><br />When we thaw the chicken for our dinner, we have consistently had wonderful, subtle yet spicy flavor.  I believe this is enhanced by the smokiness of the grilling.<br /><br />I typically do not use a dressing on my salads, but when I want a dressing, I will reach for this.  Again, it imparts a subtle, tart and spicy flavor to my salads.
