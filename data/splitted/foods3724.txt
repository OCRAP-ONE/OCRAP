review/summary: Barely a Hazelnut Flavor from Gloria Jean
review/text: Gloria Jean's cute brand name makes weak coffee. When I go to a gas station or a quick-stop my coffee choice is usually Hazelnut flavor and then I'll kick it up with some Hazelnut flavor creamers. So I happen to like Hazelnut flavored coffee and I drink it often. When I saw the chance to get some for home it looked like a good idea. Idea may have been good but the Gloria Jean Hazelnut flavored coffee fell flat on my taste buds. The best I could give it is 'adequate' since the gas station on my way to work has stuff much better for a fair price. I will use the Gloria Jean stuff up then forget about it because I don't want to be bothered sending it back. Live and learn and take the bad with the good to let an educated perception be my guide.

review/text: I purchased this coffee flavor (Hazelnut) for my wife and she is really enjoying it.  Only problem is when we received the box, all k-cups were packed inside the box and a couple of k-cup were punctured.  This is caused by the edges from the other k-cups.  We ended up with coffee grounds all inside the box. Very inconvenience.

review/text: I bought this coffee based on the good reviews that I read. Unfortunately I do not like the taste of the coffee. The coffee is very light and you get more of the hazelnut taste than the coffee. I prefer my coffee to taste a little bitter. Basically if you like coffee which is heavily flavored then this is for you.

review/text: When you go through K-cups like I do, this large quantity purchase is perfect.  Hazelnut is always a favorite and this particular brand holds up to a generous cup serving.  Some brands get too watered down in a large mug, but this has body enough to take it.  Since I store my K-cups in a drawer, it doesn't matter that the shipping box is a bare bones container.  I just appreciate the value.  All in all, it's a great way to buy K-cups in quantity.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I noticed a "different" aroma when the box arrived.  Hazlenut is my favorite flavor but I felt this flavor was not as good as other Hazlenut blends.<br />The taste is slightly bitter and just less rich and satisfying than other coffees.  Drinkable, is the best I can say.<br />I won't order this brand again.  This is my first negative review, so it isn't my personality, just the coffee.

review/summary: Superb flavor, excellent value, nice box!
review/text: I'm not really a fan of fruity flavored coffees like raspberry chocolate frappa-mocha-cina or french vanilla twist or what-have-you, but occasionally I do like a hint of hazelnut in my cup of joe, and Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups handily fill the bill.  The hazelnut taste is fairly subtle, blending well with the rich flavor of the coffee.  I've tested brewing on all 3 settings on our Keurig, and prefer the medium and large cup settings in terms of coffee strength.<br /><br />Buying these on Amazon ends up cheaper than pretty much anywhere else (yes, even cheaper than Bed, Bath and Beyond with the coupons) and the frustration free packaging is great.  Open up the box with your bare hands (no wasteful shrink wrap to throw away or hard plastic that needs to be cut with a knife), and fold the box up for recycling when you're finished.<br /><br />This is my second time ordering this set from Amazon and it won't be my last.  And writing about it reminded me how good it is so I've just gone and made myself another cup!

review/summary: Hazelnut flavor perfect for even hesitant coffee drinkers
review/text: First of all, I'm not a big coffee drinker. I asked for a Keurig for Christmas because I'm a second year law student and I could use a cup of coffee (or 2, or 3) while studying, but I didn't want to drink the Maxwell House that my parents drink. I was enticed by the idea of flavored coffee. This Gloria Jean's Hazelnut does not disappoint. I brew the 8 or 9 oz cup and add 1 tablespoon of fat-free hazelnut creamer, and I'm good to go. It has a nice smell and flavor that makes me feel cozy. Some reviewers would say that this coffee is bitter. I would disagree. I'm gradually warming up to the taste of coffee (I think it must be an acquired taste) and I still shy away from anything with a dark roast or anything with a bitter taste.  If you are like me and are not a huge fan of coffee (unless it is flavored) try this. I'm currently debating purchasing a Gloria Jean's Flavored Coffee Variety Pack along with this giant box of delicious hazelnut.

review/text: Bought these k-cups on a Friday sale and used the subscribe & save option for an excellent deal on another 50 k-cups.  Haven't tried this flavor before, so it was a gamble since I was going to be stuck with 50 coffees if I didn't enjoy it.  Fortunately, the reviews were correct, this is a good, flavorful coffee.  A bit lighter than I was used too, but that enabled me to use less creamer (Chocolate Toffee) than I normally would need.<br /><br />Amazon shipped this package quickly, all were in great shape, and the k-cups don't expire until next March.

review/text: This is the best way to buy K-cups!!  It's so inexpensive...especially if you do the "Subscribe & Save".  I'm getting twice as many cups for like $2 more than I was paying in a store for 24 cups.<br />And Gloria Jeans coffee...need I say more...I have at least 2 or 3 ice coffees everyday!!

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: After reading over the reviews for several different coffee brands and flavors, I decided to go with Gloria Jeans Hazelnut and I am so pleased that I did. The price is far less then what I was paying at the stores. The flavor is excellent, the boxing and individual k-cups arrived in perfect condition,(I had read that some did not). I am going to set up for the automatic renewal. What more can I say, it works great for me. Thanks again amazon!!

review/summary: Not that great, wouldn't get again
review/text: I purchased this due to the great reviews which usually does me well.  However, compared to other flavored K-cups (i.e. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake), this lacks flavor & sweet notes and tastes burnt.  I would not order this coffee again, and will likely stay away from Gloria Jean's in general.

review/summary: Good Coffee but a little messy
review/text: I prefer light/flavored coffee, and these coffee cups hit the spot on cold winter mornings. This is the second time I've purchased coffee with frustration-free packaging, and I like the convenience, but there apparently had been a coffee cup that had broken apart during transport, so there was/is coffee all over the cups and the inside of the packaging, so it's been a little messy. The first time I ordered coffee in frustration-free packaging, no such problem occurred, so I think it's just a fluke. I wish more flavored coffee cups came packaged this way--I'd probably buy more if they did.

review/summary: Seems to be the most popular flavored coffee for my family and guests
review/text: I have given over 10 Keurig coffee makers as gifts (I have 6 children and a lot of friends) and I always send variety packs of K-cups with the brewer (beside the one that comes with it).  Of all of the flavored coffees the Hazelnut blends are overwhelming the favorite.  After some trail and error we settled on Gloria Jean's as having the best flavor and richness.  I would suggest making an 8 oz. cup or smaller, especially if you are adding cream to it.<br /><br />I really like Amazon's Frustration-Free packaging.  My favorite K-Cup (I added the product link to it below) also comes in this kind of box and I love it.  I just rip the top off and stick and whole thing in my cabinet. K-Cups produce enough trash as it is so it nice to have fewer boxes when ordering them from Amazon.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

review/text: The new frustration free packaging for k-cups is terrific! Thank you AMAZON.COM.  Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is one of our favorites for flavored coffee. Second only to their Butter Toffee. However, if you are wanting a bold wake-me-up, this is not going to please you. It's a pretty mild blend. When will someone make a really bold flavored coffee? Surely it is possible. I am a big fan of Emeril's Big Easy for my morning brew but later in the day or after dinner, Gloria Jean's Hazlenut is perfect.

review/text: I see that some reviewers also noted very weak coffee with these, yet some rave about it. I've only tried one box of the GJ's Hazelnut (won't be ordering more). We've bought other Gloria Jean's which are good, such as the Butter Toffee. So, it may be a quality control issue and you may or may not have good luck w/ Hazelnut. I cannot even detect Hazelnut flavor by taste nor a good hazelnut fragrance as this brews (unusual with flavored coffee k-cups). I've tried various sizes - even the small cup setting doesn't produce a flavorful coffee.

review/summary: Well, You Can't Beat the Price!
review/text: Gloria Jean's is the cheap-o brand for the Keurig machine, and it shows.  They've got the honesty to say (on their regular 24-pod box) "with the subtle taste of hazelnut."  Boy, IS it subtle!  Not only is the flavoring weak, but the coffee itself isn't strong at the lowest (6 oz) setting and forget the 8 oz level; you might just as well be reusing pods.<br /><br />When we first got the Keurig, we got it with a selection of Green Mountain coffees.  I thought these were first-class but kind of pricey - you can get Gloria Jean's around here for about $.36 a pod.  This saves a fair amount if you go through 6-8 pods a day, but for the difference in quality, I just don't think it's worth worrying about.  If you have to have your coffee fix so you can get out the door, keep a couple boxes of Gloria Jean's around in case you run out of the good stuff, but don't use it regularly, or you'll find yourself giving up on your Keurig machine!

review/summary: Am I drinking the same blend as the 5-star reviewers?
review/text: I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees.  We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees.  French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available.  I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack.  I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable.  So bitter and thick.  I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend.  It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed.  We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor.  The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another.  I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack.  But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on.

review/summary: subscription order
review/text: I have no issue with the product, which I actually love. However, for some reason, Amazon, or whoever is responsible for the shipping, decided to change the method for my last shipment. So, instead of receiving the product within 2 two days via UPS, they started using USPS snail mail, which took forever. I use the "subscription" service for a reason - so that I can count on the timely delivery of coffee and not run out. So, adding 5-6 days to the shipping time caused us to run out and have to make a trip to the store. Not cool. If delivery continues to be inconsistent, then there is no value to ordering this way, and I will go elsewhere.

review/summary: count them!!
review/text: NICE COFFEE, BUT....<br /><br />i like Gloria Jean coffee.  great flavor, not bitter at all.  some people think they are not strong enough, but i think they're perfect.  way better than the bitter stuff you get at starbucks!<br /><br />i ordered this through a promotion and combined it with a subscription and saved a ton of money (paid less than $15 for the box).  just got the package yesterday and i do like the packaging... but because it didn't look like the factory packaging that i usually get, i decided to count the number of k-cups.  THERE WERE ONLY 49!!<br /><br />i called and left a message with DIEDRICH (the name and number were on the box) but i haven't heard from them yet.<br /><br />if they shorted every customer 1 k-cup (yes, i know it's not much, but it's really the principle!), think of how much they'd be saving!  and just how many customers would actually go and count their k-cups before starting to use them?  i normally don't.<br /><br />anyway, i recommend the coffee, but i also recommend you counting them upon receipt.

review/summary: Something went TERRIBLY wrong!!!
review/text: I received this Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee this weekend; the same brand from the same location I've always gotten it (in fact, its a Subscribe and Save order).  I went to make coffee this morning and almost all the coffee grinds came out of the pod.  I thought it may have been a fluke so I tried 2 more times...both times with the same result.<br />To make sure it wasn't my Keurig I tried a different brand of coffee that I had at home and it worked fine, no coffee grinds at all.<br /><br />I don't know what happened, but this lot of GJ Hazelnut is NOT GOOD!!!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I have tried all the K-Cup coffee's and I always come back to this one, it sounds like a foo-foo drink but the aroma and taste make it a good cup of coffee anytime of day, and the price is right too.  I buy two fifty packs and that comes out to just a little over four cents for a twelve ounce cup of coffee.  Try that at Starbucks.

review/summary: Good Flavored Coffee
review/text: Good flavored coffee taste.  Not a bold taste which I prefer in flavored coffee.  My main coffee is Parisian Nights which is very bold and outstanding and rocks in the early am.  This hazelnut is a great mid-morning change.  If you don't like bold coffee all of the time and like favored coffee...give this a try!

review/summary: Great Aroma & Taste, One of My Favorite K-Cups
review/text: If you like other flavored k-cup coffees, you will probably like this one.  This is one of my favorite k-cups.  I think it is a perfect balance of a lightly flavored coffee and superb aroma.  It has a very pleasant hazlenut aroma when it brews (stronger than some other flavors) and tastes like a great coffee with a light hazelnut taste.  This seems more like a medium roast than a light roast if you compare to other flavored coffees and I feel like it has a very nice coffee taste above all else.  I like medium coffees, so I think this one is great.  It isn't like drinking a shot of hazlenut flavoring or like drinking a strong starbucks coffee.  It is just a harmonious light flavor to a good medium coffee.<br /><br />Like other flavored coffees, you should only brew this on the normal default coffee cup size (6oz) on the Keurig brewer or you will water it down if you use the mug size or larger.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Great Price
review/text: Uncle purchase K-Cup Keurig brewer for my office.  My staff and I love it.  No arguments about who is going to clean up the coffee at the end of the day.  Who is to blame for not turning it off and coffee burning at the bottom of the jug.  Plus we can have a selection of different coffees to suite the tastes for anyone.  We love it.  The Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is a very flavorful, but not a strong coffee.  I prefer the "Jet-Fuel" brand, but for the tamer coffee drinkers in the office they swear by it.

review/summary: A good cup of coffee
review/text: I bought this for my brother. He has one of those machines. I don't. But I was out of coffee so I took 6 of the K-Cups and opened them and used them to brew a pot of coffee. I'm not a flavored coffee fan either -- but I really liked the coffee. Full-bodied and mildly flavored. The feedback from my brother's household affirms my opinion.

review/summary: If this flavor is a let down.... TRADE IT
review/text: Most of the Gloria Jeans coffees I've tried do not meet my coffee expectations. Some of the foo foo flavors, like Mudslide, are okay, but still not exceptional. Luckily, I was able to trade my almost full box at the K-Cup Exchange on yahoo ([...]), and in return get a flavor I liked.<br /><br />I recommend this site VERY highly. You will learn a lot about brewing with your Keurig there, and it's free.

review/summary: Great tasting coffee
review/text: Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for my wife and me this is the best tasting hazelnut coffee that we have ordered. It has a nice aroma, distinctive hazelnut taste that is not too weak or too strong, and a very smooth taste (not bitter at all). This is a great coffee to start your day or to enjoy with some cake or pie for dessert.<br /><br />When I ordered the 50 count pack, I didn't realize that the K cups came loose in a big box. That is not a convenient way for me to store them, so next time I will probably order two 24 count boxes that I can stack up in my closet along with the other K cup flavors that I have.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon of $29.99 is about the same as on various internet sites, but as a Prime member I don't pay shipping (as you have to do on the internet sites unless you spend a certain amount that is much more than the cost of this product), so for me it is a good deal.

Amazon has set the level of customer service, and quickness to such a high level, extremely hard to beat. Nine out of ten times I always shop at Amazon not only are they quicker, but they also have everything for less expensive price. No shipping if you sign up for prime time once a year.Love them can you tell  !!!!As far as the coffee I preferred Green Mountain my choice, over Gloria Jeans Hazelnut.

review/summary: Keurig Hazelnut K-Cups
review/text: Following my recent divorce my ex-wife got custody of the Mr. Coffee machine.  It made no sense for me to get a coffee maker since I drink perhaps one cup of coffee a day at breakfast.  Then a friend introduced me to the Keurig coffee maker.  Very convenient for a single guy, it makes one cup at a time.  And it is very efficient.  The secret is the single serving "K-Cups" which are inserted into the machine.  They come in a huge variety of flavors and the Hazelnut is my personal favorite.  Amazon.com makes it very convenient to order large quantities in a single shipment and they are prompt and reliable in the shipping.  I enjoyed the entire experience of buying and drinking them.  By the way, I also got an assortment of coffee flavors as well as two different kinds of tea (Japanese Green and English Breakfast) and cocoa (which is my daughter's personal favorite).

review/text: My husband and I enjoy the hazelnut flavored coffee at home.  When I got my Keurig for the office I was afraid I would have to compromise or use the adapter and use my coffee from home.  Much to my surprise I discovered Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups and am totally happy now.  I drink other flavors and coffees but this one is by far my favorite.  The flavor is very mild, not overbearing at all.  Coffee at the office is perfect!
