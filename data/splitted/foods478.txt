review/text: I have had problems with arthritis for years now, and have been trying to loose weight. This cereal alone has helped me both loose weight and lessened the pain in my joints. I have not done much differently besides eating this cereal for breakfast. It has been an absolute god-send. Thankyou Kashi

review/text: I was attracted to this cereal because of high fiber and protine content. I ate this cereals everyday for two weeks and noticed a significant difference in my health. I am hooked onto this cereals, especially because of great test and high fiber content. This is a much better option than trying to eat green stock vegetables or worse metamucil. :)

review/text: Tastes great, makes you feel better, and its actually good for you. If you're used to the more sugary cereals, it may take a little getting used to. It's sweetened a bit but not as crazy as some of the other ones out there. I make my cereal a little different everytime with a combination of strawberries, blueberries, raisins, walnuts, and bananas.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: Great cereal!
review/text: This makes a great cereal - so I have thought. With almond milk, fruit, and a protein this makes a well balanced meal, and is great for an on the run breakfast. Has a nice crunch and stays with you through the morning. Has good fiber and protein. With the recent Kashi controversy regarding how their soy is processed, I am not sure how long I will continue to use this. I have recently returned to my flax cereal on some days. Arrives as expected - fresh and well packed.

review/text: We have been eating Kashi for years and really like it.  The coolest thing about buying it through Amazon is that I can have a subscription!  Imagine, every month (or more depending on your requested interval) you get a note from Amazon asking if it is ok to send this months installment, and for a lower price that I can generally find it in the stores.  At the rate we eat cereal this is a most amazing thing. Thanks Amazon.

I also eat it dry and buy it in individual cups when I am in a big city/train station/airport and need a healthy treat.<br /><br />If you are a dry cereal lover then trust KASHI! It is truly the most consistently delicious brand I've every bought. Very happy and loyal customer!

review/summary: Healthy And Filling, If A Little Rabbit-Food-y
review/text: I share an apartment with two other college-aged guys.  Kashi is really expensive in the grocery stores nearby, so we get monthly subscribe-and-save deliveries of the following:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E05G">Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E074">Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E08S">Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal, Honey Almond Flax, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317EA46">Kashi GOLEAN Crisp! Toasted Berry Crumble, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E060">Kashi Heart To Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal, 12.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />We save quite a bit of money this way, and we always have a stock available.  I eat it for breakfast every morning and often for a snack as well - it really is tasty and filling, has lots of healthy protein and fiber, and doesn't leave you feeling sugar-shocked like kid's cereals overloaded with high fructose corn syrup and cane sugar.  I rotate between the five cereals listed above to keep things interesting.<br /><br />Kashi's generic GOLEAN is at my upper limit for granola-y rabbit-food-ness - some days I'm totally up for it while other days I'd rather have something else.  It has very little sweetness to speak of, so it's great for adding a bit of dried or fresh fruit and/or honey to, or eating with soymilk (which is often sweetened with cane sugar and has the same amount of sugar as milk, but tastes sweeter than cow's milk because the sugar is sucrose instead of lactose).  Kids used to Chocolate-Frosted Sugar Bombs probably won't be into it, so you might want to buy a single box at the store before going in on a six-pack on Amazon.

review/summary: As much protein as an egg...
review/text: I LOVE this cereal!  I don't eat much meat, so this is a good way for me to get a significant amount of protein in one meal.  However, the box says "As much protein as an egg."  At 13g of protein per cup of cereal, shouldn't it say "As much protein as 2 eggs," or "More protein than an egg?"  I am wondering if it has something to do with complete proteins, which mostly come from animal sources. I am also wondering if I should be relying so heavily on this product to meet my protein needs.

review/summary: Easiest way to get high fiber cereal
review/text: I'm working to boost the fiber in my diet and I've tried every "high fiber" cereal on the market. Most of it is barely edible -- and some simply isn't.<br /><br />Kashi's GoLean (and GoLean Crunch) are my favorites. It's sweet, but not overly so. It's got serious crunch and holds up well to milk. It's a satisfying breakfast (and I take the crunch version in a zip lock baggie to have easy to access high-fiber munchies on the road.) And, ten grams of fiber per serving (8 on the crunch version) is not bad, not bad at all!<br /><br />Even my highly-resistant-to-health-food-of-any-kind boyfriend likes the crunch version!

review/summary: Didn't think it would taste this good!
review/text: I eat high fiber cereals because they are good for me. But, can't say that I really enjoy how they taste. No, they are not horrible, but I'd much rather have a bowl of a sugary "kids" cereal rather than something such as Raisin Bran (or anything else that has the word "bran" in the name).<br /><br />Heard a lot of mostly positive things about Kashi, so took advantage of the recent sale on Amazon to give it a shot. Really pleased with this cereal! It actually tastes good!<br /><br />I eat it mainly as a snack rather than as a breakfast cereal. Great dessert replacement when mixed with some dried or fresh fruits. Very crunchy and tasty, with just a hint of sweetness. A cups worth really fills you up, and provides far better nutrition than a typical snack food (although, I have to confess that once in a while I skip the fruits and mix in M&M's. Not so good for nutrition, but tasty!!)<br /><br />The crunchiness is appreciated when I eat it as a snack, but not all that great when eaten as cereal - just a bit too loud for that early in the morning.<br /><br />Highly recommend!

review/text: I have been eating nothing but Kashi Golean for breakfast for the past 4 or 5 years (OK, with the occasional splurge at IHOP or similar). Its nutritional values are perfect: high fiber, high protein, will keep you going for a long time. I add some Splenda and cinnamon for sweetness, skim milk, and some dried fruit (cranberries, etc). I love the taste, and I love the calorie count. For people who love cereals, but can't afford the ridiculous amount of added sugar in most commercial cereals, Kashi is the best.

review/summary: Filling and lightly sweet
review/text: I avoided this cereal for what seemed like years.  It looked like bird food and I imagined the taste would be the same.  When I started losing weight 2 years ago I finally caved and was pleasantly surprised.  It has a great mix of crunchy textures and is lightly sweet.<br /><br />Best of all it is low in calories while keeping me full and satisifed.  A cup is only 140 calories and yet gives you 10 grams of fiber and 13 grams of protein.  Being an abid label reader I've come to appreciate how rare that is and although I've tried many other healthy cereals it's hard to find a nuritional profile that matches this one.  If I eat something else in place of this I can tell the difference because the fiber and protein of this cereal keep me fuller longer than anything I have tried.<br /><br />I think the one criticism of this cereal could be that the flavor is mild so I often combat this by paring it with lite flavored soy milk, berries, or other toppings.  Or, if I am feeling in the mood for a more flavorful or sugary cereal like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5RZE">Nature's Path Organic Optimum Banana Almond 11-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> I will usually mix my bowl of 1/2 and 1/2 to get the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Overall though this is a fantastic cereal.  It is filling, crunch, and much more flavorful and sweet than one might think.

review/summary: High fiber and high protein
review/text: This is one of the better dry cold cereals on the market.  They list a one cup serving as having 13 grams of protein and 10 grams of fiber.  Six grams of sugar give it a slightly sweet taste.  It has 480 mg of potassium and only 85 mg of sodium, along with 20 percent of the RDA of phosphorus.  It has only limited vitamins, but I take a one-a-day supplement separately.  It is listed as having 140 calories per one cup serving, mainly from protein.  It will get somewhat soggy if you leave it setting in milk too long, but that is a feature of many dry cereals.  It can be eaten as a dry snack, something that is not always true of dry cereals.  Adding fresh fruit is optional.<br /><br />One reviewer commented on the price.  It does pay to shop around, but that is true with any product.

review/summary: Try it this way!
review/text: This is how I eat my kashi - in order to incorporate more coconut oil and more cinammon in my diet for my blood sugar and weight loss, etc. I melt 8 TBSPs of coconut oil in a big metal mixing bowl (1T per serving) and dump in the kashi and stir and stir till it seems to have absorbed the oil. Then I add cinammon to taste (at least 1-2 tsps) stir some more and then pour it in a pan and toast it at 350 for 10 minutes - the resulting cereal is absolutely fabulous and I like to mix it with my sugar free activia as well as milk.<br /><br />It's super! and for weight loss use it as a meal replacement and you'll drop weight like a stone.<br /><br />However, do not order this cereal from Amazon, as I post this they want over $4 per box. It's regularly $2.78 at my local Wal-mart.

The same thing happened along the sides, now I have 6 boxes of Kashi with half of the box ripped and destroyed, including the nutrition facts on the side.

review/summary: Eat it at your own dental risk
review/text: Go Lean cereal is hard and milk does not soften it much but it does taste great. One morning I poured a bowl, bit down and felt a shock of pain.  I ignored it and my jaw swelled.  The dentist said I cracked a back tooth and had to pull it.  At the time, I was a 25 year active duty military member who up until that point no dental problems outside a few cavities during any of my annual exams.  The dentist explained that teeth are like people with different shapes and sizes and that some back teeth are flatter than others and these are more susceptible to breaking especially as the teeth age.  Go Lean, while delicious, is hard and I gave it up to avoid any more dental issues.

review/summary: Worst Tasting Cereal Ever
review/text: I have no complains about the nutritional benefits of Kashi Go Lean cereal. It's got the lowest fat content of any brand cereal on the market. It only has 130 calories per 45g serving.<br /><br />However, it is the worst tasting cereal that I've ever had (and I've had quite few in my lifetime). Combine this with Skim Milk and it's akin to eating cardboard pieces soaked in water. It is absolutely revolting, with a weird chemical after-taste that refuses to go away. The least Kashi could have done is throw in some raisins or dried strawberry pieces in there. Sure, the fat content goes up a gram or two but at least, you won't feel like throwing up each time you take a mouthful.<br /><br />I tried it for three weeks (one serving every day) to see if it was an acquired taste but I will tell you, it was as revolting on Day 21 as it was on Day 1. I've since then switched to Special K Protien Plus. It's got 2 extra grams of fat (that's 30 calories per 45g for the calorie counters out there), but hey, you can eat it and not feel like throwing up. That, I guess is reason enough for me to switch. I can walk the extra 20 calories off by parking the car at the far end of the lot.

review/summary: Spendy..but good product
review/text: I went ahead and ordered this 24 bottle case since it's difficult at best to find a local supplier of the Mexican Cokes in my area.  Costco MAY carry them here, but I don't currently have a Costco card, and all other shops here only carry it sporadically.<br /><br />So, based on this my review ignores the cost.  Shipping was actually free for me, but I'm also an Amazon.com Prime member.<br /><br />This is the true Mexican coke, made from sugar, not High Frutose Corn Syrup.  The flavor is different, and better if nothing else simply due to that, although I do somewhat wonder if the formula is slightly different also.  I do remember that Canadian coke in the 90's tasted slightly different (and better) to me also when I'd travel up there, but at the time I didn't check labels to see if they were using sugar and not corn syrup.<br /><br />Packaging was fine, all the bottles came in intact and undamaged, the box was about the right size for the flat box of 24 cokes and also was padded well enough with packing paper.  I would have added a bit more padding, but things were done well enough too I feel.<br /><br />The add this seller placed does read a bit strange, but my take is he is saying all the cokes he sells are of consistant quality, not that every coke from every nation is good or the same.  Otherwise, all of HIS coke products are good and the same.<br /><br />Anyway, when I see this or Pepsi Throwback (which is also sugar based, not corn syrup based) locally I'll get that instead, but when my area is out of that, I'd consider this merchant again for sure.

review/summary: Awesome to cook with or to eat
review/text: This mango pickle is an excellent burst of flavor for your flavourful dishes.  A little goes a long way.  It's also great to eat as is if you like pickles.  I have used this for years in stews and curries and never thought to eat it until I was convinced to try it and now it probably gets eaten as much as a tasty, tangy snack as it does in cooking.  It is superior to any other mango relish or pickle I've ever had.  Like all the other Patak's products it adds great taste to a meal.<br /><br />One of my favorites is as a primary seasoning for ground beef with or without caramelized onions, green onions, garlic and whatever vegetables you have on hand (usually green or red sweet peppers and tomatoes).  Anything from a half teaspoon to a pound of meat (minimum amount) increasing to taste.  Experiment.  Don't overcook lean ground beef.  Use Adobo or Badia complete seasoning to taste.  note: Badia does have MSG.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Badia-Complete-Seasoning-Sazon-Completa/dp/B001O4GMDU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1344360665&sr=8-2&keywords=badia<br /><br />my favorite Adobo is by La Flor.  Goya makes several varieties available on Amazon... I remember being underwhelmed by Goya Adobo. It's not bad, La Flor's versions are just better (and cheaper).  Try your local international or Latin Grocery. See it at La Flor's own site.<br /><br />Hint: start defrosted, seasoned ground beef in a skillet with low heat and no oil is necessary.  If you use oil, olive oil is tastiest.  Caramelize onions, green onions and Garlic separately first in olive oil.  You may also precook the vegetables if you like them well cooked or if you like your meat lightly cooked.  Add vegetables and onion mix to seared meat.  Cook to preferred 'done-ness'.

review/summary: Yummy & Safe
review/text: I have tried a number of other dog treats that assist with keeping a dog's teeth healthy but have been very concerned about the safety.  At some point my dog would begin to choke on the treat because it would get caught in his throat.  Then I found Checkups at Costco (a company that sells great products) and thought I would give them a try.  The Checkups dental treats are awesome.  They give his teeth a workout but are not hard to the point of having sharp edges and my dog loves them.  For his size it is recommended to give him the whole treat but they are scored so they can be broken in half and he is satisfied with half.  I went on line and found Amazon sells them and am on my second bag now!  Great product!!

The Checkups are really excellent for helping to keep the dogs' teeth clean and better yet, the dogs -- two shelties, 8 yrs and 2 years old -- love them. They each get 1/2 a checkup bone before bedtime. The treats are also wheat-free and very digestible -- eliminating two issues that have caused serious problems for dogs in the past. Even better, during our dogs' last two annual health/dental checkups -- the vet did NOT recommend we bring the dogs in for teeth cleaning. In fact, their teeth were given the "look pretty good" comment.

review/summary: Better than a $550 cleaning
review/text: Alright so about 3 months ago I asked my vet how much a dog teeth cleaning would cost me.  Because the dog would have to be put under anesthesia, she said total would be about $350.  Pretty steep but I thought I should give my dog a cleaning since he was in need of one.  Last month I called in to make the dental appt. and was surprised to hear their prices have gone up to $550....c'mon people, I love my dog a lot but in today's economy $550 is a lot of money, certainly almost more than a car payment.  I stumbled on these Checkups at my local Costco and have been using them for a week.  I am AMAZED at how well these work!!!  In just a week I have noticed a real drastic reduction in plaque buildup and in the bad breath.  I highly recommend these, my dog loves em so much, it's his special treat and at the same time it's helping his teeth and the bad breath issue.  Can't beat that, and the Costco price is awesome!  Try these.

review/text: These are the best dog treats ever. The dogs seem to like them and they really, really, really work. We have two Labs (a black and a yellow). The yellow is nine years old and has about the worst breath of all time. You know like when he breathes in your general direction, it causes a physical reaction. Well after about four treats (one per day), you could see err smell a significant improvement. It was amazing. They are a good chew for my guys as well (taking about 2 minutes to get through), as opposed to some other treats which go to fast or Greenies which are way too expensive. I highly reccomend. I just wish more people carried them locally.

My dog loves them, and best of all, after about two months there is hardly any plaque on her teeth.  I truly believe these treats saved me from the risk and expense of having my dog under anesthesia.  Plus, these treats are wheat gluten free so they don't aggravate my dog's allergies.

He generally needs his teeth cleaned by the vet every 12-15 months due to tartar buildup, even though I brush them.  He absolutely LOVES these treats!  He gets a half of one (they are very easy to divide) after dinner and he sits by the cabinet and waits for it.  The treats are not completely hard, but slightly rubbery, so they clean the teeth as the dog chews them.  His teeth look great and his breath smells cleaner.  The treats are not scented, and are made of mostly potato flour.  I HIGHLY recommend!!

I have been giving her two Checkups a day for the last 5 days and I am amazed at how good these dental bones work. These bones have completely removed the tartar on most of her teeth, and continues to remove the remaining tartar with each bone eaten. I tried brushing her teeth for a month and could not get remove the buildup of tartar!<br /><br />In addition to removing tartar buildup, her bad breath that used to drive our family crazy has also cleared up! We were also very happy with the fact that these did not upset our dogs stomach. Our dog has a very sensitive stomach and most food and treats will cause her to vomit and develop diarrhea, but these treats caused no problems at all. If your dog has tartar build up or bad breath, give these treats a shot.

review/summary: My dog chooses these!
review/text: We used to alternate between Milk Bones and Checkups but it wasn't long before our Rottweiler/Lab mix was refusing the Milk Bone and waiting for us to get the Check Ups out!  She LOVES them!  They're a little more expensive than most treats but if they're doing something positive for her teeth at the same time, it's well worth the few cents extra!

review/summary: No more gulping or gagging on dental treats
review/text: I've become hesitant about giving my American Bulldog dental chews because she tends to gulp them in two bites. My vet recommended the C.E.T Oral Hygiene Chews, but my dog doesn't chew them properly and ends up gagging and regurgitating them. Based on the good reviews here, I decided to try the Checkups and so far they are working great! My dog is eager to get the treat, but she chews it more slowly. I haven't used that many yet, but I can tell her breath is better and it looks like her teeth are improving, and it doesn't upset her sensitive stomach.

review/summary: Checkups Dental Dog Treats
review/text: A truly outstanding product! My dog loves his Checkups and his daily enjoyment has resulted in several hundred dollars savings when my vet says, "His teeth look great, his gums looks great: no cleaning necessary!" My dog loves them so much, he never lets me forget a day.  He stands and stares at the cupboard where they are kept each afternoon letting me know he's not yet had his Dental Treat. :-)  Absolutely love this product!

review/summary: Costco has stopped carrying Checkups
review/text: These are great, our dog has never had to have her teeth cleaned in the nearly 6 years she's been with us. Every monthly trip to Costco, I pick up two packages, and she wants them every time I head towards the garage (where we keep them).<br /><br />Unfortunately, they weren't there on our last trip to Costco. Apparently the only Costco that will still carry them is in Anchorage.<br /><br />Please please please if you're a Costco member, and your dog likes Checkups, add it to their suggestion box -- at the store, and online (memberservices at costco dot com).

review/summary: I like these, but WOW!  The price here!
review/text: My dogs love these dental chews, and they actually take up to a minute to eat one, which is much better than most affordable dental chews.  I'm poking around the net for another place to buy Checkups because my Costco is an unreliable source.  But about that affordability.  I have been paying about $14 per bag at Costco.  A 50% higher price at amazon makes them that much less competitive.

review/summary: Golden Retriever has very white teeth!
review/text: I have been using this product for more than a year now. It keeps my 22 month old Golden retriever's teeth very white and clean.  I see no tartar buildup and bad breath what so ever.  Another plus is that it is wheat free. I occasionally invite the neighbors dog over for play dates. One day I took a look at their dog's teeth who is 8 months younger than my dog and he already has tartar buildup on most of his teeth. I give her one bone a day every morning after she delivers the morning paper to me.  To bad she doesn't know how to make me breakfast.<br /><br />My only disappointment is the price. They were once available at Costco's for $11.99 the markup here is unbelievable. Now you have to pay almost double for them here. It is my understanding that Costco is no longer going to carry this product anymore. I emailed the company but Amazon and Costco were the only companies getting them at the time. I think they have a great product but need to make it more widely available and maybe that would bring down the price.<br /><br />They also make Bright Bites (which are the same with flavor added to it) but I find the checkups a better value for your money. The checkups are much bigger than the large size Bright Bites and cost less when you compare the weight. If you have a small dog it is not that hard to break up the checkup bone. With all that said I will keep buying them here until I can find someone else who sells them cheaper.

review/summary: They forced me to put a star...
review/text: I have a 6 1/2 month old, 47lb, pit bull mix. He has absolutely no allergies, and no sensitivities. He basically eats everything without an issue, however, we found the one thing that does not agree with him, "CHECKUPS." I just bought the product from Costco last night, and gave him one bone while I was home so that I could see how he reacted to it and how long it lasted. At first I was happy to see that he spent some time chewing on it. We all went to bed, and all was fine, until 4:00 am, when we were awoken by Rocco throwing up his dinner. An hour later, he proceeded to throw up blood, a large amount of blood. Soon after, he threw up blood again. We rushed him to the vet, and the vet said that this product was way too hard for a puppy that young. We were surprised to hear this because the package stated that the product was designed for puppies 6 months or older, and Rocco was double the suggested weight limit. He said this product should not be given to dogs until they are more than a year old. The product, when chewed, became sharp shards, that tore up his digestive tract. I feel terrible for putting Rocco through this. It is not worth the risk.

My 6 year old lab mutt, however, would take these in her mouth and then set them down and ignore them. While I'm glad my pit bull loves these dental treats, the treats did not do a thing for his breath. It took a good ol' toothbrush and Petrodex dog toothpaste to get his breath under control.

review/summary: She Goes Nucking Futz For Checkups
review/text: My black lab Jade is 6 1/2 years old.  She's been having tartar lately, probably because her mouth was sore after having a molar extracted when it got cracked, and rawhide chews no longer interested her.  I bought Checkups at Costco for a good price, less than $12.  By the way, after not finding them recently, I was told they have been terminated.  None are left at any Costco in the Las Vegas area, so by all means place it in the suggestions box.<br /><br />Anyway, when I first brought one out of the bag, it didn't look like anything special.  The bag smelled like vitamins, and pretty strongly at that.  Jade followed me upstairs to our bedroom, knowing I had SOMETHING interesting I was hiding from her.  I tried to toss it to my wife, who was sitting on the bed.  Jade went nucking futz!  She jumped uninvited onto the bed, which she NEVER does, sniffed out the Checkup quickly, and ate it.  Since, she's repeated this behavior.  She absolutely loves them!  She's never acted like this over anything.<br /><br />After a few weeks of Checkups, Jade's teeth are white again.  Her breath is clean.  But now I'm out of Checkups and can't get them from Costco.  Amazon's price is much higher, and it has to be shipped.  I've requested the company send me dealer locations, so maybe all is not lost.

review/text: I buy the Checkups Dental Treats at Costco for around $20/bag of 24.  They are scored so I can break them in half.  This is the one treat that my dog will run to her crate for.  As soon as I even touch the bag, she's in her crate and won't come out.  She hates the crate, but has to be in there when I leave.  I've tried coaxing her out of the crate with one, but she's planted firm in there because that's the only place she's ever gotten one.  I wish they made them in bite size pieces, because I could really get some good training done with these.  I've never seen a dog love a treat so much.  She gets several different treats, but this one seems to be the bomb for her.

review/summary: My Dogs Literally Do Flips For These Treats:)
review/text: I first purchased these at Costco a couple years ago. Our dogs at the time, Chuy, String, & Belle, LOVED them!!!!! They would usually get a little upset if we were leaving the house. I gotta say that these treats made it easier for us to get away for atleast a little while. The only problem was that there just weren't enough in the bag!<br />I am a Veterinary Technician & I also own my own professional pet sitting business. So, of course, I would leave a little thank you card with a Check-up for each dog in my client's family. I found that I was spending more & more time at Costco. I was going to Costco atleast twice a week:( Worse, my client's were always asking where they could purchase the Check-ups. Most of the time when I would tell the client that I had purchased the Check-Ups at Costco, the client or clients did not have a Costco card. This meant that I would usually offer,or my client would ask if I would mind picking up some Check-Ups for their dogs. Next thing you know, I would be walking out of Costco with a HUGE box full of 20 or more packages of Check-Ups!!!<br />Thank God for friends! Especially when I evidently can't think of such simple things! My friend had gone with me for my "Check-Up run. She asked why I had not googled Check-Ups. Said that she had found many items like Check-Ups on Amazon. After she said that, all I could think was why hadn't I checked on Amazon??????????<br />As soon as I had delivered the Check-ups to my clients, I went straight home to get on the computer. There it was on Amazon!!!!! Thank goodness! No more trips to Costco! Plus, a much lower price!!!<br />Now, about the product!! It is Great! String needed a dental. Unfortunately, she had a tumor on her heart which eventually would be her demise. The Check-Ups helped to remove some of the tartar from her teeth! Same for Chuy! So, the Check-Ups work. I have yet to find a dog that refuses a Check-Up. I see many dogs in a day.  I recommend Check-Ups to the clients at the Veterinary Clinic & to my pet sitting clients! I would not recommend any product that I won't or don't use for my/our dogs! That in itself should be a great statement for Check-Ups!

review/summary: A new combination buy suggestion.
review/text: My 35 lbs. terrier has been devoted to Checkups Dental Dog Treats for several years but he is nuts for the combination of 1/2 a Checkup stuffed into a medium-sized Kong ribbed Stuff-a-Ball. After about two years, he is on his fourth Kong, having worn and weakened the others after many hours of torturing it. Pushing it all the way into the new Kong might take hand strength and determination on your part. Getting it out requires crushing doggie jaw pressure, a series of well-thought out strategies like slamming down the Kong while perched on a footstool, or carrying it up a flight of steps and bouncing it down to the lower level, then checking each step for crumbles that may have dislodged on the trip down. All the time he is working on extracting the dental bone, he is cleaning his teeth on the Kong - I don't think the vet will ever have to have to anesthetize him and clean them again. My boy brings me the Kong right after he finishes his supper each night and cries like a girl until I stuff it with a Checkup and the fun can begin.

review/summary: Awesome Product, Wish I Could Buy It In Stores
review/text: I don't know what is in these things, all I know is that our dog can't stop eating them. If her teeth didn't look so good since she I started giving her them (and if they weren't so easily digestible), I'd feel bad that I enabled a Checkups addiction in our dog. She's a forty-pound mutt, and I give her one-half of a Checkup after breakfast and dinner... if I wait too long to give her the treat, she starts whining and moaning until I pull one out of the container on the kitchen counter. Then she runs to her bed and waits not-so-patiently for it... yeah, she's a weird one. :-)<br /><br />Like many other reviewers, I used to buy these at Costco for about half the price, but had been unable to find them at either of our local stores. I contacted both Diamond Pet Foods and Costco about it. Diamond said that Costco rotates the availability of many of is products, discontinuing items for a couple of months then bringing them back. They suggested I let Costco know that we liked product and wanted to see it on a permanent basis, but in the mean time that I could buy them from Amazon. Costco said the item had been discontinued, making no mention of it being a rotating product, but that they would pass my message on to their buyers. If you want to see these back on the shelves in Costco, send them an e-mail or drop in a note in the suggestion box at your local store about it. The more customers they hear from, the better the chance they will bring them back.<br /><br />Diamond also suggested another one of their products, Bright Bites, which are similar to Checkups. They come in three flavors -- peppermint, wintergreen, and cinnamon -- and are available in retail stores (you can find a list on their web site) and Amazon. I don't know if our dog would dig the flavors, or if switching to them would be any less expensive than continuing to buy Checkups from Amazon, but maybe I'll try them out some time.

review/summary: Nice treat.  Cleaning teeth?  Not so much.
review/text: I appreciate the ingredient list in these Checkups, with no wheat, gluten, or corn, no added sugar.  We have 2 shetland sheepdogs, and one of my shelties has epilepsy and it seems gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers so we avoid those ingredients.<br /><br />Zoey (28 lbs) & Bailey (21 lbs) would each get one Checkup once or twice a week, and didn't have any problems with throwing these up or getting runny poo.  But they would eat them by breaking off a piece with their molars (which was easy for them to do), then work the piece around in their mouth to soften and chew it, and swallow.  Gone in less than 10 minutes, even for Zoey who is a "lady-like" eater and thoroughly chews everything, never gulping.  The problem spot on my shelties' teeth is their canine teeth, they get plaque buildup near the gumline.  These Checkups don't do a thing for front teeth because my dogs only use their molars to (briefly) chew them.<br /><br />My vet recommended instead to get raw (not cooked!) beef knuckle bones or marrow bones, because the shape and size of those encourage the dog to use their front teeth to get in there and pull and pluck at the meat and marrow, in addition to using their molars to scrape off meat.  The raw bones don't splinter and are soft enough that they won't crack my dogs' teeth.  (FYI: After trying both knuckle and marrow bones, my shelties get more chewing with knuckle bones and they each get to chew on the knuckle bone for an hour every other day on a mat in the garage... chewing makes them happy and tired, and my vet is very happy with their teeth.)  My vet said for teeth cleaning we need scraping action, and these Checkups don't provide it, nor do any of those "dental rawhides" you see in stores.<br /><br />These Checkups are a nice little quick treat for my small/medium size shelties, but not for teeth cleaning.  5 stars for the good ingredient list, but 1-star for teeth cleaning action... average of 3 stars.  Perhaps if you have a tiny little dog and the idea of raw knuckle bones grosses you out, these Checkups might be a good option, but I won't buy these again as they're just not what I need.<br /><br />Checkups Ingredients (from the Checkups website):<br />Potato flour, rice flour, glycerine, water, natural flavor, gelatin, canola oil, titanium dioxide, monoglycerides of edible fatty acids, flaxseed oil, citric acid, magnesium stearate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate

review/summary: They WORK ... dog LOVES them!
review/text: Best treat I've found!  Not only does doggie love them, but they DO keep the teeth clean.  I have a 70 lb female German Shepherd.  I decided to start giving these to her as a 'bedtime' treat (as an incentive to get her to enjoy going to the crate at night).  I've been using them for about a year now, and at the last vet checkup the doctor said she was surprised at how great her teeth look ... and asked me if I brush them.  Nope!  Just one of these every night.  And it's hilarious because no matter where we are in the house, all I have to say is "time for bed" and she sprints and literally RUNS to her crate and gets into it long before I can get there with the 'bone', and when I do finally catch up with her at the crate, she is sitting there smiling patiently, and drooling.  Literally!  It's so funny, everyone in the family laughs about how much she loves her 'bedtime bone'.  And I echo what other reviewers have said ... the Amazon price is a little high.  You can get them at Costco for quite a bit less, but I'm not a member and it's also a 30-minute drive for me.  So I order from Amazon out of convenience.

review/summary: These are awsome!
review/text: We have been giving 1/2 of a bone (they are scored in the middle) each to our puggle (pug/beagle) and Min. Schnauzer each night for a few years.  I was looking for a dental treat that is just the right mix of gummy/hard/chewy to really clean those teeth- this is it!  True, there is a lighter stool when it passes- but it seems to help with regularity.  We give these at night as part of the to-bed routine.  Just like kids, if they have a usual routine, they tend to fall into habit...helpful with puppies that think playtime is anytime.  I know they love the treats because they will often go into the bedroom and wait an hour or so before the usual routine begins.  I think its rare to find a good, healthy product that my dogs love, too: we are avid fans.  Costco has the better price, hands-down.  When our local Costco didn't have new shipments (and no information on when/if they would come back), I did an extensive (!!!!) search online and made calls thinking, surely I can find these for less or a comparable price somewhere: nope, not even direct from the manufacturer (that is without adding shipping costs).  I saw where one person said that another Costco had them, so I called every single one near me- turns out one had one bin-full...I bought TEN BAGS!  We recently finished those off and are still purchasing these wonderful treats from Costco.

review/summary: Choking Hazard
review/text: Although my dogs loved these they are very easy to choke on. I have two pomeranians and broke one of these in half I noticed how thick they were and watched both of them carefully as they were eating them. They each ate their share half way and then they could fit the bones fully in their mouths where they could easily get stuck. I thought I could break them down in really tiny pieces so they could at least enjoy the rest of them but, it was impossible to do and I ended up throwing them away. Of course they would last a lot longer if you gave each one the entire bone but,they are still somewhat too big for my dogs and you would still end up throwing part away.<br /><br />I was going to give the product one star but, if it wasnt for the choking hazard I think these would be great treats.

review/summary: Keeps dental cleanings down!
review/text: My dog needed frequent dental cleanings, despite the fact that I brush his teeth daily, just because he has "one of those  mouths." Since I have been giving him checkups, the need for those cleanings has decreased dramatically! My dog had periodontal disease and needed extractions. His teeth have been kept sparkling clean with both the checkups and brushing. On his last dental exam, his Xrays showed no evidence of periodontal progression since his previous visit (which is a big change from the past).<br /><br />Likes:<br />Dramatically decreased the need for dental procedures<br />Keeps breath fresh<br />Dog LOVES them<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />Used to be able to find them in stores for cheaper<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I love checkups, of all the dental chew brands I have tried, these work the best for my dog.

review/summary: My Dog will not go without one
review/text: My dog loves these so much, he actually waits by the drawer in the kitchen every morning until I give him one.  I ran out one day, and tried to give him another treat, but he would not take it.  So I had to run out and get more.  He just expects one every morning now.  I was telling a friend about them one evening and he heard me say 'checkup chew' and he went to the drawer so now  he even knows them by name.

review/summary: My dog loves them!
review/text: My bulldog is only 8 months old and so he doesn't have much problems with build up on his teeth yet but we wanted to take preventative measures early. I usually break them in half and give him one before bedtime. He waits by my night stand until he gets one. He usually swallows his treats whole so I love that he has to work at these for a minute.<br /><br />These treats are a great alternative to some other dental treats that cost considerably more. My dog will eat almost anything and but won't touch dentastix.

review/summary: work well on bad dog breath!
review/text: My dog LOVES these bones. He's small (11 lbs) so I break them in half along the scored middle section. They've worked well in combination with the water additive that also helps keep plaque at bay. The horrendous dog breath has calmed down a bit and his teeth are noticeably whiter. Will certainly buy another package when we run out. Recommended!

review/summary: My dog goes absolutely crazy over these
review/text: My dog is 12 years old and you can't tell when I have one in my hand!  He is jumping up and down, walking on the back of my feet and totally excited.  It does not matter if he has had half a treat everyday for the last 48 days he behaves the same way. The treats also work as his breath is much better after he has been eating them.

review/summary: Dog treats
review/text: My dogs loves these treats.  I have tried to get them at a local store again but no place close to me seems to carry them.  I tried to locate information about them on line to see if they were okay to give to dogs and it seems okay.  I'm no expert though on all that is okay for them, but he seems to like them.

review/summary: Great treat, and good cleaning
review/text: My dog loves these treats. He is a 40 lb husky mix and they clean his teeth pretty well. We only give him 1/2 of one each day. Sometimes we don't give him these for a few days and we notice more plaque on his teeth. He likes to hide them around the house, and eat them when he gets hungry.

review/summary: My Dog can't live without Checkups
review/text: Our dog lives for Checkups Dental Dog Treats! He begs for them at specific times of the day or earlier when he can get away with it. They do a great job of cleaning his teeth. They are also like catnip for dogs. Our dog has dietary restrictions and the protein content is low enough that he can digest them. Great Product!

review/summary: Great dog treats!
review/text: I ordered these hoping to help my Bernese with her breath and teeth. I think they are helping and would order them again. Plus, she absolutely loves them. It is great to see her so excited and happy to get a "cookie" a day. I am going to continue to give her these for a few months to see if there's any reduction in the plaque on her teeth.

review/summary: My dogs love these
review/text: My dogs love these, they scarf them down like they are treats. It seems to help with tartar and breath but I give them a number of these kinds of treats so not sure how much this product works. I break them in half because they have a marking in them that looks like it would be easy, but it's not easy to do and ends up hurting your hands. Either get someone else to do that, try a serrated knife, or just give your dogs the entire thing.
