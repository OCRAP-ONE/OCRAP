review/summary: THE BEST!
review/text: I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.

review/summary: A Tasty and Healthy Cherry-Dark Chocolate Snack Bar
review/text: A nutritionist recommended Kashi products and bars to me. When you want a little bit of chocolate, these don't quite replace a Snickers Candy Bar or Chocolate Chip Cookie, but they come close enough for me. They're a non-guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is good for you, say health experts. These also pack 5g protein and 4g(15%) of fiber. Only 8g of sugar (a Snickers candy bar has 28.8 g of sugar by comparison or more than 3X the sugar than these Kashi bars--nutritionists say your body burns sugar BEFORE fat as it's easier to burn so your body will keep the fat). These have 120 calories per bar vs. 280 cal in a Snickers candy bar. I like to take these chewy bars in the car when I'm running errands and need something to tide me over, or they're a tasty after-meal treat.<br /><br />A confession: I grabbed this box by accident at the grocery store thinking I was buying this Kashi bar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DHNIBG">Kashi TLC Chewy Granola Bar, Dark Mocha Almond, 6-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> which have been my favorite. I generally like my dark chocolate straight-up and not mixed with fruit. However, as an alternative, the cherry taste is refreshing although I think the dark chocolate taste, which I love, is stronger in the other bar with the almonds. Some family members will probably prefer this one. So, it's great to have two healthy treats in the house that are better nutrition than a candy bar or cookie.<br /><br />If you like the taste of cherry with chocolate, you may want to try these bars. I have lost 30 pounds and reversed diabetes eating healthy, low-sugar foods over the past few years.

review/summary: Suprisingly good.
review/text: Walden Farms salad dressings are a hit and miss.  Some of them are a bit off, and some of them are really good, so I decided to try 'Asian' and was delighted.  Wasn't sure what I was expecting, but the taste is very much like soy sauce with a slightly thicker consistency.  I love to pour it over chicken or fish and then pop it in the oven.  The only downsides have nothing to do with the quality/taste.  1, Sodium.  This is to be expected with most salad dressings.  If you eat it in moderation it shouldn't be an issue, but since it's zero calorie, some people think it's ok to pile it on.  This isn't the case.  2, Price.  The price tag might turn off the average consumer, but for me it's a trade off for the taste that I love and the zero calories/zero sugar advantages.<br /><br />If you're curious, and just want to try it out, I say go for it.  If you're a dieter and are looking for a serious way to cut calories, I say DEFINITELY try it out.

review/summary: Really Good If You Make A Few Adjustments
review/text: I won't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label, what they take out, they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet, a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing doesn't even begin to cover my salad the way I'd like. I'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that's just too much fat for one meal. It's almost the RDA for an entire day so that's not really feasible for me.<br /><br />What to do??<br /><br />I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket. I think it tastes "okay" right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds, it does leave something to be desired. To make it into something I look forward to eating, I do the following:<br /><br />Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it, 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water. Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me. I don't feel at all deprived and I'm getting fewer calories (there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing) and it's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that's cover the salad. I don't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite. I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco, chef, asian greens, etc.<br /><br />Sometimes I'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3's however, be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you're watching calories then take that into consideration.<br /><br />The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency. I like it best on salads.

review/text: As a general rule, in my opinion, if you stay away from the creamy-type dressings, you should be ok. For example, I love the balsamic one and the honey dijon is pretty good, but ranch and bleu cheese are just inedible; I would rather just eat my salad plain.  I'm on a very low cal and almost zero carb diet, so these (especially the balsamic) have been a life saver.  I'm going to try the cocktail sauce next.

review/text: These salad dressings are a great alternative to other popular fat free dressings.  I hate those sprays that are on the market now because there isn't enough dressing for a serving for pete's sake.  I like Thousand Island Waldens Dressing the best -- made a salad with veggie steak strips, spinach, black olives and mushrooms and this dressing was perfect! I've tried Ranch, Balsamic, Caesar and Blue Cheese.  The bleu cheese is bland, but the rest I've tried have been tasty and very satisfying.  I'm glad that I don't have to waste a 60-80 calories on dressing for my salads.

review/summary: Terrible: Walden Farms Ranch Dressing
review/text: This review is specifically on the Ranch dressing, it may not apply to other flavors.  I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the zero calorie description.  I don't know what people who eat zero calorie dressing are used to, but I was expecting a tasty gluten free Ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as Ranch(or dressing for that matter).  I can't believe there are reviewers saying this stuff has flavor.  Well, it does but the flavor is something like what you might get if you took a dirty dish rag, dipped it in latex paint and wrung it out on your salad: This is vile and nasty stuff! Don't waste your money on this one.

It is the only dressing you can use when on the HCG diet. I use this on my spinach and salads ... and also on my chicken, as a marinade! It is awesome. Sure makes the hcg diet a lot more bearable. Walden Farms has a whole line of products so fellow HCGers should check them out.

review/summary: Diabetic's Dream
review/text: For type 2 diabetics trying to control blood sugar by diet alone or with minimal medication the Walden Farms brand is heaven sent.  I have been using their dressings for several years.  Not all of their dressings are as good, in my opinion, as the Thousand Island but all will help control blood sugars.  What I like about the Thousand Island particularly is the creamy texture of the dressing and the taste.  You can use it on salads, burger melts or in a low carb rueben wrap. (I use the Santa Fe Tortilla 6 carb wrap)<br /><br />People who complain that Walden Farms products don't taste the same as 'normal' dressings have a valid point and it shows how much we have come to equate 'good taste' with sugar.  One way to check out your favorite dressing or catsup is to look at the ingredients and see how high sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn sugar, is on the list. It is no surprise that sugar is often up there near the top and often listed multiple times. Some dressings produced by major brands, however, have only two carbs per serving.  For many people, myself included, this is a tossup.  In some cases taste and cost may swing toward buying the major brand.  For more selections check at the Walden Farms website and don't forget to check at your local grocery or health food store to compare prices on this brand.<br /><br />Clearly, if you are looking to control your families intake of carbs, the Walden Farms brand is a good choice.  If you know of other brands with zero carbs that taste as good or better please add your comments to this review.  There is nothing I like better than hearing about something that tastes great with zero or low carbs.  Your comments may assist myself and others who are living with diabetes and want to live a better and longer life.

review/text: Got this dressing and others from DAB Nutrition last year, price for shipping was $6.95 total for up to 16 or 17 bottles - a great deal! Now the shipping is still the same for this flavor of dressing only. But if you try to order their other flavors you'll find that they are charging $6.95 PER BOTTLE. Quite a surprise when you see hundreds of dollars show up in your shopping cart. I spoke with Amazon and they told me to get in touch directly with the vendor because the vendor sets the pricing. I spoke with someone at the vendor who told me to get in touch with Amazon. Then she finally told me to email her manager, be brief, and explain the difficulty. I did this and got no response. Caveat emptor, buyer beware.

review/summary: Worth a try
review/text: As other reviewers have said elsewhere, these Walden Farms salad dressings, and other Walden Farms products, can be hit or miss. But everybody's taste is different, so I would say they are definitely worth a try. When they hit it's excellent, with no calories, fat, or carbs, and few if any artificial ingredients. When they miss... well, you move on.<br /><br />Pay close attention to the pricing on these items. They are all over the chart, ranging from reasonable to highway robbery. Some have shipping charges of $4.95 PER BOTTLE! It would seem to be a mistake, but they refused to acknowledge it and actually defended the charge. Others are over $8 per bottle w/free shipping; no bargain there either. Some, with shipping, are over $10 a bottle. It's not difficult to find much better deals on the web-try allstarhealth.com for starters, and there are probably even better ones out there.

But thanks to Amazon reviews, I decided enough people liked the salad dressings that I should give them a chance.<br /><br />I found this at my local Fred Meyer (Kroger family) for a few pennies over $5.  The FM stores in Boise have a little diet food section, and that's where I found it.  I bought the Bacon Ranch, and I must say it's pretty good.  I had a full bowl of salad with plenty of dressing (I like lots!) for just 20 calories.  Very cool!<br /><br />I wonder how this would taste on shiritaki (yam) noodles?  I think I'll try that tomorrow.

review/text: I love this dressing. I use it pretty much with everything. This year I decided to get serious about my weight (and lost 23 lbs by the way)and with some pokes from my friends I went to HCG diet (along with those friends). In my doc office I was introduced to Walden Farms products, although I've never heard of them before. Being an on and off dieter since I can remember, that would be shame on me. I am in love with their products now. Well, most of them. This Russian dressing is one of my favorites along with Chocolate dip. I use it with everything. Cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach. It goes well with everything. It tastes good, it's light and calorie free. And I might get addicted to low calorie eating after all. Dieting becomes fun when it tastes good.

review/summary: If you're serious about calories...
review/text: I've tasted the best of the "real things," and they were wonderful and dreadfully high in fat, carbs, and calories; that includes dressings, dips, and sauces.  Yes, I've added up what goes into a salad, and those oil and fat content calories soar!  If you expect a fat-free substitute for most anything to be a close equivalent, forget it; you'll have to do with eating the tiniest bits of food to lose weight.  If you expect a zero-calorie substitute to taste the same, ditto.  However, the key here is to find the best of the WF products for you.  I can't do the Peanut Spread (and I'm addicted to Peanut Butter), but most of the other products I can manage.  Some of the dressings are really good, especially the Balsamic.  Loving sweets, I keep handy an assortment of chocolate sauce and dip, caramel sauce, pancake syrup, and I've recently "discovered" the blueberry pancake syrup.  The trick is not to use too much because, yes, there is an aftertaste, but if you use the right amount, it's a darn good substitute.  AND...the calories...the carbs...the fat...don't add up!!

review/text: I would certainly compliment Walden Farms for their line of zero-calorie salad dressings.  It's really quite amazing how they can do this.<br /><br />The Thousand Island dressing is fair.  The major flavor that comes across is vinegar.  In small amounts, mixed into a salad, it does the trick.  It gives a kick to "boring" field greens.  In larger amounts, it's no better than tolerable, but you may feel good that you can have a huge greens salad and dressing for under 50 calories.  One thing is clear:  It does not taste much like full fat or low fat Thousand Island dressing.

review/text: I have to give it 1 star because they wont allow for any less... this ranch dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet, the chemical taste of the Splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself...I could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing, this is one of the five Walden's Calorie Free product I have tried and been VERY disappointed with... I was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with Splenda instead of Stevia but for God's sake why make it soo unpalatable?!  there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner?  My other reviews for these products may be around the same... but darn... I best just make my own dressing, might not be 100% calorie free but at least it will be consumable.  Why does RANCH need sugar?! WTF?  I have made ranch from scratch and never once did I add any sugar to it!  Also there is a dry chemical flavor that comes with this...  I am sooo lucky my healthfood store has a nice return policy because after tasting all these dressing products I could NOT use them and felt jipped because these aren't that cheap..

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: This is not bad, it's good on a salad, and decent as a veggie dip as well.  It's very tangy, and nice in it's own way but does not taste like a normal full fat ranch dressing.  It's on par with other low fat or light dressings I have tried, but with 0 calories.  I like to add a little cracked black pepper to mine.  I may buy this again, but I prefer their Caesar dressing.

review/summary: A Healthy Alternative, Depending on the Flavor
review/text: I've tried a number of different flavors and found the Bleu Cheese and Vinaigrette more suited to my taste.  Nothing I've tried of these dressings really tastes like normal salad dressing, but these make terrific alternatives if you're looking for a dressing that minimizes caloric intake.  The Vinaigrette also has made a good "dipping" dressing for bread, etc.  Just try a few and see which ones you like.

review/summary: No cal delicious
review/text: I am a serious weight control person.  I recently lost 25 lbs and I determined not to regain it.  The key is lots of salad and lots of veggies with adequate protein and eat frequently. I use Bacon Ranch and add some straight balsamic vinegar to my salads.  Delicious.  I use the vinaigrettes on vegetables and then roast or BBQ them.  If you hate these dressings, in my opinion you don't REALLY want weight loss or weight control.  Are the "regular" dressings better?  I don't know and I don't care.  I am a 66 year old female athlete and I love being trim.

review/summary: Try Coleslaw and French Dressings Instead!
review/text: I tried each salad dressings of walden farms and bleu cheese is one of the most unsavory ones that also ruins the taste of the salad. It tastes and smells like white glue. So I would suggest Coleslaw dressing which is great and can also be used for Caesar salad. French also tastes good for giving a spicy taste to the salad.

review/summary: From a HUGE fan of Walden Farms
review/text: We've been ordering these dressings directly from Walden Farms for many years and haven't yet had a flavor we didn't like.  Our favorites are the Caesar, the Bleu, and the Ranch, but we also regularly enjoy the Creamy Italian, Russian, and Thousand Island.  You can buy them directly from Walden Farms, up to 10 bottles in an order, for a flat shipping fee of $7.95. Make the salads as rich as you want with tasty ingredients -- we like avocadoes in ours, providing healthy monosaturated fat, or a dollop of virgin olive oil -- and save calories BIG TIME with these delicious dressings. Any of them will also make a wonderful dressing for cole slaw and broccoli slaw, although WF also has a very good Cole Slaw flavor.  And the kids love them as dips for fresh veggies.

review/summary: Great syrup for flavored water
review/text: I don't like drinking plain water, but I'm trying to cut back on sodas. I decided to try Torani syrups to flavor my water (1 oz per 20 oz cup, so less than half the calories of soda).<br />I've never had huckleberries before, so I wasn't sure what to expect (I purchased it based on good reviews on Amazon & other sites). I'm still not sure how to describe it. Although the Huckleberry syrup smelled like cough syrup when I first opened it (ugh), it has a nice flavor when mixed with water. It's kind of light, fruity and somewhat similar to blueberry.<br />For myself, I would give it 5 stars, but my 9 year old daughter (who's been sampling syrups with me) didn't like it at all. So I think maybe this flavor is more subjective than some of the others. If you're not sure about it, I'd say try it once at a local coffee shop before you buy a whole bottle.

review/summary: Best dog food for my dogs
review/text: Have you ever seen a dog out grazing in a field?  Me neither.  Have you looked at your dogs teeth?  They look made for tearing and gnashing.  Does your dog delicately chew their food before swallowing?  Mine don't.<br /><br />This is the way a vet explained to me the EVO food line for dogs, which is made from meat, not grain.  Then when he told us that it was made for a dogs digestive track, unlike a man's; and that it was made to process meats and that because it was the meat and not grain that made their digestive tracks healthy and that when they eat how their digestion was designed, they would naturally have smaller, less frequent eliminations, with less stomach and bowel related gas & diarrhea, well, I was willing to give it a try.<br /><br />I mix the duck with the chicken/turkey small bites for my indoor pups.  They love it!  It's improved the bowel issues my 12+ year old yorkie was experiencing.  The fur and energy of my 3 year old Westie and my 2 year old Havanese doesn't need any nutritional supplementation while pregnant.<br /><br />My only disappointment isn't with the product.  I will never go back to any other product.  My disappointment is with the online shipping costs.  I don't begrudge the sellers/shipping companies making a little money, but geez! Shipping costs add almost a dollar a can to the price.  That seems too high for me, so I'll probably stick with buying it local.

review/summary: Not With Corn Gluten Meal in It - NO THANKS!
review/text: Crude Oil is natural, too, but I'm not going to feed it to my dog. Corn is bad for dogs and any vet will tell you that. At least whole corn is human-edible. Corn gluten meal's other use is as an herbicide (shudder). No thank you. Do the research, this also has 'animal fat', which has been listed as a very unhealthy ingredient as well. Purina can try dressing up this stuff as much as they like, it's still bad for dogs and it's filler.<br /><br />If you have enough money to buy yourself snack foods, if you're not eating ramen noodles for the last two weeks of every month and if you can drive through a fast-food joint, then feed your dog food that will extend his life.

review/text: The quality of these dates is fantastic, however they need to be chopped smaller and more uniformly. Most people probably used chopped dates for recipies, and I cannot imagine a recipe that would call for dates that are this coarsely chopped.

review/text: they are not sugar coated and very sweet like some of the other brands are. they do not seem to be as soft either.  i used to give them to my baby, but there are some hard pieces in here and they seem a little dry. i like to use them in trail mix or cereals, but they are not as good as the sweetened softer ones

review/summary: quality product but not great taste
review/text: I was disappointed in this tea, expecting more of a sweet spicy orange flavor but finding it to be just overall sour with very little spice shining through. I have tried it sweetened and unsweetened. I have steeped it for longer and shorter periods. It is palatable in all cases but never very good. I do find that if I steep it for a short period of time and add a little sweetener that helps reduce the sour taste, but then it is just rather bland.

review/summary: Amazing White Tea Adventure!
review/text: *****<br />I enjoy Numi's Moonlight Spice Orange Spice White Tea. It has a distinctive orangey taste and a light spicy taste (from the cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and ginger), sort of like a light, subtle, orangey chai tea. It is different and unique and all of the flavors are much more subtle than a chai-type tea, quite adventurous. It brews for a lengthier time (7-8 minutes) and is worth the wait.<br /><br />Moonlight Spice is kosher, certified organic and contains amazing ingredients: organic cinnamon, organic orange peel, organic cloves, fair trade certified organic Pai Mu Tan white tea, organic hibiscus, organic allspice, organic ginger, organic schizandra berries, organic lemongrass and dried lime. The schizandra berry is a major tonic herb in Chinese medicine used to assist the body in dealing with stress, to improve memory function, and to assist with many various physical issues.<br /><br />There are no oils or natural flavorings used, unlike many teas; it is also sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable, the carton is made of 100% post-consumer waste, and cello wrap is not used. Numi says that all their tea bags "are made of natural fiber paper, not the trendy, "silky" see-though nylon tea bags".<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Numi's Orange Spice White Tea is like no other. We use an abundance of all natural, organic ingredients for an authentic cup, without using oils or flavorings. This sublime tea ingeniously blends premium Organic White Pai Mu Tan tea with orange, citrus, and spice. Pai Mu Tan is exclusively the top two leaves and a bud of the tea plant and can only be picked the day before the buds unfurl. White tea is the least oxidized and processed of all teas, making it supremely healthy. Smooth and delicate, Moonlight Spice balances citrus notes of orange, schizandra, Numi's own Dry Desert Lime, and luxurious spice for the most divine experience. Transcend into a peaceful moment through its luminous hue and enchanting fragrance."<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but enjoy white tea, this will probably be one of the best you've ever had.<br />*****

review/text: I have been a fan of Bigelow's Constant Comment tea for decades. Out of the blue, my grocery store was out of it. I scrounged through my tea bags and found this orange spice tea by Numi. It probably had been in a gift basket. Well, it blew my socks off. This is the best tea I have EVER had. I can't stop drinking it. And it leaves a perfectly wonderful aftertaste in my mouth. I have can't wait to try Numi's chai tea and the Jasmine. I think the huge difference with the Constant Comment is the quality of the tea base: the Numi tea in this blend is a white tea. I think the base of CC is black tea. CC is bitter compared to the Numi.

review/summary: Delicious topping with Japanese flair!
review/text: I know, some of you may be thinking, GROSS! Fish shavings?? But if you like fish, and the flavors of Japanese food, then you'll love these Bonito Flakes. This brand's individual packages is very convenient and ensures that you always have the freshest serving.<br /><br />Bonito flakes are part of the base soup stock in miso soup, so you've probably had a taste of it without even knowing it. Don't think they are only good for stocks, however. The flakes themselves are a delicious addition to a block of cold tofu with some soy sauce, and also on a bowl of steamed rice, again with a little soy sauce. They are also great when mixed with fresh cucumber slices and soy sauce. If you're getting the drift, they are much more flavorful when a drizzle of soy sauce is added too.<br /><br />Bonito flakes, called "hanakatsuo" in Japanese, are a fabulous source of protein and are a quick and easy way to add a lot of taste to even a plain bowl of rice. I guess if you purchase some and don't agree with my review, you can follow the lead of one of the other reviewers and feed it to your cats...

review/text: I love bonito flakes. I'll tell you why - they taste like bacon to me. There is no religious reason for me NOT to eat bacon; however, these give you that smokey flavor of bacon without the fakey smoked tasted of turkey bacon or just that liquid smoke stuff. I love bacon, I love bonito flakes and have become addicted to dashi, the basic Japanese broth they use in almost everything.<br /> It's much more natural, it's delicious, it's not like anything else. I have yet to come across 'artificial bonito flakes' - that should tell you something.

review/summary: Liquid Gold
review/text: This olive oil is fantastic and I highly recommend using it as part of your regular diet! The taste is much better than the prior store bought brands I've tried in the past and the packaging is nice and slim for storage. As someone that is fairly health conscious, I've done some recent research on the importance of olive oil. Olive oil is considered in many parts of the world to be liquid gold and is commonly used as a main ingredient in the Mediterranean.  Olive oil contains cancer-fighting polyphenols, which actually give the oil its unique taste. One of the best types of olives to use are Koroneiki olives because they contain even more cancer-fighting polyphenols! I will definitely buy this product again.

This olive oil has a nice smooth taste that has no bitter after affects, and it's rich flavor is perfect on pastas, salads, breads, ets.  This olive oil has less acidity than most others (o.3), and it really does make a difference.  I wish I had easier access to this product in stores where I live, but unfortunately, I do not.

They came in a nicely packaged box, no seals were broken.  The jars are very nice but there is a sticky residue left on the plastic container after soaking of the label that I can't get off, so although I'd like  to reuse the jars, I probably won't because of the sticky residue.

I used it with some home-made meatballs over linguine, and it was marvelous.  (I make my own meatballs using ground turkey, spices, breadcrumbs, and egg, then bake them on a cookie sheet and freeze 'em in bags.)<br /><br />WOW!  It's packed with intense tomato flavor, with just a hint of garlic.  I think I've tried 'em all, and this was so much better than any others (including some VERY expensive gourmet varieties).  Nothing detracts from the tomato flavor.  I find a lot of jarred marinara sauces to be too sweet, and that is definitely not the case here.  You get that slight acidic "bite" from the tomatoes, and that subtle garlic flavor.  Heaven!<br /><br />I liked this so much I just set it up on a "subscribe and save" purchase.  I'm planning to use it for lasagne, baked ziti, even pizza sauce.  It's that good.

review/text: I wasn't blown away, but I did enjoy the sauce very much.  4.2 stars from me.  High marks on the plastic vessel, and lower marks on value.  At $5.75 I'd make it my weekly Marinara.

review/text: I have tried all the sauces at the store..ragu, paul newman, barille etc etc etc. They were just ok...was looking for something great! So i decided to try this..all natural ingriedients...so very good. Will be buying more...finally I found a great sauce to put over spaghetti and ravioli!! Very very happy with this purchase. Loved the sturdy containers...re-usable!! Try it..you wont go back to the grocery store, I promise!!
