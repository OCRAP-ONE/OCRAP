review/summary: Great packaging idea, too bitter on the finish
review/text: The concept for packaging this coffee was great.  Simply putting the coffees in a ziploc bag preserved their freshness and the idea that I was putting less plastic in our local landfill was great as I live in a little village on the Yukon River.<br /><br />However, I found this roast to have a very bitter aftertaste.  I generally enjoy a full, dark roast and I like the bitterness of coffee.  That's the whole point.  But I was really unhappy with the finish in this particular French Roast and won't purchase it again.  I am slowly working my way through the 80 count I bought, on days when I have a taste for added creamer flavors.  This isn't a comment on any of the other San Fransisco Bay products, as I haven't tried them, just this particular roast.

review/summary: Great strong coffee, Waste-avoiding K-cups!
review/text: I love the fact that this delicious, strong K-cup ready coffee comes with an exposed filter.  I'd been trying to cut the bottoms off of the K-cups I had been using, in order to recycle them. (good intentions, but not realistic!) The fact that they don't even have the bottom portion of the "regular" K-cups while still maintaining excellent, rich flavor makes me a convert.<br /><br />This flavor, French Roast, is bold, strong and just what I'm looking for as a morning coffee, and holds up very well as iced coffee as well.<br /><br />I'll be buying many more of these!

review/text: I tried these alternative k-cups for the first time and thought they were pretty good. I don't think I'll be buying the traditional k-cups again. The French Roast were nice and dark roasted.<br /><br />My 80-pack came with 10 bags of 8 pods. When I opened a bag I put the ones I wasn't going to use right then in a ziplock bag. Not much hassle to save 50% on the cost of k-cups.

review/summary: Give it a chance
review/text: After reading the reviews we jumped in with both feet and ordered this and the Fog Chaser. Here's my take on the French Roast after drinking all 36 cups:<br />* I prefer this to the Fog Chaser, but I like a darker roast.<br />* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.<br />* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.<br />* The taste is bold, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like really dark roasts but most people don't.<br />* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.<br />So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine.

review/summary: Great tasting, less waste
review/text: I did not buy these from Amazon, but apparently will in the future.  I was in my local membership-required-big-box store (am I allowed to say Costco?) when I saw this stuff for about 27 cents per serving.  Since it's very easy to return stuff there, I bought it.  As others have commented, it's unusual looking, in that just the familiar looking K-Cup ring and foil at the top are there.  The plastic cup around the bottom is missing.  But that doesn't matter and it actually creates less waste and probably costs less to manufacture.<br /><br />Off course, being green doesn't matter if the coffee tastes bad.  In this case, it does not.  It's got to be one of the two best French Roast K-Cups I have ever had.  Full of flavor, without being bitter or burnt.  I went back to the store a few days later and they had sold out and they are not sure of plans to get more, so it looks like I will continue to buy my coffee from Amazon, but instead of my usuall brand (Green Mountain French Roast), I will be buying these.

review/summary: Our new "go to" coffee
review/text: This has become our daily coffee. We were previously Starbucks (brewed at home) coffee drinkers, although I will say these are not quite as strong as Starbucks brewed coffee...not weak either though. I usually buy them at our local wholesale warehouse, where the price is a little better, but I come to Amazon when I am needing it fast and don't have time to go to the store. It makes a good cup of coffee, that I happily serve to guests. The only down side is that the individual packaging does not allow for display. Not a big deal.

review/text: We purchase on Subscribe and Save, 3 boxes a month.  I like the little filters instead of the pods. The price is great. My husband thinks the coffee is stronger than our previous French Roast.  However I really like the robust flavor and, at this price, he just adds a little more cream.  If this had resealable bag I would give four stars. We had to buy a large airtight jar.

review/summary: Better than average K-Cup
review/text: I'm generally a fan of dark roast coffees, and this is one of the better K-Cups of that variety.  Perhaps not as strong as Emeril's but better than the Starbucks French Roast K-Cups.  (None of the K-Cups I've found are as tasty as a well-made Aeropress cup, but the ease-of-use, cleanup, and ability to change varieties for each person more than make up the difference.)<br /><br />The form factor doesn't seem to have any significant disadvantage for my.  This box contains 3 12-count sealed plastic bags (each with one of those one-way air valves).  I've kept the "open" dozen in a Gladware tub.  All's well.

review/summary: Good Price and Good  Coffee
review/text: Always in the market for a cheaper k-cup (and living in San Francisco) I was happy to have stumbled upon the  San Francisco Bay brand. I was worried about the weird shape at first but it still works in the brewer. I like that the packaging is trimmed down so I don't feel as guilty about the environental impact of overpackaging  (told you I live in SF!)  The French Roast is very bold and at first I was unsure...I think I like  it just fine but plan to try another roast next time. It also tastes a bit more acidic than other brands but that isn't such a bad thing either. I think I am getting used to it. My problem is that I switch from several different brands all the time so I may y always notice that difference. I recommend this and plan to order this many more times!  I would give it another half star if i could!

review/text: I enjoy a good cup of coffee, when I found these little gems I was hesitant like other people. We were all brain washed thinking we had to use the wasteful K-cups. As they continued to raise the price of coffee up and up and up I was trying different ways to utilize my Keurig coffee maker, purchased refill cups etc you know how that works. Well this is by far the best way to enjoy a good cup of coffee, the way the cups are packaged does not bother me at all, I don't let it sit around to get stale , I drink it. If you notice the bags are vacuum sealed and a zip lock bag would not work people. If it is not broken don,t fix it, and this is not broken so just keep these prices affordable, and keep the quality of the coffee just the way it is.

review/text: I was surprised when I got these from Amazon because like the other reviewers said, the cups do not look like traditional K-Cups, because the bottom of the cup is a filter - not plastic like the traditional ones. But don't let this bother you - they worked just fine.<br /><br />The coffee was better than most - strong flavor. One of the better stronger brews.<br /><br />The only issue I see is that after you open the package, you must use the cups quickly or they will get stale. Some people like the K-Cups because they don't use that much coffee and so it is always fresh. But if you are like me and drink a lot of coffee, I don't see how you can go wrong with this coffee.

review/summary: A great alternative to K-Cups
review/text: Yup not a K-Cup. If you don't like the non-plastic cup, then don't buy them.<br /><br />For our family, we like the taste, and the price. We've tried both this French Roast and the Fogchaser, and enjoy them both. We have not had any issues with grounds in the coffee. We keep them in a zip-lock bag after opening the 12 pack bag, so we have not had issues with them tasting stale (we drink them in about 2-weeks). I'm guessing that these cost less since they don't have to pay a royalty to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters for using the K-Cup name and design.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive alternative to the K-Cup, these are a great choice!

review/summary: Not a traditional K-Cup, maybe even better?
review/text: I bought these in an attempt to get some Kcups at a reasonable price that were NOT instant coffee. While I'm not picky about coffee, I'm not going to waste my  time with instant-coffee Kcups no matter how cheap they are. Using Subscribe&Save, these are half price compared to what I pay at Costco for my husband's favorite Kcup: Starbucks Cafe Vienna. They do not have the white plastic "cup," instead the part under the foil top is coffee-filter material in a curved-bottom shape. So only the foil top is pierced when the machine brews. I like to think this means less waste! They are packaged in thick sealed plastic bags in groups of 12. Aroma is extremely fresh, taste is great, just as strong/rich in my opinion as the Starbucks ones. Wish they came in more flavors and larger quantities!

review/text: This coffee had all the rich flavor that I expect from a dark roast and minimal bitterness.  I suspect most folks are checking these reviews to find out if these weird cups actually work in a Keurig machine.  They do.  I had no issues.  The unexpected benefit was the great coffee aroma.  I love the Keurig system, but I miss the smell of coffee before it is prepared.  The aroma is back with these as soon as you open the plastic bag that they come in.  As much as I enjoyed the aroma, I felt compelled to store these things in another air-tight container, lest they lose their freshness. I also decided that I could not keep these cups in the rotary K-cup holder that we keep next to our machine.<br /><br />Despite storage issues, I would get these again for their flavor, aroma, and price.

review/summary: Everything we want!
review/text: Function: these cupless k-cups work perfectly in our Keurig B130 (the business version of the small personal brewer) which makes only a small cup.<br /><br />Less waste: We were really disappointed when we discovered that the plastic k-cups aren't recyclable. These are a terrific low-guilt, more responsible alternative.<br /><br />Less storage space: they take up much less room to store. I buy k-cups in quantity to save money, but then I had to dedicate a large cabinet to storing them! Not so with these, partially because they're less bulky and partially because...<br /><br />Great Price: these k-cups are much less expensive than other brands, especially at the Subscribe & Save price. At this price, I can buy less at a time and still pay less per cup than I could finagle with coupons & sales & bargain-shopping the major brands.<br /><br />Taste: Amazing!  I love a good dark French roast, and these are the best I've ever had.  Dark & rich but not bitter.  In fact, this morning I forgot to pour the creamer before I took a sip and I was amazed that it tasted really great.  I've tried to go without creamer before - I'd like to get used to coffee without it - but could never stand to...until I did it by mistake this morning and it was so smooth I drank the whole cup that way.  Trust me, this speaks volumes.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm keeping my subscription, and I just increased the frequency of my deliveries because we found we drink these more than the regular k-cups. How can you beat cheap, tasty, less bulky, and less waste?

review/summary: Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig
review/text: As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!

review/summary: Very good coffee, packaging needs a bit of work
review/text: This coffee is very good, it has a nice aroma and a good strong flavor.<br /><br />I also like the "minimalist" k-cup design, but have a couple complaints with it.  Since the individual pods aren't sealed, you have to keep them in a sealed package to prevent spoilage.  It would have been nice if the plastic bag they came in was re-sealable.<br />Also, since the coffee doesn't just come out of a small hole in the bottom of the pod, the first cup you make with these will wash all the stray grounds out of your machine and into your cup.  Be forewarned that you should wash the pod holder before using these.<br /><br />Overall I like the product, just be careful about the different pod shape.

review/summary: A new type of K-cup
review/text: I have been purchasing San Francisco Bay Whole Bean French Roast for years, for the money it has been a very consistent good cup of coffee. I bought a K-Cup brewer to please my guests. K-cup brewing really provides something for everyone without throwing pots of coffee down the sink.<br /><br />But I must admit that I didn't fall in love with all the K-Cup selections out in the market no matter what the price, brand or blend. They were generally hitting a 6 to 8 on a scale of 10. I tried the San Francisco French Roast last week and I really loved it. For me, it is the best out there in the K-cup world.

review/summary: Unusual packaging but full flavor
review/text: Though the lower than usual price caught my attention, I was concerned that this coffee, marketed for Keurig, was not packed in the common cups.  Rather, the coffee is in small bags.  Not to worry! They fit as well as the usual cups do. I was so pleased with my first order, I have ordered several more...and given some as gifts to other Keurig fans.

review/summary: Wow...I can't believe the quality
review/text: At first I wasn't sure but I figured, at the price i'd give it a try.<br />I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and quality of this coffee.<br />The K-Cup design is somewhat different and you will need to store<br />the coffee in a zip lock bag after opening the bag containing the<br />coffee. Other than that, it's quality coffee at a very nice price.<br />We are talking $0.41 each rather than $0.50+ each.<br />You can't beat it!<br />I'm now buying the 80 count and enjoying it even more as<br />the price is now $0.35 each.<br />Try it...you'll like it!

review/summary: Decent coffe Great Price
review/text: I ordered this to see how it compared to the Fog Chaser. It is a good French Roast coffee and is comparable to the Tully's that came with my machine. French Roasts are good for K-cups because you stronger flavor out of one, however, for overall flavor this is not as good as the Fog Chaser.<br /><br />Price is excellent and the packaging is great as it has a much lower waste profile. It's also much easier to compost the grinds with these.

review/text: Where I live in Florida white Melitta filters are not available in stores. If you use a fine grind then the brown filters become clogged very quickly. Purchasing Melitta white filters in quantity is cheap and you can stop kicking yourself for dreading the next time you want to brew a cup of coffee! The brown filters are the equivalent of watching paint dry :)

review/summary: My favorite snack chip!
review/text: Extremely flavorful and crunchy, Hot Fries have been my favorite snack food for a long time.  Unfortunately, it's not carried by every grocery market, so I appreciate that Amazon carries them.  These are baked and not fried like a lot of popular chips, which makes it a slightly healthier snack choice.<br /><br />Usually, a bag of this size is a dollar from a local shop.  So you do pay a small premium, but I can't argue with the convenience of having a dozen dropped off at my door.

review/text: I have been a huge fan of Andy Capp hot fries for over 10 years now.  Unfortunately, for the past year now, they have really sucked.  Either they are so greasy it makes you sick or the fries are so hard it feels like your eating Corn Nuts.  Horrible, just horrible.  Not only here in Ohio or on Amazon either, it's everywhere.  I prize those random bags that are made correctly...I find them so rarely now; each new batch Andy makes is uniquely horrible.

review/text: These Hot Fries are a little hotter than I would like, but for those of you who like their snacks spicy then you will like these for sure. The bags are big and full, you certainly get your dollar's worth with Andy Cap Hot Fries.<br /><br />My only real complaint is the amount of preservatives in this product. Lots of MSG.  If you have issues with MSG you will want to avoid these.  The added MSG might be why these are so tasty and why it is so hard to put the bag down once you've had a few.

review/text: Not a very popular snack, probably due to the salt content.  My wife loves the stuff and they're not easy to get unless you're driving through the highway and stop at a truck stop or go to your local "hood".  I went ahead and ordered this product off Amazon.  Terribly addictive; I limited myself to one bag.  They're not spicy to me (because I love spicy foods).  I'm more of a healthy snacker, so I think I'll go back to my nuts and carrots.

Let the munching begin.<br /><br />It's been about 20 years or so since I've had these, but it seems the texture is lighter and fluffier now - similar to Cheetos Puffs. These are also incredibly salty, but they probably always have been.<br /><br />Because the texture is too airy for me, I'm dropping my rating down to 3 (3.5, if I could) stars.

review/text: I used to pick these up from the corner store as a kid and share them with my friends. These things used to be HOT and GOOD! Last time I brought a bag was about 10-15 years ago because I hardly find them anywhere but liquor stores and unfortunately I don't drink. These newer hot fries just aren't the same. They are extremely Salty! and only mildly hot. They also taste more like cheese doodles than anything else. No burn your mouth taste, no slender little fry shape, these just aren't the same. I made the mistake of buying 2 of these and sorry to say but these are too salty for human consumption. They should call them SALTY FRIES.

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/summary: Bitter lime taste
review/text: This has a strongly bitter taste of lime when made as directed.  Definitely not a natural made from scratch taste.  It made the worst tasting Margaritas that I've ever had.  My initial response is to just pour the rest of it down the drain and cut my losses.  I'm glad I only bought one bottle to try.

review/summary: Delicious coconut water
review/text: I received one complimentary can of this drink when signing up for a charity bike ride.<br /><br />11.8 fl oz (350 ml), 120 calories, 10 fat calories, 130 mg sodium, 22g sugars.<br /><br />Like others have described, the water has small pieces of tender coconut floating in it. The drink is delicious, refreshing, and "kind of" filling. Feels much better to drink this than soda.<br /><br />Ingredients: 80% coconut juice, water, sugar, coconut pulp, etc.<br /><br />What I don't understand is why would you add water and sugar to coconut water? One star off for that.<br /><br />I would buy this product, but would hesitate paying more than 75 cents per can. Your price tolerance may be higher, but you won't regret if you tried one can first.

review/summary: (Cheaper) Alternative to Designer Waters
review/text: Goya Coconut Water has been around in local US tropical food marts for decades.  A friend suggested coconut water to me ages ago for some issues I'd been having.  I started out with fancy expensive CW and one day on a whim I bought some of the Goya brand in a convenience store.  I wish I'd done so sooner!  If you love the benefits of coconut water but can't stand the taste or get your kids to drink it, this is a suitable alternative.  Lightly sweetened but not nearly at the same rate as sodas and other fruit juices with high fructose corn syrup.  It tastes great and don't be fooled, it has the same benefits as the designer $3 a bottle coconut waters being sold in health food stores.  I've been throwing my money away for years on other brands.  Don't buy this can.  With the shipping charges you may as well fly to Singapore and pick your own.<br /><br />Make sure you're drinking regular water with this or any other coconut water.  One of the things I noticed when drinking coconut water is that it has a diuretic effect.  Since I was a kid I've had this unusual water retention problem though, moreso than the average person, and coconut water makes me flush out fluids like crazy.  Despite the refreshing qualities of this water I've noticed there is a danger of becoming dehydrated.  The added water in this product is a nice bonus but it's not enough.  My guess is that the added water in this product is merely to allow Goya to offer coconut water to consumers at a lower price. It won't be enough to offset the effects of the juice so drink more water if you don't already.<br /><br />Goya has cubes of raw coconut floating around in this juice so you've got a good source of fiber there. The coconut pieces may pose a choking hazard for really small children and you can't drink it from a straw because of the chunks.  I took a star off for that.  Also the can isn't the most environmentally friendly packaging either.  Otherwise this stuff is the perfect refresher.

review/summary: Healthful it is not
review/text: Why would anyone want to add sugar to coconut water???<br />I mean, what's the point of spoiling it and making to it like all the sugary drinks out there.<br />Can the American palate not tolerate anything that is all natural that does not have added sweeteners?<br /><br />I bet you that no one from the Caribbean or other places that coconuts are indigenous to would appreciate the alteration of this delicious water. We who are used to it do understand that the natural sweetness levels in each coconut varies, so some may be sweeter than others, and we are quite ok with that because it is natural.<br />Please read ingredients people- not all coconut waters are created equal.

review/summary: More like Coconut Drink at Vietnamese Restaurant than Coconut Water
review/text: I have tried a variety of coconut water: Zico (old), Zico (new), O.N.E., Vita Coco and Naked.<br />I saw this at my grocery store for .99/can and had to try it.  I heeded the advice on the can to "shake well and serve chilled" and was pleasantly surprised to see coconut chunks as I poured it over ice in a glass.  This reminded me of a "coconut drink" I had at a Vietnamese restaurant in Philadelphia.  This is not like the other brands of coconut water, consisting of only coconut water with no added sugar.  The ingredients are: 80% Coconut water, water, sugar, young coconut pulp, and potassium something other (a preservative).  It has 120 calories per can compared with Goya's unsweetened version with 80 calories.  While the one with pulp has a little more sugar and fat; it also has more iron, calcium, and fiber and 50mg less sodium than the unsweetened version.  I will definitely buy this again - to drink on its own/with a meal though, not as a sports drink.  Also, it is far cheaper in store than on here! I would love to buy this in a case through Amazon's subscription program.

review/summary: Nice strong ginger flavor
review/text: Prince of Peace Ginger Honey Crystals<br /><br />Unfortunately I got these on the last day of a local tea shop -- and I say unfortunately because I became instantly enamored of the product.  A single packet produces a decidedly strong 10-12 oz cup, very nice and gingery, reminiscent of the hot ginger tea sometimes served on cold winter days at a Haitian restaurant I know.  The honey adds a nice complexity to the cup, but I'm also looking forward to adding a few cloves and cinnamon stick.  Many other uses for the crystals come to mind as well as simply dissolving in water -- I've been using it to sugar tea, both black and green, and I'll definitely try another reviewer's recommendation for strawberries or other fruit.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish the packet had somewhat less sugar (but with the same ginger and honey strength).  One packet, at 17 g, is getting a bit close to typical desert levels (I checked some sorbet in my frig, 23 g).<br /><br />That aside, I prefer this to the ginger tea I've been getting at a local Korean market, a kind of marmalade or jelly with ginger slices in a jar.  Not only does this product have a stronger, hotter ginger flavor, but it can be used in place of granulated sugar.

review/text: I discovered this product years ago at a local asian market.  This is a miracle cure for an upset stomach, car sickness, seasickness, etc...My husband uses it when his IBS acts up.  When I go on a cruise, I bring one dose a day and I do not need to get the behind the ear tabs that I had used before.<br /><br />Before I found this, I would have to go get the ginger root, peel, slice, and steep to get a good tea for my stomachache, but this is tons more convenient.  Besides, who wants to do all that work when you are sick.<br /><br />The flavor is very strong so I found that I like it a little more watered down than it recommends but 1 or 2 "doses" when I am feeling queasy and it is gone.

review/summary: Good but too much sugar
review/text: The first time I drank this tea I almost gagged. I'd prepared it according to the directions but it was too spicy. I then had the good sense to add more water and a chamomile tea sachet to break down the spicyness...and it was wonderful. I then discovered that eating the ginger crystals by themselves was quite pleasant as well. I know it sounds weird, but the crystals are tasty, probably because they're so sweet...which leads me to my next point. Although sugar TASTES good, im not a fan of consuming too much of it. It's 17 grams per packet, which I think is too high for a cup of tea. It makes my teeth feel all gritty afterwards (no bueno). If they made a sugar free version I'd be sold :)

review/text: If you're into hot, spicy gingery tastes, you'll like this drink. It's intense, also because of the honey. I find it delicious, and I know some people who dilute it (using half a package per cup) to make it milder. Either way, it's yummy and satisfying. Very soothing on a winter day, and also if you have a cold or are suffering from nausea or stomach upset. It's also versatile. I dissolve a package into plain oatmeal--what an easy way to add unique flavor. I like that it's instant, and also that I can take along the sachets to work or on a trip. Highly recommend this!

I love the flavor and I don't get acid kick-back anymore.  I drink the honey ginger tea hot for a sore throat. It is wonderful in apple juice or other fruit juices as it give a punch to the drink.<br /><br />I also make a drink from green veggies and some fruit. This ginger honey really livens it up and makes it delicious. When I make shortbread cookies, I sprinkle this ginger on top before baking. I won an award for the cookies at a Scottish festival.  I buy 3-4 of the large bags at a time. It doesn't last long around here.<br /><br />It is great to sip on the front porch with neighbors and can be served hot in the winter and iced in the hot summers.

review/summary: I was looking for Jamaican Ginger Beer
review/text: I found lots of spicy ginger beers at Amazon, but the best price in the lot was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB04N8">D & G, Soda Ginger Beer, 12-once (24 Pack)</a>; while $30 [$45 shipped] for 24 hard-to-find sodas isn't the worst pricing in the world,  it's still not going to be in my budget as an everyday beverage. This stuff is plenty affordable in the 30-count bag, and the flavor is exactly the spicy & sweet combination I remember from my youth in the South.<br /><br />It just arrived today, so I've not had the chance to try it with club soda in place of water, but I expect adding some fizziness will make this drink perfect! Look for an update to this review.<br />UPDATE: almost finished  with bag one, ordering more. Mixing the bag with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBRS12">Blue Sky Natural True Seltzer,  12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> does make a nice refreshing drink (I mix in a little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WX5J9I">Tang Orange Powdered Drink Mix (Makes 22 Quarts), 72-Ounce Canister</a> for a citrus-ginger soda), but it's not as close to the Jamaican Ginger beer that I remember as I'd hoped.<br /><br />However, if I add it to store-brand ginger ale, it IS the flavor clone I'd been looking for! Five stars!<br /><br />Further update: There are many recipes foe home-made ginger ale on the web, and the process looks very simple...I'll keep a stock of these packets anyway, but I think I'll try fashioning my own brew this weekend!

I haven't used it much since, unless I have an upset stomach, because I'm not a huge ginger fan.  But hey ... if you're suffering from morning sickness or suffer from nausea, this may work perfectly for you as well.

review/summary: Great Buy!
review/text: I was very happy with this product and this seller. I added the product to Hybiscus flower tea to replicate Jamaican Sorrel. It turned out great. The product was well packed and promptly shipped. The taste was what I wanted. I will buy from this seller again.

review/summary: Great for seasonal allergies and cramps
review/text: My colleague had me try this ginger crystal a month ago when I had cramps. After drinking it hot, my cramps went away during the rest of my cycle and did not need medication. Recently my allergies flared up bad and again it relieved some of my symptoms.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: As Ginger is good to settle a stomach and, when I eat a Larabar Ginger Snap or a few Ginger cookies, it seems to satisfy my hunger, I had great expectations! I tried this cold and hot. I got a BLAST of Ginger heat in the back of my throat (expected) but no residual Ginger after taste,just an odd taste from the sugar (we use very little sugar so maybe just me). I had hoped to satisfy hunger but it doesnt seem to do that at all & seemed to MAYBE upset my stomach a little. Packaging quality & content uniformity is very good & dissolved quickly. I will be throwing the rest away partly because it is made in China and I am nervous about food items from there.

review/summary: Too much sugar
review/text: I have been making ginger tea by grating fresh ginger, mixing it with honey and lemon and adding boiling water. The qualities and effects of ginger on the body are quite remarkable. My husband and I have been battling the flu for 10 days, and the ginger tea really helps. It was getting tiring doing that by hand, so I found this product and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts:<br />Pros:<br />It's quite tasty, although very sugary. For me, as I love the taste of ginger drinks (ginger beer, ginger ale) I like the combination of ginger with sweetness, although I would prefer it to be artificial sweetener. I found that I need more than 6 to 8 ounces of water due to the concentration in each of the packets.<br />It's very nice that each packet is individually sealed, which keeps it fresh for quite a while.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's very high in sugar. It's a peppery, sugary drink. I believe it will supply you with the necessary amounts of ginger to affect your health in a positive way. Here's the but though, because it's high in sugar, it's something that someone like I, who have higher than normal cholesterol would not want to consume too much off.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I liked the taste, but would prefer less sugar, or artificial sweetener. Perhaps sweetened with honey?

review/summary: Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets
review/text: A nice healthy cup a...ginger crystals?...Yep! This stuff is great! I found this when I came across it somewhere on clearance once and althoug it's very strong (I only use 1/2 packet per cup); depending on how strong you like ginger, you might use more :)  For winter or fall this is a wonderful thing to have around.  Remember how I said it's strong, well, I get 2 cups per packet (I like my tea very strong, but I like this the way I described). The value here-wow, you just can't go wrong.  And no, I am not getting any compensation here for saying all this, I just found a product I like and it's hard to find for such a great price. I can't do dairy either or much coffee, so haviing things like this just make life a little more fun.  Plus, it's so much better for you and chepaer than a drive-through drink :)
