review/summary: SHE LOVES THEM!!
review/text: We've got a rescue Greyhound & we've had her for going on 2 years. She, her name is CC, absolutely loves these things & has yet to get tired of them. We give her one a day @ different times of the day & she gets so excited when we are getting it out of the bag & then runs back to her bed with it sometime tossing it & playing fetch with her self, then she settles down to enjoy it. I truely think it's like a candy bar for her. As long as I can find these I will continue to keep them here for my girl.

review/summary: Really help my dogs' teeth
review/text: We've been using Checkups for three or four years with our two 80 lb. dogs. Originally, we found them at Costco. Our dogs became addicted to them at once! Sadly, our Costco discontinued them so  we order them by the case directly from the manufacturer. I'd happily buy them at a local store or on line, but find that prices are staggering for these kinds of products, especially for two large dogs like our husky and our shepard/akita mix.<br /><br />Our dogs get one each everyday and their teeth look spectacular. Our shepard mix really had trouble with her teeth and gums before we discovered these. The cost and stress of blood tests, chest x-ray, anethesia and a cleaning is just over the top - too hard on Mom and too hard on the dogs. I'd rather pay the big bucks for the Checkups and have less stress. We've tried other chewy products, and I'm sure some are also good. But for our large dogs, these deliver as promised and seem to be the best bang for the buck. I just wish retailers could bring the price down so more dogs could benefit from them.

review/text: I had not realized just how fond of Checkups my dogs were until Costco quit selling them. I could just barely stretch the dog care budget to cover the cost of them on line, but it was worth it seeing them do double back flips and helicopter imitations. The best news is last weekend I saw "Checkups" in Costco at the usual great price. Whooie!!!

review/text: I have a German Shepherd.  When she was about 8 months, we found these at Costco.  She was fully addicted.  I bought bag after bag.  I must have bought them out, beacuse I havent see them at Costco for about a year now, which is a bummer.  But having them on Amazon is great.  They are soft enough to break in half, if you want a smaller treat, and hard enough to clean the teeth.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Best Dog Treats Ever - No dental problems
review/text: I have been using checkups for about 3 years. First with my two large dogs ( 55 and 65lbs). We then got two Pomeranians, Snickerdoodle and Ewok Widdle (6 and 7.5lbs). I started giving them the treats. I'm not sure why it says they are for adult dogs over 20 lbs. I cut them into 20 bit size pieces (using a PVC cutter) and they get 2 or 3 of these a day. Their teeth are great, their gums are great, and they never have doggie breath. And they love them. (and 24 biscuits go a long way)

I was truly disappointed when I went to Costco last month and found out they'd discontinued them?? I looked all over town and finally found them online. I even went directly to the manufacturer, and get this... they said they would only sell them to me if I bought $150.00 worth??? That alone would of stopped me from buying them again.. but what can you do when your dogs love them.. and you LOVE your dogs!!

review/text: Our dog has massive allergies and this is the first treat we have found that does not only make him very happy but does not cause him any issues.  He is 12 years old, is going blind, has a sensitive stomach and bad arthritis so you can imagine how great it is to find a treat that he can not only enjoy but can causes no harm.  To us, the side benefit is his teeth are doing great.  Does not need cleanings and has no bad breath.  I highly recommend these for all dogs.

review/summary: Amazing, Magical, and Mysterious.
review/text: Like many, I checked out this product because of the whole gluten-free craze: I needed to lose a few around the mid-section. Confused from all the brands, reviews, and star ratings I just plunged in and chose this brand because my fond familiarity with their other products (though I will take issue with the packaging not being consistent: I was hoping to be amused with new age rhetoric or trite expletives crammed omnipresently on the jar). This product is amazing! It's everything people say it is and more. I now think it's the White Duct Tape of the grocery world. I read about all its uses and tested them my self out of deep skepticism and curiosity.  Internally and externally, Dr B's Coconut Oil is just short of miraculous. Did I mention rubbing it on your belly instantly produces wash-board abs? Try it.<br /><br />Internally, this oil makes everything tastes great like I thought only butter could do. Because it's better for you than butter, I now have switched teams with no guilt for doing so--though butter will always have a place in my heart (literally, HDLs a-gogo). The taste has just a hint of coconut which is enough to not overwhelm if you never liked that flavor. It makes boring veggies taste like manna from heaven. Though I'm a vegan, sometimes it's torture having loved the taste of well-prepared meats.  But when you rub this oil on a carrot, it tastes like southern fried chicken; when rubbed on potatoes, it tastes like mouth-watering Porter Steak, and when rubbed on lettuce it tastes like a Greek gyros that Zeus himself would find divine (though saying that might be hubris punishable by IBS so I take that back)!  Food simply tastes better with it and there should be a fine for people who sell vegetables without it.<br /><br />Externally, I tried this stuff to enhance the complexion of my skin, car, and cat.  (Next week, we'll work this miracle oil on the "B's": baby, boat, broadsword, briefcase, and bare bodkin). For my skin, it made my dull, totally-original-Jaguar-biting-into-my-skin tattoo come back to ultra-vivid life and bite me back--it literally drew blood, ouch! That kind of macho-ness with the mix of coconut and my own scent sent a pheromone hailstorm that turned every 18+ female in my trailer park into lust-seeking zombies.  Within seconds of catching this scent, a horde of women came at me with sex-frenzied fury, I could barely run away. Out of bestial competition, they fought each other on their way to the source of their lust (me, or my skin, couldn't tell, does it matter?), leaving a long trail of gorgeous scantily-clad, bruised, and forlorn women.  After the clouds parted, one warrior woman did make it to me from the pyre of trailer park pulchritude. So short of breath, she couldn't even speak when she was by my side: she just starting licking my skin, which was erotic and weird all at the same time, like listening to Prince's "Purple Rain" album for the first time. She too enjoyed the taste of Dr. B's sumptuous coconut concoction. At that point, I knew that I must get this product on Amazon's Auto-Subscribe service lest I suffer that ill fate of an empty jar in my cupboard. So many nights I've suffered in my misspent youth sitting at my desk, dreaming of a way to talk to women and the key to my salvation was in a jar. They should call this stuff Miraculous Whipp, because that's what it is! (Oh, that's sorta taken: sorry).<br /><br />It does not stop there, this oil is great for making some extra cash and other great uses. I took my Trans Am on blocks and added old tires to it. It made my tires and car dashboard shine like brand new, which I sold for a cool $1,500: rich city.  It took a dark stain out of my black shirt by making everything else a lot blacker and newer. Around the globe, a tone-deaf boy in Europe rubbed it on his ears and hands one day and within a month, he became the greatest guitarist you never heard of. I was told that in ancient times, people used this oil to make the square wheel spin faster and effortlessly.<br /><br />Coconut oil is also used in post-divorce litigation procedures to bring people back together in love, saving the world billions of dollars in lawyer fees and asset allocations. There are even rumors of it solving missing person cases the world over if it's rubbed on a detective's badge. Its power should not be underestimated. In medicine, it's been known to cure the common cold after using it for 10 days: who knows what else it might cure in times to come. Cancer? Tennis elbow? Hiccups?  Oh, the joys of this oil! Do not hesitate to buy this product, even if all said here has been hyperbolic. Great mysteries and miracles will unfold upon you if you do! But because of the powers, do use this coconut oil wisely and for good, not evil. Namaste.

review/text: After going through the entire SodaStream sample pack, my wife and I picked out a few flavors that we wanted, and ordered them from Amazon.  Being a huge fan of orange soda, I picked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZFOEEK">Sodastream Diet Orange Sodamix Syrup</a> (as I'm on a big diet soda kick).<br /><br />The flavor closely resembles actual Orange Crush, or maybe even Orange Fanta.  I can't really comment on the "burniness" of this soda, as you control the carbonation, so it's only as carbonated as you want to make it!<br /><br />I really like the SodaStream diet syrups, because they're sweetened with Splenda�, which makes them a little bit more healthy than regular, name brand diet sodas.  It also doesn't give them that aspartame taste, which makes a lot of diet sodas taste disgusting.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this SodaStream syrup, as well as the whole SodaStream system!

review/text: While Eight O'Clock Coffee is not my very favorite in the world, for the price it is very hard to beat. It tastes like one of the more expensive brands, but costs a good deal less. I will say this much: it's a lot better than Starbucks, and although their flavor variety is a little limited, the flavors they have are good, and the coffee is good, too.

review/summary: Tasty Snack, Poor Packaging...
review/text: When I first opened the box, I thought I had been sent an expired pack..the chocolate had a foggy, powdery look to it, like it was old. These cookies are in a plastic container in two rows...just like how Oreo's are packed, one right next to another. I don't know if these were at one time stored in warm place, but each cookie was melted to the next, which means when you try and separate them, they completely fall apart.<br /><br />Aside from the horrendous packaging, these are very tasty...that is, if you can get a whole one. The graham cracker bottom crumbled on most of the cookies I tried to pick up, and the marshmallow top would stick to the cookies above it. If they can find a better way to package these, they would absolutely be something I would purchase in a grocery store. They're small (which was a nice surprise, I expected them to be twice as large) and chewy and great for a quick chocolate fix. A shame they're packaged so poorly.

review/text: Okay, I have to admit to it -- I ate the entire box!  They truly are that delicious...  :-)<br /><br />Mallomars are a soft, vanilla wafer that has a marshmallow layer on top, which is then covered over with scrumptious chocolate!  Much to my surprise, these cookies are actually quite low in calories (60 calories each, with no trans fats), which is one thing I was a bit worried about originally, before I got my first taste!  ;-)<br /><br />The cookies were fresh, which is one thing that I appreciated.  I know that some earlier reviewers mentioned that they had experienced some issues with this, but mine were great!  One suggestion is to freeze the cookies, as it makes the outer chocolate layer crunchy and the marshmallows delightfully chewy, if that is something that you enjoy.<br /><br />One word summary -- BUY!

review/summary: Excellent Cookie. Shipping & storage concerns.
review/text: This is an excellent seasonal cookie that has been around for almost 100 years. It consists of  a small cookie topped with marshmallow and then covered with chocolate. I enjoyed the cookies and agree with the other positive reviews here.<br /><br />There are a couple of concerns having to do with how these cookies are handled and stored.<br /><br />Fragility - the cookie part of the Mallomar is quite fragile. The sample I received was shipped in a bubble-wrap package. At some point, something heavy was on top of it or dropped on it. That's how almost half of the cookies were crumbled. Regular shipments would be packed in cartons, but this is definitely something you want put in at the top of your grocery bag.<br /><br />Chocolate Bloom - When stored in warm conditions, real chocolate will "bloom."  Some of the cocoa butter will separate and migrate to the surface. This results in what appears to be a very thin light-colored coating on some or all of the surface. It is generally held that this is a cosmetic issue which has no effect on the taste of the chocolate. The sample I received had chocolate bloom and a few of the cookies were sticking together, definite signs that they had spent time in a warm environment after leaving the factory (it was unseasonably cool here the day they were delivered). This may be one reason that this is a seasonal, cool-weather product.<br /><br />Neither of these issues have to do with the manufacturing of the cookies, so I don't think they merit any stars off. They are something to bear in mind whether you're buying them online or at a retail store.

review/text: Yum, I loved those chocolate covered marshmallow cookies. I have a weakness when it comes to chocolate :)<br /><br />I especially love that those cookies are covered with tasty and sweet- but not too sweet- chocolate. Once you bite into the cookie, you'll get to the soft marshmallow center and a tasty cookie bottom.I really enjoyed these chocolate marshmallow cookies. Yesterday I was hoping that they would arrive, so that I could also give some of them out on Halloween. But when they arrived today and I tasted them, I changed my mind! I'm keeping them for me, and only sharing them with family... or better yet I'm hiding them in the fridge then I'll get to enjoy them for the whole week lol.<br /><br />On another note: Health wise, every two cookies (which is the size of a serving) has: 120 calories, 5 g fat, 18 g carbohydrates, and 12 g sugar. So be careful not to eat a lot of those.<br /><br />In the end, these are very tasty, I liked them a lot. But I do think that they are a bit expensive.

review/summary: S'Mores still beat them!
review/text: Were they bigger when I was a kid or is it just that now I am big and they seem small? It is probably just my memory. To me,<br />the dark chocolate coating is perfect, the marshmallow seems OK but the cookie seems a little dry. But that may be how they tasted back in the 1950s. (I ate more S'Mores than Mallomars back then.)<br /><br />I still compare them to S'Mores and to me they run second place. Real S'more have a two full sized graham crackers with a piece of chocolate and a regular sized marshmallow in the middle with it. Now that I think about it, the reason that Mallomars can't beat them because S'mores are warm with a melting marshmellow. Remember toasting marshmellows over an open fire or near a fireplace? Then the marshmallow melted the chocolate and you ate them and then you were in heaven. They were so good that I can remember when my mother fixed them and then when I made my husband's first S'More. Those memories don't fade.<br /><br />So with the basics, graham crackers, regular marshmallow and rich thick dark chocolate, I wil still rank S'Mores first.<br />If you don't have all that and a bonfire outside or a raised hearth fireplace, you can still get a sweet kick from mallomars.<br />Of course, without the delicious sticky fingers to lick.<br /><br /> About four of the pack were already split apart but that's OK, glad that it was the whole pack. So they are much more convenient but not quite as tasty as S'Mores.

That they appear in the fall, and presumably are not available at any other time of the year (?), seems delightfully old-fashioned.What can one say about a sweet treat which consists of cookie, chocolate, and marshmallow?

They have the flavor of Smores with the satisfying texture of biting into a cloud of happiness.

review/text: These are potentially addictive, the sort of snack that each member of the household should have their own supply of, because once you walk away, you can't be sure there will be any left in the package if you come back for more later! If I had any negative feedback, it would be that the cookie is slightly dry and separates sometimes from the marshmallow. The marshmallow, though, is sooo light and creamy! Very tasty for a mass-produced sweet!

Kind of on the small side (compared to Pinwheels) IMO they taste SOOOO much better.

review/summary: Not as good as I remember
review/text: I remember loving these cookies so I was super excited to get a box through Vine. I'm not sure how much the shipping packing from Amazon played into account in my disappointment or if it was all due to Nabisco. The box was pretty damaged when it got to me, dented in several places. When I opened the package, almost all of the cookies were in some state of falling apart- more so than you would expect from the damage the box showed, which is why I'm wondering if some of it came from the factory that way. May of the cookies were coming apart, the top half separated from the cookie bottom. Those that weren't in 2 pieces had the the cookie part crumbling.<br /><br />Despite their sad state, we managed to eat several cookies, holding them together when necessary. And I am sad to say that they were just "OK", not at all like the Mallomars I remembered from 10 or so years ago, which is probably the last time I had them. My husband agreed that they weren't quite the same. I thought the texture of the cookie was not good, it was very crumbly. The marshmallow was OK but the chocolate didn't taste all that good. Overall, they were just eh, not at all worth the calories, in my opinion. My kids will probably finish them off, though, as they seemed to enjoy them well enough.

review/text: I love marshmallow.  I love dark chocolate.  How on Earth is it possible that I had never tried Mallomars before?  I don't know how, but they had managed to escape my radar for all these years.  In case you haven't figured it out yet, I loved them.  I loved everything from the rich, dark chocolate covering the cookie to the ooey gooey marshmallow on the inside.  Not only did I love them, but both of my kids loved them too.  I hate to admit it, but I selfishly wanted to stash them somewhere and not share. I did fight that urge however, and shared them with my family, but only because I know I will be buying my own secret stash soon enough.

review/text: I'd never had these before, which is amazing considering how much I love marshmallows! These are basically a marshmallow sitting on top of a graham cracker crust, then dipped in chocolate. I found the chocolate coating to be inferior and waxy tasting, rather like the cheap "chocolate" covered Easter bunnies. The crust was falling apart on all the cookies and each one separated when it was lifted from the package. Not good. This is not a product I will buy, although I like the concept. If the chocolate was higher quality, they could be quite tasty!

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: By volume, these cookies are mostly biscuit and marshmallow, with a coating of chocolate. However, the predominant flavor is one of dark chocolate; the biscuit and marshmallow don't have much flavor. And that's okay, IMO. Some cookies with marshmallow as a major component can be rather over-sweet. These cookies, while certainly sweet, don't go over the top in that department, so kudos for that.<br /><br />This may sound like a niggling point, but these cookies are very messy to eat. Bite into one, and you're guaranteed to get a shower of crumbs and bits of chocolate down your front. There's just no way to avoid this, other than jamming a whole cookie into your mouth at once.

review/text: I received a package from the Vine program. They sent it in a padded envelope so needless to say, some of the cookies were broken. I won't hold that against the cookie. I assume if you purchase these, they will be shipped in a box with better protection. As for the cookie, I really liked them! They aren't too sweet. There is a light crumbly cookie topped with marshmallow and then the entire cookie is covered in dark chocolate. The chocolate & cookie not being too sweet help to balance out the sweetness of the marshmallow. I think if either were overly sweet, it would just be too much. It reminds me a little bit of a smores. These are really good and a nice little treat!

review/text: Mallomars were a staple food in my family for decades.  When I was young my father would hide them in a high cupboard and dole them out on an "as needed" basis.  So this review is going to be a little biased but accurate.<br /><br />Mallomars are a round chocolate covered marshmallow topped kinda graham cracker cookie that is only available from October until the supplies run out.  They are delicious without being sickeningly sweet or mushy. They can be enjoyed with milk, coffee, wine or any other beverage you like.<br /><br />They are often imitated, but they beat all challengers every time.

review/summary: One of life's temptations
review/text: The only real problem--no, there are two problems--with Mallomars is that they are often hard to find. I'm not even sure that they are made during the summertime, so scarce are they. The other problem is that one has to take reasonable care not to be left alone in the house with an opened box of the things. They are one of those foods that speak to you and do not shut up until they are all gone.<br /><br />If you've never had one, it's a fairly nondescript relative of a vanilla wafer topped with marshmallow, the whole thing thinly coated in a nice dark chololate. Sweet and gooey and not too heavy; what's not to like?<br /><br />HOWEVER, I am giving this five stars because I have eaten them in the past. The particular sample that was sent to me seemed a bit old, or as if it had been stored at too high a temperature; and this is a cookie that needs to be fresh to be at its best. Thus, I received these at the end of October, with an expiration date in February.  I would look for something with the date a bit further along if I were buying them in a store.

review/text: You might think a boxed cookie from a major manufacturer is guaranteed to be bad (I did), but these things are really quite good.  The chocolate actually tastes like chocolate (and pretty good chocolate at that), the marshmallow is soft, and the cookie is crunchy.  So good in fact that I only got half of one cookie.  I split one with my son when we first opened the box.  When I asked a few days later where the box had gone, well, I got some sheepish looks.<br /><br />Ingredients are fairly natural.  There's some high fructose corn syrup, but they're otherwise real components.<br /><br />My box arrived fairly squished, so you might be taking some chances with the shipping gods, but that's not the fault of the cookies so I'm not changing my rating based on that.

review/summary: Tasty morsels, a little thick
review/text: Receiving this product in the mail, I carefully opened the bright yellow box to examine the contents. While most of the cookies were intact, several did have broken parts with crumbs scattered about. Obviously this was due to the shipping and handling, but is something to consider as a possibility when buying products such as these through the mail. Of course, in this situation, even the crumbs were tasty and most of the cookies had no problems at all.<br /><br />Not normally being a big fan of marshmallows, I was pleasantly surprised with the balance of taste between the graham, the marshmallow, and the chocolate. Perhaps the overall flavor was a bit sweet for my tastes, but the chocolate and the graham off-set the sweetness of the marshmallow, creating a feeling of comfortable flavor not too sweet nor bitter at all. Each bite was a pleasure and took me back to childhood full of moonpies. With a flavor and texture similar to moonpies, Mallomars are a slightly healthier alternative and less likely to leave melted chocolate on the hands and fingers.<br /><br />For personal taste, I would have preferred a lesser amount of marshmallow on each cookie or maybe a "tighter" less fluffy marshmallow in the middle. This would make the cookie feel crunchier, smaller, and allow for more cookies in a box. Yet there was no denying the excellent flavor and feeling of fun as I ate these delicious morsels. Recommend for chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker enthusiasts.

review/summary: S'mores in a Box
review/text: I had no idea that Mallomars were such a sought after item until I had these sent to me.  Reading through other Vine reviews--I haven't experienced the same problems that others are reporting.  My box was shipped in a single mailer and arrived undamaged. Upon opening the Mallomars they were new looking and smelling, so far there has been one that the bottom fell off of, but the rest were all very intact. And they tasted fresh and great.<br /><br />They are a messy cookie--so don't be sitting on a white couch where the dark chocolate can melt into the fabric.  They are smaller than I thought they would be I'd say they have maybe a two inch diameter and are about 3/4 of an inch tall.  The bottom is more akin to a graham cracker crust than a graham cracker (Very crumbly).  On top of that sits a puff of marshmallow all of which is coated in dark chocolate.  I actually liked these more than I thought I would.<br /><br />Their small size makes them a great not-so-guilty pleasure, treat.<br /><br />The packaging resembles the old Fig Newton boxes, cardboard with a closeable top (like cereal boxes). The Mallomars sit in a plastic tray in two rows that are sort of segmented.  My one caveat is that the plastic that covers the tray ripped too easily so it isn't really helping protect my uneaten cookies from getting stale.<br /><br />I don't know how long they can sit out as they are without loosing flavor (I'm guessing this normally isn't too much of a problem with how popular they are) but the cookie seems to be one that could be frozen pretty easily.

review/text: These cookies are SO good!  They're like a S'more...only in a cold cookie.  Marshmallow, piled high on a graham cracker like cookie, and then wrapped in perfect dark chocolate.  Yum!  These are difficult to find in stores in the Western part of the country, but I snatch them up when I find them.  They tend to separate where the cookie joins the marshmallow when shipped (this box did, anyway).  They're still delicious and picking the bits out of the tray and popping them in my mouth is a guilty pleasure...but if you want to have a plate of whole cookies (for presentation purposes) I'd look for them locally rather than having them shipped.  There aren't many in the box (18), so that makes them a rather expensive cookie, but they're worth EVERY penny!

review/summary: Like eating a chocolate cloud
review/text: This brings back wonderful childhood memories. I had not eaten Mallomars in years and I have to say that they are as delicious as I remembered them. The base is a chocolate wafer with marshmallow on top, all covered with chocolate. I love the way the kind of explode in your mouth. The base on some of the cookies had broke apart from the upper half. I don't know if that happened during shipping or if the cookies might have been slightly old. They tasted fine and I would certainly recommend them. Wonderful with milk!

review/summary: Mmmmmm........mmmmm
review/text: I decided to try these since I remember eating them as a kid (decades ago) and they are still quite tasty. Mallomars are a combination of crisp cookie bottom with marshmallow on top covered by a chocolate coating. My 11 yr old son and 13 yr old daughter are looking forward to eating more this evening. We tried them both with and without milk; decided they are better without milk.<br />The only negative (and it may be because these were mailed to me as single box in an envelope) is that many of the cookie bottoms had separated from the marshmallow top

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I'm not sure why I'm not crazy about these things. When I was a Girl Scout, I used to love s'mores so I thought it'd be the same deal. They have the crunchiness of graham crackers, the chocolate and the marshmallows though. I like them, but I'm just not in love with them. If I really needed a sweet tooth fix, they'd definitely work. I like the texture and taste of the chocolate though, but I'm wondering if maybe I'm outgrowing s'mores these days. I'll have to make use of my stove (or somebody's campfire) to find out.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I have often heard about Mallomars through books and TV, but here in California I never really see them on grocery store shelves. So to me, they had this mythical quality, and when Amazon offered me the chance to get my hands on a box, I went for it.<br /><br />If you like marshmallows and chocolate, you are going to be happy.  These dark chocolate-dipped marshmallows are soft and fluffy since the chocolate protects them from the air.  A graham cracker base provides a slight bit of crunch.  I was tempted to microwave one of these cookies to try and get the full s'mores effect, but since the chocolate is on the outside there was no way to do so without making a huge mess.<br /><br />Overall, these are pretty good.  Not quite as delicious or exotic as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA158Q">Nabisco Pinwheels Chocolate Marshmallow Cookies</a> - but if you're a fan of Pinwheels I'd give Mallomars a chance, because they're a great snack.  Alternatively, if you've been eating Mallomars for years and want a marshmallow snack for the months when Mallomars aren't in production, try to find some Pinwheel cookies.  They are AWESOME.)<br /><br />Now please excuse me as I continue to try and work up the nerve to microwave these suckers for a true s'mores experience...

review/summary: I Love the Mallomars
review/text: I love these things. They are delicious. Basically, they're s'more cookies (graham cracker topped with marshmallow coated in chocolate.) They are a little small, but very thick, about the size of three Oreos stacked on top of each other. They also fall apart; the graham cracker base separates from the marshmallow top very easily. Also, the graham cracker part is crumbly. I wouldn't recommend eating these things on the couch.<br /><br />The taste is phenomenal. It's definitely got the processed food tang, but it's a very small evil among all the good. Buy them. Even if you don't like them, someone in your family will.

review/summary: Pretty good for a cold s'more
review/text: I must confess I hadn't heard of mallomars before.  It's basically a kind of graham cookie with some marshmallow, covered in a thin layer of chocolate.<br /><br />I give Hershey's version of this snack 3 stars, because Hershey's chocolate has a very particular taste that I'm not a fan of.  This one definitely merits four stars, but not five.  All the elements are very solid in terms of taste, especially the chocolate.  Most surprising for me, given that s'mores are really sweet, these cookies are sweet but not overwhelming.  As far as texture goes, the cookie definitely falls a little short, with the texture of damp cardboard, rather than crispy graham cracker.  The marshmallow isn't quite as soft as a jet-puft, but it's definitely not as hard as something you'd find in a box of cereal.  It's pretty good, but no substitute for a fresh marshmallow.<br /><br />And that's really where I come out on these cookies: you could build a better one with graham crackers, (decent) chocolate, some marshmallows, and a campfire.  But when you don't have those, these are pretty good.<br /><br />My trial pack came in a bubble-pack envelope, so some of the cookies were broken.  I think it probably comes in a cardboard box if you order four boxes (4 x 18 cookies) - most of the other reviews do not complain about broken cookies.  As far as value for money, these seem a little pricey, but they're quite satisfying if you're after a special treat...

review/summary: Very Nice Marshmallow Cookie
review/text: I've known the name "Mallomars" for many years but just never bothered to try them because for many years I was a cookie snob and stuck to chocolate chip cookies and sugar cookies. I only bought those kinds of cookies and I only baked those kinds. Then I wised up and expanded. I now especially like trying all kinds of new cookie recipes. I have tried making various marshmallow cookies because I like marshmallows but none of my recipes ever turned out well. They were either too messy and gooey or the marshmallow stiffened up. Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies have none of the problems my poor baking attempts have suffered.<br /><br />Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies consist of a thin round cookie with marshmallow on top all covered in a dark chocolate shell. I was somewhat hesitant to take a bite considering my past recipe disasters but this is actually a surprising good cookie. The round cookie on the bottom is thin and crunchy. Other reviewers have said it is a graham cookie but it seemed a bit sweeter than that to me. The marshmallow is soft but not gooey and is enough for a good taste but not so much as to be overpowering. The chocolate covering is hard but not tough and leaves a nice aftertaste in your mouth. The cookie crumbled a bit as I bit in but did not fall to pieces. My Mallomars arrived in an 8 ounce box in a padded envelope and arrived in good shape. Three cookies had parts of their bottoms broken off but otherwise they were in good shape and were not squashed and the chocolate was not cracked.<br /><br />Overall, Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies are a surprising good cookie. I think I can now give up on trying to bake a marshmallow cookie. In fact, I may try to sneak these onto my Christmas trays of homemade cookies at our Christmas Eve get-together.

My teeth break through the hard chocolate coating like an icebreaker cruising through the arctic only to encounter a bright white marshmallowey tastiness in the center until ground is broken through the graham cracker crust in the bottom. The chocolate tastes more dark than milk, and the flavors blend into an intense flavor mosaic that is definitely memorable.<br /><br />I don't know why I haven't tasted these before... but I'm glad that I have and will be happy to eat more!

review/summary: Sweet, campy bites of cookie, marshmallow, and chocolate
review/text: I had heard about the Mallomars long before reviewing this product. They are part of food lore along the lines of the girl scout cookie and smores. Stripped of its reputation, this is a simple graham cracker, with a generously portioned marshmallow, all coated in a chocolate shell. It is a mass-produced, room temperature derivative of the smoore. While not crazy about the taste relative to premium cookies, it is satisfying as a snack on its own. And immediately after telling my wife that I expected something else, I found myself grabbing inside the package for seconds and thirds. Is the chocolate going to be mistaken for Godiva? No. Does this make me forget campfire smores from days past? No. But as my wife remarked, if Nabisco's Mallomar was priced at two for $5 in a supermarket, I'd take both and count myself lucky for it.

review/text: These are excellent for a treat when you are craving chocolate.  Not for those who are watching calories or fat but sometimes you have to just live it up a little!<br />Only issue was with how it arrived - many of the cookies were damaged in transit, resulting in a cookie crumbs covering all cookies.  Not a major issue but I believe this may be specific only to the way these are shipped when sent as part of Vine program (as a single pack, not as pack of 4).  All in all, a very delicious cookie to be enjoyed by all ages.

The only time I ever remember hearing the name before is in the Simpsons episode "Hurricane Neddy" when nice-guy Flanders finally snaps and cusses out the whole town.  Upon getting to the portly Police Chief Wiggum he says, "The only case you've gotten to the bottom of was a CASE OF MALLOMARS!!!"<br /><br />I assume by what I've read that they are a fall only type product, like the McRib.  I am also informed by the box that they are a New York kinda thing.<br /><br />Regardless, I'm glad Vine gave me the chance to try them, because they are SO GOOD!!!<br /><br />The crunchy dark chocolate coating over a marshmallow lump and thin crunchy cookie gives a s'mores like experience that truly satisfies.<br /><br />An excellent snack.

review/summary: Tasty Choc marsh-mellow cookie
review/text: "Mallomars" by Nabisco [Kraft Foods], labeled "Pure Chocolate" cookies.  Well, let's define "pure chocolate": to me, that means `all chocolate', but I guess to manufacturers it means that the chocolate isn't `unpure' - whatever that may mean. Essentially, a marsh-mellow sits atop a vanilla cookie, and all enclosed with the `pure chocolate.'  Anyway, pertaining to the free box I received for review, it appeared that the Mallomars had been left in some storage facility for toooo long: most of the edges of the chocolate cookies looked like they had some kind of `freezer burn' - there were yellowing.  About of third of the items had the cookie separating from the marsh-mellow.  They looked like they were past their prime, `expired' even - although the box code stated that their shelf life was okay until 8 Feb 2012.  Nonetheless, but closing my eyes they tasted GREAT!  Both my father and mother liked them.  All the contents were better than good: including the cookie, the marsh-mellow and the chocolate.  The `pure chocolate' wasn't as GREAT as some of the expensive chocolate you get from Switzerland, but the Mallomars' chocolate was tasty.  Yeah, I'd gladly buy a box.

review/text: I don't think I had ever tried Mallomars before seeing them available in the Vine program.  They were really good.  The dark chocolate flavor is pretty intense for a cookie, and the marshmallow and cookie base complement each other well, like an unmelted s'more.  I do wish that the cookie base had been a little more firm and didn't easily crumble when bitten.  Made for messy eating with everyone in the family -- and we all tried (and liked!) them.<br /><br />I am not sure that this is a great product for mail order, however; they are readily available in our local grocery stores.  In our box, about half the cookies were broken apart.  Still, they are pretty delicious.

review/text: I have never tried these cookies before, I don't think they are available in my region. They are good, but I wouldn't put them on my list of favorite cookies. The chocolate shell is perfectly thin to the fluffy marshmallow creme which is perfectly balanced with the 'cookie'. I put that in quotation marks because the 'cookie' is more like a graham cracker crumbly crust, not a hard-packed cookie. I tried mine frozen and enjoyed them more that way. They are very sweet though, so I suggest enjoying them with a glass of cold milk!

review/text: Chocolate, marshmallow, graham crackers.. there's nothing really more nostalgic than a combination of those three ingredients (s'mores anyone?) bringing back so many young memories. The true beauty of the combination is its simplicity and that it spans so many different countries and cultures.<br /><br />I actually grew up more with moon pies (or choco pies as it is called in Asia) that more closely resembles a s'more by having two graham crackers sandwiching instead of the mallomars single cracker on the bottom. The thing I really like about this version is that it is smaller and much easier to have a small snack or nibble as opposed to the larger alternatives. Sinking my teeth into the fluff first made me enjoy and taste the marshmallow sweetness first which I've come to realize I prefer.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that my package (of 18 cookies) came smushed in the mail so many of my cookies had their layers separated letting me not enjoy the full experience as intended.

review/summary: Not Moon Pie and not sorry about it.
review/text: In 1913 it was Mexico that had its revolution.  The Romanovs  by contrast, celebrated 300 years of rule.  Woolworth opens the world's tallest skyscraper, casting a dagger-like shadow every morning aimed at the heart of West Hoboken.  The result, in life imitating Michelangelo's Creation, was the American incarnation of the Danish Chocolate Coated Marshmallow Cookie, The National Biscuit Company's Mallomar.  While New York's version cannot compare to the 800 million of the original produced annually in Denmark, the loyalty is as fierce as any Viking's.<br /><br />The appearance of  Mallomars mean one thing.  It is harvest time.  We cannot get these in France, where harvest centers on mere grapes.  But I remember the old Nabisco factory that used to make them.  Now they are imported from Canada.  Not French Canada, home of the vaunted Whippets, another older version with fiery loyalty.<br /><br />But a couple of the original ingredients are still used.  Sugar is not sweet enough for modern tastes.  Instead, high fructose corn syrup is used to supplement.  It has the added advantages of making use of the corn subsidy and doubling the body's fat producing efficiency.  Good thing, because these little wonders have only 45 calories out of each 120 coming directly from fat.<br /><br />And what fat is that?  Mostly saturated fat. What saturated fat?  Well, highly saturated fat - palm oil.  Actually, there are two.  The other is from the kernel of the oil palm.  It is even more highly saturated.  These oils are really cheap.  All you do is denude the natural palm groves.  And by grinding up the seeds along with everything else, you ensure that the palm groves cannot return.  Could be worse, it could be trans fat.  And the minority contribution does ensue from monounsaturated fat.  Which one you timidly ask?  Canadian Low Acid Oil, better known as canola.  So you can breathe a sigh of relief.  That is unless you happen to be one of those who do not like the idea of genetically modified organisms that allow corporations like Monsanto to control patents on the once natural ability of crops to reseed themselves.<br /><br />You know what a marshmallow tastes like.  But one encased in a hard chocolate shell is not exposed to air.  This changes the surface texture.  It is less chewy because there is no drying.  The shell is hard, but thin.  So this brittleness has a crunchiness to it, yet it is thin enough so that there is no resistance.  The chocolate is dark chocolate, as New Yorkers prefer.  It gives that lingering chocolate aftertaste.  The whole experience is mediated, extended by the cookie.<br /><br />These cult treats are immune from all the above attacks.  Such is the nature of a cult.  Impervious, intractable and intransigent.  How do you know it is a cult item?  Look at the box.  Nabisco does not plaster it all over with the standard marketing drivel.  It is not new and improved.  It is not DELICIOUS.  It is not given with recipes or serving suggestions.  It makes no apologies.<br /><br />I will make one suggestion.  If you do not want it with milk because milk is not sold out of quart bottles for you to chug, go to the other extreme.  They go with classic cream tea.

review/summary: Great stuff, but get it locally.
review/text: I know how Mallowmars taste. They are the truly splendid fall treat I have looked forward to around thanksgiving for as long as I can remember. So what I really was checking via this order was how well they ship.<br /><br />The answer is, terrible. The over long, Two weeks of delivery time turned the cookie part to crumbs on almost every one. The chocolate was melted to the plastic tray on half of them (only half?).  Overall a fail, and certainly not something you would want to open up in front of guests.<br /><br />Get them locally or find a replacement. Splurge on faster shipping perhaps? I can not vouch for that option having not tried it though. As is, the standard shipping makes for sad mallomars pandas.<br /><br />The second star is for the two in the box that had part of a cookie left and were somewhat edible.

review/summary: Yummy but squished
review/text: These cookies are delicious.  In our neck of the woods, they only have the giant Mallomars, so I really like the smaller size of these.  Everyone in our family loves them.  Not the cookies' fault, but these were mostly smashed to smithereens when we received them.  The box looked fine, but the cookies were broken and messy.  Luckily, I got them for us, not for someone else because I wouldn't have known they were all broken because the box was perfectly fine on the outside.  My advice would be to buy these in a local store, they don't ship well, at least the package I got didn't.

review/summary: A nice treat... but not compatible with most shipping.
review/text: On the basis of taste alone, Mallomars would get 4 stars from me.  These were non-messy S'mores alternatives long before people even heard of S'mores; starting with a graham cracker-type base, then a layer of marshmallow and all capped with delicious chocolate.  They're a great treat, even if the temptation is to keep popping one in your moouth after the other.<br /><br />The problem here is that a single package doesn't travel well.  Consider the way a lot of boxes can be tossed around in mail and UPS trucks and you start to get an idea as to the problem.  About half of the cookies that were in my shipment were either broken or crumbly.  That kind of detracts from things.  And before you have images of some small package delivery guy tossing the box every which away, this wasn't that kind of damage.  This was the kind of crumbing and breakage that's almost unavoidable in a small carton... IF... it's going to be shipped through any method other than a shrink wrapped pallet.  I like the treat, I just wish it wasn't so crumby by the time it gets to my hand.

review/text: Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies / B000FA38ZY<br /><br />Usually I start off my Vine reviews with a little background on my history with the product, but lets jump ahead to the end for once: I liked these cookies so much that as soon as I finished eating them, I bought more. From Amazon. Because my local grocery store didn't have them. And I nearly cried in the aisle because of that little tragic fact. Yeah.<br /><br />I've never had Mallomars before. They're wonderful. They're soft and delicate, and the little internal cookie is so deliciously spongy. They're basically s'mores in a box but without having to find a heat source and the cracker cookies aren't hard and stale. Every time I sit down to eat just one of these I end up eating four. They're delicious. I especially like that the chocolate coating is also very delicate and doesn't overwhelm the whole thing. Can I sound more addicted? Probably not.<br /><br />NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Expected better.  Quality control was not where it should be.
review/text: I remember these type cookies from years ago.  And was looking forward to 'reliving' the past.  The box came and when I opened them, the cookies were, well, a bit broken.  Somehow many of them had come apart.  There was no reason for that to have happened, other than quality control issues at the factory.<br /><br />That being said, the taste was, well, not as good as I had thought it would be combining all those flavors in one.  While I have eaten a fair number (can't pass up chocolate) the quality and consistency of this Nabisco brand left a lot to be desired from a national brand company.<br /><br />If they get their production process straightened out and get the taste right, then this will be a great product, reminiscent of years gone by.<br /><br />I for one won't be buying any of these any time soon.

review/summary: They don't travel well.
review/text: The last time I bought Mallomars was in a local grocery store, and they were old. These from Amazon were fresh (sell-by date is 3 months in the future) and they taste nice and fresh with nice soft marshmallow. However, even though the box shows no sign of damage, some of the cookies inside had broken apart and every one of them was covered in cookie crumbs. This doesn't really affect the eatability of them, but it is disappointing. I just don't think Nabisco has put enough thought into the packaging for Mallomars.

review/summary: outrageous
review/text: If you have not tried this you do not know what you are missing.  This is a chocolate covered cookie that when you bite into it you will taste soft marshmallow and a cracker all of this wrapped in chocolate.  It is great with a cup of tea, my favorite but with milk, coffee or any other beverages it is a real treat and once tried will be buying it forever. The only bad thing is it is not available in the summer cause it might melt so try it now when it is fresh and at its best.

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: I remember these from childhood but I guess those memories aren't that accurate. These were very dry, poor quality chocolate and mediocre marshmallow. All combine to make an underwhelming product. There are other mass market products that are similar but better, such as the Pinwheels also from Nabisco. There are also very high quality versions out there from small, specialty manufacturers; chocolate teacakes from the UK, similar products from other countries (they all seem to have some variation on this theme) and there are even great recipes on the various food websites for the more adventuresome. Your kids may accept these as edible, but why not give them something better?

review/summary: Mallomars... the cookie of choice of Claudia Kishi!
review/text: So, the only reason I requested these was because I have nostalgia for the Baby-Sitter's Club series by Ann M. Martin. Claudia Kishi, the vice-president of the BSC, was always referring to Mallomars and I don't know if my small Minnesota town just didn't have them when I was growing up but I have never had one. When I saw these on Vine, I had to get them for nothing but nostalgia. Fortunately, they weren't awful but they aren't something I'm going to buy on my own. If you like marshmallows, this may just be the cookie for you. The thin layer of chocolate coating gives these a distinct s'mores flavor which again, is kind of fun. These aren't an awful sweet treat but they aren't something I'm going to routinely reach for when I need a sweet fix. However, I'm glad to say I experienced something Claudia Kishi was always raving about.

review/text: The particular feel of these cookies is unforgettable-- even if, like me, you have not eaten one in forty years. My grandmother often served these. They taste somewhat like s'mores, but there is this marvelous texture of the crisp candy coating, the soft marshmallow and the crunchy cookie inside that is awesome. I think of them as Christmas cookies. They are a prefect cap to an after school snack on a dark winter's afternoon.

review/text: I was expecting to get smores like goodness out of this product.  However, the box of mallomars I received were 1) stale, 2) had white residue on the chocalate, 3) cookies lacked any semblence of edibility.<br />Questions raised are: 1) Storage problems at Amazon?  2) Shipping problems 3) Did the cookies expire.<br />The sxpiry dating was still OK.  Not sure why the cookies were problematic as they were.

review/summary: Almost a S'more
review/text: A packaged substitute for a s'more, the Mallomars have a very thin graham cookie, topped by a large marshmallow, and all drenched in chocolate.  They are alright for an occasional snack, but my children enjoyed these more than I did. My children actually altered the Mallomar to make it a little more scrumptious.  They placed the whole cookie on top of a graham cracker and said it tasted great that way!<br /><br />I'm all for stories, and I liked how they attempt to tell their story on the box--that Mallomars have been enjoyed in New York City for decades, and its most loyal fans reside there.  Now they're spreading across the nation.  Makes you think about what you're eating.

review/text: My Mallomars looked like they were either very old and past their shelf life or (more likely) had been stored in a facility that was too hot or too cold for the cookies. The chocolate looks ashy and is cracked and the cookies taste a little stale. I'll be asking for a refund. Such a bummer, I love these cookies.

review/text: All my life, I'd heard of Mallomars, but had never seen or tried them. These are reasonably tasty, with a darker chocolate coating. My only real problem was on fully half of them, the marshmallow separated from the cookie base. I doubt if I'll buy these again. There's better chocolate marshmallow cookies out there, even Walmart's are better.

review/text: I am into dark chocolate and I liked these cookies. I think they probably used more dark which might explain why my kids don't care for them.<br /><br />When the package arrived, half of the cookies were not intact. The top separated from the bottom at the crunchy cracker place. As you eat them, intact or not, crumbs come down.<br /><br />But it has better quality comparing to products like Little Debbie etc..
