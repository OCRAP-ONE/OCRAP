review/summary: The name implies strength, dark and bold
review/text: Like all reviews the taste is subjective based on your preference.<br />I had this on my gift list and received it for Christmas.<br /><br />So now it came time to taste test it.  First off my reference point is "Jet Fuel", "Double Black Diamond", and Donut Shop" all from the Coffee People and each being in my top choice category.  I tend to favor strong dark roast flavors.<br /><br />Judgment criteria for my coffee is; aroma, taste, and color.  If it doesn't have aroma it typically goes nowhere and is tasteless.  At that point color doesn't matter.  Some have good aroma but lack the full taste to complement the aroma, and the color should be indicative of the coffee type, either rich brown or rich black.<br /><br />Well I tried the "Black Tiger" and must say: NO aroma, NO taste, OK on color.<br /><br />So in summary 46 k-cups (I tested 2) will be shipped off to the land fill unused.

review/summary: Black Tiger?  More like Black Kitty
review/text: Not strong enough.  I decided to try Black Tiger instead of Coffee People Organic in order to get something a little bit stronger.  Bad idea - Wrong choice! Not strong and odd taste.  I'll stick with stronger/better coffees from Timothy's like Parisian Nights or Midnight Magic.

review/text: I have been purchasing this coffee for about 2 years now.  I really enjoy the strong flavor and I love my Keurig.  I just ordered the "frustration free" packaging and I am not a big fan.  It is basically 50 KCups thrown in a box.  I think I prefer the boxes that can be left out on the counter next to the machine.  I will probably be switching back to the frustration packaging.

So I now have both Donut Shop and Black Tiger, and, love them both! And...I love my Keurig coffee maker(a Christmas gift for my husband and I from our daughter). A little bit of a luxury, but I have fresh cup of coffee every time!

review/summary: Keep coming back to tiger
review/text: I have tried many of the K cups from Coffee People and they all have their strengths. I drink them everyday and find myself always coming back to the black tiger. It is coffee with rich earthy flavors and mild acid finish in excellent balance. A little early morning time alone with a cup of fresh brewed black tiger K-cup is what makes the start of the day a real treat for me. I have seen some compare jet fuel to black tiger and think that you will have a challenge telling the difference. It probably does not matter too much, because if you like or dislike the one, the other will likely be the same result. What a great find. Thanks coffee people!

review/summary: Bold but not bitter
review/text: NOTE: This is a review of this coffee in the K-cup format, not of Amazon's packaging.  However, I have never had trouble with the Frustration-free packaging; I simply cannot comment in this case.<br /><br />Reviewer's preferences: Strong, medium-dark roast coffees, mid-to-heavily sweetened with whole milk (4:1 ratio or a little heavier toward the coffee side).  I occasionally add a hint of vanilla syrup and cream or half-and-half if a coffee is overly bitter.<br /><br />I picked up this coffee in a large sampler box of Coffee People "Extra Bold" K-cups, which I have just finished off.  The collection contained the following blends/coffees: Wake-up Call, Jet Fuel, Black Tiger, and Organic.  I have had each coffee multiple times.  From the four, I give the Organic blend the top spot with a slight edge over Black Tiger (we're talking 9.1/10 over 9.0/10 here).  Both the Black Tiger and Organic were strong and bold in flavor but not too bitter, while the Wake-up Call tended to be a little more harsh on the palate.  The Jet Fuel blend was appropriately named, as it almost always required a little vanilla and more milk or even heavy cream to make it palatable.<br /><br />Qualities of Coffee People Black Tiger blend:<br />Strong, medium-to-heavy dark coffee flavor (think bold Columbian or Italian roast strength) with a rich aroma and barely-there nutty note.  Bitterness on the mild end, a little above most medium roast coffees, but still pleasant.  Mild-to-medium acidity (mellow), with no sourness of note and a slightly nutty or even earthy flavor.  Flavor envelops the entire mouth, but rarely overwhelms the palate.  Substantial body, but not heavy or syrupy.  Takes to sweeteners and milk/cream well without disappearing or losing nuance.  Very good bold coffee, with a distinguishable flavor profile but still primarily made up of the familiar flavors unique to coffee.

review/summary: Ok, but not the best I've tasted
review/text: Black Tiger makes a good cup of coffee, but not great.  It's got a bit of a bite and could be a little smoother.  I really enjoy a rich, robust coffee and was hoping for that according to the name--just a bit disappointed.  I have found Timothy's Rainforest Extra Bold Espresso K-Cup a much more satisfying cup.  The 50 pack in the simple brown box, though, is a great idea--there's enough waste with the K-cups that the simpler the outer packaging, the better.

review/text: Raised in TX but very near S. LA, I love a really strong cup of coffee.  Coffee People win out over all other brands.  The others have some great coffees but overall, Coffee People don't make a really bad K-Cup.  I have no idea what they do differently but they don't have all that sour aftertaste or acidity.  I hate that and for me, it's prevalent in most of Grn Mtn coffees.  My fav of all the Coffee People is a difficult choice but I do love Black Tiger and Jet Fuel.  I keep both all the time.  They are similar but Jet Fuel has a bit of smokey end note and Black Tiger is a bit smoother with no smokey taste.  Love Coffee People.

review/summary: Black Tiger blasts through KCups
review/text: I like bold coffee, which this was promoted as a bold, dark brew. I've had better but this isn't bad. It has a dark roast flavor that really attacks the palette, leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste, which I don't really care for. I'm glad I tried it and I have enjoyed it as my morning brew but I probably wouldn't order another box. I have also experienced some of the kcups leaking during the brewing, spreading dark, hot coffee with the grounds all over and down the front of the brewer leaving an absolute mess. It's bad enough for this to happen once in awhile, but this has happened three times and I'm not even half-way through the box (BTW, Amazon's frustration-free packaging is really great!). I see what is happening is that the foil on the top of the cup breaks loose allowing the coffee to be forced out over the top. Now, I must look over each KCup very carefully before I use it. Maybe I just got a bad batch but I can't wait for it to be gone.<br />UPDATE. I separated out the cups that look like they might explode. Of the 28 kcups left, 17 (over half) looked like they would fail. I was right on all but 4 of them! With this batch of 50 kcups, nearly half of them failed during the brewing process. This is by far the worst batch of KCups I have ever used. I will definitely, never, ever, buy these again.

review/summary: Strong with Italian/French roast flavors and aromas
review/text: Decent, strong cup with overtones of Italian or French roasts.  CP Organic Bold is a bit "rounder" and Jet Fuel is a tad bitter.  Produces a nice cup of reasonably strong coffee that is not bitter or harsh.  Our prefs run to CP Organic and Green Mountain Dark Magic or Double Black Diamond and the occasional Italian or French Roast.  We find the Timothy's blends to be rather bitter.  With the bulk packaging and subscription, Coffee People produce the least expensive K cups we have found at around 35 cents per pod.

review/text: I usually drink mild or flavored coffee with lots of cream and sugar. And to tell the truth, I first ordered a sample of Black Tiger because I love the packaging. Silly, I know, but it turned out to be a smart choice. Black tiger is strong but not bitter or burnt tasting, and the coffee flavor shines through all the cream and sugar I like to add. My husband used to drink Green Mountain's Dark Magic, but he likes this one just as much. Black Tiger is a great way to get going in the morning--and it's strong enough to make a big, delicious serving to fill the travel mugs we take to work.

First, the removal of this fine coffee from the Subscribe & Save program was bad enough but the jump in cost has been an even worse follow-up. The term "price jump" is an understatement. This sort of increase is usually only seen in black market supply & demand situations.  Maybe it's time to go back to burr grinders and french presses.

review/text: Very good coffee.  Strong and rich with an earthy taste. There is a bitter dry after taste but not too bad. Not exactly what I was looking for but well worth trying. Prefer wake-up and kona over this coffee.

review/text: We've had our Keurig for a couple of months and it makes great coffee.  Newman's was my favorite until my wife was looking to restock and ordered Black Tiger.  Wow, is this good, full-flavored coffee!  I'm not a coffee snob I'll drink almost anything and not complain but since I've been drinking this I don't even pour a cup when I get to work.  Great coffee!

review/summary: poor product this delivery
review/text: I am a frequent subscriber to this product and get regular shipments.  However, I was running low, so instead of waiting for my automatic next shipment I went ahead and ordered just one box outside of my normal order.  I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the k-cups in this particular box.  Over half of the cups I could not use because they were all messed up on the top with the edges pulling away leaking coffee grinds out.  The cups themselves on some were all smashed.  I don't know if you have every used a less than top quality k-cup but if there are any imperfections then you run the risk of them "exploding" in your machine and making a grand mess and clogging it up.  Therefore, I chose not to run this risk and wasted half of this box.  Normally, on my regular shipments I have never had this happen and I am always completely satisfied.

review/summary: Great coffee, bad manufacturing
review/text: This is the 6th box of the Black Tiger K cups that we've received and while the coffee is still fabulous, the seals on this box of K cups were defective.  Atleast 10 of the box of 50 were unusable, as without a tight seal, the water and ground will overflow the k cup to spill all over your counter.  The cost of these skyrocket when fully 20% of the order is defective.<br />This has only happened with one box so far and I am hoping it is a one-time occurence.

review/text: I have long been a fan of Black Tiger coffee - K-cups; however, upon receipt of this particular item, I found many "bloated" k-cups with the seal pulling away from the edge of the cup. I gave a couple of them a try, only to find overflowing coffee and what little went into my cup had coffee grounds in it. I'm not sure if the "frustration-free" packaging was the cause or this batch was just mishandled - another order I had was packaged normally - 25 cups per box, and those K-cups were normal.

review/text: Having tried several of the K-Cup coffees available I keep coming back to Black Tiger. I like my coffee black, bold and strong, with a rich full flavor. This really delivers better than the others. It is smoother and richer than Jet Fuel, coming as close, so far as I've been able to get to, a quad Americano at Starbucks. Oh, and packaged in the Amazon packaging at .42 per Kup its a pretty good deal with less cardboard to dispose of.

review/text: I had never tried Black Tiger coffee before purchasing this, which struck me as a little odd while I was waiting for it.  I mean really, who buys a 50 pack of coffee they have no idea if they like?  But fortunately, it turned out very well.  This is some of the best coffee I have had in K-cups, and will definitely be something I will purchase again in the future.  The frustration free packaging was great, too.  I love that I didn't have to fool with the flimsy cardboard packaging that K-cups usually come in.

review/summary: just what I was looking for...
review/text: I got the Keurig coffeemaker for Christmas.  Was skeptical that it could brew a cup of coffee strong enough for my taste.  After trying all the k-cup samples that came with the maker I decided that the extra bold k-cups were strong, but not quite what I was looking for.  Started reading reviews and decided on Black Tiger.  Found what I was looking for.  Great taste, not bitter, strong enough for me (the largest size brew is not strong enough, but the next size down is perfect).  Highly recommend this k-cup.

review/summary: Excellent dark flavor with a smooth, silky feel.
review/text: If you love the rich taste of a good cup of espresso or french brew and the smooth, silky feel they leave behind on your tongue, this is the K-cup for you. While it doesn't have the full-blown flavor of espresso, this is a nice dark, rich coffee that really comes across as freshly ground and brewed. I love my Keurig  for and the convenience it provides, and I've tried quite a few different K-cups, including Coffee People's Jet Fuel (good, but not as good as this) and Newman's Extra Bold (no way nearly as good as this), and this is the first one that has made me want to go back and brew another cup and another. It's really that good.

review/text: I have ordered Black Tiger many times, but this last shipment was horrible!  Something definitely changed with this batch, besides the cup color.  This batch had a harsh chemical taste and was very bitter. It was undrinkable. I thought maybe it was just one k-cup, but after a few the same, I returned the product and cancelled my subscription.  This was my favorite type with Donut Shop a second. Now Donut Shop will be my everyday K-Cup.  Hope they don't mess with that one too.

review/summary: Decent cup of coffee
review/text: I bought this based on the other favorable reviews.  I find it is just about right for flavor and strength.  While not being the strongest coffee I have ever tried with my Keurig brewer, it makes a decent cup of coffee.  I also tried Tree Hugger and find it is a bit stronger and you can even run it through almost a second time to get another small serving or a warm up out of it.  So, if you are looking for a bit stronger coffee try the Tree Hugger.  Santa's Buzz is also a good choice.  I will most likely buy the Black Tiger again at some point but I like to try different ones for variety.

review/text: I read the reviews about this being a *really* strong cup of coffee and bought it for that exact reason.  Maybe I got a box of wonky pods, but it wasn't nearly as strong as I was hoping for.  I'll stick with the Wake-Up Call or the Jet Fuel - I think both have a darker and more intense flavor.<br /><br />The frustration-free packaging is great...I'm so glad this is being offered now.  Every month I'd gripe to my husband about the ridiculousness of two separate boxes of coffee pods wrapped in plastic, padded with more plastic and then placed inside another gigantic box.  Thumbs up to the much simpler and greener packaging of just one little box.

review/text: Purchased this coffee after reading many reviews about being bold, etc.  I also Purchased "Jet Fuel" also by coffee people.  Bottom line - Black tiger does not live up to its name.  It has a "mainstream" flavor similar to the big brands you find in a grocery store.  No comparison to high quality coffee.  If you have a choice between this and Jet Fuel go for Jet Fuel.  Bold and pleasant without the astringent bite of black Tiger.

review/text: I have been purchasing this product for years, along with some of the other Coffee People extra bold flavors, such as Jet Fuel and the Organic option. For me, they are the best K Cups around for bold and deep flavor; also, the 50 count packaging is convenient. However, as the demand and popularity have been increasing, so has the price.  It, and others are no longer available for subscription as well. Therefore, I have been looking into substitutions. I still purchase 50 count Jet Fuel since the it is still available for around $30.00.

Made this an even more expensive purchase. Grunt. I must say that Amazon was really, REALLY great on another subscription purchase that was messed up in shipment. So I "complained" on packaging feedback - hopefully that works.<br /><br />(In all my years shopping Amazon, this is only the second foul-up. I love Prime and subscriptions. Yay for Amazon!)

review/text: Black Tiger was my third Coffee People flavor after trying Donut Shop and Jet Fuel. Donut Shop is a bit weak for me and Jet Fuel was too strong, so I hoped this would be the perfect strength. The strength is right on, but this flavor has an overly bitter taste that really turns me off. It is drinkable, but I think I'll be going back to Donut Shop (which is super smooth) for my next order.

review/summary: Perfect, Rich, Earthy Dark Roast
review/text: This easily moves to my top 3 favorite k-cups, along with the Puck Sumatran and Puck Columbian. This is a very fresh tasting, wonderfully smokey dark roast. For those who may not know, even though a dark roast has a stronger flavor, it has less caffeine than regular roasts as the beans are roasted longer. The aftertaste is smooth, earthy, and smokey, no bitterness at all. I'd say its the best aftertaste of any k-cup so far. Highly recommend!

review/summary: strong coffee but...
review/text: The coffee is as strong as advertised and reviewed however the grind seems to be too fine.  The commuter mug setting produces a 1/2 cup of coffee and the pod is full of water.  When used with other coffees and teas the Keurig produces the expected volumes so it's not my machine.

review/text: Black Tiger K-cup is my daily coffee. I love it.  I also like the minimized packaging.  However my latest order(box of 50)contained half Black Tiger and half Coffee People Donut Shop. Not what I ordered.  I was tempted to return the shipment, but that would have left me without my Black Tiger.  So, I'll give the Donut Shop a try, and come back and add a review.  If a mixed shipment is sent in future I'll not only return it, but seriously consider ending Amazon as my go to source for K-cups.

review/summary: Tic Tac Freshmints
review/text: I was looking for some good mints with a cheap price when I found these. About 2c per tic tac (24 packs x 37 per pack = 888 pieces / $18 = 0.02027c), it is cheaper than the Big Packs and virtually every other mint product. On the package, it said to be sold by Oct 2011, its late January 2011. (I read in another review that amazon had sold a box of tic tacs beyond the expiration date.) In the package, there are two cases, each which hold 12 5/8 oz of tic tacs, so you can keep it well organized. I tried one, and mint was powerful. Within maybe 5-10 seconds, my breath was already smelling like freshmint. In short, a solid product with a cheap price. Anyone looking for cheap strong mints should look no further than this one. This should be at the top of anyone-looking-for-mints's to buy list.

I don't use bell pepper very frequently and often it is on the spur of the moment. This solves my problem without my having to go to the store. I only use dried bell pepper in things that I am cooking. I have no idea how they'd be if you were trying to use them in a salad or something where they weren't cooked.

review/summary: ingredients are EPA registered pesticide
review/text: We have stopped buying Kellogg's Frosted Flakes because the corn in this product is an EPA registered pesticide. It is Bt GMO corn which is patented by a chemical company that genetically engineered it in a lab and turned it into an EPA registered pesticide. When corn worms bite into this corn, their stomaches explode. There are concerns about the effect these GMOs have on human health and no long term studies have been done. Kellogg's Frosted Flakes are not the same product I ate when I was growing up. I won't feed my family EPA registered genetically modified corn, or any other GMOs. The sugar they are using is from GMO sugar beet. My family loves the Nature's Path version of frosted flakes. Tastes much better and no GMO risks or pesticides.

His coat is great, he is the ideal weight (labs tend to get chunky if you're not careful), and his stools are solid. Yes, Innova is expensive, but quality food should decrease all the potential health problems (and that's where it gets really expensive) down the road.

review/summary: One of the best dry foods out there!
review/text: We put our German Shepherd on Innova when she was a puppy.  She has always flourished and her coat was gorgeous.  Our vet has always highly recommended this or the Buffalo Blue or anything that doesn't have "meal" in the top three ingredients.  She was started on Wolf Cub by her breeder and we put her on Innova as soon as we got her home.<br /><br />Our only complaint is the rate at which the price skyrocketed on the Innova.  We were forced to switch brands when it was costing upwards of $70 a bag for the food and after five years.  It was well below that until they went to the larger chain stores.  We currently have her on Chicken Soup but would love to be able to put her back on the Innova.  I'm always still looking for deals on it where ever I can.<br /><br />Any dog not only switching brands but going from a natural dog food to one more processed, or the other way around, is going to get diarrhea.<br /><br />I can't recommend Innova enough for anyone looking for a great food with not a lot of fillers and premium ingredients.

review/text: Our Golden Retriever used Innova Large Breed puppy food for a year.  We switched to this over a course of a few weeks without any issues.<br /><br />She is healthy with a nice coat being on this for 3 months.  She maintains her weight well on Innova and seems to be full whenever she gobbles down the bowl.  I agree with the reviewer who stated this is the least expensive of the best dog foods in pricing other higher end foods.<br /><br />We buy locally for $60 a bag and it seems to last awhile since its a higher quality nutrient dense food (I can update an exact time in the future).  You can spend less on a bag of food with fillers...and you probably will go through it quicker.<br /><br />It is worth the extra $$ in a healthier pet/member of our family.

review/summary: Most appreciated item in my pantry!
review/text: These single serve aseptic cartons of milk, which need no refrigeration, are just incredibly convenient to have on hand. Many trips to the store have been avoided -- saving a lot of gas and time -- when I only needed a cup or two of milk.<br /><br />A plus is that the milk is delicious, organic, and comes in lowfat 1%. Instant milk, though handy to use in recipes, never seems to mix up into a pleasantly drinkable beverage.<br /><br />My idea of coffee is 8 oz. of hot milk to 2 oz. of strong coffee, so I've used these out of my pantry multiple times at 6 a.m. when I really didn't want to go to the store just to get milk for my wake-up coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps you never run out of milk like I do, but if you do, and find yourself needing just enough for cereal, or a recipe, or for your coffee or tea, these are great to have tucked away and available. A terrific time saver!

review/text: I like shelf stable milk in my kitchen since I don't drink milk and I don't cook with it enough to buy even a half gallon at a time.  I loved the fact that when I received this in March, the expiration date was Sept 10, 2012.  Very nice to have shelf time - as one expects with the product.  Well, I just ordered this again (August 23, 2012) and the expiration date is in October 2012! I would not have bought the product with such a short expiration date if I was in the store and picked it up off the shelf myself.  I will not be buying this product again for this reason.<br /><br />Taste-wise:  I like it. When I lived/traveled overseas there were some shelf stable milks I did not like, but this one is a keeper. If only they could be consistent with expiration dates - come on at least give me 3 months of shelf life!

review/summary: A 5 Star company!
review/text: If you are looking for these little boxes of milk, definitely go with Organic Valley over Horizon.  They actually adhere to and go a bit beyond organic standards!  Your best choice is obviously to support a small local organic dairy whose cows are well cared for and grass fed, but they don't offer these little boxes for occasional needed convenience for that better diet choice when you are out.  If you are buying organic, you are a mindful consumer to some varying degree so do yourself a favor and check out the findings on the Cornucopia Institute website (sorry for no link...google and you'll get there) on organic dairy findings, then do everyone a favor and speak your mind at stores and restaurants that carry Horizon products as well as lousy store brands of organic dairy.  They are making billions off the organic consumers and you are not getting what you think you are paying for.
