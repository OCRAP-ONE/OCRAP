review/text: We got these as an office treat with a gift card we received from a client. We are all chocoholics, & love to try new brands. These got really good reviews, so we thought we would give them a try. These chocolates were....disappointing. There is nothing special about them. They taste like every other grocery store brand of chocolate. Ghirandelli has much better flavor than these do, & I can pick that up local. If I had to do over, I would have picked something else. The chocolate wasn't bad, just not as good as I thought it would be for the price.

review/summary: Love this tea!
review/text: I first found London Fruit & Herb Company Black Currant Bracer Tea at a local discount department store.  After trying it once, I immediately returned to the store and bought two more boxes.  By the time I needed more, the tea was out of stock.  Not sure where else to find it, I turned to Amazon.  Sure enough, I found a great bargain on what has become by favorite herbal tea.  I add a little honey to it, and I enjoy a nightly cup while relaxing with my Kindle before bedtime.  It has a very unique flavor, and when it's left to steep for several minutes, the flavor is very full and rich, and the aroma is wonderful.  The price at Amazon is amazing, and buying six boxes at once means I have about a four-month supply!  I have also tried the Blueberry herbal tea from London Fruit & Herb Company, and it, too, is excellent.  For herbal tea lovers, I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: These are very tasty -- like dark chocolate covered coffee beans.
review/text: These are much tastier than I expected. The nibs are small, like a fraction of a coffee bean, and covered in dark chocolate. They are crunchy like coffee beans and quite addictive. I used these, golden berries, mulberries and mango pieces to make an awesome trail mix. They should be considered candy. I like that these have more beneficial ingredients than processed candy with refined sugar. If you like chocolate covered espresso beans these are close in flavor and texture, just much smaller hence the entirely descriptive nibs. Just sounds diminutive doesn't it?

review/summary: Deliciously different little wafer cookies
review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies.

review/text: I had these cookies in Germany, but I had a hard time finding them in the US.  I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon.  They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies, but they're a little richer and a little moister.  I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.

review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

The whole wheat version of these are particularly superb with a subtly greater flavor than the original and a lovely, slightly more crumbly and grainy texture. It has been a wonderful discovery. Bon appetit.

review/summary: Great cookies--don't buy in the summer
review/text: These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive, but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

review/summary: Good with coffee
review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.

I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box.

They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.

review/text: I was very pleased with Love 'N Bake Almond Paste.  It was much smoother, more malleable, and more easily incorporated into other ingredients than the stiffer, dryer Odense almond paste I've used before.  The flavor was excellent as well.  The only negative is the packaging.  It has a pull-ring lid, so once it is opened, it cannot be resealed if all the almond paste is not used.  Not a big problem, but it would have been nice if it came with a plastic lid as well.  This is an expensive baking item, but worth the occasional splurge.

review/text: I'll admit it, I'm a bit of an almond addict.  And Love N' Bake Almond Paste is the best out there, and is simply a must have for baking almond cookies like pignolis and deeply almond flavored cakes.  It's the brand most often mentioned in cookbooks I trust, and for good reason.  If you're making a recipe that calls for almond paste, use this type, which is smooth and creamy (and good enough to be eaten right out of the can!) as opposed to grocery store brands which are drier and more crumbly.  Also, buying in this three pack saves you money over the individual price of one of these cans.

Used a recipe from King Arthur Flour.com, can of almond paste, sugar or sucralose, eggwhite, dash of salt, maybe some chocolate chips, yummo! This recipe only yields 12-15 cookies, and kind of pricey, but well worth the effort/expense. Crunchy on the outside, deliciously chewy almond inside.<br /><br />The paste needs to be cut up with a knife in smaller pieces, before putting it in a food processor, as it is thick and will bog down the processor.<br /><br />Free ship took 4 days from order date. Packaged well.<br /><br />The paste is obviously expensive, but is also very tasty. Great stuff.

review/summary: Ah, the joy
review/text: Ah, the joys of peppermint tea! Not only does it taste great and sooth the stomach, but for me it is currently working to deter a squirrel from eating my porch! I researched methods of detering squirrels and peppermint was suggested. I have sprinkled my porch with it and no more nibbling beastie--at least for now. This is a great price for this much tea, especially since I will definitely continue drinking it, but I might need to reapply it to my porch after the next rain.

review/summary: Thats a lota tea for the price!
review/text: I am not a Tea connoisseur but I have been drinking tea for about 20 years and I am happy with this product.  I mix peppermint tea in with my Yerba Mate tea and I got a nice blend.  This is a lot of tea! 2 huge bags, and for that price you cant go wrong if the product is decent.  When I opened the bag a very strong Peppermint odor came from the bag, this is a good sign.  I was not sure if the quality would be so good because of the bulk price, but I am very happy with this purchase and I will purchase it again.  People pay 3-5 dollars for a few small bags of peppermint... here you get like 50 times as much tea for the money, and thats probably not even an exaggeration, 2 huge bags.

review/summary: My eyes started watering...
review/text: Seeing the price difference between this and what the grocery store sells 4oz packs for I was realy not expecting anything near the quality and freshness I got. When I opened the package I expected the dull dusty smell of the peppermint I get at the grocery store, but on shoving my nose right into the bag to get a good whif, I had to pully my face back sputtering as the massive dose of mint hit my sinuses.  I started tea water and made my tea and the flavor was intense.  The only drawback at all is that the bags were not resealable but a few flip top mason jars later, 5 qt's stores 1 lb, I sat back to savor the excelent the mint tea.

review/summary: The best peppermint on the whole planet!
review/text: All I can say is.. WOW! I tried all kinds of peppermint before, in bags and loose, organic and not. Nothing ever came even close to this. It is SO good that you can smell even when the bags are sealed. And when you open the bags, you can feel the icy feeling in your nose when you smell it.<br />Outstanding both hot and cold. I also use it in soap making, infusing oils and then adding them to the soap. Any way you wanna use it, this is just fantastic. The price is also absolutely great. I would give a hundred stars.<br />I really hope Amazon keeps carrying this :)

review/summary: Great taste, Great aroma, Great price
review/text: I received my peppermint leaves today. Each bag measures about 15 inches tall and 12 inches wide. They come in foil bags that are not resealable. No problem ! I just transferred it to a one gallon Ziploc bags. I had to use 2 Ziploc bags for one pound of the leaves. The leaves are crushed up real fine and sort of resembles tobacco. The aroma alone is to kill for. The taste is excellent. I made tea from the leaves in my coffee pot. I added about 3 tablespoons of the leaves in the coffee maker,poured a cup, and added a teaspoon of sugar. I have a sore throat today and I could feel the coolness of the peppermint in my throat. I have sinus problems and this defiantly helped. The price is great for the amount of peppermint leaves that are received.I will be ordering more to stay stocked up for winter. This would taste excellent in a cup of cocoa on a cold winter night.

These bags are massive, and it's well worth the 15-20 dollars in comparison to how much it costs for the tea bags or to buy the little 2 oz at the herbal store.<br /><br />The tea tastes fabulous! And with so many tea leaves, you can make it as strong as you like without guilt! If you're an avid mint tea drinker, I highly encourage purchasing this product.

review/summary: I hope you like mint a LOT
review/text: I got into drinking mint infusions each morning as a substitute for coffee.  It seemed a good idea to get it in bulk, since I was paying about $3/box for 24 herbal tea bags.  (Don't re-use herbal tea bags.  Wastes water and electricity.)<br /><br />Somehow I missed that this was a 'pack of 2'.  Two 16 oz. bags of mint leaf amount to the stuffings of a sofa cushion.  Or a bed pillow, assuming you could sleep through the crackling.  To appreciate this product you should be fairly adept with a tea ball (schlepping a generous teaspoon of the mint leaves into a metal container with holes in it and dunking it all in a very hot cup of water), You also need a bit of patience (to allow it to steep 5 minutes) and a fair amount of imagination.  Then you may learn to like this infusion, and if you're really imaginative, you can even pretend it's a great wake up brew in the mornings.  Frankly, that's a stretch.<br /><br />I would not buy this product, unless you intend to make 'iced' mint herbal tea, hot herbal mint tea, mint ice cubes, and some kind of mint salve.  Otherwise I expect it will go flat or rancid, depending on just how much peppermint oil is included in that mint leaf.  Or, you could invest in a tea bag machine and make your own tea bags to sell on-line.I happen to have discovered an Amish cheese shop which markets mint tea bags by the quarter pound.  Those $3 grocery store  24 count herbal teas?  This place sells 24 bags for a buck.  Of course I did not discover that bargain until after I'd order the sofa cushion full of mint leaves. I'm thinking of making soap, candles, and sachets for Christmas gifts.

review/summary: Not just for tea
review/text: I was making fabric bags filled with flax seed and various smells to use in the microwave or freezer. I wanted a lavender bag and a peppermint/eucalyptus. After a bunch of looking around, I decided to try this one.<br /><br />When it came, I was shocked at the amount. For some reason I was expecting a couple handfuls, and got several dozen handfuls. When I was sifting through it, I noticed how fresh it looked, even dried, and the smell was wonderful. I mixed it in with the eucalyptus from the same company (and same great quality) and put that with the flax in the bag. It didn't take much to make it smell good (about a tablespoon of each per cup of flax). After being used again and again in the microwave, it still smells like it did the first day. I'm very pleased with the quality, and plan on buying only this brand in the future.<br /><br />Even the room I store it in smells fabulous.<br /><br />If looking for the same great mix, I recommend both herbs from Frontier.

review/summary: The Blue Drink
review/text: Can you believe that there are people out there who can't tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke?  And if they can, some people can't put the tang/taste to the label?  Strange.<br /><br />Long story short, I didn't drink too much soda while growing up.  I hit high school, and while many of my middle school friends discovered cigarettes, pot, and possibly armagnac (The Amber Drink), I found Pepsi.<br /><br />I became addicted to Pepsi.  I drank about three to five cans a day, with a Josta every 2 pm during my Physics class in 1996.  Crystal was a dream come true.<br /><br />* Pepsi is sweeter than Coke<br />* Even when served at the recommended 40� F, Pepsi becomes flat faster than Coke.  At sea level, Pepsi, in my opinion, is practically non-consumable.<br />* Pepsi contains 39mg of caffeine as opposed to Coke's 45mg<br />* Pepsi rivals Coke with their strange, alternative soda releases, such as Crystal Pepsi, Crystal with Citrus, Josta, Pepsi Blue, and Pepsi Holiday Spice.  None of these lasted, unfortunately (or were limited productions).  Popular flavors of this soda that continue to last are Wild Cherry Pepsi, Pepsi Twist and Pepsi Vanilla.<br />* Pepsi is less expensive than Coke<br />* Where Coke's holiday marketing is comprised mainly of St. Nicholas, Pepsi's is more apropos with their blue color: ice, winterscapes, snowflakes, and cartoony reindeer characters<br /><br />I always feel, because of Pepsi's modern (and vertical) logo on the can, like I am drinking a container of potential energy.  Like I was holding a 12 oz. consumable battery.  This sleek logo (recently aligned with a 3D-shaded red-white-blue sphere) may be an additional reason for Pepsi being America's second-favorite cola.  It is not as nostalgic as Coca-Cola's cursive logo, which hearkens back to the halcyon days of our older generation (and potential customers).

review/summary: I happen to like my caffeine cold and my cola blue
review/text: The history of soft drinks goes all the way back to the mineral water found in natural springs.  The first marketed (non-carbonated) soft drinks, made from water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, appeared in the 17th century. The first drinkable manmade glass of carbonated water was created by an Englishmen, Dr. Joseph Priestley, nine years before the Declaration of Independence.  In 1832, John Mathews invented an apparatus for making carbonated water.  The drinking of natural (or even artificial) mineral water was considered a healthy practice so American pharmacists were adding medicinal and other flavorful herbs (birch bark, sarsaparilla, fruit extracts) to unflavored beverage from their soda fountains.  Then their customers wanted to start taking the drinks home with them and thus the soft drink bottling industry was born, leading eventually to "Rock and Roller Cola Wars."<br /><br />In 1893 in New Bern, North Carolina, a young pharmacist named Caleb Bradham began experimenting with a wide variety of different soft drink concoctions that friends and patrons could try out at his drugstore soda fountain.  Five year's later the most popular formulation, known as "Brad's Drink," a combination of carbonated water, sugar, vanilla, rare oils and cola nuts, is named Pepsi-Cola and in 1902 the company was incorporated.  The product was sold with the slogan: "Exhilarating, Invigorating, Aids Digestion."  By 1995 the company's slogan was "Nothing else is a Pepsi."  PepsiCo.'s restaurant division, Tircon Global Restaurants, Inc., which includes Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, & KFC, is the largest restaurant company in the world in terms of units and second-largest in sales (go ahead and guess who is bigger and what cola they happen to sell).<br /><br />Here we have 144 fluid ounces of Pepsi Cola divided into a dozen 12 ounce cans as the "6-Pack" goes the way of the nickle bottle of Pepsi.  Today, Pepsi is a concoction of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid and natural flavors.  The high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar part has me puzzled, simply because I would think that once a corporation has a major formula they do not mess with it in any way shape or form.  So now I am wondering if the taste difference between high fructose corn syrup based Pepsi Cola and sugar based Pepsi Cola is as significant as the difference between soda fountain Pepsi Cola and Pepsi Cola in a can (the latter is better).  In addition to the 150 calories per 12 fluid ounce serving you get the following percentage daily values (based on a 2,000 calorie diet):<br /><br />Total Fat (0g) 0%<br />Sodium (35 mg) 1%<br />Potassium (10 mg)<br />Total Carbohydrates (41 g of Sugars)  14%<br />Protein (0 g) 0%<br /><br />There is also 25 mg of caffeine, a fact that is not included in the Nutrition Facts on the side of the can, which I find interesting because I know I am not alone in drinking Pepsi for the caffeine instead of the sodium or sugars.  But I also know that I like the sweeter more refreshing taste of Pepsi as compared to the competition (Bill Cosby once dismissed the idea that we wanted cola with a "sweeter" taste, but he was wrong).<br /><br />When I was in England several years ago I saw a whole bunch of ad posters in which things that were traditionally red over there, such as mailboxes and phone booths, were suddenly blue.  Of course I now know this was in anticipation of Pepsi going from white cans to blue cans.  You might wonder how much money was spent to determine that blue versus red was a better marketing position than white versus red, but when you are going up against a product whose brand name has become the generic name for cola, you need to look for every marketing opportunity.<br /><br />For most of us the history of Pepsi is found not in the can (or the bottle), but the advertising slogans.  See how far back in history you can go down this trip along memory lane: "Be Young. Have Fun. Drink Pepsi" (1993), "Choice of a New Generation" (1992), "You Got The Right One Baby" (1990), "The choice of a New Generation" (1984), "Have a Pepsi Day!" (1976), "Pepsi Generation" (1962), "Now it's Pepsi, for those who think young" (1960), "The Light Refreshment" (1953), "Bigger Drink, Better Taste" (1943), "Drink Pepsi-Cola, it will satisfy you" (1920), and "The Original Food Drink" (1906).

(I know, the natural food folks are unhappy right now.  Sorry.)  I envy all of you whose stomachs can tolerate this juice.  The problem is almost assuredly me, not the juice, as I don't deal well with cider either.  I'm giving the juice a three mostly as a warning to others who have the same tendency.

We use these in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a> and they come out great in both the "Small and Large Cup" settings.<br /><br />This is very smooth and has a very distinctive flavor that makes it a great cup of morning coffee.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
