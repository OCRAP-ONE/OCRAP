review/summary: Organic Lobster Base
review/text: I was excited at the prospect of an organic product.  I did not think that would mean substituting salt for flavor.  I used it in a recipe I have made for years and it was so salty it was inedible.  Funny, because everyone else complained about my old tried and true as being "too salty"....ha!  I gave it two stats because of their "attempt" to be healthy.

review/text: It's not great, and it's not bad. If you're looking for a healthy, clean "hole filler" to keep in your office cabinets for those days you forgot to pack enough food, or when you're looking for a little extra som'n som'n, then this might be a decent choice. Don't expect much substance as each bar is basically a tablespoon or two of sprouted nuts and seeds held together with some raisins and dates (70 calories/bar). The bars are not moist, and instead are crunchy and thin. Like I said, it's a great alternative to the vending machine, but it probably won't be your "go to" snack.

review/summary: Good for traveling and lunches
review/text: I have been buying shelf stable milk for my brother and his wife to keep in their truck. They are long haul drivers and milk can be difficult to get. Because refrigerator space is extremely limited, having shelf stable milk is the only way for them to keep a ready supply. This 16 oz bottle is a better size for them to drink than the 8 oz cartons. Enough for one person without having to open multiple cartons or having leftovers. The vanilla flavor makes it tolerable when they have to drink the milk at room temperature.

It took a little longer than I thought it should but the bottles were packaged beautifully, sealed and wrapped in a way that gave me confidence.  I love the taste of this stuff.  It's a concentrate and so, thick.  2 tablespoons into a glass of water or diet lemonade is great.  My favorite part is licking the spoon I used to measure.  Tastes like very tart and wonderful cherry pie to me, despite the fact that there is no added sugar.  I'm hoping it will help with my arthritis.

review/text: V8 Fusion is great. Servings of vegetables in a drink that tastes great is a fantastic invention. (peach-mango is by far my favorite flavor)<br /><br />The price here on amazon is either very good at times, or leaving a lot to be desired. You can pick up single bottles at a grocery store or a target/walmart for around $3 a bottle, or maybe less if they're on sale. On amazon, (I'm a subscribe & saver) the price seems to change a lot, anywhere from shipments that were in the low $2, to the higher $3's and $4's.<br /><br />In short, a great tasting drink with nutritional value, but watch the prices to make sure you're not paying too much.

review/text: I, like most other college students find it very hard to keep a balanced diet so needless to say i don't get a lot of fruits and vegetables. This drink is delicious and has really made me feel a lot healthier after drinking it for some time. There are a lot of different flavors but this one is by far my favorite. The only problem is that its hard (for me at least) to find this flavor. All of the 5 grocery near me are always ether sold out or don't have any in stock. I would not recommend buying it from Amazon however because they are overpricing it by miles. 40 some dollars for 8 bottles? if you can find this juice at Target or places like that you are far better off, its usually around 3 dollars (or less if on price cut) a bottle so if you were to buy 8 bottles it would only be 24 dollars, Amazon is charging twice the amount of what its worth. My advice would be for you to buy this drink, but buy it somewhere else.

They're not strong by any means, but we've found we can mix 2 parts of his fluoride water with 1 part v8 and he still guzzles the stuff down.  We still brush his teeth and such, but reducing 'hidden sugars' from juices is a priority.  Not sure how well the flouridated water works with V8 mixed in, but I'm supposing the flouride balance in his mouth is better than it would be without water mixed into the V8. :)  Disclosure: I'm not a dentist, just done some googling about pediatric dental issues.

review/summary: Zip-a-dee-doo-dah Hawaiian style
review/text: I strongly suspect that Peach Mango is an acquired taste, as is the POG I fell in love with in Hawaii. Mango is one of those weird fruits like rhubarb (veg?) that aren't great on their own but make everything else taste like heaven. Ever try strawberry-rhubarb pie? Run to your local Marie Callendar's and order a piece of strawberry and a piece of strawberry-rhubarb (without whipped cream, please). Suddenly you're in a different world. Even my sister-in-law who never likes anything I make, finally gave in on the strawberry-rhubarb pie. Well, mango has the same effect. Once you get used to it, you'll wonder how you ever lived life without it.<br /><br />NOTE: Do NOT order the "Light" version. All they did was put in half the amount of juice and half the amount of water. Yuck.<br /><br />Bottom line: see if you can get a small bottle or a taste sometime. But give it a couple of tries. If it doesn't work out, such is life. But don't forget to try the strawberry-rhubarb pie or cobbler.<br /><br />On the other hand, V8, which I have always liked, declares that their Fusion drinks contain one full serving of vegetables and one full serving of fruit for each 8 oz serving. I love the stuff and order it by the carton, as local drugstores and grocery stores are frequently "out" of the product. If you signed up for Amazon.com Prime, that provides free shipping for a one-year period for a fixed-fee, you won't have to worry about the shipping. This is convenient, because you never had to worry about weight. Living in the sub-suburbs, this is convenient because it allows us to buy a lot of staples and have to spend less time walking around the store. Go, Amazon!<br /><br />Here's to trying new things!<br /><br />r

review/summary: EXCELLENT drink, HORRIBLE price!
review/text: Yep, it's a great product!! My kids and husband get a serving or two of veggies with little effort. We love the strawberry banana and peach mango.<br /><br />But the price here on Amazon is ridiculous! There are tons of coupons online and in your paper, and it's on sale very often. Amazon's price today comes out to just over $5 a bottle. Two days ago, I bought ten bottles at my local Ralph's for $1.33 each (they were on sale, plus I had coupons). This sale was in California; my sister-in-law in Texas said she got them for about 70 cents a bottle. If you don't feel like taking coupons, Target's regular price for these is $2.99.<br /><br />Enjoy the drink, get your veggies, and don't spend money foolishly while doing it. You win all around!!

review/text: This is a very tasty, high quality cake. I couldn't be happier with the taste, texture, moistness, ect. I'm sure I will buy this again in the future.<br /><br />The only down side is that they cover it with plastic wrap for shipping and it pulls up on the frosting when removed and it sort of ruins the appearance of the cake.<br /><br />Over all very satisfied.

review/summary: Great flavored syrup
review/text: Really good product. I bought this after having a chipotle pineapple mojito at a local restaurant. It really gives a nice chipotle kick which helps cut the sweetness of the pineapple. If you like chipotle, you should try this syrup. It could be adapted for use in any number of drinks. Plus, it is sweetened with cane rather than refined sugar or high fructose corn syrup. That alone made it an easy purchase for me. I have used about 1/3 of one bottle in making 6 or 7 mojitos so far. I am probably a bit heavy handed with my pour on this as I like the chipotle so much and these have been made in tall glasses. So, you should be able to get at least 20-25 drinks from a bottle--more if you are lighter than me on your mix.<br /><br />Update--I like my drinks really spicy so I was tending to overpour the Monin. Two problems there: uses too much syrup and it tends towards the too sweet side. My solution was to cut back on the Monin and sprinkle a bit of chipotle chili powder in my drink. Works great that way for me.

review/text: I was happily surprised when I received this item the 2nd time.  (The first time, it was delivered with the cans crushed).  When you check the ingredients, it has one item, tomatoes.  I usually get tomato puree because they put so much salt in tomatoes, but puree usually doesn't have salt added.  However, this was much better than the watery store brand I used to buy. It's actually quite delicious and costs less than the store brand.  I used to buy Contadina puree until my store discontinued it, but I think Cento is better.  I'm amazed there aren't more serious reviews, because this is a very good item.

review/summary: Splinter Scare!
review/text: I LOVE Merrick's products. I bought the Ranger Rib and was disappointed when I made my 6 month old German Shepherd mix spit out a small and very sharp shard he chewed off. It would have been easy for that piece to cut through his intestines if he were to swallow it. Hopefully he didn't swallow any pieces while I wasn't looking; I only had my eyes off him for maybe 8 minutes before he chewed through it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this unless you watch your dog like a hawk while he/she chews it or if it's bought for a small dog that can't break off pieces easily -- there are other Merrick's bones that are much better; I bought "The Sarge" and my dog loves it!

review/summary: Splinters easily. GI vs Ranger Rib
review/text: I bought a box of these on another website. They were much larger than I expected, some pieces were much thinner than others. My dog got through most of the ranger rib within 30 minutes. She is still chewing on some of the pieces that have splintered off.<br /><br />The only worry I have is that the splintered pieces are just that. Thin, sharp, oddly shaped pieces. Even the main bulk of the bone after having split was very sharp looking. I would suggest to monitor your dog, especially if you have one that is known to not chew their food very well, or will get in a rush in the presence of another dog and swallow pieces before being well chewed. Swallowing these sharp pieces could be very dangerous and has me monitoring my dog very closely when she chews on these ranger ribs.<br /><br />I previously bought the Merrick GI bones. The bone is much thicker and does not splinter. One bone for her has lasted her (collie/hound mix) for more than a month and she has barely cracked the bone. Other breeds, her roommate the american bulldog/lab mix makes it look easier to crack the GI bone, but she practically devours the ranger rib very quickly.<br /><br />I would consider buying the ranger ribs only on a treat basis. MAYBE once a week if at that. They get eaten up way too fast. Although they are much cheaper than the GI bones, I don't believe they are worth buying if you want a bone that will last.

review/summary: Premium indeed
review/text: When brewed just so, this tea is mellow and flavorful, without any of the strange "oriental" hints of typical green teas. Made stronger, it becomes astringent, which some people prefer. The color of the brew is a beautiful amber, and the large leaves are easy to fish out with a fork so you don't need a tea ball. (although when the bag is nearly empty, there will be a lot more finely broken pieces, which I don't mind in my tea.) Leaves won't unfurl properly if the water is any cooler than just-boiled. Excellent to go with dessert, but also does quite well on its own.

review/summary: Unique Flavor
review/text: I bought this a while ago as a gift for a friend who's an avid tea drinker (particularly green tea). She loved it! I shared a cup with her and I also thought it was very tasty! It has a unique flavor and a wonderful aroma that differs from most green teas and it also re-steeps very well.

review/text: These are tomato chunks that are larger than most company's "diced" tomatoes, but a little smaller than the slices used in "stewed" tomatoes. They are packed in tomato pure. You can't beat the convenience.<br /><br />They taste like tomatoes, very good ones. I have used numerous cans, and can say that they they are not sweet, there is no metallic taste; they just taste like very good tomatoes. The one weakness is that some people will not like the added salt.

review/summary: Keep a chaser handy...
review/text: I love cookies because I'm a fatty.<br /><br />These are not cookies though, they are the cookie version of sin. Ever held sin in tangible form? Well if not these "cookies" will do the job! If cookies had a religion, these would be their anti-christ. Hitler could not make a cookie that tasted this bad and look at his cooking attempts. These things taste like you grabbed the shells of peanuts from the floor of a 1930's stadium and shoved them in your mouth with the intent of assaulting your taste buds. Have you ever wanted to assault yours or your friends taste buds? Behold the compact way of doing so! Please keep in mind that a chaser of some type of liquid is a necessity when attempting to eat these. I unfortunately did not have any present and had to man up while trying to over come these dastardly doom disks. Speaking of which, after eating one of these I was compelled to the bathroom by some satanic calling from my belly. Upon making it there I vomited profusely. For the first time in my life, the taste of vomit was welcomed. On that note, these should never be allowed near anyone whom ever was or is bulimic or anorexic as it will give them ever more incentive to vomit.<br /><br />Did you know if you threw these out the window of your car you'd be ticketed for littering? Why? Due to the simple fact that they lack a trait know as biodegradable. Bacterial could not even be bothered to touch these. I could go on and on about how bad these are, but alas I have to finish taking care of these cookies.<br /><br />I'm going to take these and have the bag, with the remainder of the cookies, laminated to seal them in forever. After doing so, I will be shipping these to NATO with the intent of having these cookies be banned from war. I will edit this post upon receiving an update from NATO about these cookies.<br /><br />Little known fact, these cookies were first made in 1986. Know what else happed in 1986? The Chernobyl disaster...yeah think about it.

review/summary: Brian, I'm going to be honest, that smells like pure gasoline.
review/text: Please do not take this review as a dare. Please heed its caution with the utmost of seriousness.<br /><br />If you come across a bag like this, do not open it. The consequences will be great, but I'll get to those later. As for proper disposal, do not let ANYONE see these, as they might be tempted into opening them, seeing the deceptive word "cookie" included in the title. You have two options, both of which require items that are difficult to obtain, but which are the only acceptable ways for destruction to ensure these ruinous abominations don't return as even worse creatures. The first is to find some thermite or a similar accelerant that can burn this at over 4000 degrees F. The second option is to use a rocket that can escape Earth's orbit; you must carefully calculate the route to the Sun so that these don't get slingshotted back to us (we cannot risk something like this).<br /><br />As for the consequences: If you've ever seen a Roland Emmerich film (Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, 2012, Godzilla, etc.) you will recall shots of people running horrified from a central location, scrambling in all futility to escape inexplicable horrors. What I've discovered from months of digging and "Deep Throat" style meetings in shady parking garages is that Emmerich adds all of the special effects in post-production, but uses these very cookies as "inspiration" for the extras in his film. Finally, you'll understand why all of the lead actors are awful (even talented actors like John Cusack), but all of the extras provide incredibly convincing performances.<br /><br />Andrew Johnson is widely regarded the worst president in US history. Imagine his remains being fermented like sauerkraut, sealed in jars, and then put into a time capsule to be unveiled by this horrendous "Joseph" character over 100 years later. The festering stink will stick with you for months. It's as if a skunk mated with sin and the scent was diabolically baked into an innocent-looking cookie.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of just 1 is that these cookies have given me the most amazing idea for a spec horror screenplay. My career as a Hollywood screenwriter will flourish due to these incomprehensibly awful monstrosities.

review/text: This stuff tasted so terrible that I had to spit it out before any more of the content permeated my poor mouth. Most people around me wouldn't take up the dare to try one because of the hamster-cage smell drifting out of the bag. The couple people who tried couldn't keep it down. Listen, it's very hard to change your lifestyle, and cookies are more than just food that's bad for you. Cookies make a person feel good, it's true. But if regular cookies have been removed from your menu, try to find something else. Anything else.

review/text: So, we've been searching aimlessly for foods my daughter, age 4, can eat with her many food allergies. She is allergic to dairy, eggs, soy, nuts, corn, rice, apples, & strawberries. And I came across a lone bag of these cookies for a whopping $1.00 at our local Big Lots, and thought i'd give em a shot. Well, best buck I ever spent on cookies, because she loves them! They don't smell bad as other reviewers have claimed, yes they are 'oatmealy', and on the crunchy side, but if I can get a 4 year old to eat them, they get two thumbs up from me! :) I just wish they were cheaper on here. But... when it's the only cookie I've been able to find that she can have and can't find anywhere else cept the joseph site... I will pay the price.

review/text: I have been eating Josephs's cookies for many years.  I am not a diabetic, but I do look for low carbohydrate desserts and sweets, and these cookies are amongst the best tasting cookies in this category.  They are fulfilling to eat unlike so many low carb sweets.  I do wish that Joseph's would make more of the soft style cookies that they use to make.  They were great.  But these crunchy style cookies are still delicious.

I was skeptical from the moment I opened the package considering they had used musty old newspaper for padding.  They refused to refund my money on the grounds that they hadn't heard complaints from any other customers, which seems like a blatant lie considering there are other reviews on here complaining about the exact same thing.  Order only if you like playing Russian roulette with candy from a dishonest seller.

review/summary: Terrible quality candy
review/text: I've had these M&Ms before and they are delicious. The bag sold by this reseller however is absolutely terrible!<br /><br />When I opened the bag, much of the color had faded from the candies. This was the first sign that they were old or expired. I tasted a few and they tasted miserable. The crisped rice center had the most horrendous after taste I've ever had from a candy. There was also a fruity flavor, which is totally creepy given that these are chocolates.<br /><br />Bottom line: DO NOT BUY THESE M&Ms FROM THIS RESELLER.

review/summary: Ok but Not really the same.
review/text: I just got these in the mail.  Sorry, but they don't taste the same.  I'm not sure why.  The ones that were<br />made here years ago tasted like regular M&Ms filled with rice crispy-like stuff.  This filling<br />is similar in texture but I don't think it is the same material.  That is disappointing.<br /><br />Yes, the bags are small.  Remember, they are coming from Germany so you are paying a<br />premium for them.  Hopefully, they'll make them again in the U. S.<br /><br />Ok on further reflection, the inside is ok.  I think it is the coating that is odd.  When I opened the bag I could smell<br />somethink like hazelnut and kind of got that flavor from the candy.  Normally I like hazelnut but NOT in these.  I hear we will<br />be getting Crispy M&M's in the U.S. sometime in 2012.  Great!<br /><br />Ok it's Aug 2012 and still no US version.  I emailed M&M but no reply so far.  I did end up eating them and have a tip.  Rub the candy shell with a kleenex before popping it in your mouth.  It helps.  Its like it has an odd-tasting oil coating it.  I think candy makers do put a top coat on for shine and whatever they use in Germany tastes different than what they use here.  Yes, its still very expensive but if you have a craving, go ahead.

review/text: Didn't realize these would actually be coming from GERMANY and that the quantity would be about half a package as the package size I used to buy in the USA. Tasted stale - perhaps because of the things they used in Germany to make the product as opposed to the great things here in the USA. I would NOT suggest you buy this if you are here in the USA. Perhaps its different in Europe, but I can't speak to that.

I opened the Lemon cookies and was reading my Kindle when something in my mouth didnt feel right.  I spit out what can only be discribed as a TAIL.  It appears to have been baked into the cookie and was hanging out of the piece I spit out of my mouth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I am a 63 year old grandmother of 3, conservative and have NEVER posted anything like this anywhere.  Heaven only knows what I ate in the cookies preceding the tail (assuming it is a rodent tail).<br /><br />Amazon is a trusted part of my life and let me tell you I am terrified to eat anything out of a package again. Beware of these cookies, obviously they have at the least a terrible quality assurance dept and NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.

review/summary: Great Tasting 2 Carb Cookie
review/text: Joseph's makes an entire line of sugar-free cookies that are just 2 carbs per cookie (about 1 1/2" in diameter).  My personal favorites on the different flavors are Lemon, Oatmeal and Almond.  All three of these are delicious, especially as a dessert while watching carbs - there is nothing in their taste that even hints at "artificial sweetener".  Other flavors are Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter (sort of bland), Pecan Shortbread (more along the line of a Pecan Sandie rather than an actual shortbread).  The cookies are delicious, but because of the size, low-carb dieters will need to have good self-discipline in order to keep the actual carb count down when eating them.
