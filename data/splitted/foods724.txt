review/text: I love Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillets. This is a great Box Meal. Just add Ground Beef and water. No other ingridents needed. This could not be easier. Everything needed to make this a great meal is in the box. The cheese is very creamy. This comes with creamy cheese and not the dry cheese found in most Boxed Meal Kits. The price is also great. Great for your family and your family will enjoy.

review/text: This dinner kit should be in everyone's pantry.  If you have this and a pound of hamburger, you'll never be caught short for a quick dinner.  Just brown your hamburger, pour in the mix and some water and you're all set.  And...did I say...it tastes really good.  The color could be more appetizing but it probably won't last on your table long enough for that to be noticed, much less a problem.

review/summary: Family approved, Mom not so much...
review/text: I do think that the creamy cheese mix that Velveeta includes is a better option than the Hamburger Helper offerings of a powdered cheese.  However, it did not increase the taste factor enough for me to contemplate five stars. I try to limit the processed food that I feed to my family so if time constraints have me picking a meal to fix along these lines taste tends to win out for me and I found it to be just ok.  My husband found it to be to his liking and my kids also seemed satisfied with the meal which is why I gave it four stars.  I personally did not find the cheese to be as tasty as it could have been.

review/summary: Cheesy!
review/text: I am a cheesy mac person, so this was right up my alley! I love the super cheesy of this product! I love the big fat noodles and it wasn't as salty as other prepackaged meals. This is always super easy and doesn't take a lot of effort if you have had a long day or it is too hot out and you want something yummy for dinner. You can always add lots of things to make it extra yummy but it does help when the cheese is perfect and aplenty in my opinion!<br /><br />I would love to find other prepared meals they have out, Velveeta knows cheese!!

review/summary: Dinner doesn't get much easier
review/text: If you're looking for something fast, easy and tasty for dinner than you need look no further - it's as simple as boiling water for pasta and cooking up some hamburg.  The creamy Velveeta sauce is really what makes this good, much more satisfying than other powder cheese sauces.  The seasoning that is included may not be to everyone's liking - I only used about 3/4 of the seasoning provided and I found it perfect for my taste - plenty of flavor.  Other people may prefer using all of the seasoning, or even less.<br /><br />Round your meal out with a salad and you can't go wrong - for a busy weeknight dinner this is perfect!

review/summary: For a "Hamburger Helper" type of meal, this IS perfection
review/text: I remember as a kid just LOVING any "Hamburger Helper" product.  Over time, my taste buds have become more refined, but I'm still willing to try a new "just add meat and water" meal.<br /><br />This one knocks it out of the ballpark on flavor and quality.  VERY cheesy, huge noodles, and great overall flavor make this THE best of the boxed dinners that I have had to-date.  A separate cheese packet is included (not the dry powdered stuff, but the squeeze-out cheese), which definitely enhances the flavor and texture while making preparation easy (no "pockets" of dry powder to deal with when blending in the cheese).<br /><br />The only downside is that it goes quickly; one box is just enough to feed my wife and I (no kids).<br /><br />Folks, if you like the boxed dinners, then I can almost guarantee this one will be a winner with you - my new favorite - enjoy!

review/summary: Simple to prepare, but a little salty
review/text: My guess is that this product will forever be compared to Hamburger Helper, and it should. It tasted much the same as the HH offering. The thing that distinguishes this product though, is the use of Velveeta Cheese in the ingredients. I love Velveeta Cheese and have since I was a kid (many moons ago). There is also a spice packet that is part of the ingredients. The product contains 900 mg of sodium, which amounts to 38% of daily values. One serving also contains 350 calories, but if this is your main dish, chances are you will eat more than one cup of this. I did like the taste however, but as I try to be more health conscious, I will not eat this very often. For a quick fix it works well.

review/summary: Convenient and tasty
review/text: This is pretty tasty if you eat this sort of thing, and I'll admit it's a rare guilty pleasure for me.  As compared to the brand that is no doubt its main competitor, I thought this one tasted better, probably because of the already mixed almost-cheese sauce that is included (which also replaces the milk that's usually added).<br /><br />It's pretty much a toss-up in terms of nutrition, given that we aren't looking at a nutritional champ to begin with here.  As prepared, this one has 350 calories per serving, the other 310.  This has 140 calories from fat, the other 110.  This one has 850 mg of sodium, the other one has 810.  The Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillet comes out slightly ahead overall, with protein of 8 g compared to the other's 3 g and dietary fiber of 1 g compared to less than a gram for the competitor.  These differences are probably attributable to the "cheese" sauce.  The sauce also pushes this one over the edge for total fat, with 9 g for this one and 0.5 for the other.  After the ground beef is added, the difference is 25% of the recommended daily amount vs. 19% (virtually none of it "good" fat in either one).<br /><br />It is significant that although both brands claim zero transfat, both also list partially hydrogenated oil as one of their ingredients, meaning they certainly do contain transfat, just less than the half-gram per serving that would require full disclosure.  If you eat the whole package - about 5 cups, so realistically with a dinner and a leftover lunch or two, you easily might - you could get whacked with as much as 2.4 g of transfat, not to mention the saturated fat in the ground beef you add to both.  At 800+ grams of sodium, you probably need to skip another meal that day to avoid going over the recommended daily value for sodium, too.  You might consider fasting that day if you plan to eat more than one serving!<br /><br />But, as I said, it's a guilty pleasure; by definition, that's not the most nutritionally sound choice that can be made.  In any case, all other things (price, availability) being equal, I will probably choose this one if I choose it again.

review/summary: Fast, Flavorful, and Easy To Fix!
review/text: I'm very familiar with Hamburger Helper, and, frankly, this beats HH hands down.  Both meals call for a pound of hamburger, to which is added a quantity of macaroni, and a sauce for flavoring.  The big difference with the Velveeta skillet dinner is that the flavoring sauce doesn't come in a powdered form.  Nope, the folks at Kraft put a nice foil packet of Velveeta cheese in with their macaroni, and that makes all the difference.  The Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillet Dinner is much richer and creamier, cooks up quickly, and paired with a nice salad, makes for a great fast dinner.  My brother and I both enjoyed it so much, we bought another box to have later on.  I let my cats lick the bowl and they loved it too!  Two paws up!

review/text: I thought this Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillets Dinner was very tasty. I like to keep quick meals like this or hamburger helper when my kids have Dance or Gymnastics and you need a quick meal. My daughter loves hamburger helper cheeseburger macaroni but she says she loves this more. I have to agree with my daughter, I don't know how they did it but it tastes like a McDonalds cheeseburger. It's weird but it's almost like you can taste a hint of ketchup, mustard, onion & pickle in it. It's quick and easy to make and it comes with a seasoning packet that you add in with the macaroni after cooking your ground beef. When it's done cooking you add the liquid cheese packet. Another thing I like about it, is you don't have to add milk, you just add 2 cups of water. It is really yummy.

review/summary: People who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like.
review/text: I don't know what Abraham Lincoln was speaking of when he said that, but it fits this Velveeta product pretty well.  If you like this sort of boxed meal, then you'll probably enjoy this, though I have to say that I think Hamburger Helper does it better.  Heck, I think you can do way better from scratch if you're so inclined, and it wouldn't be that much more difficult.<br /><br />For all the cheese product in this thing (The "seasoning" bag was filled with cheese powder, and there was a whole pouch of Velveeta to add to the finished product) the resulting meal wasn't all that cheesy-tasting.  And really, the point of this sort of meal isn't just relative cheapness or convenience, but also big flavor.  Stuff like this is as much about satisfying some kind of itch for something that tastes like it's bad for you.  That's a big part of the appeal of fast food after all.  And on that point, this product doesn't deliver what I think it ought.<br /><br />On the plus side, though, it is relatively cheap.  You'll get four to five decent-size servings out of it at between about 350 to 400 calories a serving.  Made with veggies instead of meat and both price and calorie count go down.  And you can certainly add seasonings of your own to make it more appealing.  Just don't expect big flavor as it comes out of the box.  It's just not there.  One note though: Cooking for the recommended amount of time makes the pasta really soft.  If you like yours al dente, start testing well before the 11 minute mark.<br /><br />So honestly?  I doubt I'll ever buy a box of this again.  It tasted fine; it just didn't excite me.  Meh.

review/summary: Bland
review/text: I've tried to write this review three times now, and every time I get a power blip or something happens to the browser and I lose it.  One more time.<br /><br />I made this carefully, and it is not tasty.  It has a big packet of spices that has a lot of whey, onion, and cheese and spices like black pepper are lower than an ingredient that is listed as "not more than 2%.<br /><br />I've eaten tasty mac and cheese, and I've even eaten decent hamburger helper, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ59EQ">Hamburger Helper, Cheesy Nacho, 7.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  That stuff is cheaper and tastes better.<br /><br />This stuff is easy to make.  You brown one pound of beef (I weighed it to be sure I was following directions) and then drain it (pouring out the tasty juices, I won't do that again), then add the misnamed seasoning packet and the pasta, along with two cups of water.<br /><br />Bring it to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and cook for 11-13 minutes.<br /><br />Then remove from the heat and mix in the velveeta packet.<br /><br />They suggest that you add lettuce?  Or chopped tomatoes, so I added Ro-Tel to part of it - the other part I kept pristine so that I could taste it as made.  I used hot Ro-Tel, and, other than the flavor of the Ro-Tel it was bland.  I have to think that the pasta is sort of bland and the spicing in the packet is lacking.  It could have some more onion flavor, or more than 0.5% garlic or something.<br /><br />The value in this is what I believe to be parboiled pasta that can be cooked in this fashion.<br /><br />The net weight of this stuff is 12.8 ounces - with a pound of beef, it makes 5 one cup servings.  My wife guesses that it serves three adults, or six-eight toddlers (if you were making lunch for a day care, say).<br /><br />Now, this is my suggestion:<br /><br />Suppose you buy a piece of velveeta in the store, some cream, some beef, and a little garlic powder, some onion powder, and some pasta.<br /><br />Cook a quarter pound of pasta in one pan, boiling and draining normally, and then brown a pound or two of beef with a bunch of onion and garlic powder, to taste.  In a third pan (or in the one you boiled the pasta in), grate or cube about a pound of Velveeta and heat it gently with a 2 tbsp of butter, stirring frequently until melted, then add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup cream a little at a time while stirring. Add a little white pepper and 1/8 tsp nutmeg, if you like it. Or use sour cream instead of whole cream, or put a little beef broth into the beef after it has browned.<br /><br />Now combine the cheese sauce, the pasta (use more or less to taste, the beef (please don't drain it unless you are on a low fat diet, and then do so carefully - if you have one of those old fat brushes, use that, try to save the juices).  Then add a whole can of Ro-Tel, to your family's taste, hot, mild, lime-chili, whatever.  Taste it - and if it is bland, fix it.<br /><br />Dust the top with paprika before serving it.<br /><br />This dish will taste good, and it won't take you much longer to make it than it would to start with this mix.  And if it is bland, you have only yourself to blame.  You can put more or less salt, pepper, herbs, and whatever - you don't need to use a mix to make a cheese/macaroni/beef dish.  This stuff really isn't that hard.<br /><br />Now, there is nothing wrong with Velveeta.  It melts nicely, it makes a great cheese sauce.  It usually has some flavor.  And there is nothing wrong with this stuff except that it is just tasteless, and almost anyone can do better.  Seriously, YOU can do better than this bland product.  If you like Velveeta, use it. If you don't like Velveeta, well, making it yourself allows you to make your cheese sauce from a different type of cheese.  Mexican melting cheese is good.  Heck, Sargento six cheese is great.<br /><br />If you don't want to do it yourself, save money and buy Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />I can't rate this less than 3 stars, far as I can tell, it is wholesome and it doesn't actively taste bad. It doesn't actively taste of much at all.  So it gets three stars, and a suggestion that you can do so much better by doing it yourself that you should try.<br /><br />If I had some of this stuff I had to use, I'd:<br /><br />Add a half tsp of white pepper, a half tsp of paprika, garlic powder to taste and onion powder to taste.  I might consider a knorr garlic cube.  Or Chipotle.  I would always add the Ro-Tel, this is the biggest fix you can make to this stuff. Paprika to dust the top before serving.  And, well, beef broth instead of water - that "seasoning" is really, really bland. A dollop of sour cream when you put the cheese sauce in, and a tablespoon of butter.<br /><br />Because as shipped, it is horribly bland.

review/summary: Quick, very easy, slight aftertaste
review/text: Overall, I like this new velveeta Cheesy Skillets meal. It was very fast - less than 20 minutes including browning the meat) and unlike Hamburger Helper, the Velveeta doesn't require milk. So quite simple to make in a pinch if you haven't been to the store or whatever. And the noodles are larger than the ones in the Hamburger Helper version. The only negative thing was a slight after taste for the first few bites. It was sort of a chemical tinged flavor. I was the only one of the three of us that had this for dinner that experienced that after taste sensation. It's entirely possible that it's just me, so I am only taking one star from the overall rating.

review/summary: Signature Velvety Texture
review/text: I do love a nice boxed dinner! Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Dinner is a breeze to prepare; just brown the ground beef and drain, add water and seasoning packet, simmer eleven minutes or so, stir in creamy cheese sauce and finally add any optional embellishments desired.<br /><br />The taste of the finished product alone is very good - I guess it would be fair to say I like it quite a bit better than the Hamburger Helper Cheesy Mac, which leaves a high-sodium aftertaste. I added a tomato embellishment (though using tough-skinned, yet seeded garden fresh tomatoes) and wished that I had just left it alone, although if the tomatoes were a bit better it would have been really nice, but I'll stick with the base recipe in the future. There is nothing I don't like about this product.<br /><br />Each box makes five satisfying one cup servings. I'm always good for a couple of servings and there's plenty left to share or to save for a later time. So, with the creamy, smooth texture and the velvety, rich cheesy flavor, I will most assuredly continue to buy Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Dinner. It's delicious and I look forward to having more.

review/text: I eat Kraft Mac & Cheese dinners a few times a month, sometimes the deluxe and sometimes the regular type.  I never serve them as the main entree but as a side dish & I stick to the recommended serving size.  I thought that I would really like the Cheesy Skillets as a change-up from the usual but I found the onion flavor/aroma overpowering.  Now, I'm not a big fan of onions so someone who likes Kraft's other Mac & Cheese offerings and loves onions might love this one.  It is what it is:  a quick-fix dish for those who aren't watching fat, sodium, and/or cholesterol in their diets.

Cook until the noodles are tender, then mix in the cheese sauce.  The spices that came with have a distinct chargrilled burger taste.  The cheese was very creamy and much thicker than what you would get with the mix from similar meals in a box.  I did find it to be a little salty, but I am somewhat sensitive to salt as it is.<br />I would recommend this over similar boxed meals because of the superior flavor and quality.

review/text: I didn't expect too much from this dinner-in-a-box meal and it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />I cooked the dish using ground turkey and once browned, added the water, elbow pasta, and powdered seasoning pack as instructed. Once that got thoroughly mixed and simmered for a while I added the Velveeta creamy cheese sauce, stirred, and the dinner entree was done.<br /><br />The result was something like a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese but with larger pasta, meat, and a creamier texture.  The Velveeta flavor was not as chemically cheesy/sharp as Kraft and the subtle differences in the seasoning made it more interesting than the one-note Kraft.<br /><br />If I was to do this again I would add kielbasa or sausage to add more interest.<br /><br />Overall, not bad for an "instant" dinner.

review/summary: You Can Adjust Everything To Meet Your Dietary Needs
review/text: This new Velveeta Cheesy Skillets boxed dinner was a nice surprise from the usual powdered cheesy boxed dinners. In our household, we have to watch sodium and cholesterol levels and this dinner can be tweaked to your dietary needs. For a one cup serving, there are 350 calories, 140 calories are from fat. The cholesterol has 15 mg- mostly from the cheese and some from the gound beef. The sodium is pretty high at 850 mg, but this is mainly from the spice packet and some from the cheese preservatives. The best part, is we used only a tablespoon of the spices and we lowered the cholesterol to 300 mg- a huge difference for your diet. You can use any type of gound beef, they say to use a pound, but that is way too much meat- we used 2/3 of a pound and it was perfect.<br /><br />We browned less beef- 2/3 of a pound- drained it, added the water, a tablespoon of spices and the elbow macaroni. Bring it to a boil, then simmer on a high simmer covered, stirring every couple of minutes. In about 13 minutes, when the water is gone, it's ready for the creamy Velveeta cheese packet to be mixed in and it's ready to eat. Because we used less ground beef, we also used a little less cheese. We added some sliced tomatoes and olives on the side and it was really good for a boxed dinner. It would be good with any kind of salad. The creamy Velveeta cheese made this dinner really so much better tasting than dinners with powdered cheese, and being able to control the sodium with just a little of the spices is a huge plus. Even with hardly any spices, the taste was delicious, the sodium and cholesterol low, it's quick and easy to prepare, so this will be a dinner we will definitely have again.

review/summary: It Was Alright
review/text: First, I'll say that I made this without any meat. I'm a meat-a-holic so I wanted to get the full taste of this product without being biased by the beef. My initial observation is that the amount of noodles that comes with the kit seems rather insufficient. The kit also included the silver pouch of creamy cheese that comes with other Velveeta noodle products and a small packet of seasoning (an orange-ish powder).<br /><br />The way I made this was that instead of water, I used heavy whipping cream with the cheese sauce. I only used a little of the seasoning because it seemed disproportionate to the amount the noodles in the box. I can't imagine how season-y this would taste if someone used the whole pouch.<br /><br />The taste was okay. It has a leg up on Hamburger Helper because the cheese sauce is creamy as opposed to a powder. It also seems like the noodles are larger in size than the noodles that come with Hamburger Helper. However, it's hard for me to recommend one over the other because the difference isn't that big. I can see ardent lovers of Hamburger Helper liking this just as much.

review/summary: Less than Hamburger Helper
review/text: We're used some Velveeta products in our house from time to time ranging from the boxed cheeselike form to the newer pasta mixes.  This is another of the pasta mixes they currently offer and clearly these are designed to compete with the Hamburger Helper brand that you add meat, water and sometimes butter to as well.  Since this is a competitor, it makes sense to compare them.<br /><br />Frankly this Velveeta version of the Cheeseburger variety falls far short of the Hamburger Helper version.  The steps are almost identical except for the added foil packet of Velveeta sauce that you add at the end.  I'm not sure what caused the sour taste that no one in the family liked, but since we have liked the plain boxed pastas versions before, I'm thinking it must be the seasonings packet.  Not only did this not stand up to the level of Hamburger Helper but it also fell short of the store brand of this particular variety which we've also had several times, thus the 2 instead of 3 stars I would have given it had it pleased my family as much as s the store brand.<br /><br />The final result is that the product is OK but certainly not as good a taste as other brands of this exact same variety. Since these box mixes tend to cost more than either Hamburger Helper or store brands, the value is even less.  You'd do better just adding your own ingredients to pasta and cheese you had around the house.

review/summary: My kids loved this!
review/text: Something you have to know about me is that I almost never cook or bake exactly according to directions.  I didn't with this either.  With five kids, I do my best to make meals stretch... and I do a lot of cooking from scratch.<br /><br />Some days, though, it is really, really nice to have a solid base to build on.  And that is how I used this Cheesy Skillets meal.<br /><br />I started with browning the hamburger, as per the directions, but to that I had added an onion and some chopped celery.  When it came time to add the pasta and seasonings, I added an extra handful of macaroni, and additional water.  I would have added additional water anyway because of our altitude.<br /><br />The best part was adding the cheese packet.  Not dried cheese, this was creamy and smooth.<br /><br />Because this was something I was asked to review, that is the extent of the changes I made.  Served with bread and a vegetable, this made a great meal.<br /><br />The result?  My kids loved it.  I liked it.  They requested that I definitely do this again.<br /><br />If I wasn't reviewing the product, I would have considered other additions.  Tomatoes added near the end would be great, as would a handful of fresh spinach.  If I had less ground beef around, I think a half pound of meat plus some great northern beans would be yummy.  I could see adding lots of different vegetables -- corn, peas, green beans, cauliflower, broccoli... I am quite certain those would all work.<br /><br />The best part?  This is something my teen and tween boys could easily prepare without assistance.

review/summary: Okay, If You Like This Kind of Thing
review/text: Okay, let's get one thing out of the way first. Velveeta is to American Cheese, what American Cheese is to Mild Cheddar. We're talking about a substitute for a substitute here.<br /><br />But if you're used to powdered cheese, this isn't too bad. It's not as good as a can of spray cheese, so we're certainly not talking gourmet here.<br /><br />Consider this meal to be a Hamburger Helper alternative. You don't need a bunch of stuff in your pantry. You don't need to think about gathering ingredients. You just need a pound (or so) of lean ground beef, and a skillet. The big advantage this has over Hamburger Helper is that the "cheese" (using the term loosely) is already a sauce. You don't need a quarter or half cup of milk, which is a big plus for someone like me who doesn't drink milk.<br /><br />Make sure you use very lean ground beef - 90/10 or leaner. Anything less lean, and between the oil in the "cheese", and what you aren't able to completely drain-off will make a mess of your meal. It won't look anything like the picture on the package if you do that!<br /><br />So if priced the same as Hamburger Helper, I'd pick this. But if I wasn't going to buy a Hamburger Helper-style meal to begin with, there's no reason to get this. It's just something to eat. It's not a culinary feast. (It's sure nothing you'd want to serve guests, unless you're trying to show how poor you are.)

review/text: This isn't marketed as a "health food", so I'm not going to consider nutrition, organic eating, and such issues.  Just taste . . . and I loved this stuff.<br /><br />I suppose this Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillet begs comparison with Cheeseburger Hamburger Helper (which I really like) -- so compare I must.  This product derives the cheese aspect from Velveeta rather than the powdered form found in Hamburger Helper.  Although not Wisconsin cheddar, the Velveeta definitely brings more to the party than does the powdered counterpart from the HH box.<br /><br />I like a few shakes of hot sauce in my HH, but the Velveeta Skillet comes with additional seasoning which adds much flavor (I still like a little hot sauce, but less).<br /><br />Quick and easy, of course.<br /><br />Anyway, if you've got low rent tastes like me, and you've been a fan of Cheeseburger Hamburger Helper . . . try this one out.  Good chance that you'll love it.

review/summary: "Cheesiest" is right
review/text: The first thing I noticed about this Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Dinner Kit was that the box was heavy. That was surprising, because I'm used to the less-expensive just-add-ground-meat dinner mixes. But this was the cheese sauce pouch making it so heavy. And man, is that stuff good. I could've just eaten the cheese sauce -- forget the beef and everything else!<br /><br />The kit was very easy to make, following the steps that are typical of these kinds of dinner mixes. The main difference was the addition of that cheese pouch at the very end. There's a suggestion on the box to customize it with chopped tomatoes and shredded lettuce, and I imagine chopped onions and all kinds of other stuff would be good, but I just prepared this kit straight-up, since it was for a Vine review.<br /><br />The taste was great, the macaroni noodles were nice and plump as befitting a heartier mix, it was indeed ready in about 20 minutes, and it all worked fab as not only dinner but leftovers. I was surprised that a one-cup serving has 350 calories -- yowza. But overall, very good.

review/text: Meh, not impressed. I am a huge fan of Velveeta Shells and Cheese so I thought I would really enjoy this as well. However, it didn't taste any different than your basic Hamburger Helper to me. It took about the same amount of time and simply had a packet of noodles, packet of "seasoning" (which, unfortunately, mine got punctured so it was chunky, but it dissolved during simmering) and packet of Velveeta cheese sauce. I wasn't impressed at all. I'd probably purchase whichever was cheaper if I was choosing at the grocery store.

review/text: I will admit that I was a bit skeptical that this product would be any good. People I know always made fun of Velveeta.<br /><br />Not only was the product great, but I think it is better than Hamburger Helper. It is probably the cheese that makes the difference too.<br /><br />The only thing that I found that could be better was the level of seasoning. That is, I would have rathered it be a little spicier. Of course, maybe I could have fixed that when cooking the meat. In any case, this product is way better in this regard than Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />Even if a bit more expensive than Hambuger Helper, I'd buy the Velveeta product.<br /><br />Give it a try.

review/summary: VEG-customized to Cheesy Skillets DeLITE
review/text: Adults only. Do NOT try this on kids. PG13 (pretty gross for those under age 13) when using our "customized" skillet meal. We live by nutrition labels since my second heart attack. Packaged food kits, are customized to heart-healthy. In this case, it ended with a fantastic delightful dinner. Velveeta has always been known to be tops in taste, so the concern was calories, fat, sodium, and fiber.<br /><br />It took a bit more time-but it was worth it. We replaced ground beef with 5 cups of veggies (zucchini, onion, water chestnuts, mushrooms, & Broccoli; a cup of each). They were saut&eacute;ed in place of the meat, then the Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Dinner Kit-Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac was completed as box directed. The 2 cups of water was actually the liquid drained off the water chestnuts and mushrooms, with a cup of canned tomatoes (Hunt's Diced Heart Healthy No Salt Added; Basil, Garlic & Oregano).<br /><br />The result was more than hoped for. A delicious cheesy veggie-mac meal, plenty of superb Velveeta cheese taste, crunch from the water chestnuts, and chew factor from the mushrooms. The only problem was stopping with one cup for a single serving meal, since our "customized" recipe actually ends up with 10, not 5 cups. Will power can't be boxed. That's still okay, because of the huge difference in nutrition numbers for this customized formula. We found nutrition info for the fresh veggies, and used can labels for the rest. It's not scientifically perfect, but close. We did the math.<br /><br />Nutrition facts first "as prepared on box with beef" and (customized facts), one cup serving comparison<br />calories 350  (141);<br />total fat 16g  (4.7 g);<br />cholesterol 65mg  (7.5mg);<br />sodium 900mg  (432mg);<br />carbohydrate 27g  (19.5g);<br />fiber 1g  (2.4g);<br />Protein 24g  (5.7g).<br />Per serving calories CUT 60%; fat CUT 70%; cholesterol CUT 88%; salt CUT 52%; & fiber increases 140%. That's a win/win/win/win/win and still comes with that voluptuous Velveeta taste.<br /><br />Just a customizing (as suggested on the back of the product box) for those concerned about their weight and health. Flavor and texture were not compromised. Next: Nacho Supreme with meat replacement. This is actually fun as well as delicious. Like doctoring a cake mix. There's a whole book on that. Bon appetit (enjoy YOUR meal)!<br /><br />.

review/summary: Hamburger Helpers Anonymous
review/text: I'm Mike and I really love hamburger helper.<br /><br />I have tried other "look alike" products, but few measured up to the original. But Kraft may have exceeded it with their Velveeta Ultimate skillets line.<br /><br />There are several things I like better with this product.<br /><br />One, it uses larger macaroni and they hold more cheese sauce on the inside.<br />Two is the cheese sauce itself. Not a powdered mix, but a foil-packed Velveeta cheese that you add at the end of the preparation. This also means you don't have to worry about the cheese burning during cooking, which in turn means easier clean up.<br /><br />As to cons, could use more macaroni for my taste, but that is easily added in.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent product and I will definitely be trying some other flavors as well.

review/summary: Easy to Prepare, but Salty
review/text: I'm generally not one to use this type of product, since I make most of our meals from scratch, using fresh ingredients. Still, this boxed dinner kit is a quick and easy way to get dinner on the table, for anyone who is pressed for time.<br /><br />Directions are simple: you brown 1 lb. of ground beef, add 2 cups water, the seasoning packet and pasta, cover, and cook for 11-13 minutes. Then you stir in the Velveeta cheese, and dinner's ready.<br /><br />I had a few problems with the meal.<br /><br />First problem, the recommended cooking time for the pasta, made for a too-soft consistency. Better to reduce your time by a few minutes, I think, for a more "al dente" consistency.<br /><br />Second problem, the saltiness!  Even with the addition of the very creamy Velveeta cheese, the flavor of salt was overwhelming. I don't know if I can recommend using less of the packet of "seasoning" since I don't know how that would affect consistency or flavor of the dish.<br /><br />Now, the box says this contains 850 mg of sodium. Yep, that's salty alright!<br /><br /> In any case, for a quick, once in awhile dish, this might be okay, but not unless you enjoy really salty dishes.

review/summary: Generally OK for a box meal
review/text: I didn't have high expectations for this, but it was decent for a box meal. The seasoning was good, albeit very much on the salty side. The cheese was plentiful and creamy. All in all, an OK one-skillet quick meal that takes about 20 minutes to prepare. Nowhere near as good as even the most basic scratch-made casserole, but decent if you set the benchmark as a mass-market box meal.<br /><br />The nutritional, caloric and fat components make this something you would not want to have as part of your regular diet. It's not horrible when it comes to nutrition, but there's not any bright spots either.<br /><br />The sodium content is very high -- you'll want to give this a pass if you are on a sodium restricted diet.<br /><br />I found that adding broccoli florets made the texture and flavor more interesting, and also cut down on how salty it was.

It's rich, creamy and of course very cheesy. In other words, it's delicious. :)<br />The only downside is I found it to be a bit salty. Maybe I'm hypersensitive because I don't normally eat foods that are high in sodium content. Everyone's palate is different and perhaps you may not find this to be the case at all. However, those who are  sensitive to the amount of sodium in their food, you might agree.<br /><br />Even so, I'd still recommend this product if you're looking for a quick, easy and tasty meal. The kids will probably like it. I know the adults I had taste test this thought it was good as well.

review/text: I am a big fan of easy to make skillet dinners like this one. Sometimes when you have to work, and are coming home late and don't have time to cook, you want something easy to prepare that you can serve with a side salad. The cheeseburger skilled fits the bill. It was easy to prepare, quick, and was in general a crowd pleaser. My father and mother both liked the taste very much. My sister said it was a bit salty... And I felt it tasted a bit pickly for my taste. I don't much care for pickles on burgers, and there is a sweet, salty pickle taste that really made it taste like cheeseburger, but I felt kind of ruined the flavor. I prefer my pickles not on my burgers.<br /><br />Still, this is bound to please those who like the taste of a McDonald's cheeseburger with all the toppings. That is exactly what it tastes like. I just can't rate it that high, because for me the taste was ok, but nothing I would find myself craving.

It was a nice box-meal but there was nothing distinct about it.  The amount of noodles provided were inadequate as well.  The ultimate cheeseburger mac tasted like every other cheesy-mac that I have tasted. The use of Velveeta cheese made the cheese taste smoother to the palate but other than that it is the same.  If you have a particular affinity for Velveeta cheese and like mac and hamburger then this would be the purchase for you.  The directions were easy to follow, the only ingredients you need to add are water and ground hamburger.  It is a simple easy meal to prepare.

review/text: I have only found a few gluten free crackers I like, this IS NOT one of them. I purchased these at Sam's Club, much cheaper. These crackers were hard, not crunchy, almost seemed stale. The first bite didn't taste too bad but they left an awful, odd after-taste, similar to burned grain. The texture wasn't too bad, not the usual prepackaged gluten-free grainy texture. My husband went Gluten-Free when I had to, he almost almost anything and he doesn't like them either. We tried them plain, with cream cheese, with cream cheese/olives, in salad, with cheddar cheese, nacho cheese but nothing would conceal the after-taste, in my opinion they were Horrible! I would say it is just my taste buds but...I not 1 of my 5 kids, 4 of which will eat pretty much anything, liked these. We offered them to friends, family, and neighbors but after trying them no one would take them. It could be possible that we purchased a bad batch, there were 2 packages in the box, but I don't think we want to chance buying and wasting another box. After reading some of the other reviews it appears many people love them, I guess you never know unless you try them. We hated to toss them in the trash so we occasionally used them as dog treats, the dogs did like them.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: With Tahitian vanilla and a great name (Beanilla), I had high expectations for this product. Alas, it doesn't taste like vanilla and barely even smells like vanilla.  It smells like cheap candy:  a sickening starchy sweetness, almost like Play-Doh mixed with confectioner's sugar, with a hint of McDonald's vanilla shake.  The product melts in your mouth (good), but tastes like sweet powdered clay.<br /><br />I keep the Beanilla in my cupboard and retry it periodically, hoping that my taste buds were off in the past.  But, whether sprinkled on coffee (the main reason I purchased the product) or mixed into icecream, the product is gross.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm not using it as intended or am not thinking of it the correct way.  If you think of it as a powdered creamer like Coffee-Mate (and you like Coffee-Mate), you might like it in coffee.  It might also be better in baked goods (on the label it recommends using the product for "frosting, sauces, puddings, and other recipes as a substitute for vanilla extract").  Liquid vanilla extract contains alcohol and slightly thins what you're making -- I see an advantage in using a powdered vanilla if you want to avoid these characteristics.<br /><br />I'm giving the product a chance and want to like it, but it's the most artificial tasting real vanilla I've had.  I purchased the 12oz. version.  If you think you'd like to try it, I'd advise trying the 4 oz version first.<br /><br />Ingredients on the Label:  "Dextrose, Silicon Dioxide, Vanilla Bean Extractives"<br /><br />I recommended "Authentic Foods Vanilla Powder," also sold here on Amazon for a more genuine vanilla taste.  It's made with:  "Natural Vanilla Bean Extractives, Evaporated Cane Juice, Silica, Cellulose."  I like this for icecream and for coffee drinks.<br /><br />You might also use Raw Vanilla Bean Powder, which is expensive at triple to quadruple the price, but it contains only vanilla.

review/summary: Vanilla Flavor but very gritty
review/text: I bought this based on some of the reviews at Amazon indicating this product was more organic/authentic and the other products were not "true" vanilla as they weren't "brown" in color and were dextrose based. My idea was to replicate the vanilla used at Starbucks, however I couldn't find this brand (now I know that it is made by cooks). I use this powder in coffee, however because the method of manufacturer is by spraying liquid vanilla on silica oxide (basically inert sand) then ground up and sold as a powder you never really get the sand out of the food. In my coffee, the last couple of inches of liquid in my cup are usually a gritty taste (basically sand) so I never get to fully drink all my coffee. For that reason I am giving it a low rating. I would suggest getting of the other brands which maybe are less organic but will taste just the same and won't have this gritty feeling.

review/text: I love teas with mint, so I decided to give this one a try. Its really good and refreshing but the mint flavor isn't as strong as I would like to be. Not saying that it should be overbearing, but I had to question whether or not mint was even in the tea. All in all, its a good tea.

review/summary: Excellent Flavor
review/text: I wasn't a tea drinker until I developed ulcers and wasn't able to drink coffee for a few months. I bought this tea on Amazon and am so happy that I did. This is my favorite tea in my cupboard (and I have tons since I wanted to learn really quick what I liked). The mint flavor is mild and doesn't hide the flavor of the green tea. I drink about 3 cups of this a day and don't tire of the flavor. I like it far more than the comparable Tazo flavor, which is not normal since normally I prefer Tazo to Lipton.<br /><br />When I get close to finishing off the tea I have now, I think I'll order this on a subscription and save 15%

review/text: This is the best green tea I have run across, cause they say we got a drink it, you know? It has a fresh mild taste, but does not have that grassy taste like you're drinking something that was part of your lawn. Therefore you can drink a bunch of these through the day without upsetting your stomach like with coffee. I think the instant hot water makes it taste better than tea bags in the microwave. A box shows up really fast UPS if you have Prime Shipping. Good stuff.

review/text: I used to use Bigelows green tea in tea bags. After purchasing  a Keurick Kcup machine I finally found their Kcups on Amazon . For me this tea is just right at 12 oz. If I want it a little stronger I just cut back on water. A little squirt of lime juice makes it perfect. I receive my orders from Amazon fast, as I have 2day shipping. I will continue to use Amazon and Bigelow tea in future.

Green tea is also very beneficial to your health (cancer fighting agents).  For the Keurig machine, I recommend doing the small cup- to get all of the flavor.  When I chose a medium cup, a lot of the tea seasoning was lost.  We go through this stuff like candy in our office YUM YUM YUM :)

review/text: I am a fairly sophisticated tea drinker and I prefer good Taiwanese green tea (which is 100 times better than tea from China).  This particular k-cup is o.k. but it is more of a Japanese green tea like flavor (darker green).  If you like a good cup of Japanese tea then this is o.k.  I have not found any good k-cup green tea but again even these are much better than Lipton.

review/summary: Is the cost justified????
review/text: I have been using the Bigelow Green Tea Bags with my Keurig machine.  Bigelow Green Tea Bags provide great taste.  And when you buy in quanity with the subscribe and save option the cost is a fraction of the cost for the Bigelow Green Tea K-Cups.  I use the Keurig machine solely to get the hot water to brew the tea.  I have not tried the K-Cup Bigelow Green Tea, but I am wondering if the taste using the K-Cups justifies the much greater cost?  I am giving a 3 rating since I do not think the cost would be justifed to use the K-Cups in comparison the the Bigelow Green Tea Bags.  I welcome feedback from individuals who have tried the Bigelow Green Tea and the Bigelow Green Tea K-Cups.<br />Please read my updated comment.  I tried the K-Cup Variety and found no difference in taste between the K-Cup and tea bag variety.

review/summary: These taste awful!
review/text: I bought some of these from a vending machine at my work today. I want my quarter back. I tasted a red one. It tasted like how horse manure smells. I have no clue why they'd call these Lotsa Sours when they aren't sour in any way shape or form. I thought maybe one of the other flavors would be better. I was wrong. The green one had a slight hint of possibly a different fruit flavor, but it was still overshadowed by that same much stronger flavor remeniscent of roadapples. I handed the rest over to my boyfriend who eats anything including old leftovers rescued out of the garbage. Even he thinks they taste terrible.<br /><br />$45 spent on buying these in bulk is $45 spent on something you'll probably be spending the rest of your life trying to get rid of. Just taste them before you buy them, and you will know precisely what I mean.

review/text: These are simply the best little snack cracker I've ever tasted, and wonderful holders for toppings of anything you choose--fish, cheese, salsa, etc. (Only slightly less delightful is the wasabi cracker--not enough "bite" for me, but still great.)<br /><br />Like most of us, I need to watch what I eat so I can maintain my weight. I think the flavors in this cracker are better than any I've ever tasted of this genre (although I still like cheese-nips and rye crisp--other animals, so to speak), and they really fill me up at snack time.<br /><br />Warning: do not leave outside or rodents come and open the plastic to get to these gems! (I have used them, the spilled leftovers, successfully in a mousetrap--they aren't as dumb as we think!)<br /><br />Unless I find something tastier, these will be in my pantry forever! Please try them. Worst that can happen is that everyone BUT you will love them, but I'm fairly confident that if you like nori, you will LOVE these crispy treats! Not too hard to bite into, few if any crumbs, and, satisfaction-wise, 100% better than any rice cake cocoction to cross my lips. I wish I could give them 10 stars!

review/text: I'm from Buffalo where Pfeiffer originated and I've been eating it my whole life.  I was disappointed when they stopped carrying it in our local grocery stores a few months ago.  I seriously called every grocery store within 20 miles.  I was ready to call the company and try to order it through them.  I was so happy when I found it on Amazon, although, I was a little weirded out ordering food via the internet.  Everything is fine though, there was nothing wrong with it and it's best buy date is not for about 7 months.  The only problem is the price, I used to pay $1.50 per bottle but with shipping it equaled out to more than $5.00 per bottle.  It's worth it.

review/text: Pfeiffer French salad dressing is absolutely the best. I don't eat salads much because the acid in most dressings tends to wilt the greens before I'm finished. When on a diet, I have "Monster" salads with hard boiled eggs, tomatoes, turkey, Cheddar cheese and pretzels (For crunch).  Worried about calories? Use half Peiffer and half Salsa.  I'm sure a doctor would not endorse this kind of diet, but I lost 60 pounds in 8 months.<br /><br />So why are Peiffer products so hard to find?

review/summary: Pretty darn close...
review/text: Be aware that this review regards Stagg's "Classic" style chili, as they make several varieties. We prefer the "Silverado" style, but Stagg made the labels so close we bought the wrong one. So we made the best of it, and it's not bad, but... the first thing you notice is the difference in how much grease has congealed to the top of the can, which is fairly considerable. If you like your chili greasy, scrape it off of the lid and dump it in. If you have heart concerns and/or for whatever reason do not want enough grease to free-up your average M-16 jam, just throw that lid away. Stagg Chili is still the best game in a can, but the "Silverado" is far and away the best, "Classic" comes in a fading second. More flavor than Hormel (same company owns both, but apparently does not make both in the same facility), but every bit as much grease. It may also be worthy of note that when our local Sam's Club gave us a (typical and by now anticipated) ration of BS (half-answers, 'get-back-to-ya's' and outright lies) about why they weren't going to carry our chili anymore, we gave Amazon a shot. We not only got our chili for about the same price, but also got it delivered to our door. If we can regularly make the same progress with the rest of our shopping list, it's finally "C-ya" to the Sam's Club BS for $36/year and hello 30 minutes on the computer and done.

I chose chili for hubby's lunches and chili baked potatoes for dinner, and this chili did not disappoint! Yummy!

review/text: I would go so far as to say this chili is better than mine by a long shot and I can't believe it is made by the Hormel Company.<br /><br />They used to sell it at Safeway Stores and now sadly you can only buy it online.<br /><br />What a tragedy because this chili is the best you'll ever eat bar none.

review/summary: Lentils are terrific - Price is a JOKE it's so highj
review/text: From the time we discovered this product 2 or 3 years ago at a local store (Costco) we loved the product.  Then discovered Amazon, and the Tasty Bite Lentils was one of their Subscribe & Save items, allowing us to set up a purchase schedule and receive a 15% discount and free shipping, making the full purchase price around $26.<br /><br />Then, earlier this year Amazon removed it from the Subscribe and Save and the prices went completely nuts.  The lowest price on Amazon is now close to $37, and believe it or not, you can pay as much as $89 on Amazon for the identical package!  Is that crazy??<br /><br />Costco stocks it regularly in their stores for $6.99 for a package of 4 10oz envelopes.  So for 12 envelopes (the same ones that you can buy here for $37), you can purchase 3 boxes of 4 at Costco for $21.  That is 44% Cheaper than Amazon, I won't bother to compare with the $89 price on the linked product!  Make up your own mind.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R9L4M">Tasty Bite Madras Lentils Entree, Heat & Eat, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Madras Lentils a good side dish
review/text: I've been eating various Indian retorted veggie entrees for a while now -- we use them as side dishes when I cook main dishes that may be, but aren't always, Indian. The Madras Lentils remind me a lot of really good Louisiana Red Beans (as in Red Beans & Rice--with or without sausage). Very flavorful and actually a bit meaty in taste. I first encountered them at Trader Joe's but it seems that they are going over to their own labels and they wouldn't admit that they were using TastyBite (see someone else's review of Punjabi Eggplant)so I'll stick with the original. I've also tried, and liked, the Punjabi Eggplant.

review/summary: A low-cal alternative to chili
review/text: I must reiterate what another reviewer said.  Tasty Bite Madras lentils do taste an awful lot like beef chili, a perfect alternative for those who love chili but want a vegetarian alternative.  They also have a similar mouth feel and a nice hearty spiciness.  What they do not have is a lot of excess calories.  One can eat the whole pouch (2 servings worth) and only ingest a mere 240 calories.  That can't be beat!

review/summary: Nice spices - add rice to make a hearty meal
review/text: Madras Lentils are my #2 favorite Tasty Bite entree. Compared to some of the others, it's a little more soupy; I add one GoGo Organic Brown Rice bowl to the mix and put it all in the microwave together for a very filling, very satisfying meal. It does rank on the medium spicy range so if you are averse to a little heat with your meal I would suggest one of the other more benign Tasty Bite meals (such as Agras Peas and Greens). I like that the sodium content is not too high (34% of the RDV if you consume the entire packet yourself) and that the taste is so interesting and complex, given that it is an "instant" item. A friend who hails from south India tried this at my urging and was absolutely delighted by it - she and her Morrocan husband both really enjoyed it and went on Amazon to buy their own stash! I whole-heartedly endorse this particular meal on the merits of its simplicity, too - no crazy preservatives or chemical ingredients.<br /><br />As with many other Amazon offerings, the price they give is not entirely representative of a good deal - the Tasty Bite website offers 1 package for $1.99 each. Where you make out well is when you combine the purchase of several with free shipping here on Amazon and the occasional sale.<br /><br />One last note of caution - be careful of a bit of splatter when opening the vacuum sealed pouch for the first time.

review/summary: Mmmm...mmmmm.....Madras Lentils!!!
review/text: While visiting my family, my sister gave me a bunch of food, and shoved a box of madras lentils in my hands. Indian food is good and all, but I was never a big fan of beans. I went ahead and took it anyway. One night I had nothing in my cupboard, so I went ahead and gave it a try. Boy was I glad that actually I had. As soon as I took my first bite I was flabbergasted that I was actually eating beans--and loving every bite of it. It has just the right amount of spices. It's so creamy and scrumptious. Tasty bite is quite a good description of how delicious this meal truly is. If you like Indian food and lentils, I would recommend this dish. You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy this. This Indian food does not mess around. Hell, it tastes better than meals I've tried at authentic Indian restaurants. Buy it! You won't regret it.

review/summary: One of the best of the Tasty Bite meals - Nutrition Information
review/text: The Madras Lentils may dethrone <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5DKLM">Tasty Bite Entree, Punjab Eggplant, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> as my favorite Tasty Bite meal.  Just finished eating it for dinner and it was perfect for the winter storm weather because it tastes exactly like chili.  I served it over a little rice to soak up the excess gravy and topped it with fresh chopped jalape&ntilde;o and a dab of sour cream with corn tortilla chips to eat with it.  Yummy!  Instead of serving it over rice, you could also add some leftover beans or lentils of any kind.<br /><br />The flavor is excellent and the lentils and red beans retain their texture.  I have finally figured out that Tasty Bite does a passable job with beans and lentils as opposed to softer vegetables that end up mushy and flavorless and swimming in sweet sauce.<br /><br />Also, Tasty Bite has finally moved towards eliminating the cardboard boxes that the flexible retort pouches have been packaged in, saving trees and lots of energy in package production and shipping.

review/summary: Makes a great base for lentils and beans!
review/text: I bought this because the picture looks great and I wanted to eat more lentil and bean based dishes.  On its own I think its just ok but it does make a great base when you add additional lentils and kidney beans it also increases the serving size substantially and makes it worth the price. I saute a 1/4 cup of chopped red onion with 1 chopped garlic clove and 1 tablespoon of olive oil until the onion is tender.  Then I add 2 cups of water and bring it to a boil. I reduce the heat and add a pinch of salt and 3/4 cup of French lentils. Cook the lentils until just tender and stir in 1 can of drained kidney beans plus 1 Tbsp  butter and the contents of the package. Heat thoroughly.  You can add vegetable broth or water to adjust the consistency. Tastes great as a soup or side dish and is great with salmon and adds some variety to my meals.

review/text: This is now one of my favorites.  Had it for lunch as a soup.  I do think that the Tasty Bite portions are on the small size for claiming two servings (unless you're serving it with other food items) but they're always just the right amount to fill me up.  This one in particular I found to be extremely filling.  Tastes just like a mildly spicy beef chili without the beef.  Tofu and an extra can of kidney beans stirred into the mix could easily make this a filling meal for four.

review/summary: Tasty Bite Madras Lentils are in fact tasty!
review/text: With my daughters decision to eat vegetarian, it has become a small struggle to find healthy, filling foods to stock in the pantry for her after school.<br /><br />We recently had the chance to sample <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R9L4M">Tasty Bite Entree, Madras Lentils, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> and I was very surprised at how good it was. Unlike my daughter I do not normally care for any type of Indian cuisine, but I liked this. It can be best described as a meatless chili, but with better flavor and texture than most vegetarian chili. It also had a nice level of heat to it.  Enough to notice, but not enough to be unpleasant.<br /><br />Serving suggestions were to use as a filling for tacos or over basmati rice. So far my daughter prefers to just eat it by itself.<br /><br />Now that we have found Tasty Bite brand products, my daughter is looking forward to trying out some others.  I think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R9L3I">Tasty Bite Entree, Kashmir Spinach, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> will probably be next.

review/summary: Great office food, tasty for what it is
review/text: I buy these all the time.<br /><br />It's GREAT for office food. I heat up a container of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPRNGS">Annie Chun's Rice Express Sprouted Brown Rice, 6.3-Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 6)</a>, combine it with the contents of the Madras Lentils in a deep microwaveable bowl, give it 2 more minutes in the microwave and I've got a hot tasty filling filling, low fat high fiber meal (filling enough in fact that I often end up eating 1/2 and saving the rest for later). Both of these products require NO refrigeration so they are perfect for keeping around the office, at ~$5.50/meal if you eat it all at once, $2.75 if you split it between two meals.<br /><br />I also eat it at home.<br /><br />From a Weight watchers standpoint, the rice and the lentals add up to 10 points total, but like I said its filling enough for 2 meals.<br /><br />I will say, this is Indian food Lite, as in its processed food, and the spicing is mild. But it's very tasty

review/text: We were at Costco one day and they had a sample table set up with these.  We tried them and really liked them and so did our two year old, who is a fairly picky eater.  So we bought a box and now I wish I had gotten more!  I have eaten them straight, over baked potatoes, and tonight mixed with some sauteed chicken over a bed of peas and brown rice.  It took me all of ten minutes to cook (the chicken was cut into bites and the rice was instant).  We are going next week to Costco and stocking way up.  I would buy them here, but this is not a good price at all.

My husband likes it too, and he's not big on vegetarian meals.<br /><br />90 seconds in the microwave is perfect.  It doesn't seem like there are two servings in the pouch, but we poured it over slices of homemade bread, and it was very filling.  I'm looking forward to trying out more Tasty Bite flavors.

review/text: I really like this product a LOT, and though for my taste it is a bit too spicy. I consider  this is my BEST "find" for this year!  I keep this stocked in my pantry all year-round!  I find this product is a great base for a very nourishing meal shortcut.  So, if you're not into spicy food like me, use two of the packets as a base and add one 14 oz. container of chicken stock, add a cup of cut potatoes (I use the plain Ore Ida hash brown cubed potatoes from the frozen food section of the market) and add one small can of kidney beans and finely chopped carrots and celery and slow simmer for about 45 minutes (or use a fuzzy logic rice cooker on the soup setting if you have one) and you'll have an incredibly easy & hearty meal good for 2 large or 4 smaller bowls.  Add to it a loaf of crusty bread, some wine, and Fontina or other favorite cheese and you'll be healthfully well-fed!
