review/summary: Just like Nonna used to make!
review/text: I love the Cucina Antica sauce.  They don't add any sugar and pump it full of chemicals and preservatives.  The Tomato Basil is hands down my favorite.  It is just like my Nonna (Italian grandma) used to make.  I am a huge fan of all of their sauces and especially love these 16 oz jars.  They make my life easier when I don't need a lot of sauce.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I am WOW'ed by this mix! As much as I love latkes, I hate making them from scratch and therefore don't make them often. I tried boxed mixes before (something German from the "ethnic food" aisle at the grocery store and Swedish one from IKEA), but was not impressed. I am glad I stumbled upon this at Amazon and decided to give it a try (the price was right!): it tastes just like homemade and can be whipped up in no time at all! All you need is 2 eggs, some water and oil (to fry).<br /><br />Having had less than pleasant experience with boxed potato pancake mixes before I was a little skeptical (and the boxes looked so small!), but Manischewitz potato pancake mix exceeded my expectations. One box was enough to feed our family of five (two adults and three kids) as a main dish (would definitely feed more people if served as a side or an appetizer). The flavor and amount of salt was just right, and we were able to get the desired textures: I love mine superthin - almost lacy - and crispy, while my husband likes his on a thicker/softer side, both turned out wonderful and absolutely delicious!<br /><br />Now that Amazon's price had dropped a little more, I will be definitely re-ordering!<br />Great product. Solid 5 stars from our family!

SO FOR MY MOM, I BREAK IT UP IN THE MAJIC BULLET AND ADD APPLESAUCE OR MAPLE SYRUP AND BLEND AND REWARM IN THE MICROWAVE.  THE POTATO PANCAKE TASTE IS STILL EVIDENT THAT SHE RECOGNIZES IT FOR SURE.  I DON'T LIKE WASTING FOOD SO BEING CREATIVE IS A PART OF MY COOKING HERE.  I HAVE ALSO MASHED UP THE POTATO CAKES AND PUT IN WITH REGULAR POTATO SOUP FOR A DIFFERENT FLAVOR......ADD SOME CHIVES, PARSLEY AND WE LIKE IT.

I accidentally bought the caffinated bags but gave them to my cousin and immediately reordered decaf.

review/summary: Tasty and filling, but not low calorie if eaten as a lunch
review/text: This is a tasty sweet-ginger curry with chick peas and a few chunks of potato. The sweetness comes from the chick peas themselves, smartly brought out by the spices chosen.  The texture of the vegetables is surprisingly good - modestly firm, not an unrecognizable mush.  Unlike most prepackaged meals, I don't mind it cold, though it only takes two minutes in the microwave.<br /><br />Each package has 480 calories, which is rather incredible for just 10 ounces of Indian food with no ghee or paneer.  In fairness, it is high in fiber and protein and low in bad fats, so it is probably an ideal choice for skinny vegans/vegetarians.  But for those like me that eat plenty of dairy and meat but are trying to keep a few meals light but flavorful and filling, there are better options, particularly the Dal Bukara (340 calories) and Rajma Masala (270) by the same maker and several options from MTR or Tasty Bite.<br /><br />ETA: I understand it's technically 2.3 servings, but my original review was geared in terms of a quick office lunch, which is how I most often consume shelf-stable foods like this.  For me (tall male), 10 ounces of food is about what I expect for lunch.  So I still eat this, but usually as an addition to a family meal with a couple of other dishes and rice.  In that context, I full endorse the recommendation of other commenters to heat with a can of regular chickpeas (drained), ideally after sauteing a bit of garlic or onion.  The flavor spreads nicely, plus it's a bit healthier and cheaper that way.

review/summary: Very tasty, good quality, Too much salt
review/text: I recently ordered a whole bunch of Kitchens of India 6-packs from amazon during a sale.  This is my first dish from this company so I cannot compare it to others yet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very nice combination of flavors, accurate texture similar to making it fresh<br />-10oz serving for just over a buck-fifty, very reasonable for prepackaged food of any quality<br />-No processed ingredients at all, a major plus<br />-You will actually be able to tell what ingredients you're consuming (again, nice texture)<br />-One packet (2.3 servings) on some rice makes a great meal at about 470 calories + rice<br />-about 19 grams protein per package (2.3 servings), 10 grams fiber, 26 grams of fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />-about 1900mg sodium per package (2.3 servings)!!  This about ruins this dish for me, and I'm afraid of the other products that are still in the mail<br />-Tastes far too salty (you will notice the 2 grams of salt in there!)Do not add salt to your rice when cooking, when this dish is diluted by the rice it is consumable.  It is very unfortunate they added so much salt, could not decide if 3 or 4 stars is appropriate (5 stars without the excess sodium).  Perhaps they did this for preservation.

review/summary: An Outstanding Curry But Comes at a Cost...
review/text: I must say this is easily my favorite of the Kitchens of India [KoI], Ready to Eat curries that they offer.  The Pindi Chana, chick pea curry takes virtually no time to make.  Either empty the pouch into a pan and heat for 3 minutes; microwave the contents in a bowl (I prefer mine over rice), or just heat the package up in boiling water for about 3-5 minutes dig in without needing a container.  It is an easy, fast meal that tastes delicious!<br /><br />Speaking of taste, the Pindi Chana comes across as a flavorful curry that seems so simple yet can be very complex.  There is a mild ginger flavor to this curry that goes really well with the chick peas and potatoes inside.  The spices are perfectly balanced and do not overpower the flavor of the chick peas, while having a slight spicy after taste.  There is a lot going on with this curry but it comes together really well to produce an outstanding dish that is ready for you in less than 5 minutes!<br /><br />I would gladly give this curry 5 stars in a heart beat but what brings this curry down to 4 stars is actually the Salt and Fat content.  While this curry doesn't taste very salty at all(probably because I eat it over rice), it packs about 830mg per serving of salt and 10g of Fat.  10oz of this delicious curry will cost you over 20g of fat and almost 2 grams of salt; plus around 500 calories just for the entire packet alone (not including any sides).  Of course this delicious curry is worth it, but I personally portion the packet out usually into 2 servings.  For the price you get two fast meals that taste excellent.<br /><br />5 star quality taste, but overall 4 stars due to less than stellar nutritional value....<br /><br />* Nutritional Information ** (Entire packet)<br />Each packet is 10oz (285g) and contains a little less than THREE Servings (~2.5 servings).

review/summary: It IS low in Calories! And Delicious!
review/text: Absolutely delicious. I prefer this over the chicken curry and butter chicken packages because all a few minutes on the stove prepares this as compared to ~20 with those other ones. This thing is low in calories. I don't know what the review who got the best rated review is say. If you look at the box its only 210 calories per serving. Even if you eat the whole box that 525. I made this for lunch one day with rice and ate it throughout the day for approximately 900 calories. Not too shabby from lunch onward. However, it is indeed pretty fatty as stated by that individual. Anyway, back to the product. It does have a little kick to it but I happen to add ticed tomatoes and spinach to give myself some veggies and I've noticed it helps reduce the heat if that's a problem for anyone. Also good enough to eat on its own as a soup. Highly recommend and it actually looks like restaurant curry compared to the chicken packages I mentioned above.

review/summary: When Used As A Base, It's Great!
review/text: I bought a package of this product at the store, being it was my first time trying it. Because the sodium content is high, I decided to thin it out by adding  a can of low sodium garbanzo beans (chick peas) that I rinsed/drained. I also sauteed an onion and about 6 smaller cloves of garlic, before adding the package, and extra beans.  I would think if a person eats it this way, the sodium content is not as bad; plus, it about doubles the serving size!<br />Tomorrows left-overs will be combined with my favorite brown rice ("Mekong" by Lotus Foods) to make it a complete meal!<br /><br />Those that love curry, or are vegetarian should really enjoy this!

review/summary: One of my favorite store-bought Indian pouches
review/text: I think this one has the best flavor of the Kitchens of India choices. It has a spicy kick to it, but it's not overwhelming. The chick peas are tender and the hunks of potato and bamboo (?) are a nice accent. Overall, this goes great with some basmati rice. The only drawback is this is not one of their healthier items they sell. It doesn't have that much saturated fat in comparison, but it is higher calorie, probably in part because it has a lot of protein (and fiber!) I've never ordered chick peas curry (or whatever you wish to call it) in a restaurant so I cannot compare, but this is a good. The pouch is super-convenient.

review/summary: A fav in our house!
review/text: While I often cook different types of curry from scratch, sometimes we need something quick and easy. These chickpeas became a favorite quick meal in our house. My husband and I will split it and pair it with some basmati or brown rice. Sometimes I even throw in some chicken short cuts that I have on hand. The sodium is high, but if you aren't regularly eating sodium laden foods then once in awhile shouldn't be that big of a deal. I don't think it is overpoweringly spicy, but then again my husband and I love spicy foods so it probably doesn't make me a good judge of the spice level. I think it does take an adventurous palette, as do many things, but I would recommend that it is at least worth a try. I think the price on Amazon is good too, ~$2.66 a box whereas in the grocery store I have paid $3.50-$3.99. Will be ordering from Amazon in the future!

review/text: This is a really nice product. Not too spicy, but with very good flavor. You can warm it up and eat it as it is, right out of the package, or pour it over rice or couscous and make more of a meal out of it. My son even liked it! (and that says a lot, LOL)

review/summary: The Curry Tastes Okay, Everything quick, but...Nothing Special
review/text: I am a single guy in his mid-20's and I buy Kitchens of India curry because it is a tremendously quick, easy dinner idea.  The taste of the curry is about on par with Chili con Carne from the can and is of relatively the same quality.  Nothing to give five stars over as for the price it is not even that good of a deal.  This item, in my opinion, is extremely over-hyped.  Don't get me wrong, not a bad food option, just not a five-star food product.

review/summary: Not half bad, and super convenient
review/text: I recently tried the KoI Chick Pea Curry after being impressed with their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  With the Butter Chicken, you have to add chicken and some other ingredients (i.e. water, butter), but with this Chickpea curry it's all inclusive in a pouch - simply squeeze the pasty contents of the pouch into a pan and heat up for a few minutes.  I served over couscous, not sure how authentic that is but it was pretty  good.<br /><br />The nutritional info says one pouch contains 2.5 servings but in my opinion it's only enough to feed one, and even then I'd want some rice or something with it.  It's high in sodium, but unfortunately so are most packaged foods.  I'm normally a big meat eater and even though this is a vegetarian dish I still found it substantial enough for a quick dinner.<br /><br />My only complaint is I'd say it is a little bit mushy, but overall it's not bad and for the convenience it's tough to beat.  Because it's so easy to prepare requiring no outside ingredients and with a shelf live of over 2 years, not only is this a good quick/convenient food option but stocking a few in the pantry in case of emergency (i.e. as part of hurricane preparedness stash depending on where you live) wouldn't be a bad idea as long as you have a way to heat it, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PUR5E">Coleman PefectFlow 1-Burner Stove</a>, although I'm sure you could eat it cold if necessary - and the pouch packaging is much smaller and lighter than canned food.

review/summary: they emptied out the salt mine into this
review/text: One word: SPICY. If you don't love spicy food, don't even have a taste of this. Why? Because it tastes damn good and you will want to eat the whole pouch and then your mouth will be on fire (and in the future your brain will remember "tasty" over "spicy" and you will make this same mistake a second time). The packet says 2.5 servings, but who are they kidding? (I guess if you're cooking for two adults and one child.) The only reason they say that is because the entire pouch *exceeds* the USDA's upper limit for sodium. Ouch. Honestly, I don't even remember it tasting overly salty. At least it's vegan.

review/summary: Just had this for lunch - FANTASTIC!
review/text: I purchased my Kitchens of India "Pindi Chana" from a local supermarket.  I have been buying this at $3.99 a pouch locally and decided on a whim to check if Amazon carried this.  I am elated that this is available, Prime shipping eligible, and in multi-packs.<br /><br />I have been eating this for years.  I just finished my Pindi Chana for my lunch and it was FANTASTIC.  I must say that if you do not like Spicy foods and if you do not like SPICY HOT foods, then you will not like this meal.  I, however, LOVE spicy and spicy hot meals and this is seasoned perfectly for me.<br /><br />I absolutely love Indian Cuisine with my favorite being Punjabi style.  This is really excellent for a pre-packed meal and tastes like my favorite fine Indian restaurant.<br /><br />If you are one who likes well spiced foods but not spicy hot, I would steer you to Kitchens of India's Red Bean Curry as it is spiced nicely but no heat.<br /><br />This is definitely a vegetarian dish but this meal is not always vegan as it is sometimes made with ghee instead of the sunflower oil.  In my local Indian restaurant, this is vegetarian not vegan.

review/text: This curry is nice and spicy - really a convenient tasty meal on it's own, or (slightly less convenient) combined with some rice.  Packaging is a bit inconvenient for stacking in the pantry, but it wouldn't stop me from buying more.  The consistency of the potatoes, chick peas, etc is pretty good (not real mushy).  Also the ingredients are vegan, although the package does say processed in a facility that also processes milk.

review/text: This is my first taste of the Kitchens of India RTE products, but I'm very happy (I've had other KoI products, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>).  The chickpeas are cooked very well, neither hard nor mushy, and the curry gravy is very flavorful.  I'm impressed that they actually use real, natural ingredients.  You will find an occasional piece of ginger in there showing you this isn't as industrial as the vacuum foil pouch packaging makes it seem.<br /><br />It's more "medium" than "mild" if you're used to typical American Indian restaurant food.  If you love the taste of chickpeas, you may be a bit disappointed, because the curry gravy does overpower the taste of them a little.

Amazon's having a special on the TASTY BITE meals, which average to over a little under $2.00 a piece. Even though I will not be buying any more Kitchen of India ready to eat meals, I do like their lamb and butter chicken pastes.

review/summary: Chickpea Curry doesn't Chicken Out
review/text: Kitchens of India's "Pindi Chana (Chickpea Curry)" was an unexpected surprise. I'm not a fan of garbanzo beans by any means. They have a funky flavor,and I like them best when they're incognito as felafels or hummus. Garbanzos must be seen and not tasted. Kitchens of India succeeds. The tomato sauce is SO SPICY that one can't taste the garbanzo beans. At all. The chickpeas serve as the canvas,the supporting player,while the spicy sauce gets top billing. Indeed,they act like movie extras,which is how it ought to be.<br /><br />It was SO SPICY (there should be a warning label) I should've paired it with rice,or a dollop of yogurt.<br /><br />To put the topping on the curry,so to speak,it comes with a CD of Indian classical music. It's a duet between Ustad Liyaqat Khan (on sarangi) and Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya (on santoor). It's sublime and sensual. This is the sort of easy listening music that 96.5 KOIT should be playing.. it's THAT good. Great music, great food-a sublime combination! All ready-made Indian meals should be this great.

review/summary: Tastes Great but will Kill your Sooner
review/text: All of the Kitchens of India products (and in fairness all ready to eat Indian Curries) are loaded with sodium. This particular product has over 800 mg per serving. Each packet is supposed to serve two! I eat one pack as a single person. I have read several people who claim to eat the entire package individually. In effect you are ingesting ~1650 mg of sodium with a single package. The latest recommended FDA sodium levels have been reduced to 1500 mg per daily to avoid heart issues apart from other potential issues. While this product does taste great and is good for busy single people who cannot spend time cooking, it is going to kill you sooner than otherwise. So enjoy the taste as long as you are willing to die sooner as well....

I tried the syrup first in a protein drink (vanilla) and it was excellent.  I've tried the Torani SF English Toffee syrup and like the DaVinci better.  The pump works well with the glass bottle, and 4 pumps in 12 oz. of vanilla protein drink seems optimal.  I've found in the past that when using a pump in the plastic bottle, when the liquid gets down a couple of inches, just the slight compression of picking up the bottle can cause it to send liquid up and out of the pump.

review/summary: Our Kid Liked it Fine
review/text: As a woman perusing the candy aisle said to me just yesterday, "When did licorice stop being black?"  Sure enough, all of the choices on the shelves were red and had one so-called fruit flavor or another.  Apparently, black licorice has joined muscle cars and drive-in theaters as mostly a memory.<br /><br />It's hard to miss the old stuff when the new stuff tastes as good as this, though!  I shared this package with four people, three of whom are avowed licorice fans.  One had to be strong-armed into trying it because she's from the black licorice camp, but in the end, even the youngest among us liked it.  The tangy flavor sets it apart from the usual very sweet red licorice, and we did like knowing both that it was organic and that it supports the Newman's Own charity recipients.  It also has a somewhat softer chew than the usual twists and the preferences were split, with some thinking this was an improvement and some not.<br /><br />And, as I go to post this review, I see that Newman's Own makes - you guessed it, black licorice!

review/text: This tastes like real licorice candy, with a pleasant dash of real pomegranate. It has the right texture, starting out chewy and slowly melting and releasing flavor. While it is candy, not health food, the ingredients are more food and less junk than most candy.<br /><br />My kids didn't like it and I suspect yours won't either. It does not have the intense artificial flavors of more processed candy, and the complex textures are more appealing to adult tastes. No one will pig out on a whole package of these, they are candies to savor. You could serve them after a good dinner with fruit, cheese, nuts and dessert wine without shame (unless your guests see the package, I suggest cutting the sticks into shorter pieces for additional deception).<br /><br />Since I no longer take chocolate GORP on my hikes for health reasons, I tried short pieces of various flavors of this with raw almonds instead. I won't say it delivers the ecstasy of the original, it satisfies both tongue and stomach.

review/text: The Newman's Own line generates some decent food products at reasonable prices.  This one, however, wasn't one of our favorites.  The "licorice" is a bit sticky, and left a sticky residue on our children's fingers.  The pieces are also relatively short.<br /><br />We do eat pomegranates from time to time.  This doesn't really taste strongly of fresh pomegranate.  The initial taste is reminiscent of a sweet-tart apple/pomegranate with berry, but the aftertaste is a little off.  Don't get me wrong.  It's not horrible or anything.  It just doesn't really live up to what we've come to expect from the Newman's Own brand.

review/summary: Great licorice!
review/text: I always have a little licorice every now and then to tide me over that starting hunger just before a regular meal. Most often I would do this at work and it has benefited me in a way that I do not overeat during a regular meal. Since I lift weights and do cardio, my system of eating incorporates several small portion eatings to keep my metabolism running and in check. I found that eating licorice works wondersand I have shifted to eating organic and sugar free licorice to maximize the health potentials. When the Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists came to Vine, I felt I go to have and I haven't regretted it. The pomegranate variety is among my favorites because of the health factors you get from the Pomegranate fruit. This variety though contains corn syrup so I advise you to eat this in moderation. As you very well know, corn syrup plays a huge factor in just about everything we eat nowadays and recent studies proved overabundance of this ingredient is not healthy. So moderation in eating this or any other licorice for that matter is highly recommended. Overall satisfied with the product.

review/summary: Awesome stuff!
review/text: This licorice is really good! I took it to work and everyone agreed it was really good stuff. A few things I gotta add though... I am not a fan of pomegranate. But I really liked this. I was very surprised that it tasted so good.<br /><br />Also, this stuff was delivered to my house during the hottest weather week of the year - we even came close to setting a record. I did not get a chance to check my mail for a few days, so it sat in the outside mailbox, in >105F degree heat for a day or so. I expected it to be a big lump of licorice.<br /><br />Newman's apparently has the recipe down just perfectly for dealing with temperature - none of it was stuck together at all. (I bet you never expected to read a 'torture test' in a candy review, did you?)<br /><br />So, would I buy it again? You bet I would. Can't wait to try out the other flavors.

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: I grew up eating Red Vines and I liked them very much, but it's been ages and ages since I've eaten licorice. I don't why, I do eat candy on occasion, but licorice I just stopped eating, until last week when I tried these. They do kind of remind me of Red Vines. The flavor is different, of course, then I remember. These are pomegranate flavored, but it's been ages and ages plus years since I've eaten a pomegranate, so I can't swear that they've gotten the flavor right, but that being said, these are very tasty.

review/summary: Great for the movies or in a martini
review/text: I'm not a big licorice fan, but I do like Paul Newman's food products and pomegranate, so I gave these a try. They have a nice pomegranate flavor, and they are not too chewy as licorice can sometimes be. I like that they are made with organic sugar and wheat flour, and the size is smaller than the usual licorice.<br /><br />I think they'd be perfect in a pomegranate cocktail, like a martini. It would make a festive swizzle stick. They'd also be great to stick in your purse on your way to see a movie. I have to admit that they are addictive too; the serving size is 5 pieces, and  that seems about right to satisfy the candy craving.<br /><br />Licorice lovers should definitely give these a try; they are a worthy addition to the Paul Newman organic family of products.

review/summary: 50 bucks for licorice?!
review/text: I ate six of these right off the bat. Delicious but not overly sweet, with only a hint of pomegranate that tastes more like conventional cherry licorice. These are delightfully chewy (and my bridgework is still well intact). I certainly would like to try the other flavors, but finding just a single package at retail would probably be quite pricey. (One 5-oz. package contains eighteen 4-3/8-inch "twisted" sticks.)<br /><br />According the the package, these are made in Mexico and certified to be organic by Oregon Tilth. Ingredients include corn syrup--but not the high fructose type.

review/text: Okay, but I don't think I'd buy it if I saw it in the store, natural ingredients or not. However, for those of you who are into licorice, this does taste like licorice, not the licorice I'm used to, there is a hint of something else, pomegranate they say, but I couldn't tell. And I'm wondering if Paul Newman were still with us, if this would be branded Newman's own.

review/summary: Crazy Expensive
review/text: I really wanted to like this product.  I usually like "Newman's Own" items. . . and I really like licorice. . . and I really like pomegranate.  But this item fell short.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Texture.  Chewy just the way you want it.<br />Organic<br /><br />Con's:<br />Cost. I know that prices go up-and-down on Amazon. .  but right now the price is CRAZY expensive for a 5oz package.<br />Pomegranate?  Really?  I was in hopes of a real good pomegranate flavor, but it just didn't come through for me.  But I must admit when I eat "red" licorice I don't think it has much of a strawberry flavor either. . . if that's what it's supposed to be.<br /><br />Overall the product is fine. . . but I wouldn't buy it again. . . I would like to try some of the other flavors though, like tangerine.

review/summary: My Son Pick Newman's Own over Red Vines
review/text: So to the ultimate licorice test. I gave my son one of these sticks and a Red Vine. The Red Vine was longer, so he grabbed it first. It was redder two. After he gobbled it down, he gobbled down Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice Twist.<br /><br />I went and sat down and waited. There was a pack of each of these on the kitchen counter, by the sink. He asked could he have more licorice and I said yes. He went for Newmen's own. Nuff said.

review/summary: A healthy version of the red "vines"...but...
review/text: I only got a 5 oz. packet of these (~20 of their 6 in. sticks) and gave them out to the crew at home, so it was a small sample...but we all agreed on the following pluses and minuses:<br />+ healthy ingredients...what you'd expect from Newman's Own...especially when compared to the commercial versions<br />+ nice color, obtained naturally...NO food dye!<br />- a bit too waxy for our tastes (as compared to other licorices, like "Panda" Brand)<br />- a bit chewy for our teeth...not very filling-friendly<br />So, overall, we have a mediocre response to these. If you really love swizzler-type candy, these might be a healthy alternative...but if you are craving a meatier kind of licorice, try some of the other brands (one example already cited above).<br />Thanks for reading!

review/text: We really like Newman's Own products.  We also like these.  But the taste is not consistent.  It starts out nice, and you can taste the pomegranate, but as it sits in the mouth, it begins to taste like cough syrup a bit.  Just enough to be slightly off-putting.  Overall, good product, but not one you will want to buy multiple packs of.

review/summary: Differing opinions
review/text: I have to say, I'm generally not a big fan of organic food. Especially since the taste of organic food can sometimes leave a lot to be desired.  Another drawback is that organic food is, in general, much more expensive than regular. But I have to say, these licorice sticks were a pleasant surprise. They weren't overly sweet and they have a very strong fruit taste. I enjoyed them a lot and would consider buying them in the store. However, I gave a piece to my mom and she said it was "terrible." She said it had a really nasty aftertaste. This isn't your run-of-the-mill licorice. However, I think this is one of those foods that either you love them or you hate them. Based on the other reviews I read of this product, there doesn't seem to be much in between. I would definitely be interested in sampling other flavors of this licorice.

review/text: I've never been a fan of black licorice but find myself enjoying a package of Red Vines every so often - but they MUST be chewy. So imagine my joy happening across this new treat from Newman's Own and having my first bite having the required "chew" without having to let the package stand out in the open for a few days.<br /><br />Yummmmmy. A whole new way to enjoy licorice with a healthful "kick" of tangy pomegranate to stave off the guilt of indulging in some delightfully chewy and delicious candy treats.<br /><br />I'll be sneaking these babies into the movies from now on.

review/summary: Newman's Pomegranate Licorice tasts natural - not artificial
review/text: I shared this package with several work colleagues who have nearly finished off the package as I write this review.  We all agreed the taste is a bit cut above the other popular red licorice vines.  It has a taste somewhere in between the health food store licorice brands, which use all natural ingredients and that other popular red licorice product.  The ingredients list seems to be largely organic and include actual pomegranate juice in the ingredients list. The one oddity is the mix of both sugar AND corn syrup.  It might be nicer to exlude the corn syrup from an otherwise all-natural natural product (I know, I know - corn syrup is natural, etc.  But a lot of people - me included - avoid it.)  Overall, it's flavorful and darn near addictive.  Another hit from Newman's Own, a company you can feel good about supporting.

review/summary: Sweet, tangy licorice
review/text: Although I try to eat healthily, I am a big fan of all kinds of candy, which I try to reserve for an occasional treat. Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists are a nice compromise--sweet, but not filled with a lot of chemicals. For example, there are eleven ingredients in the Newman's Own Licorice, while Twizzlers has a list of ingredients too long to count.<br /><br />Newman's Own Licorice is shorter in length than typical licorice, and come in a much smaller package. The ingredients are not totally organic, and corn syrup is the third ingredient (it's the first ingredient in Twizzlers). The Newman's Own Licorice is made in Mexico, which is a drawback for me, I prefer my candy to be made in the US, the quality is usually better.<br /><br />The best part of Newman's licorice is the flavor, it is a clear, strong pomegranate. It is really refreshing for a candy to taste like the flavor it's supposed to be instead of being just sweet with no specific taste profile. Two or three of these twists are enough for a snack, which I suspect is because the flavor is so good. The back of the package says that strawberry, tangerine, and black Newman's Own Licorice is available, which I will definitely look for and try.

I know what all the ingredients in these Licorice Twists do for one's body including the Elderberry Extract and the Pomegranate Juice.<br />3.

But now you know, here's the scoop. These twists may become my new before-bed snack. I can eat just one and only consume about twenty calories and go to bed happy and yes, feeling virtuous. So in spite of my aversion to anything that sticks to my teeth, I love them and have even become a fan of the last ingredient on the list, Licorice Root Extract.

review/summary: Nice candy, flavorful and toothsome, but maybe not quite so Green
review/text: Newman's Own (Organics) Pomegranite Licorice is a red chewey twisty stick (tube) candy of the sort that most of us remember.  It's sealed in a multilayer plastic-and-foil wrapper, which may lessen its appeal to the sustainable-use folks.<br /><br />The aroma and flavor are clear and memorable.  Had I not known that this was pomegranite-flavored, I might have labelled it black cherry, but pomegranite it is.  It was just chewey enough to resist the tooth pleasantly.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is much as expected, except that the sugar and starch sources are described as "organic" (except for the corn syrup, which follows flour and sugar, but precedes tapioca starch).  The glycerin is listed as "vegetable glycerin" and the package bears one of the familiar Kosher markings, along with the designation PAREVE.<br /><br />This package is marked BEST IF USED BEFORE MAR 11 2012.  I don't know the date of manufacture, but the package says it was made in Mexico and certified organic by Oregon Tilth.<br /><br />So ... this is the familiar candy of your childhood, only a little bit better, or a lot better if you enjoy the aroma first.  There were a generous 18 pieces in the package I received.  They call it "about 3 and one half servings" but I think it could be five or six, even though the sticks are shorter than the candy store variety and maybe a little thinner.<br /><br />I'm taking a star off for advertising it as "organic" (which it is) while sealing it (for good reason) in a foil-and-plastic multilayer pouch.

Only 3 out of 9 ingredients are organic (didn't count citric acid and natural flavor as an ingredient).<br /><br />I've tried Twizzlers before and Newman's licorice is way better. In general I am not a licorice person, on top of that whole package is 455 calories, I think I'd prefer M&Ms as a snack (small package 250 calories). But if someone likes this kind of treat than this is the way to go.

review/summary: Pomegranate licorice takes some getting used to
review/text: I love pomegranate flavor, so when this came up as a Vine option, I jumped at it.  I got it a few days later, quickly opened it, took a bite, and then stopped.  Wow - this was weird.  I wasn't sure if I liked it.  I took another bite.  Hmm.  Still weird, but not bad.  Last bite (they're short)... I'll need another one to be sure.  Three more later, I've decided to like them.  They are kind of like salt & vinegar chips - odd at first, but addicting.<br /><br />The texture is perfect - soft and chewy, not so chewy that you're afraid of your crowns coming out.  I suspect if you leave them exposed to air for long enough, they'll dry out and get hard to bite, but after 3 days of an open package (clipped closed)the texture is still good.<br /><br />There are no artificial colors (or flavors), so the deep red must come from the elderberry extract and pomegranate juice concentrate.  Cool.  There are actually 2 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber in a 5-piece serving, and only 1/2 gram of fat.  At 130 calories, it's not exactly guilt free, but the guilt can be rationalized.<br /><br />I like that these are mostly organic - less toxins to dump in the environment when they grow the wheat & sugar.  I like that you can get this on subscribe & save.  I do that for a lot of things.  There are 15 smallish packages (about 18 pieces per package) so they stay fresh.  Twizzlers might be a lot cheaper, but this is a LOT better.  Newman's Own licorice ingredients start with organic wheat flour.  Twizzlers start with corn syrup and contain artificial colors and flavors and there's slightly more fat & calories and no fiber.<br /><br />I'm just not sure I need 15 packages of candy at my house.

review/summary: Good Licorice Flavor
review/text: For a true licorice lover, these are certainly worth a try.  The pomegranate flavor bursts at the first bite and then subsides toa  tasty licorice finish.  The twists are a bit chewy, but not in the obnoxious way.  This allows for a fuller taste of all the flavors in the twist and not just the before or after, but also the in between slide from fruitiness to licorice tang.  Overall, an interesting take on a traditional treat.  I liked it.

review/summary: Naturally GOOD!
review/text: It's so nice to come across an all natural product that really tastes good! I am a huge Black licorice fan so the flavored stix are not usually my thing. These actually do have licorice root extract in them which many black licorice products don't even have, so technically this is real licorice. The bag is 5 ounces and 3.5 servings, each twisted stick is approx 4.5'' long and 5 of them are only 130 calories and just 10 grams of sugar. There is also 2g of protein and 2g of fiber go figure. The flavor is pomegranate/berry  it is flavored with both Pomegranate and elderberry. I like this product and I don't feel like I need to punish myself for snarfing down a 5 stick serving, there is nothing bad in this product. I will try the other flavors too.  Darn, my bag is empty!

review/summary: Firm, chewy, fruity licorice
review/text: Reviewing food is tough -- I didn't like these as much as I had hoped I would, but if they're to your taste, go for them.<br /><br />The box I got had 16 or so 6-inch licorice ropes.  Each piece was firmer and chewier than I expected, but pleasant to eat.  The licorice had a very fruity smell and a sweet, slightly waxy, pomegranate flavor.  It's a Newman's Own product, so the ingredients are organic, and some money goes to charity.<br /><br />If you're intrigued by the idea of a firm, pomegranate licorice, go for it.

review/summary: Paul Newman had nothing to do with this but it's still good
review/text: Licorice is a funny sort of treat, both humble and old-fashioned, and perhaps more relevant than ever in an ever more obese world obsessed with counting calories.  Pomegranate is an interesting choice of flavor; the pomegranate too steps forth from the fringes of fruit consciousness as from the pages of myth, its recent 15 minutes of fame as a super-antioxidant notwithstanding.  I like licorice and I like pomegranates, but I was a bit skeptical that the pomegranate's intense dusky flavor would make a good match.  I'm still not sure--not because this licorice isn't sweet and delicious (it is!), but because I'm not sure it's really fair to say this licorice is pomegranate flavored.  Yes, there is some pomegranate in it, but it's lower on the ingredient list than elderberry.  And sure enough, there is a definite undertone--or is it an overtone?--of the somehow dark, musky sweetness that makes elderberry so distinct.  I happen to love elderberries, so for me this is a happy coincidence.  Whatever your taste may be, it does seem as though the folks at Newman's Own use good ingredients and care about the quality and flavor of their products.  I did notice an odd almost minty sensation at times which is why I give only 4 stars.  More concentrated flavor would have been nice too, but overall a great snack--good flavor, good texture.

review/summary: Not health food, but a delicious candy
review/text: Newman's Own is well known as an innovative company - innovative in their products and innovative in their corporate giving. This interesting snack is a "red licorice" candy that has a deliciously sweet pomegranate taste. It's made with all organic ingredients, including pomegranate juice concentrate.<br /><br />I liked it a lot. Yes, it's candy with five pieces containing 32 grams of carbs(!), so it's not health-food. But nonetheless it is a delicious candy!<br /><br />(Review of Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists)

review/summary: Great Taste
review/text: I really like this Licorice.<br /><br />It has a great flavor.<br /><br />Does it taste like Pomegranate?<br /><br />I don't really know what a pomegranate is supposed to taste like, so can't really answer if that's the flavor I'm tasting.<br /><br />But if you're looking for a licorice with a nice berry flavor that doesn't turn your tongue colors, this is it.<br /><br />I also like that it's from Newman's Own.  I always purchase their products as I know it's going towards charity.

review/summary: Good alternative to Twizzlers
review/text: These are really pretty good. My husband and I both tried them and he loves them. I feel like they have a bit more of a chewy texture than Twizzlers, which is why I gave it 4 stars. However, the flavor is great! Also, the product is made with some organic ingredients (wheat flour, sugar, and tapioca syrup) makes me feel good about it. The pieces are much shorter than Twizzlers, so they make a nice quick snack if you just want one. Overall, a very yummy snack with good flavor, but a bit on the chewy side.

review/summary: Good, though a little subtle on the Pomegranate flavor...
review/text: Got a chance to try these Newman's Own Organic Pomegranate Licorice Twists and I have to say that I enjoyed them, but I didn't love 'em.  I've never been a huge fan of the "red" licorices, finding them a bit bland and much more plastic-y than your standard black anise licorice, and these certainly fall into that camp.  I was expecting more of  a burst of pomegranate flavor, but it's rather subtle unless you really keep it in your mouth and savor it.  Actually the flavor builds with the more you eat, and you taste it more on the back end as an aftertaste.

review/summary: Tasty and Great Old Fashioned Licorice!
review/text: Based on my previous great experience with Newman's Own products, I got the Pomegranate Licorice.  Opening the package treats you to a wonderful aroma.  The licorice itself has a beautiful rich color and is made from cane sugar and tastes like real licorice unlike some which are more waxy and tough and lacking authentic flavor.  This is tender and tasty and a real treat.  The package is just the right size for a snack.  Glad I got them!  Now excuse me I need to get back to chomping licorice.

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists
review/text: I love licorice!  I was not so sure that was going to be the case<br />with a POMEGRANATE licorice...but, it WAS!  I just loved this!<br />I am not a consumer of pomegranates usually...so not really sure<br />what I could expect.  This to me had almost a berry flavor to it.<br />It was chewy and the shorter sticks are nice as you can HAVE that<br />treat and not go crazy and eat 1/2 of the package.  Really I can<br />not say anything bad about these...many of the ingredients are<br />organic too.  If you are going to purchase candy THIS is a good<br />one to get...plus the added great feeling of knowing that the<br />"Newman's Own" are supporting charities with their profits.

review/text: This was surprisingly delicious!  I'm not a big licorice eater but this licorice had a good taste and aroma, and was very satisfyingly chewy.  It's not overly sweet, but just sweet enough for a nice treat.

review/summary: Red licorice that actually has some taste.
review/text: I like to have licorice twists sitting around for an occasional snack. I tend to prefer red. But the problem with the typical red twist is that it has no taste, really.  A vague cherry flavor, perhaps, but predominantly just a sugary taste and a super gummy texture.  In contrast, these pomegranate twists have some flavor. They are tart and tasty and have a substantial feel to them when you take a bite.  The package says that they are made with organic sugar. Makes no difference to me, but some people might care.

review/summary: Tastes good, not too artificial tasting
review/text: I don't have any idea what organic licorice is, but I do know that these strips are pretty tasty. Moreover, they do not have as strong of an artificial taste as Twizzler's. I'd buy them if I had the chance. The pomegranate flavor is good, not tart, just sweet enough. And the proceeds are donated, so what the heck....

review/summary: Eat This, Not That (for old time flavor)
review/text: Do you remember old time, penny candy licorice in flavors like strawberry, and black, and cherry?<br /><br />I do.  We used to get them 5 for 1 cent at the drugstore on the corner. Ate 'em up, loved them.<br /><br />In later years, I tried to substitute those old flavors with a supermarket brand of licorice that (Twi**Elers), in a strawberry flavor.  Pure sugar with that. And some kind of "gum" for chewiness.<br /><br />Let me tell you, as someone old enough to remember real licorice-- these licorice twists, in POMEGRANATE, from Newman's Own Organics, are as chewy, tasty, juicy, and real tasting as candy gets. Takes me right back to the penny candy drugstore.<br /><br />Now, I know, these days, people want carb counts, calories, sugar, etc. So, here's some of that:<br /><br />sugars: 10g<br />carbs:  32g<br />calories: 5 pieces, 130 calories<br /><br />Hey, I'm not your doctor. I'm reviewing a candy. And it tastes GOOD. For those with real health issues with sugar, etc., I recommend reading the ingredients  (see package) in the grocery store. For anyone else who just wants a nice, great tasting, old fashioned treat, get these, and enjoy yourself!

review/summary: Great snack- perfect for your sweet tooth
review/text: I didn't have high expectations when I received this product.  "Healthy" forms of candy and treats are often disappointing-- but this one is not!  It has a great texture and a slightly sour-sweet taste that is refreshing and enjoyable.  Your sweet tooth will be satisfied without an overload of sugar.  It's much better than the regular candy versions of licorice.  I have to admit that I'm not sure I could have identified the flavor specifically as pomegranate-- so if you're worried about not liking an unusual flavor like that, don't.  It just tastes great!  By the way, this candy holds up in all sorts of heat without getting sticky or messy (mine was sitting in a metal mailbox in the Texas summer heat and survived just fine) so I think it would be safe to hand to children without too much worry of sticky hands or other messes.  All the healthy aspects-- low fat, organic sugar-- well that's just a bonus.  Excellent product-- I'm looking forward to trying more Newman's Own licorice products soon.

review/summary: More pomegranate than licorice - an energizing snack
review/text: I was expecting some black licorice with a pomegranate flavor.  I grew up not far from Pontefract in Yorkshire where licorice was a treat for those who couldn't afford chocolate, so I love the black chewy Pomfret cakes and I like to chew real licorice roots. Black licorice is typically made with treacle or molasses, but this like American red licorice with a fruitier, less sweet flavor.<br /><br />On the plus side, it is good and chewy if you keep it in the fridge. To me, it tastes better than red licorice because it is not as sweet and has a delightful taste of pomegranate.<br /><br />On the minus side, I wish there were more licorice flavor. This might be a boon to those who don't like licorice, as I couldn't taste the licorice root extract.<br /><br />The main ingredients are organic wheat flour and organic sugar.  There's even a tiny bit of sunflower oil in the ingredients, above elderberry extract, citric acid, natural flavor (not sure what the flavor is?), pomegranate juice concentrate and last & least licorice root extract.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable candy, good for a hike where you need that little bit of extra sugar.  There are 130 calories in 5 pieces, the bag says it has 3.5 servings (I think there were nearer 4), but still that is 455 calories a bag.<br /><br />For me, I'd like less sweetening and more licorice to make this a truly great snack. I'd also like the texture to be a bit more glazed and springy - like gummy bears, maybe substitute gelatine for flour.
