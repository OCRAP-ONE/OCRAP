review/summary: Always the go-to chew in our house
review/text: I have a very aggressive 5 month old chewer.  This scenario is new to me, because my other dogs have never had the "need" to constantly chew.  I tried many, many different types of remedies.  Bully sticks are wonderful, but expensive, horribly smelly and don't last more than 20 minutes at best.  I've tried other brands of rawhide and have been disappointed in the light, airy texture and rapid fire disappearance.  I have tried deer antlers.  They are wonderful, but don't hold the attention long enough, simply because their seems to be no "reward" to the chewing (antlers are so tough that rarely anything breaks off as they chew).  These Chunky Chew Braids are fabulous.  Between the two dogs (of course, my 7 year old dog is suddenly interested in chews), these braids last the longest.  Actually, any of the Chunky Chew products are solid, heavy and provide hours of chewing if that is what the puppy/dog needs.  Very little breaks off from these chews, yet the texture allows satisfaction because they receive gooey goods as they chew, and due to the fabulous construction and quality of them, it is as if the gooey goods are time released.  Never too much at once, yet enough to keep them after it.<br /><br />I wish I could give 10 stars...  These products have saved my furniture, toes and who knows what else!

review/summary: Great Chew
review/text: Usually our Pitbull pup tears through a rawhide or bully stick.  This has actually lasted over a week.  It is great and keeps her busy.  I never thought I would find something to occupy her for more than 30 minutes.  I highly recommend this for the pup that tears through their chews quickly.  It has lasted longer than most of the Kongs we have purchased.

review/summary: Rawhide Ring from Hell!
review/text: My dog, (a one year old female Great Dane) eats her way through a normal rawhide bone in under a hour. Not with this one. You'll notice three things with this, and the other Chunky Chews items, right away.<br />First, they're a lot heavier than normal rawhide.<br />Second, they sound and feel more like plastic or wood when you tap on them or hit them.<br />Third, they reek of quality construction.<br />Later you'll also learn that they aren't messy and the dyes don't transfer either. What I mean when I say they aren't messy, is that there always seems to be a dry place to grab this ring by. Unlike a normal rawhide that feels like slime when the dog's leaves it laying somewhere and you need to move it.<br />I've tried, (I should rephrase that to "my dog has tried") all the different flavors and shapes of rawhide they offer from Chunky Chews, and the ring, in either flavor, is the longest lasting and best value for the $. The other shapes are also long lasting and made very well, but they don't have the durability of this shaped toy. And considering it only costs a couple dollars more than the other shapes it's well worth the extra 2-3 $.<br />If your dog has anything less than a chainsaw far a mouth, this toy will last.

review/summary: Husky chewed through it in an hour / lasted a week
review/text: My husky, a chewing machine, LOVED the flavor and she devoured the whole thing in about a week.  She preferred it over all of the other chews she got for Christmas.  I was disappointed that she found a defect in a seam and broke the circle in about an hour. Oh well, there may be NOTHING that is husky-proof.<br />I will purchase it again, however.

review/text: These are so expensive that I thought there were two in the package but no, just one.  Therefore they unwillingly had to share. Anyhow it has lasted two dogs all week while other rawhides only last a day or less. I like the safety aspects of this product since it doesn't come off in hunks that are likely to choke them and is tracked to a specific cow.

review/summary: Plain & simple: THIS STUFF WORKS
review/text: I originally found out about this product because it was given out as a 1 ounce sample on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico to New York JFK in January. Genius marketing on the part of Dove - whoever thought to hand out a sample size lotion to a flight of sun-drenched dry-skinned passengers should be given a raise because I'm positive I wasn't the only one to go out and buy a full size when I got home. The lotion worked perfectly to calm and moisturize my VERY dry and itchy sun dried skin. And everyone else on the plane seemed to feel the same way. I bought a full size as soon as the sample size ran out, and I'm still loving it - it goes on silky smooth, absorbs very quickly, and really helps combat winter dryness. The best moisturizer I've ever used, hands down - except for one thing - the smell. I wish they would make an unscented or fragrance free version. The scent is very perfume-y and will clash with any perfume or other fragrance you may be wearing. DOVE - please make an unscented version. Other than the scent, this lotion works great and I will buy it again and would recommend it to anyone who has dry winter skin.

It was very random but I loved the compliment and now I make sure to never go anywhere without using this lotion. The price on here is a lot more than I pay for it though. I will keep buying it at walmart. I divided the price by 3 and you are paying over $7 for one and in Walmart the most you pay is $5.

review/summary: Simply the Best!
review/text: In my opinion, Intensive/Extra Dry Skin is the only formula of Cream Oil lotion that Dove needs to make! I've tried the Shea Butter and Pro Age, and this has them both beat! The Pro Age has a hideous odor. The Shea Butter smells a little better than Pro Age, but still not as nice as the Intensive/Extra Dry Skin formula. It's not thick or heavy-just the right consistency with the slightest hint of oil-not greasy. Please Dove, don't change anything about it!!!

review/summary: New Favorite
review/text: Two years ago I developed a sudden break out of eczema on the back of one hand, something I had never experienced before. I tried every lotion I could get my hands on to help sooth it, to no avail, and I eventually ended up having to use a topical prescription steroid cream to get it to go away (not something I really was comfortable using). Then I found this product. It's fantastic, and has completely replaced the steroid cream, as well as my other regular body lotion. I use it twice a day, and it leaves my skin so soft and hydrated, it feels wonderful. Another reviewer commented on the strong scent, and while I am usually super sensitive to perfumes I find that this goes on a bit strong but quickly dissipates, leaving a soft and very pleasant scent. I love the body wash as well. Well worth the price listed here, although as someone else mentioned, it is cheaper at Walmart and you save yourself the shipping cost.

review/summary: Nice Cream Oil Lotion But Not Crazy About Scent
review/text: I read several reviews on this lotion and decided to give it a try.  I have very dry skin and I really like Dove products, and this one is no exception.  Goes on very silky smooth, absorbs into my skin very quickly, but I'm not real crazy about the scent.  However, this lotion makes my skin feel really soft for a long time.  You don't need to reapply because it is a very substantial lotion, mainly because of the oil in it.  Everything I've bought by Dove is a quality product, but if I could change anything about this, it would be to make it unscented.  If they could do that, it would be much better.

review/summary: King of Lotions
review/text: I have tried countless lotions for my dry skin and they would work for awhile and I was right back to dry, cracked skin. I actually forgot that Dove made lotion so I said why not try it, and I was amazed. After weeks of using it the lotion still works and there is no dry skin at all. After I scratch I don't have those "white streaks" in my skin, and is very soft to the touch. It is fully absorbed into the skin in seconds, but best of all the scent isn't overpowering so I can wear it alongside perfume and I don't have a scent cloud surrounding me. For anyone who has tried everything like me give it one last shot and try this lotion I think you will be very pleased.

My sister-in-law used this and she smelled so nice afterwards, I thought I'd give it a try. I found this to smell really nice, but it was very light and watery, almost felt like I was rubbing scented water onto my hands. To keep skin soft, I found I have to apply it many more times, which is probably why they sell it in such a large bottle.<br />I can say that after this is gone, I probably will not be re-purchasing.

My favorite body lotions that I have tried so far are Boots No 7 Body Serum, like the BEST, do to it's thick, velvety texture that lasts for hours and makes your skin look dewy.  My 2nd favorite is a toss-up Eucerin Smoothing Lotion with AHA's or Vaseline Intensive Stratys Lotion which go on smooth and are not sticky afterwards, but usually wait till it goes on sale.  For a low cost lotion, I liked the Aveeno Baby Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion.  Will still see if I find anything that tops Boots No 7.

I'm sorry that one reviewer no longer cares for it; but every time I open a new box of this cereal I get a great scent of the banana chips and nuts. It whets my appetite for slightly more than I intended to eat! I like that it has the fiber I need and it has iron, too.<br /><br />The expiration date is always a while off; that's another plus.<br /><br />It does have some fat, sugar, partially hydrogenated sunflower oil and carbs. (Uh-oh! I can't quite give it five stars because of this, in particular the partially hydrogenated sunflower oil.) If you're watching those (or anything else) closely for your diet, look first at the nutrition facts above to see if this cereal will fit into your diet.<br /><br />I have to admit I love this cereal! It's great anytime of the day!

review/summary: Try it at Walmart if you must.
review/text: Bought a bottle of this at Walmart. I thought it was passable at first, but every subsequent time I used it, it tasted worse and worse to me. I realize now  that I had just been wishing or hoping for it to taste good. It has a really unpleasant strong chemical flavor. It ruined the experience of the last batch of pancakes I tried. It is going in the garbage. So today I came to Amazon to find well-reviewed low-calorie syrups. I am going to try Smuckers next.

review/summary: Good jerky, too much pepper!!
review/text: The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!

review/summary: Never again
review/text: I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

review/summary: Edible..
review/text: The price was very good, but I guess I know why.  I gave it 1 star because it's low in carbs and another because it's edible.  There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

review/summary: Horrible at WSOP
review/text: So I have been hanging with a top player at the world series of poker and I purchased 2 packages of Jacks Links beef jerky.  These 2 purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money.  The meat was so dry I was not sure if I was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey.  The "meat" caused sickness and lock jaw.  Jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes.  It was pretty incredible of them to sponser the WSOP but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price.

review/summary: Great snack....even during battle!!
review/text: I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!

review/text: I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.

review/summary: Cheaper at Walmart
review/text: Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.

review/text: This is probably the best mass-produced beef jerky on the market.  It isn't too tough or dry like cheaper brands, isn't too sweet or spicy either.  Only problem is that as a snack I feel it isn't overly healthy.  (It has MSG, sodium nitrite and a lot of sodium).  However it is a low-fat, high-protein food, and very tasty.

review/text: I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car. I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind. I am all for natural products that they enjoy!

There were tiny bits and they were extra hard and grisly. I thought maybe it was just a bad run and let the next order come through. They were terrible also. It was like there was one or two decent strips of meat, and the rest was inedible. I'm not sure how this keeps happening. I had meant to cancel this subscription but remembered after I was shipped another pack of two. Maybe they'll be better but I haven't been eager to to open them. Roll of the dice, I guess.

So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again.

review/summary: Best ever
review/text: I buy a lot of stuff online and only write a review if something was very good or very bad.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that Jack Link's Jerky is the best jerky I have ever eaten (I've even bought some from a meat market before).  I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have "turned on to" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet.

review/summary: By Far The Best Jack Links!
review/text: I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.<br /><br />This is the best deal I've found by far, select delivery 1 time a month for 16 bucks and sit back and wait for your jerky!<br /><br />Now on to the flavor, I usually buy the peppered Jack Links for the touch of spice.  Recently I found the A1 steak jerky, and its fantastic!  It seems like its more dry, like the homemade jerky I remember from my grandparents.  I find the most of the flavors to be to moist, and salty.<br /><br />If your a fan of jerky, and the taste of A1 sauce, you will enjoy this product, use amazons subscription option and save another 15%, excellent deal when compared to store purchasing.

review/summary: Tastes of Death (Peppered)
review/text: I got the peppered flavor and it tastes awful.  It's spicy as heck but the pepper taste is so overwhelming that it totally ruins it.  I got through about half a bag and not more then 2 pieces at a time.  Totally disgusting.  I like beef jerky and Jack Link's especially, just not this flavor.<br /><br />Anyone who is a health nut may not like this because it's loaded with MSG, though I think most beef jerky is.

review/summary: Is it meat?
review/text: I have been trying to find a good brand of jerky that I don't have to order online.  I finally tried Jack Link's original.  Way too sweet, doesn't taste like meat, and most of the pieces don't have the texture of meat.  At times, I thought I was eating plastic.  Or some soy meat-substitute.  I couldn't even make it through the whole bag.  I miss the original Pemmican..., before ConAgra sold the brand and it got ruined...

review/text: One of the most disgusting experiences of my life!  Pulled the package out, opened it without looking at it, and smelled something indescribably gross.  Looked through package window, and what was left of my jerky could not even be identified as jerky.  It was white yet covered with mold.  Couldn't see any evidence of a hole in the packaging.  It came in a 2-pack, and the 2nd pack looks fine but has the same date stamp on it, so I'm not sure I dare eat it.  They expire in December of 2013...14 months away.  I'm not sure what happened to it, just that I wasted $10, and I'm still nauseous just thinking about the sight and smell of it.  Is jerky even supposed to spoil at all?

review/summary: Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy
review/text: I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.

review/summary: Pretty Damn Good Jerky
review/text: I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.

review/summary: The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category'
review/text: The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.  I've tried the Jalepeno brand but, it is not as 'hot' as the Peppered brand -but I still make room for both.<br /><br />Again back to the price... it's on the high side.  Which compels me to eventually research more about making my own beef jerky and then make it closer to what I'm looking for - scorching hot!  Something that includes cayenne, habaneros and the like for a taste to remember!

It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.<br /><br />I have order this double package in both Original and Teriyaki, and is the best price I have found when you figure it down to a per oz price.  It's even cheaper if you add it as a "subscription" to be shipped every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months...which you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />One other use I have for this is an extra special treat for my dog.<br /><br />Anyway, this is always high quality jerky.  Only negative is these large backs end up with a bunch of small crumbled shavings in the bottom--guess what then gets poured onto a plate for my dog!!!

Fortunately my mother-in-law and wife gift me with Jack Link's beef jerky on a regular basis. Jack Link's uses premium cuts of meat that are seasoned and smoked in a way that you will find to be delicious. Once you open the bag, be sure to put it in the fridge unless you want your beef jerky to grow some white fuzz. An opened bag of beef jerky that is refrigerated can last for months. I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes.
