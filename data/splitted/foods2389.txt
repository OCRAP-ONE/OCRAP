review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

review/summary: Made coffe sweet
review/text: I thought these would just add flavor rather than such a sweet taste.  I don't like sugar in my coffee.  Now I have 6 containers that I have to throw away.  There used to be a product just like this that just added flavor and did not have all of the artificial sweetners.  Not a good thing for someone who does not like sugar in their coffee but if you do it is good.

review/summary: Flavour Creations Hazelnut Coffee Flavoring Tablets (Pack of 6 48-count Dispensers)
review/text: I love Nescafe Tasters Choice Hazelnut-flavored instant coffee.  However, the 6.1-ounce plastic container of this product is no longer available in any of my local retail stores (although a smaller package of individually portioned coffee containers is, at an exhorbitant price).  Further, the best price of the Tasters Choice 6.1-ounce-package hazelnut coffee has increased from about $6.00 (store price) to nearly $57.00 (internet price, including shipping) during the past two years -- representing over a 800 percent price increase!  Hence, it is no longer economically feasable for me to purchase this brand coffee.  Other brands are either not acceptable for reasons of unacceptable taste or exhorbitant cost.<br /><br />Several years ago I tried hazelnut flavor tablets for my instant coffee and found them to be satisfactory, if not convenient (since there are two ingredients, instead of one, at each preparation).<br /><br />I therefore recently ordered Flavor Creations Hazelnut tablets from Amazon on a trial basis.  Because I combined this order with another, Amazon charged no shipping and handling fees.<br /><br />The cost proved to be satisfactory, and the Flavor Creations Hazelnut tablets added to another good, but less expensive, brand of coffee made the total cost far more satisfactory.  Further, the flavor was very near my original favorite.<br /><br />I plan to reorder these tablets when I run out, providing the cost has not increased.

review/summary: A second purchase for me
review/text: I never knew there was any flavoring like this until I saw it listed here at Amazon. I love these tablets and carry a tin with me in my purse (no larger than a tin of mints) so that I can have Hazelnut coffee when I am out.  I also use these when I only want one cup of decaf coffee and make instant coffee.  I like the flavor tablets because it doesn't diminish the coffee taste, dissolves easily and has very little sweetness to them.  I can add Splenda easily.  It is getting harder and harder to find Hazelnut coffee for a regular coffee pot or in instant form.  The recommendations are for using one tablet but I always use two.  If I am going to make iced coffee I have an extra large mug that I use and use three tablets instead.<br />I was so pleased to find these on Amazon.

review/text: I have recently RE-discovered Tobleron MILK chocolate bars!!!!  After resisting ALL milk chocolate candy for several years now and even being able to resist the See's candy assortments we frequently receive as gifts, (making it fairly easy to keep slim and healthy) I only occasionally indulge in a DARK chocolate Ritter Hazelnut bar once every few months.  However,  I may NOW choose a piece of candy over my usual Laughing Cow Cheese for a snack IF (and only IF) someone offers me the original Milk Chocolate Tobleron.  After having  tried their "dark chocolate concession to better health?", I found it's not  (and two bars of the dark chocolate Tobleron sit untouched).

review/summary: Good
review/text: We used this to bulk up an emaciated rescue dog. This has helped fill him out, build muscle and grow a gorgeous coat.<br /><br />Not a fancy food, but good enough. I have the proof in a healthy, energetic dog with an excellent digestion. Poops twice a day, right on schedule with this chow.<br /><br />We did try some of the high-end foods at first,as well as homemade, but those seemed to upset his digestion. This one really agreed with him.<br /><br />Every dog is different, though, so you have to find what works for your beast.<br /><br />Main point: if you have a dog who needs nutritional extras(more fat and protein) don't be afraid to try this one. This poor dog went from literal skin and bones to sleek and muscled in a few months.

review/text: Each individual package is clearly labeled to cost:  $1.39.  last I checked, $1.39*24 = $33.36, not the $52.80 that Amazon has listed today.<br /><br />While the safety in naming an item a 'variety pack' lies in the potential of there being different combinations of 7 assorted flavors; my package included 6 flavored coffees, and 1 non-flavored variety.<br /><br />1. Mackinac Island Fudge<br />2. French Vanilla<br />3. Traverse City Cherry<br />4. Creme Brulee<br />5. Hazelnut<br />6. Toasted Maple Nut<br />7.

To give you an idea of what I mean:  drinking them black you can taste the flavor; with skim milk you get a HINT of the flavor; with cream and sugar, if you close your eyes and pretend real hard, you can sometimes guess which flavor it might be.

review/text: I discovered this chocolate at a gourmet shop in Half Moon Bay, CA called Toque Blanche. It is truly delicious for those who like strong chocolate. Be warned, you will become more discerning and less inclined to accept a rubbery, oily chocolate with fillers. A perfect gift to just remind someone how wonderful he or she is, but you may want to share a bar first, because it is a bit of an acquired taste. I wonder if this is the kind of chocolate that is as powerful as an anti-depressant.

review/text: At first taste, it is slightly gritty and sandy, in a good way, because it's stone ground and not mixed with common emulsifiers like soy lethicin. I was surprised that it quickly turned creamy and meltable more so than any other non -stoneground milk chocolates and it becomes addicting fast. And, the taste of the 80% dark is so good -eat enough of these and the taste will start to become like a sweet red wine flavor.<br /><br />I haven't found or tried any other chocolate with this texture or flavor yet, and is better than most single origin bars too.

review/summary: So-o Good!
review/text: I love dark chocolate and to try other brands.  Saw this at a Whole Foods market for $6.99 a bar.  My oh my, is it ever good!  I love the grainy texture and meltability and of course the wondeful chocolate flavor.  I think it's cheaper to get it at the local stores.  I want to try the 87% bar next.  This 80% is dark, but it is also sweet to the taste even though it has only 9 gm sugar in half the bar.  I wonder how good it would be in baking.  Yumm!

review/text: I was so excited to find this chocolate and was willing to pay twice as much as I had been for my regular bar.<br />Oh so disappointed! Gritty, grainy, odd sugar taste and very little rich chocolate flavor, I love raw cacao nibs<br />and they are much better than this chocolate. I will stick with my organic Theo dark chocolate bars at half the<br /> price thank you.

review/summary: warning: may contain lead
review/text: While this juice conforms to USDA organic standards, it may fail prop 65 standards of 5 microns or less (can google this product and "lead" and find the study).  I called the company.  It seems that the water they use may contain lead.  They filter it, but it doesn't seem to get rid of all the lead.  Lead is a toxin that gets deposited in your bones.  When you get older and bones start to deteriorate, it gets released back into your system causing brain impairments.  Even a small amount may contribute to this problem.  I certainly don't want to knowingly give this to children.  The company also said something about the problem being in their california processing facility, not the maryland one.  So, depending on your location in the country, you may be able to obtain this product with no lead.  Until the company issues a statement that they conform to prop 65 standards, though, I for one will not buy any Santa Cruz products (which is a shame, because they are generally pretty tasty).

Like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00026S630">Meiji - Yan Yan with Chocolate Dip 2.0 Oz.</a>, they are not too sweet about the sticks, but the dipping sauce is pretty much loaded with sugar.<br /><br />Again, reading and eating this are not advisable as combined activities, unless you don't mind pink splotches on your books.<br /><br />A great little snack, and a great way to give yourself a sweet pick-me-up with something a little different.

You get the biscuit sticks and a little thing of strawberry cream to dip it in. SO GOOD. My only complaint is that there needs to be more strawberry cream! That little bit they give you is not enough for all of the biscuits(or at least I don't think so). Other than that, SO SO good. Buy some! You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Olives With An Added Kick!
review/text: I love these olives - and wish they were available in larger jars!  :)  I originally purchased them for martinis (especially dirty martinis), but I've found myself eating them straight from the jar as well.  If you like a little kick, I think you'll enjoy these olives.  They aren't what I would consider to be "hot" - as they don't burn your mouth.  But there's a noticeable bite to them - a spiciness that enhances their overall flavor.  I originally purchased two of these 3-packs...and now I'm back to buy 4 more.  They make an excellent addition to any home bar - or even just to eat in salads or right out of the jar!  Enjoy!

Every time I bring something new home they are very suspicious and almost never like it but this is the only product that they actually beg me for.  I've eaten them myself and they are actually quite good and don't have the same strange taste that I have found with a lot of the other natural fruit snacks.  I highly recommend these.  Grape seems to be the most popular flavor at my house.

review/summary: Nicely spiced, tasty, and ... cute!  :-)
review/text: These green olives (with seeds) are on the small side (bigger than picholines, but not by much) -- seldom much over 1/2 inch long. They're very nicely spiced with garlic, hot chilis, fennel, and bay leaves. Like most green olives, rather salty. Quite a good value at less than $5 per pound. Very authentically Italian (imported from Calabria -- toe of the boot), they're perfect for an antipasto salad. I would prefer that there were five bags of one pound each, but since they keep quite well, dealing with a five pound bag is not that much trouble. You'll want to pour off the liquid after opening, and transfer them to a rigid plastic container or ziplocks. Good deal for olive lovers!

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: This Tangerine Orange Zinger herbal tea provides a luscious and refreshing break from your daily grind and helps you relax as well. It's got a great taste to it that is not overpowering and if you let it steep about three and one-half minutes you're bound to enjoy it as much as I do! As another reviewer notes, the main effect is a distinctly citrus scent and taste tweaked just a bit for a really full bodied flavor and aroma.<br /><br />Each bag contains the natural ingredients of red hibiscus tea with orange peel and natural tangerine flavor. There are no artificial ingredients! Celestial Seasonings even added some vitamin C to make this even better for you!<br /><br />The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it.<br /><br />The tea is also caffeine free, which is a plus for those of us who don't want caffeine in our diets. That is something I always prefer.<br /><br />If you like a special type of citrus flavor to your tea, this is highly recommended! Enjoy!

review/summary: Tangy-rich citrus flavor!
review/text: This is one of the more sucessful of Celestial Seasonings Zinger genre. In this case the flavor of rose hips and hibiscus does not overpower the other flavors (unless you brew longer than 4 minutes). The aroma of this ruby potion is deliciously citrus and full bodied. The flavor of the tea is sweet red grapefruit and orange. Very tasty! I imagine this would make an excellent ice tea. Also, it is caffeine free and has added vitamin C--45 mg.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Be in readiness for favorable winds." Chinese Proverb.

review/summary: Beautiful rosy-red orange tea
review/text: The original Red Zinger formula had about twenty herbs and made a red, sour-sweet minty tea that was original and popular. The formula was revised maybe 20 years ago to a simpler hibiscus-rose hip mix and still makes a nice, red tea. Various fruit essences were added, such as raspberry, mountain berries and now tangerine orange. This is somewhat different than Mandarin Spice (no cinnamon or clove) and it's very like Red Zinger with a slight tangerine overtone. It's delicious hot, but if you like juices or your kids love juice, you can make up this tea to a rather strong brew, chill it, and mix it fifty-fifty with your juice of choice (apple, cranberry, grape for example. I don't think orange would be that good, but it might, who knows?)<br /><br />The idea is to cut the sugar of juices down and still have a refreshing cold beverage. Drinking this mixed with juice will cut your sugar intake and your juice bill. And it's a healthy tea.<br /><br />We drink it all winter long, keeping a hot water pot going and making big mugs of tea to stay hydrated and it even keeps you warm. Sipping hot, sugar-free tea keeps you from eating junk, satisfies your sweet tooth and keeps you away from artificial sweeteners, caffeine and other less-healthy beverages.

Herbal teas that are all natural meet their restrictions.<br />Some of the "teas" I tried were too fruity and gave off a spoiled fruit aroma after several days.

The tea has all natural ingredients: such as hibiscus, rosehips, blackberry leaves, natural tangerine and orange flavor.  This tea is a "zinger," distinct with  effervescent tangerines, oranges, and a bit of passion fruit  with sweet tart hibiscus.  This tea is soothing when hot and refreshing when cold.  I recommend this tea.

I used to buy 2 to 4 boxes a week from a local grocery, but they decided not to carry it, and did not respond to my request to bring it back.  Other local stores charge $1.50 more per box, so I decided to look elsewhere.<br /><br />I found several places on the web that sell this tea, but I would have had to buy 24 boxes to get the price I wanted, AND pay shipping charges.  In the end Amazon offered the lowest price ($2.17/box), and no shipping cost when I bought $25+ worth of product.  That was only 12 boxes which may seem like a lot, but the tea is cellophane sealed, and won't go bad.  If you drink lots of tea buying from Amazon will likely be your best value.

review/summary: Our "House Special" -- on tap
review/text: Someone gave us a lovely crock and we decided to keep iced tea in our refrigerator. But we wanted a tea everyone could enjoy, not just the grownups. I bought a sampler pack of all the zingers, and we did a family taste test. Tangerine Zinger won every round!<br /><br />Now we make a crock of tea once a week or so. We experimented to find the method that makes the best flavor and here's what we do: Boil a kettle of water. Put 10 bags (half a box) in the crock. Pour the hot water in and let the bags steep an hour or overnight. Take the bags out, fill the rest of the crock up with water, and put in the fridge to cool.<br /><br />This is such a great alternative to sodas and black tea. Whenever we offer iced tea people say no until we tell them it's herbal, then the compliments start. It's great to see kids helping themselves, and it's so refreshing! Costs us about $1.50 per week.

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: Tangerine is a delightfully different flavor from the usual orange and orange spice flavors usually found in citrus flavored teas.  This flavor was in the sampler box I purchased at my local grocers but oddly was not available as a box of only this flavor.  I enjoy a cup every evening while watching TV.  It keeps me from snacking!  My husband even enjoys it.

review/summary: Raisen Juice
review/text: I bought this about a year ago and remember being so disappointed in the flavor, that I never bought it again. It seems that a lot of these cheap teas, taste like dirt. Not that I remember ever eating dirt, but that is what comes to mind when I taste it. I think this company uses a lot of raisen/prune juice to cover it up. That is the flavor that overpowers many of these teas, as well as cinnamon and anise, in some. People who like fruit cake might like it. I'm not one of them. I don't remember specifics about this flavor except that the picture is false advertising. The luscious orange flavor was only hinted at. The taste did not inspire me to try any of the other flavors, but prior to that, I did find one called Tuscany, that by itself had too much cinnamon. But on a hunch, I added it to Carnation Instant cocoa (with the marshmellows) and it was fantastic! One good thing I can say is that I appreciate the wax paper packaging. Shiny metallic paper used in Bigelow and Twinings, I think, adds a metallic taste.

review/text: These crackers are delicious.  There is also a regular cornbread variety by World Table.  Walmart carries these and they're usually sold out because they're so good. As good as they are, this price of over $4.00 a box is ridiculous.  Walmart charges around $3.00 or less for theirs.  Difference in price is worth stalking Walmat or asking the grocery manager to order more.  One down side is that they are rather soft and there are a lot of broken ones in every box.  The crumbs are good for mac 'n' cheese or spanish casseroles.

review/text: I was so excited to receive the Ceylon cinnamon sticks -- as others state, it arrives very quickly, (actually I received it prior to the Amazon shipping notification) -- I had read about the differences in cinnamon, but when mine arrived the cinnamon stick was curled in on itself from both sides and didn't seem to be as "papery" on the inside... but I think it is okay.  It does have a lighter scent than the "regular"/not real cinnamon, and it is easily crushed by hand as well as grinded in a food processor or coffee grinder.

review/text: We had been using Bentley's White Tea Ginger peach tea to make iced tea.  It became more difficult to find it at a good price, so when I saw the Tea Nation version locally at a huge discount I gave it a try. We are really pleased with the flavor of this tea.  Both hubby and I noted that it's smoother than the Bentley's.  There's no "bite" at all and is very light & refreshing.  I will definitely seek out the other white tea flavors. These are little round pod tea bags. I love that there are no strings to deal with and no folded-bag-blowouts either.  I use 4 bags per gallon of iced tea, so the only thing holding me back from giving this 5 stars is the price.

review/summary: Really not bad, but the price is quite stiff
review/text: I'm a big darjeeling tea fan, and I know the best. Most darjeeling teabag (teabag cannot be best option, IMHO) is that people usually say 'the colonial darjeeling', which is heavy, full bodied and strong astringency(which must add milk+sugar) that made of fanning grade tea.<br /><br />This is, however, better grade(full leaf) tea. the body is somewhat strong, maybe 2nd flush + autumnal flush type. Astringency is not quite so bad as 1st flush tea. you could notice the hint of gentle lemony aroma (not flavored, of course) which is pretty common caracter in clonal-type darjeeling.(clonal or some chinese bushes) Unfortunately there is very little information about the tea plantation.<br /><br />Very nice quality-made tea indeed, but the price is rather expensive. If you need the darjeeling tea and the quality of 'mighty leaf tea' type teabag this could be your option.<br /><br />Mayby not the daily choice but I'll buy it again.

review/text: I was so excited to try the new flavors (coffee and cookies and cream.) But i must say, i was a little disappointed. The coffee flavor isn't that strong and the after taste is kinda odd. I couldn't keep the original recipes of the vanilla, chocolate, pb chocolate, and mint chocolate cookie in my freezer for long periods of time bc i loved them that much and ate them ALL the time (i haven't tried the new recipes of them yet.) But I have had the coffee and the cookies and cream in there for months. I can't eat more than a couple spoonfuls of those 2 flavors at a time. They're not gross; they're just no where near as good as the others. And for the cost of them, in my opinion, this one just isn't worth it. I won't be buying this flavor again.

review/summary: Hello Coffee Drinkers
review/text: Okay...first off, only 150 calories for the whole pint.  I mean, you can eat the whole thing for the same amount of calories as a cookie or (in some cases) a half a cookie.  Don't even get started on a muffin!  Even if you sit down and polish off half the container, you don't have to feel bad about it.<br /><br />Secondly, this is my second favorite flavor of this brand (coming closely after the maple-vanilla) and when I really really want a frozen latte but can't deal with how many calories are in it, then this gets the the cold coffee fix for a lot less guilt.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is strong, but not overpowering and, as to texture, if you are expecting creamy ice cream then you may be disappointed.  But if you're used to trying other frozen treats that don't have the texture of ice cream, or if you like sorbets then this may be up your alley.<br /><br />The only difficulty is that some grocery stores don't seem to carry this brand or, if they do, it sells out quick.  But well worth a try and at 150 calories...why not?

The taste is fine, but I realized I'd rather have some coffee blended with a little skim milk and ice than this. There's something weird going on with it, almost like a sliminess. But then it should be noted that I'm a pretty picky eater. I gave the rest of the cartons away, but the friend I gave them to didn't eat them either. If you try it I hope you like it better than we did, but don't get your hopes up.

review/text: My gf and I use Mrs. Dash on a regular basis, so we ordered a pack of 6 from Amazon. The price was great and, at first sight, the shakers were all in order. However, once we started using one of the shakers, we noticed that it wasn't quite right. While the shakers were each individually sealed (so it didn't appear they had been tampered with), the seasonings inside had been packed into the shaker container with such force, the seasonings were one solid mass (so nothing would shake out of them). After using a fork to break up the seasoning (with a few clumps still refusing to break apart), the shakers work fine and, to our relief, the seasoning smells and tastes right. With all that being said, I would recommend this product to anyone who uses this blend of Mrs. Dash due to the price.

I have no idea what possessed someone to label it "berry." There is NOTHING "berry" about it. I called the company to express my disappointment in there product, and they took down my phone number and never called me back. I would assume that no one tasted this product before selling it. I had other people try the drinks left over in my 4-pack and they had the same reaction. DO NOT buy this product.

It is, contrary to what the American packaging states not sourdough at all (in it's taste), but has a nice nutty wholesome flavor and is VERY crunchy, but does not break up like some of the thicker kinds of WASA crispbread.

review/text: Originally looked to buy the WASA Light Rye, but it was out-of-stock. So, bought the Sourdough Rye instead, and glad I did because it has broadened my selection of favorite WASA brand crispbreads. And while I normally avoid products with yeast, I feel that the toasty crispness of the sourdough rye has neutralized any negative aspects (that yeast is a negative is my story and I'm stickin' to it!) that may be derived from containing yeast. As for taste, great by itself or topped with a slice of ham with sauerkraut, or even with other varied toppings such as water packed sardines or blueberry preserves. Oh, some more good news is that moths will try to eat through the package of rye crispbreads, which means what's inside is edible for humans too. I keep mine stored in the freezer, because it is so valuable. Should be a good nutrient source in case of prolonged emergencies as well.

For lunch, spread a little butter or 1/2 American cheese slice on one, and put some tuna on it....almost too good to be legal. Our case arrived with 9 months of shelf life, about 7 months more than we needed.<br /><br />Waiting for the next shipment to arrive.
