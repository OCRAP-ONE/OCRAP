review/summary: simply the best
review/text: If you try this stuff you will never want to use table salt on anything again.  With table salt they take everything that is good about salt and destroy it.  first they grind it up small with metal utensils which at this point i can now taste if someone tries to pass off some table salt on me.  then they bleach it, just want i want is some bleached food.  and finally they add iodine.  its amazing that we survived as a species without iodine in our salt.  this stuff goes further because it has more taste so you can use less.  its sundried and retains all the natural minerals.  also its mined with wood instruments keeping its natural taste. its a must for nutrition and heart heathy minded families.  its actually good for you unlike table salt!

review/summary: Even loved by food clods!
review/text: Let me put it this way: I do not have the most discriminating taste buds in the world.  I dated a woman who would take a bite of butter and say "Num, this is good, the cows ate flowers on the north side of the barn".  This was especially remarkable since we had zero idea where the tasty butter had come from.  I on the other hand would announce, "Good butter.  Very solid.  No mold."  This does save me a lot of money.  Bottles of wine over $20 bucks are all wasted on me because I cannot pick out the toasted essence of pergola or whatever.  If it doesn't have chunks, I'm good to go.  In other words, my palate responds clumsily to food nuance.  Don't get me wrong, this doesn't keep me from loving to eat.  It just makes it a little less flattering when I tell the cook "Gosh that was delicious!"  They look at me like they just got a compliment from a Labrador.<br /><br />Anyway, I preface this review with those personal insights to say "Yes, real Celtic Sea Salt is really good!"  I can taste the difference.  It's that significantly better than standard table salt or even other supposed sea salts (sorry, just because it's big lumps of salt doesn't make it any more authentic).<br /><br />The taste of Celtic Salt is a symphony, compared with table salt, which is like your nephew playing the plastic recorder.  It's just that much richer of an experience.  The first thing I noticed is that it didn't have that sharp one-note taste of table salt that anesthetizes your tongue.<br /><br />So basically I'm saying if I think it's great, you'll probably think it's really great!

review/summary: I love this salt!
review/text: I am a confirmed salt lover - and this is my favorite salt. I love the taste; after using this conventional salt tastes like the industrial waste that  it is. I keep a shaker at home, in my work truck and in my Jeep. I've been thinking of getting a little shaker that I could take into restaurants with me.<br /><br />FWIW I do not buy into the notion that salt is bad or causes high blood pressure. I use a lot of salt and my blood pressure is low normal. The research that spawned the low salt mania was flawed and it retains its hold because there are a lot of big companies making a ton of money selling "low sodium" products. Follow the money.<br /><br />Give this salt a try - you will love it.

review/summary: does something for your health NO other salt can do
review/text: A couple of years ago I tried a very strict alkalizing cleanse program to try to reboot my health. There was a VERY restricted list of things I could eat and drink including restricting salt, but two forms of were allowed; dulse which is not salt, and small quantities of Celtic salt. Why?<br /><br />Apparently Celtic Salt is alkalizing where other salts are not. The human body has become more acidic in Ph over the decades because of diet. In general the healthier, more alkaline choices of whole grains, fruits and vegetables would support proper/healthy Ph but many people do not follow the best eating guidelines including myself. Little steps like using Celtic salt are easy for me to follow to gain small advantages.<br /><br />This salt also tastes great. Not sharp like regular iodized table salt. Great for table use, cooking, baking and anywhere you'd normally use any kind if salt.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: Mild Flavor and Peace of Mind from Processed Salts
review/text: My spouse and I both believe the taste is more mellow than traditional table salt -- not as acrid would be perhaps the best way to describe it.  I make my own "sports drink" and it tastes infinitely better with this salt than it does regular salt.  Its texture is lighter and it seems to mix into that drink and other foods easier.  Knowing I'm avoiding another processed food when I use this helps me to enjoy it as well.

review/text: If you look closely at the crystals, you will notice that some are shaped in random shapes (these are harder crystals, Real Salts), whereas some are man made crystals (used from the sediments of water). You can taste the difference. The real crystals don't melt as fast whereas the man made crystals melt faster since they are not real crystals. I bought this based on the reviews as I wanted something more natural... but I'm puzzled now!

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: Such an amazing, clean taste.  I used to have to hunt down excellent-quality salts, but it is so easy to order this on Amazon.  I love a briny salt sometimes, but it doesn't go with everything.  The celtic salt is totally all-purpose -- I use it in baking and to salt just about anything.  The one issue with it is that it's a very moist salt so it doesn't have the easy-pour most people hope for.  Himalayan salt does very well for that.  But the himalayan salt, despite its awesome properties, can feel gritty at times, even though it dispenses well from a standard salt shaker.  Ultimately, I totally prefer the celtic salts, so I throw some rice into my shakers as a dessicant, and even though it takes a little bit of effort to be sure the salt is unclumped, you know you're getting a high-quality product that is feeding your body and tastes divine.

review/summary: my favorite salt ever
review/text: I never thought that the brand of a salt would make a difference, but it does.  This salt just tastes really good and wholesome.  Standard iodized table salt just tastes bad when sprinkled raw on food, but this stuff tastes wonderful.  I still use generic salt for cooking--when putting lots of salt into a cooked dish or soup, it doesn't really seem to make a difference what salt you use, but when you sprinkle salt on food to enhance it, it makes a huge difference.  So I encourage you to try it out if you're skeptical like I was.  My wife also didn't believe it until I had her try it sprinkled on something.  Now she makes sure we always have this brand on hand at home.

Orders are delivered very quickly directly from Costa Rica. Our last order took 5 days.  The shipping box is very sturdy. The individual bags are securely sealed. Their Costa Rican decaf is also excellent.

review/text: We brought this coffee home from Costa Rica, for ourselves and our family.  We have had so many compliments and I have to say, I truly enjoyed every cup.  The low acidity is probably what I noticed first, but the flavor is so calming and enjoyable, smooth and strong. It stole my heart.  Pura Vida!

review/text: I bought one of each flavor to try, after seeing these praised in a magazine. The flavors are restaurant-worthy; it's amazing that this much complexity comes out of a jar.<br /><br />They are great for transforming leftovers into Indian food. For example, I took the pickings from a leftover roast chicken, including some bits of roasted onions, added some barley (could also do pasta, rice, anything you have) , poured a jar of the sauce, heated it through and it was absolutely delicious. If you love Indian food, these are terrific.

review/text: I am a nursing mother, so I need decaf coffee.  This is an excellent brand, and the decaf hazelnut is yummy as well.  I was sad to see a THIRTEEN DOLLAR shipping charge attached to this though.  Why the seller felt the need to send coffee as "priority" when I didn't even ask for expedited shipping is beyond me.  Had I known that I was going to be ripped off with the shipping fee, I would have just bought the three bags of coffee at Target.  The price here was good until the shipping got factored in, and then I ended up paying WAY more per bag than I would have paid buying from a regular store.<br />Lesson.Learned.

review/summary: Good Cold Shipping by Amazon
review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

review/text: I ordered the 4 large bags. I received them in a timely manner and appreciated that they were shipped in a minimal amount of packaging. The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

review/summary: Some Patience Needed
review/text: With the other reviews I wasn't really expecting much, but I was buying different seeds from the same store and was looking for a way to justify the shipping costs by buying more than one item. The item looked like an interesting experiment and if it turned out well I had a small tree, if I didn't I was out less then $1.<br /><br />Followed the instructions and pretty much saturated the soil when I first planted it, so much I was afraid I'd killed it right off but after that rocky start I set it in the sun and let the soil dry out. I didn't wait until the soil was too dried out before giving it a little more water, about two weeks later I ended with a seedling that I had to take out of direct sunlight immediately because I nearly did burn the leaves. All in all it's hard to say much until it starts growing a little more and I don't want to count it until it does. Small note, learned they're very sensitive to too much water and too little water as well as climate, they also take a little time to grow. Could be the season that let this one sprout or just luck but I'm willing to be happy with either, if nothing else it is a plant.<br /><br /> I'll try to keep this updated as it grows but the basic response is if you got time and a little money this is worth a shot but if you are absolutely counting on any seedlings I'd try something will grow a little easier.

review/text: I don't know how this has gotten such bad review, I ordered 2 packets since they're so cheap. Planted 5 without pre-germinating them in a paper towel and all 5 grew quickly and have been very hardy. I now have 2, 2-3' maples and haven't had a single problem with them. The other two died because I didn't take very good care of them. One died of root rot, the other died because I forgot to move it near the window before I left for vacation. And the last one I gave as a gift to one of my friends. I would say these are by far the easiest plants I have ever grown. When I started growing these it was my first time ever trying to grow any tree/plant from seed and also what got me into growing more. I now have around 10-15 healthy plants of all different shapes and sizes.

review/summary: Good first impressions
review/text: Its been about a month and a half since my initial review and I'm pleased to report a high germination rate. Over half of the seeds that I have planted have germinated and I imagine would have been quite successful had I taken better care of them.<br />A few suggestions:<br />-Be patient. Some seeds will germinate within a week. Maples are not in this category.<br />-Be persistent. If you let them dry they will not survive. This much should be obvious but cannot be understated with seeds that have longer germination times.<br />-There is no need to leave them in the sun, this is probably going to be counterproductive if you aren't planting outdoors.<br /><br />I purchased these seeds because the youngest red maples I could find at nurseries are too large for my application. So far what I can say is that the seeds arrived only two days after a placed the order and that, like others, instead of five seeds I received seven. They looked a little aged, but I took this as a good sign as I know maple seeds can require some preparation before they are ready to germinate. For now I've planted the seeds and will follow this with my results when I have them.

review/summary: I tried my luck
review/text: I'm gonna be honest this is my first time I buy seeds at all so I decide to buy from 2 different sites here and E....<br />despite the low rating I decided to try my luck.<br />First of all, all seeds were perfectly in excellent conditions, can't say the same thing from the other marketplace or seller :S.<br />This seller gave me 35 seeds instead of 20, can't say he'll do the same to you but the extra amount was very surprising (Thanks).<br />And if that wasn't enough he also send me another weird seeds called Dracaena or dragon tree  (beautiful when matures).<br /><br />I divided the seeds in 3 separate groups 15/15/5  I'm gonna use pure water(example distilled ) on one group on the other ill use hormones and on the last group I gave them to my father.  I will update this review when I see them germinate or in max 2 or 3 months if nothing happens today is 06/03/2011.<br />I almost forgot to tell you guys I received the package on time the first day of its arrival period, also had and excellent communication with the seller about a question I had, he respond me the next day.<br /><br />So lets say not satisfy but Happy with my first buy.

review/text: I thought that these would be great at first. After scarification, and 90day stratification, nothing. I wont buy anymore seeds online as I have tried over 5 different kinds of maple seeds. All have been a complete waste of money and time. If you want certain type of tree pay some real money and buy from an online or local nursery.

review/summary: Nice mix, but..
review/text: I was looking for a mix like McCormicks Medley blend which has the 4 types of peppercorns, coriander and allspice. This was the closest I could find, minus the allspice. This blend has great flavor. The only problem is the coriander is so large that it's hard to get into the grinder and the grinder gets plugged up, having to reverse grind. I do have a very nice William Bounds grinder, so it's not the grinders fault.

review/summary: How pepper should be
review/text: The blend is beautiful, flavorful and gives of an incredibly fresh and strong pepper scent when ground. The difference between these corns and those bought in a typical supermarket was evident. I was pleased there were almost no broken corns or husk flakes in the bag.  The packaging needs to be rethought, though.  The peppercorns come in a sealed cellophane bag that isn't really user friendly.  Something self sealing would be preferable.  If you try and tear off a corner on this bag, the cellophane doesn't want to stop tearing when you do.  Scissors are the best way to open and you'll need to find an airtight container to store the rest after filling the grinder.  I'll certainly be purchasing these again.

review/summary: Subtle & Varied Peppery Spice For Every Dish!
review/text: The problem(s) with preground supermarket pepper is that the peppercorns are the cheapest that they can buy...and the preground product has already oxidized and lost all its freshness, potency, and breadth...which means you end up using much more of it than fresh-ground, and even then the flavor profile is flat and overpowering at the same time.<br /><br />This mix is the definition of "peppery"...like the way you would describe a certain note in a fine wine or French perfume...and the subtle zest really opens the other flavors of the dish the way fresh herbs from a garden do.

review/summary: Great flavors, one wish...
review/text: This is a great blend of flavors, and I'm highly satisfied with this product. However I do wish there were more pink peppercorns in the packaging which would've added a little more sweetness to the blend and soften some of the "bite" in this mix. Don't get me wrong, I love the heat of black & white pepper, but in this blend I was hoping for something a little more distinctive. Nonetheless, this is a great value. The shipping took a little longer than I thought- 3 to 5 days ended up being 8 (not incl weekend). I also bought the Szechuan peppercorns to roast up and add to this blend...that *should* work out nicely! Overall a dependable seller. Good luck!

I expected that the tea bags would be in an air tight bag, but in fact I got a big box of paper wrapped tea bags, and the box was just shrink wrapped, so when I opened it there was no protection at all from the air. The picture of the product makes it look like it's in an air tight bag. Anyway. The tea itself is tasty, but doesn't have the zip I expected from the only other time I had tried coca tea, and that was from a ten year old teabag a friend had brought back from Peru.

It's good anytime, but it's the best thing in the world when you've got a sore throat from a cold or allergies.  Steep to medium strength, then add a large dollop of honey and mix well.<br /><br />A few years ago I asked my doctor what he recommended for a sore throat, and he replied "Whatever works."  So I told him my best remedy was Chinese tea with honey and he said "That sounds good, I may try that."  I should have charged him for the advice.

review/text: I was first served this delightful afternoon tea by my future wife more than 40 years ago.  We still enjoy it and appreciate its wider availability.  Contrary to the blurb on the package, which Amazon has printed here, my understanding is that Ch'in Ch'u tea was first blended by J. G. Friedman ("Jack") and named by his wife Isabelle, of whom my wife and I have very fond and warm memories.  They were the parents of my mother-in-law, now in her 80's.  Just wanted to set the record straight!
