review/summary: Excellent with Butter Cream Creamer, by itself or any other creamer
review/text: So far out of all the coffee we have tried for the Kreuger, this is our absolute favorite. It goes well with the International Delights Butter Cream creamer that we get at Target. It also goes well with Coffee Mates Cinamon creamer and I'm sure many others. In order to know if you have similar tastes to ours, we like Starbucks White Chocolate Mocha's, pretty much any Frappichino although caramel is our favorite, and I can even enjoy straight espresso or a campana if I like something sweet. In spite of my ability to enjoy a well pulled espresso shot, I do not like strong and bold coffee's like morning blends or french roast. In fact, the Butter Toffee coffee without creamer is still a bit strong for me as are most of the K-Kup blends. But this is by far my favorite k-kup.

review/summary: Very good flavor, but miss the old pack sizes
review/text: We prefer flavored coffees and as far as those go, this is a very good.  Just a touch of sweetness resembling Butter Toffee, and a balanced amount of caffeine.  These are not a dark roast, but not a light weight either - I get just right amount of caffeine bump from this one.<br /><br />Two "con's":<br />1) I miss the old sizes.  50 is a LOT of any one flavor.  By the time we get through it, we're tired of the flavor. I'm sure there were some manufacturing efficiencies or something in it for the manufacturer, but from where I'm sitting, the 22ct is sorely missed.<br />2) That said, they need MORE flavors.  Not only all the same, but also variety packs.  Please bring those back!<br /><br />Overall, five stars for the coffee itself, but one star lost for pack size and lack of other flavors in a variety pack.

review/text: I recently purchased a 50 X pack of Butter Toffee K Cups. I'm experiencing an alarming number of K cups bursting during the brewing process. It seems as though some of the K Cups aren't as pressurized as other and the ones with less pressure seem to be the ones that burst. I'd estimate that I've had about 30% of the 50 cups blow coffee grounds out all over my brewer. Purchased through and sold by Amazon.com

review/text: When my daughter brought home this box of Butter Toffee coffee, I've got to admit I was a bit skeptical.  However, it soon proved to be a family favorite.<br /><br />As with most flavored coffees, this one is more of a medium roast.  So it will not taste as good on the larger cup sizes - I suggest the 6oz to 8oz max.  The flavor is very good with a rich round and smooth finish.  This will make the whole kitchen smell nice.<br /><br />The best thing about this flavor is that it really cuts down on the need for sweeteners and cream. It is so smooth you can almost drink it straight.  I prefer this as a desert type coffee with just a touch of sweetener.  For my daughter, it is her favorite daily cup.<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this flavor to those who enjoy a rich, buttery smooth, flavored coffee.

Butter Toffee to me should be sweet so I understand what they are saying.<br /><br />As far as Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee, it is a good tasting cup of coffee and the flavor is consistent. The value of this item through the Subscribe and Save program makes it a good value for the dollar as well.

review/summary: Not the worst k cup out there, but there are too many better alternatives to justify this one...
review/text: My only foray into Gloria Jean's brand of k cups before this one was when I tried the Hazelnut flavor that was included in the sample pack that was included with our new brewer.  Needless to say, I was unimpressed with it.  I had all but written Gloria Jean off as a weak coffee brand when my boyfriend's sister gave us a few of her Butter Toffee k cups to try out, insisting they were much better than the Hazelnut.  At that point I hadn't tried another butter toffee flavored coffee from any of the other brands, so I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />What a letdown.<br /><br />Butter toffee does smell like its namesake when it is being brewed.  I had a lot of hope for it because of how it made my kitchen smell during the brewing process.  The flavor follow-up was nothing short of weak, though.  For one thing, I couldn't detect any butter toffee flavor in the coffee itself at all.  Shame.  The other downside is that, instead of being just a slightly boring, but good cup of regular coffee, this one somehow managed to be bitter and weak at the same time.  Nothing robust or flavorful about it.  Just weak coffee with a terrible aftertaste.<br /><br />So I've only had the chance to try two of Gloria Jean's flavors so far, but I definitely won't be going out of my way to try any others.  I'll stick to Timothy's and Caribou Coffee from now on.

review/text: I personally think this one smells better than it tastes.  Nice buttery aroma, but kind of watery when I drink it - even after doctoring it up with cream and sugar.  If that doesn't fix it, nothing will.  I had high hopes, but this one just doesn't pack enough of a flavor punch for me.  Will not repurchase.

review/text: I've ordered this coffee a few times. The last batch I got had changed for the worse. It had no butter toffee flavor that the privious batches had, and it had a bad bitterness to it. I would chalk it up to "just a bad batch", however Gloria Jean's has been unresponsive to my multiple customer service request. When you call, they put you through to a voicemail line that ask you to leave a detailed message. I've done this three times with no response. I wouldn't pay for this product again.

They all smell pretty much the same to me, even different brands.  I was hoping this one would be different because of the high reviews, but it isn't.  I gave it two stars because the coffee itself is good and not bitter like some.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I never buy flavored coffee.  I'm a cream, sugar and drizzle of caramel sauce type of coffee drinker.  When I read the reviews about this toffee flavored coffee I decided to try it with high hopes.<br /><br />As the coffee was brewing into the mug, I smelled a slight toffee scent.  It, and the coffee smelled good.  My hubs wanted a cup, just black.  I brought him his and after he drank some, while I was brewing mine, I asked him how he liked the flavor.  "What flavor?" he asked.  "It tastes like coffee to me" he said.  More questions to him and he said all he tasted was coffee, no flavor and the coffee was ok.<br /><br />Now for my cup.  I used about 1 inch of milk, one spoon of sugar and the Keurig on medium brewing setting.  The same faint scent of toffee was there along with the coffee.  I took my first sip and hardly tasted any toffee flavor.  I looked at the k-cup and it said 'toffee' on it so it was the correct k-cups that were sent.  It is such a mild, almost non-existent flavor that I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to those who don't like flavored coffee, I'm sure they would like it.  I'm disappointed in the weak flavor of toffee but the coffee itself is good tasting so it's not a waste.  I'm used to extra-bold, dark/french roasts so this is a much lighter roast for me.  All in all I like it.

review/summary: K-Cups from Amazon
review/text: The convenience and speed with the shipping of these k-cups makes you hardly notice you ever ran out. The cups are free from damage and easy to open and get to when received. Finally, for my taste the butter toffee is one of the most enjoyable flavors of coffee available from this product line.

review/text: I didn't realize the fuss-free packaging meant that there would not be any smaller boxes inside the big box keeping the k-cups organized. That's a little irritating because now I have NO idea where I'm going to put them all! The coffee itself is quite lovely. My entire kitchen smells like butter toffee and I am not complaining! It's a wonderful flavour and something I am going to buy again and again.

review/summary: Great Aroma but flavor Just Okay
review/text: I tried this based on the great customer reviews.  I use the Keurig at work (we have one that everyone shares - you just need to bring in your own K-Cups).  The aroma is fantastic, but the actual flavor is just okay. We typically run it through twice using the small cup setting, so it gives us a full large cup.  Maybe this is better if you just run it through one time and make a short cup.  I thought maybe it was just me, so I gave it to a friend who also loves flavored coffee.  He tried it and was not very excited either.  It is certainly a personal preference with regard to flavor.

review/summary: Highly recommended!
review/text: Butter toffee is my second favorite coffee flavor (second to hazelnut).  As we go through a lot of coffee, we purchase our K-Cups in bulk so we're always looking for the best price per K-Cup.  We've tried other flavors from Gloria Jean's Coffees, and we have been satisfied with all of them so far.  We keep our K-Cups on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E">Keurig 5060 K-Cup Carousel, Chrome</a> so we're okay that the K-Cups ship in this box.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: this one was a disappointment  for me
review/text: Sorry but after so many rave reviews I just can't make myself "like" this one.<br /><br />I have ordered countless assorted flavored coffee at the Keurig website and<br />have not experienced such flavorless coffee.  Can't recall if I have every<br />tried any "Gloria Jean" products....and I'm not knocking the brand...I have<br />enjoyed that brand served at the mall.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have 50!  (FIFTY) k-cups to use!<br /><br />This is my personal observation of this particular flavor of this one brand.<br /><br />Just so flavorless for me.  sorry<br /><br />Wondering if there is any recourse for $30.00 worth of worthless k-cups?  Believe me<br />I am not a "complainer", check out any of my other reviews.  Just a heads up that maybe<br />if you are sitting on the fence on this flavor, IMHO stay away .... sorry Gloria Jean.

review/summary: Try it with Caramel Macchiato cream!
review/text: To ensure that I don't waste your time, I want to begin this review by letting you know just what kind of coffee drinker I am. I drink coffee every day, sometimes up to 4 cups a day, depending on my mood. When I have coffee I use just a little sugar but a good bit of cream, usually flavored. International Delight French Vanilla has always been my old faithful, go-to creamer.<br /><br />I recently received a Keurig Cup Coffee Brewer and drank the Dark Magic K-Cups that were gifted with it. I found the Dark Magic to be very rich, a little over-roasted, but very drinkable. After running through the 24 pack I was looking for something different.<br /><br />I decided on the Butter Toffee K-Cup by Gloria Jean and was pleasantly surprised by the full, rich flavor delivered without any bitter aftertaste. The Butter Toffee is a medium roast blend with a very nice toffee flavor.<br /><br />Now on to my little recommendation. I was in Wally World the other day and was going to pick up some more French Vanilla cream when something different caught my eye. Coffeehouse Inspirations - Caramel Macchiato by International Delight. (Just so you know, this was the dairy based version, not the non-dairy shelf-stable individual portions.) I was rather impatient during the drive home to say the least. Let me describe the experience with a formula.<br /><br />Butter Toffee K-Cup + International Delight Caramel Macchiato = An amazing cup of coffee.<br /><br />While I'm not going to say that I've never had a cup of coffee this good, I cannot recall one off the top of my head. Try it!

review/summary: Vino Italiano Wine Kit - Valpolicella
review/text: I've commented on the Vino Italiano Motepulciano kit, and this review will have some of the similar info.  I really like the Italian reds, and the Valpolicella the best of them (I am currently racking my 4th batch of the Valpolicella).  If you make the kit by following the instructions, it will turn out dry.  I drink dry, but my preference is for a wine to be slightly dry, so I make modifications to the program.<br /><br />I have just started my 15th kit so my experience level is getting up there. I've done kits from a couple of other companies; Wine Expert, and Vino Vida. I've bought kits from other online companies, from a local brew hut, and from Amazon. I'll continue to buy these kits so long as they are selling them at this value.<br /><br />You cannot beat the Vino Italiano Kits. They are complete with everything, delivered to your door with free shipping, and they make a really good wine. Let me back up and say first that a wine I like may not be good to someone else. We each have our own preferences. I've had many a wine served up at restaurants with price ranges of [...] to [...] a bottle. And the wine I am making now I like better than pretty much anything I've tasted from the restaurant, or the store.<br /><br />I have tried the Valpolicella, Shiraz, Reisling and the Montepulciano from Vino Italiano. I have made a couple merlots, some white zinfandels also, but from other companies. I prefer the reds, and made the others because my kids requested.<br /><br />I'll typically, but not always, spike the kit with additional sugar to up the alcohol content slightly. If you follow the instructions, the initial specific gravity comes out around 1.080-1.084. By adding a couple pounds of sugar in the form of corn syrup or simple syrup, you get to around 1.09 or better. That usually will give a final ABV of 11.5 - 12%. Other things that I do outside of the kit instructions include adding 1 cup of black oak chips, 1-2 tbsp of vanilla extract, and a lb or two of some black cherries, blue berries or black berries (found in the frozen foods section at the store). Lastly, I like my wine not so dry, so I'll back sweeten just as I am bottling. Again using corn syrup and usually between 8 - 16 oz per 6 gallons. To me the corn syrup seems to be better than simple syrup, but that's just my preference.<br /><br />I love the stuff. Currently my production is having a hard time keeping up with my consumption. Cheers.<br /><br />Dec 31, 2010 Update!!!<br /><br />We opened several bottles of the Valpolicella over the holidays.  This is from wine that I made in March 2010.  With every batch, I retain 2 - 5 bottles and let age somewhat.  Usually I drink the rest, beginning immediately after bottling.  The wine is pretty good, even though it is pretty young.  Let me state for the record, this is my preference and everyone's taste is different.  Make/drink what you like, and don't let anyone tell you its wrong...  The Valpolicella that we drank over the holidays had aged about 9 months, and I must say, it was very good. The aging had made a good wine even better.  For the most part, I followed the instructions included in the kit with some additions.  In this batch, I had added 2 lbs of corn syrup and about 1 1/2 cups of black oak chips to the kit at the start of the fermentation process.  The alcohol content, after 2 weeks of fermentation, calculated to be around 14.7%.  A little high, and no doubt due to the added corn syrup.  I racked the wine, clarified and aged it another 4 weeks before bottling.  And when I bottled the wine, I back-sweetened with another 1 lb of corn syrup and added some potassium metabisulfite (1/4 tsp dissolved in 1/2 cup of water to preserve and prevent after-fermentation).  This wine has received the most compliments from family and friends.  I just ordered 2 more kits and will try to replicate the recipe (I keep a wine log of every batch so as to capture the important points of the good, and the bad!).  I hope this helps with your wine making and you enjoy the fruits of the vine as much as I do...  Cheers.  Sam<br /><br />May 2012 Update!!!<br /><br />I have made a couple of changes to the recipe that have been an improvement.  First, I included the recommendation from another review that said to make the kit to only 5 gallons instead of the 6 gallons that the recipe calls for.  Sure, you get 4 less bottles of wine.  But, this improves the fullness of the wine and its finish.  Secondly, I boil 2 - 4 ounces of dark oak chips in a quart of water for 5 minutes. This is then added to the juice and then diluted to the 5 gallon level.  Be sure to let the whole solution cool to 70 - 75 deg F before the yeast is added.  Add the oak chips and all the liquid!  This really improves the flavor, adding a powerful oak flavor that smooths the final wine and improves its overall taste.  I have incorporated both these steps into all the Vino Italiano wine kits.

review/summary: A Great Little Wine Kit
review/text: I've been making wine at home for a couple of years now and have over a dozen kits under my belt.  I buy all of my kits at a local brew/wine store and am also somewhat active on an on-line winemaking forum so I'm pretty familiar with the various wine kits available out there.<br /><br />When I ran across these Vino Italiano kits on Amazon I was a bit leery as I had never heard of them before.  They were having a great special at the time, though, so I couldn't afford not to give them a try.<br /><br />I am very pleasantly surprised! It's a small volume kit at 5.1 liters of concentrate, but still makes the typical 6 gallons of wine. The packaging is first class and while the wine is still young (clearing in my carboy) I have every indication it's going to make a nice, red table wine.  If you've come across these and have been hesitant to order, there's no need.  They are quality, small-volume kits AND the even come with labels, corks, and foil tops.  I will buy again in the near future.<br /><br />04-28-2010 Addendum: This wine has been in the bottle for a little over 6 months now and I thought I'd update my initial report.  In a nutshell - this is a very pleasant, medium-bodied, red table wine.  It finished very dry, not fruit forward at all, but at the same time it goes down very easily.  I'd almost refer to it as "gulpable".<br /><br />If you're looking for a big, full-bodied Cabernet or Bordeaux style of wine, this kit isn't for you (probably not any of the Vino Italiano kits for that matter).  But if you're looking for a lighter, nice drinking red, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I'd view this wine as food-friendly and it'll make a great pizza or picnic wine.<br /><br />I plan on making two more of these Vino Italiano kits and giving them a nice long rest in an oak barrel to see how good these kits can be given a little more patience and time.
