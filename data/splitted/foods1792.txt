review/summary: Works great for some cats
review/text: These worked great to hide pills for my cat until he discovered the pill...and would no longer eat the Pill Pocket.  Easy solution--I just started mixing the pill pocket (containing the pill) into his wet food, and he's dumb enough not to notice.<br /><br />Extra bonus feature: cats look hilarious chewing these.

review/summary: Salmon Feline Pill Pockets at a great price
review/text: My cats enjoy their fish flavored treats. The Pill Pockets are a great way to hide the medicine and provide a treat.  My cats enjoy both the Salmon and Chicken flavored Pill Pockets.  The online price was less than going to the pet store, and they were in stock. Shipment was speedy.

review/summary: Great product if your cat falls for it :)
review/text: I love these little pockets.  My cat gets medication twice a day and actually asks for his pill pocket.  I've had some cats turn them down and others willingly take them so you may be surprised.  I buy them by the case (of 6 bags) since we go through around a bag a month.  I've been able to save around $1-1.50 per package this way.

review/summary: My cat loves the salmon flavor.
review/text: I have to give my cat 3 pills a day. Pill pockets are the greatest! I have to use the Salmon flavor though. The chicken just didn't go over very well & once she tried the salmon she wouldn't eat the chicken. I use pill pockets for my dogs too. It so much easier than trying to shove a pill down their throats. It's also a lot less messier than some of the food products I've tried hiding the pills in.

She gobbles them up right away and whenever the bag is within her sight she starts meowing and pawing at me till I give her one.<br /><br />Also, these pill pockets are certainly cheaper when you buy them online.<br /><br />Couldn't be happier and neither could she :) She never hesitates to eat these pill pockets whether there's a pill in there or not :)

review/summary: My cat never knew
review/text: My cat is very finicky.  He eats only what he wants to eat and nothing else.  He has, on occasion, practicably starved himself because he didn't like the brand or flavor of food that I bought.  A short time ago he broke his foot, and while he is all better now, the doctors recommended an herbal supplement on days where his arthritis has really bothered him.  Giving him this pill, however, has turned out to be more traumatic experience, if not making the pain even worse then before I gave it to him.  Popping it into the Pill Pockets makes for a much better solution.  He thinks he's getting a treat, and although the first few times he was unwary, he has grown to love the treats and never noticing a pill inside.  I would recommend this to all finicky cats everywhere.

review/summary: What a wonderful invention!
review/text: One of my cat sitters told me about these wonderful products so I bought them locally so I could start using them right away.  On another site there were some good suggestions for using them:  1)  Before giving your pet one of these with the pill in it, give your cat one of the pockets just plain.  Your pet will be so anxious to get another one, he'll gobble the second one with a pill in it without hesitation.  2)  I think this is a key to success.  As you get ready to put a pill in the pocket, be careful to handle the pill with one hand, carefully putting it in the pocket, then with your other hand close up the pocket and hand the treat to your cat - this way the smell of the pill will not be transferred to the outside of the treat.  After a couple of days of success, I guess I got sloppy and didn't cover the pill up well enough.  The pill ended up on the floor, but I scooped it up and put it in another pill pocket and gave it to my cat and she gobbled it up.  I am sooooo happy not to have to stress my cat out any more.<br /><br />Followup:  A few days later I fell asleep in front of TV.  When I woke up the package of pill pockets was on the floor torn to shreds (this cat is declawed by the way).  She had probably eaten 25 pill pockets.  After that I could not get her to eat one - with or without a pill in it.  Soooooo, put them out of reach until you need to use them.

review/summary: Fantastic, Tosca loves them :-)
review/text: My cat Tosca has developed a medical condition requiring pills 2 x daily.  She is the sweetest cat, however, not too agreeable when she needs to be medicated.  With these pill pockets she comes running for her meds.  I now have to give the other  2 kitties a treat each time she gets her meds or they feel left out.  Terrific product if you need to medicate a cat and want a  hassel and/or stress free way for both the cat and you. I'm very happy with the results, well worth the $$ and quite a bit cheaper than any of the local retailers anywhere in the area that I've found, living in CT.

review/summary: So far, so good!!!!!
review/text: My 16 year old cat, little bug has joined that ever growing club of hyperthyroid cats.  While she is super easy to pill, is was clear that hunting her down twice a day to drop a pill down her throat was hurting our relationship.  In addition I wanted it to be easy for someone else to pill her when necessary. These so far have worked like a charm.  As she only gets a quarter tablet I tear the pocket in two and that cuts the cost down.  Amazon's price on these smokes the pet store and the the vet.

I don't expect to use any cheesecloth with just one layer so I believe I folded twice when in use, but it won't hurt to fold it a third or even fourth time.

review/summary: Useless for both yogurt & ricotta
review/text: The weave of this cheesecloth is very loose; at least an 1/8" between strands of cotton.  The weave also deforms so that 1/4" objects can easily slip through.  I thought I could compensate with multiple layers but 8 layers proved inadequate to strain greek yogurt.  The yogurt simply oozed through the layers. Same with ricotta.  I was reluctant to return this item, but I simply couldn't think of anything to do with it.  Maybe a hard cheese, but I don't make these.

review/text: I was expecting the flavor of a chocolate glazed donut when you take a bite, but I forgot that this is really coffee. It does smell good, but it has an aftertaste that I'm not crazy about.<br /><br />I'm a person who doesn't like the instant General Mills? International Coffess that come in the rectangular cans. I've always described them as having a perfume-y flavor to them that is kind of fake in the aftertaste. So if you can relate to that, you'll understand what I mean.<br /><br />I think I will stick with different coffee blends and roasts that are natural and leave any flavoring to the creamers and other additions that I make to my cup of coffee.

Would I order it again, probably, but only as a novelty coffee, never as a mainstay.

review/text: I was hoping for a delicious cup of coffee that tasted rich and chocolatey...unfortunately, that was not the case with the Donut House Collection Chocolate Glazed Donut.  This was my first keurig k-cup purchase so I was new to the game and did not know about all the different "bold" and "extra bold" terms.  This k-cup provides (what I would call) a "light" cup of coffee, as opposed to a "bold" cup of coffee.  I tend to prefer the "bold" coffees, so this particular product was not for me.  If you like a "light" coffee, then you will like this product (although I do not think the chocolate flavor was very strongly noted at all).

review/summary: Wonderfully Chocolate
review/text: My family absolutely loves this flavor of coffee. We have tried many of the flavored coffees since purchasing our Keurig brewer in October of 2009,and while we enjoy many of them,the Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut is one that has become a staple in our house. It is simple and straightforward for a flavored coffee, wonderfully rich and chocolaty. The aroma that fills the kitchen when someone is brewing this coffee is tantalizing. To me it is a blend of good coffee and lush chocolate.<br /> In the Summer, my daughter makes a divine Iced Coffee using the Chocolate Glazed Donut Coffee along with Vanilla Creamer for an extra added lusciousness. It makes for a wonderful afternoon pick me up. Then in the Winter, we dress up a cup with a candy cane for a lovely minty, chocolaty after dinner treat. A splash of Kahlua or Creme d'Menthe in either makes it a rich cocktail for entertaining.<br />My one wish for the Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut Coffee would be for it to be available in a Bold Blend as well as the Regular blend.

review/summary: I don't get all the bad reviews...
review/text: I loved this one so much I bought it a few times, I just get bored with certain flavors after a while (I actually stop tasting the flavor) and the store I get it from didn't have it anymore, so I switched to Hazelnut for a couple months...  But I've been missing the hell out of it, it's by FAR my favorite flavored coffee, so I'm really, really shocked to see so many people give it 1 star reviews... Maybe if you drank this on its own it isn't as good?  I like strong, flavored coffee, but there aren't any, they're all lights or mediums, so I always combine a large cup of flavored with a smaller cup of Green Mountain's Dark Magic decaf (the only coffee I can drink without any flavoring), making basically a big cup of strong, lightly flavored half caff, which doesn't exist apparently.  I could never stand to drink it alone, but I can't drink *any* flavored K-Cups alone, as they're ALL woffee (water/weak coffee).  I could say take a chance on this, if you don't like it, mix it with a strong cup of coffee (decaf if you don't want to be wired all day) and you'll like it!

review/summary: Best as ICED COFFEE
review/text: Many chocolate flavored coffees tend to leave a unique 'fake' aftertaste.  This Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut K-cups are no exception, if brewed hot.  For some reason when this coffee is brewed as an iced coffee (either directly into ice or placed in freezer for 20 minutes after brewing), this weird flavor goes away.  It is a great summer iced coffee drink.

review/summary: Chocolate Glazed Donut
review/text: First let me say, I am not a huge coffee drinker.  D**n you Keurig for bringing me to the dark side!  That being said, if you like choc glazed donuts, you'll definitely like this k cup.  I've tried many different flavors and this one is truest to its name. It tastes just like a choc donut.  Other than saying "it tastes just like a choc donut", there isn't much more to say about the flavor. It's just good!  It is not my favorite, but it is definitely in my rotation.  My 9 year old convinced me to buy them (imagine that!).  I'm glad I did, and will definitely buy more.  I put a little big of sugar and a little bit of regular Coffee Mate creamer and its just perfect!  No after taste, and I made it on the largest setting.  YUM!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033HPPIO">Donut House Collection Coffee, Chocolate Glazed Donut, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>I've purchased 9 different boxes of k cups this week alone, and this one will definitely be purchased again!  Simply stated: if you like donuts (who doesn't?!), then you won't be disappointed.  Period.  :)

review/text: This coffee is true to its name, and actually smells/tastes like a traditional chocolate glazed cake-like doughnut. Unlike some of the donut house flavored varieties, this one actually tastes as good as it smells while brewing. It is a light roast, and is very low in acidity. There is no bitterness to this blend, and I find that it needs even less sugar per cup than I usually use to achieve the same sweetness. Great coffee.

review/summary: Bad chocolate flavoring (if you're generous enough to call it a flavor!)
review/text: I am a flavored coffee person. When my wife and I go to Dunkin Donuts, she always mocks me for ordering sweet, sugary coffee (I think it's better if I can have a sugar rush and a caffeine rush at the same time!). When I bought my wife a Keurig (probably because I was tired of hearing her shtick every time we went out for coffee), I set out to try the different flavors, to see what sort of deliciousness was awaiting me.<br /><br />We made it through this batch of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033HPPIO">Donut House Collection Coffee, Chocolate Glazed Donut, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, but barely. We came close to throwing out all of our unused K-Cups several times, because the taste of these pods is that bad. It was like drinking a big cup of chemicals. Chemicals that barely tasted like chocolate. Look elsewhere for your flavored K-Cups.

review/summary: Chocolate Glazed Donut!
review/text: The purpose of my review is simple:  Know that you are buying a coffee that is flavored.  It's 'chocolate glazed donut' flavored coffee.  I bought 48 of these thinking it was 'donut house' coffee.  Well, it is.  But what I didn't realize is that Donut House is apparently a brand, not a flavor.  The good news is that this flavored coffee doesn't completely suck.  Don't get me wrong, if you like 'Donut House' regular coffee, you probably won't like this flavor.  I don't.  But it's not their fault that I buy things on amazon without reading the fine print (or in this case, reading the primary description).  I will suffer through 'chocolate glazed donut' for the next 3-4 weeks so that I might learn this lesson:  Read the description of what you are buying!  Who would buy chocolate glazed donut coffee, anyway?  ;-)

Ive even tried to drink it over ice and still a no-go. The chocolate flavor is too artificial tasting. I love the regular and deacaff versions(unflavored) of Donut House coffee but this is not good.

review/summary: Attention Chocolate Connoisseurs: Avoid Like The Plague!
review/text: I should start off by saying that I have never understood the appeal of artificial chocolate flavoring.  Even when I was a kid and a total junk food junkie, the things that were artificially flavored chocolate always tasted strange.<br /><br />Fast forward to my life as an adult and I find that neither has the technology behind artificial chocolate flavoring improved, nor my opinion of it. It still has a subtle (and sometimes, not-so-subtle) metallic taste and an obvious artificial one. So do many artificial flavorings, but most seem to replicate the real thing about 75-80% of the time. Not so with artificial chocolate.<br /><br />So then, it will come as no surprise that this K-Cup variety is equally disappointing. Imagine the most mass-produced chocolate doughnut with a laundry list of ingredients (and unpronounceable ones at that) and one pretty much has the taste of this coffee flavor---at best.  It's not the worst chocolate flavored coffee I have ever had, but when most are pretty bad, that's not saying much.<br /><br />For the life of me, I can't understand the reviews of other incarnations of this product which claim that it's "like licking the frosting off a chocolate donut" or "tastes like adding chocolate syrup to your coffee". No, and no!  It's also a far cry from "cafe mocha", as well.  Come to my house and I will make you a K-Cup of coffee with real chocolate and you can have a far superior cafe mocha experience.<br /><br />It tastes little like a doughnut, a chocolate doughnut, and nothing like chocolate doughnut glaze and marginally like chocolate at all.  If you are a fan of products from companies like Ghirardelli or Lindt, I will guarantee that you will be disappointed at best and disgusted at worst.<br /><br />I received this flavor as part of a sampler from the manufacturer's [GMCR] mail order program, and fortunately only received one K-Cup, as I would never place a full order for this flavor.  I kept hoping it would get better, but such was not the case. It was all I could do to finish the cup of coffee and not throw it out.

review/text: This flavor was recommended to me by a friend.  I have had other Donut House coffees and found them to be quite tasty, so I was understandably excited to try combining both my favourite flavour (chocolate) with my passionate addiction (coffee).  This is where it all went wrong ...<br />This coffee smells incredible when brewing ... the area around my Keurig is deceptively scrumptious and you just can't wait to taste!  The problem is, you can't get to the taste of the coffee through the overpoweringly sweetness.  In all honesty, I am a bit of a sweet-hound ... I love all things candy and chocolate but even this made my teeth hurt.  Originally, I thought I'd accidentally put the sugar into my own cup instead of my wife but, after brewing a 2nd cup I discovered it's the coffee itself.  Drinking Hershey's Syrup straight from the bottle would be less tooth achingly sweet than this "flavour".<br />Avoid this unless you like the lingering taste of chemical sweetener on your tongue .. for HOURS after you've brushed your teeth to rid yourself of the taste.

review/summary: Smells exactly like a Chocolate Glazed Donut, tastes like one if...
review/text: I was very excited when my chocolate glazed donut k-cup started brewing for the first time because the first thing that hit me was an overwhelming aroma of donuts!  Almost over-powering and definitely doesn't help that I'm on a diet!  However I was kind of disappointed to discover that the taste did not come anywhere close to that amazing smell I had just got a whif of.  I tried equal packets and then later I even tried real sugar with no luck.  Then I tried stevia powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ">30 Grams (1.06 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a> and this was the golden ticket!  If you get this flavor, use stevia as your sweetener.  It's literally the closest thing to actually eating a chocolate glazed donut!

review/summary: Chocolate glazed donut coffee??  Count me happy!
review/text: I was pretty excited to try this flavor and was NOT disappointed!  It smells heavenly when brewing and tastes like a good cup of coffee with the perfect hint of a chocolate glazed donut aftertaste!  I could close my eyes and believe I was in a donut shop, drinking a great cup of joe.  I think, like most of the flavored K-Cups I've tried, the flavors are more of a delicious smell than taste but that is just perfect for me.  I think I'll go have a cup right now!

review/summary: Not the Taste It Promises, But I Like It Nonetheless
review/text: I think that Donut House's "Chocolate Glazed Donut" coffee is perhaps misnamed.  In my experience, Chocolate Glazed Donuts tend to be very sweet with a strong chocolate flavor.  This coffee, on the other hand, has a more subtle taste with a lightly bittersweet undertone.  To my mind, it's more reminiscent of a "Chocolate Cake Donut" than the Glazed variety.  Even more specifically, it tastes like a chocolate cake donut that has been dipped in a regular cup of coffee, and in the process has taken on a slightly acidic aftertaste.  Interestingly, I find that as the coffee cools, the chocolaty taste becomes more pronounced.<br /><br />Personally, I like the way this coffee smells and tastes, despite the fact that it hardly matches up to its name.  Thus, my four star rating.  But I can well understand why someone expecting the sweet comfort of a classic chocolate glazed donut would find it objectionable.  Keeping in mind that everyone's taste buds are a little bit different, I think you might be well advised to take into consideration many reviewers' opinions before you decide whether this particular K-cup flavor is one that might appeal to you.

review/summary: smells great, tastes terrible
review/text: While this was brewing, I was excited.  It smelled like a bonafide donut shop in my kitchen.  Was I really going to be able to drink a chocolate donut without the calories?  Not so much.  It has a distinct chemical taste to it that even creamer and sugar cannot fix.  I actually gave it away to a friend that likes it for some unknown reason.

review/summary: Total misrepresentation as far as flavor is concerned
review/text: This is the second time I have taken the time to review something on Amazon.  This product is so bad that I consider this review to be a public service.  As the title indicates, to say that this coffee is chocolate glazed doughnut flavored is total misrepresentation.  There is a very slight scent of chocolate while it is brewing, but the end product has absolutely no chocolate doughnut  flavor.  The end result is bitter black coffee and nothing more.  I have to wonder if the maker, Green Mountain Coffee, has ever heard of taste testers.  Based on the flavor of this coffee, and flavor of the equally bad "Cinnamon Roll", I have to say no.  I think I will throw them away and take the loss rather than subject my taste buds to continued assault by choking down the remaining 23 cups.  The kindest thing I can say about this product is that it is absolutely terrible.  I intend to express my displeasure to the manufacturer as well.  For a product this bad it should be possible to give a zero star rating or better yet, a negative star rating.<br /><br />Based on my experience with both products I will be very reluctant to purchase another "flavored" coffee.

review/text: I purchased this coffee with high anticipation after I heard it being raved about by the morning radio DJ's.  I was disappointed when I received and tried it for myself.  It doesn't really taste like a chocolate doughnut, if anything it tastes like the hardened glaze that covers the doughnut.  It also has somewhat of a chemically aftertaste.

review/summary: Not good flavor
review/text: I purchased this because it sounded so good. We love the Donut House decaf (and my husband would not drink and decaf before we found this brand). I was hoping this would be as yummy as it sounds, even tho I had read many negative reviews. I am really not that picky. I love most coffee, especially flavored unless it is very "fake" tasting flavor. Save your money on this one. Unfortunately, this is pretty awful tasting, even after I tried to "doctor" it up with syrup and cream. The nicest thing I can say about it is it smells good while brewing.

review/text: I bought this because the title made me think it might taste a little like a chocolate glazed donut. Not even close! Actually, as a cup of coffee, it's not bad. Not too strong, and not at all acidic. Very smooth, and fairly mild. A pretty darn good cup o' joe. But donut? No. Glazed? No. Chocolate? No. Not. Even. Close. The name does not say "cappuccino", but you might think along those lines if you image a cup of coffee flavored like a chocolate glazed donut. But this blend has no cream, no sugar, no chocolate, no glaze, no donut, and as far I can tell, no flavoring what-so-fricking-ever, except... well... coffee.

review/summary: Found this flavor by accident
review/text: I had traded with a member of our Yahoo group for a box of Coffee People Donut Shop Coffee and this one kcup was in it.<br /><br />Without even realizing it, I had put it in my B40 and selected the 9.25 mug size. Now remember I thought it was the C.P.Dounut House XBold.<br /><br />Well when the coffee started filling my cup, All of a sudden this wonderful aroma of chocolate filled the air. I thought WOW!! this is some coffee. Though there is some chocolate flavor, my favorite will still be Van Houtte Chocolate Almond. So after drinking my coffee, I emptied the box hoping there would be another one. Sadly there wasn't. When I went to dispose of the Kcup there still was this wonderful fragrance of chocolate being emitted from this Kcup. The sweet nuance of chocolate is so strong and I hate to throw it away; ( I have the Kcup here with me now). I wish they could make a car freshener like this.<br /><br />So if you are a Chocoholic like me, give this one a try. Now I want to buy a whole box of this one flavor LOL.<br /><br />This would be rated as between a light and medium roast.

review/text: The flavor and smell doesn't so much as hit you over the head, but elicits an emotional response through one's olfactory senses. Brewing the coffee creates the warmth and smell of a donut shop on a cold's winter morning. Mind you, this is not for those who are looking to be hit over the head with a sledge hammer of donuts.  The flavor is subtle and elegant. It's flavored coffee - not a Latte, Cappacino, etc...

review/summary: Smells great and that's about it...
review/text: This is based on the Donut House base coffee flavor with a supposedly chocolate donut taste. The base Donut House coffee flavor is mild/smooth with a strong bitter aftertaste. It smells great while breaing, like you're in a donut shop but that's where the similarity ends.  The "chocolate donut" flavoring doesn't really come through in the coffee except that the strong bitter aftertaste becomes a strong bittersweet aftertaste.<br /><br />I tried this on both 10oz and 8oz sizes thinking the flavor was being diluted but it only made the flavors more intense... It didn't change the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the Donut House coffee flavor you might want to give this a try but if you dislike the Donut House coffee I don't think you'll find this any better.
