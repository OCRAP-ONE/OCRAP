review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: I purchased this product as my cats seemed to love nibbling on the rest of my houseplants and hoped to get them something a bit more suited to them. However, I was not able to get the seeds to sprout very well (some did) and ended up disposing of them after a short amount of time (refills for it are also quite expensive). I actually still use the planter they came in but I fill it with some organic wheat grass I'm able to pick up at a local farmers market for a much lower price (they just happen to fit in the container). As well, the planter doesn't respond very well to getting wet but has lasted a surprisingly long time - but if it wasn't the perfect fit for the wheat grass I buy elsewhere it would have been in the trash long ago.

review/summary: confusion amongst them
review/text: sometimes seeds dont germinate well. no biggy for 7$ when seed packs from most dealers like burpee will cost on average around 2$ so you spend 5$ for a nice planter. one with a low profile to keep the cats from KOing it onto the floor and rolling in the dirt... my cats dig my mums out when i bring them in from the cold. and they knock my smaller pots down so i will be purchasing these types of products to distract them.<br /><br />i believe the cat grass is an annual and wont keep growing and growing.<br /><br />but then i didnt research this. if the cats eat it all down it might die just like grass that is cut too low. but wouldnt it come back. i will have to pull my books out.

review/summary: Very fine product
review/text: In a couple of recent reviews I've blasted some "Healthy" soups for being unnecessarily bland.<br /><br />Well, you don't have to worry about that with this soup. Progresso generally gets it right, and this is no exception. A one cup serving of the soup is filling, and is only 80 calories. Is it the thick and creamy chicken and dumplings that my mother and grandmother made? Of course not. However, you do get enough small dumplings and pieces of chicken to at least make you think you're not just slurping up broth. LOL<br /><br />The addition of carrots, celery, and a pleasing set of spices insures that you'll enjoy this bowl of soup. It is filling, healthy, and tasty. You can't really ask for more than that.

review/text: When you are trying to control calories this soup is a gem!  I love the flavor and it is filling.  Not as great on the nutritional side.  I don't feel there is enough protien for a meal, especially when you are cutting other areas of the diet.  It is great for an occasional meal when you add a few pieces of chicken.  Of course that adds calories but not many.

review/summary: What a delicious soup!
review/text: I am a big fan of canned food. Progresso has never let me down before, and this flavor makes no exception to that. The taste is just so right. It does not taste salty or too sweet. Eating it really gives you a warm feeling. When you boil it the smell makes it very irresistible. Better get a tissue quick before you freak someone out with that watery mouth. Nothing more I can say really, since it tastes so nice that word cannot describe it properly.<br /><br />Perhaps the only downside to this soup is that the dumplings are small and lack texture and filling to it. For that I took a star away from this review.<br /><br />Note: I highly recommend you boil canned food for fifteenth to twenty minutes before serving (ten minutes if you lived at elevated area). Not only does it make it tastes better than microwaved, but it also gives you a better sense of safer serving.<br /><br />Another note: Shipping carriers often don't know the word "gentle". I have received a package where some cans were dented. Consider this when you are purchasing canned food online.

review/text: Worth every penny - fresh and well packed from Maine to Seattle in one day.  Packed in 2 pound "netted" packages surrounded with "blue ice" packages for refrigeration. All in a sturdy styrofoam container and boxed. Out of my 4 pound order, only 3 of the clams were broken and had to be thrown away. All the others were fresh and "closed". Cleaning and cooking instuctions included. Maine steamed clams are one of the most tender varieties - not chewy like little necks or other varieties.  Steam 10 minutes, take beard off neck, dip in butter and arrive in Heaven.

He is a pug, so it takes alot of chewing to break any bone down, so these are perfect for him.  His breath is fresher, too.  Thanks for carrying these and I plan to purchase more in the future.

review/summary: Wheat free, not too sweet granola
review/text: A lot of granola out there is way too sweet and has a background taste of coconut, but not Nature's Habit (even though coconut is an ingredient). My wife and I have tried this particular flavor and several others and they are all great. It is also nice that the nuts are whole, which gives it great texture and flavor. It's been hard to find in the grocery store, so I was really glad to see that amazon carried it.

review/text: Delicious cereal... the only detriment is I must practice enormous self control, else I will eat far too much in a sitting. As all granolas are, this is fairly dense in both nutrients and calories: a little goes a long way. I love the flavor of the seeds especially. And this is a fantastic price for a flavor I can't get in my local grocery. Highly recommend all varieties of these granolas. Also, as far as granolas go, this one is not so bad in terms of calories and fat, if you, like me, are watching that kind of thing.

review/summary: I love these cookies!
review/text: I received a little snack size bag of these cookies in a gift bag from work for "National Whole Grains Day." Now I was skeptical because I have been gluten-free for a while and have yet to "fall in love" with a store bought chocolate chip cookie. Before I opened the bag I was expecting there to be one cookie in the little package but there was actually 7 adorable little cookies in the package. I think, I ate them before I could count them!<br /><br />They were crunchy in the best way possible! There was no crumbling or funny after taste with these cookies. They have an oat flour base which I personally really like and all of the ingredients are recognizable and there weren't a million of them.<br /><br />These cookies reminded me of the mini cookies I use to get in my lunch when I was a kid except better. And trust me I still very much remember what "gluten-full" cookies taste like! I think little kids would love these cookies! I didn't want to write a review at first because I didn't want everyone to buy them out from under me! But don't just take my word, try them for your selves!

review/summary: A great way to get your cookie fix.
review/text: A review for cookies?  Why not?<br /><br />My wife and I love Oreos.  Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of "snack packs" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie "fix" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off.

review/summary: The perfect format for a student like me, but be careful
review/text: Three important details about me:<br />1. I have a ridiculously fast metabolism so I always want snacks.<br />2. I'm a student often stuck in long, boring lectures or labs.<br />3. I'm cheap.<br /><br />That's why I was so elated when I found this deal.  I already love Oreos and I'm always searching for small snacks I can shove in my backpack when I'm running out the door.  I tend to buy boxes of snacks and just cycle through them: peanut butter crackers, Nutty bars, bags of M&Ms, Moon Pies, etc.  The 48 pack of Oreos was my most recent one and definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />They're packaged pretty lightly in little bags of 6 Oreos and I find it to be the perfect amount so that I'm satiated but not wasting any due to losing taste.  One pack of 48 will last me at least a month (sometimes I eat two or three packs in a sitting, okay?) so Subscribe & Save seemed to be my perfect snack solution.<br /><br />Of course I didn't realize how much Subscribe & Save sucks.  The price on these literally doubled after my first month and I had to cancel my subscription.  That said, the product is great but don't trust subscribing through Amazon.

review/summary: Still The Best.....
review/text: I have had an Oreo addiction since just about the time I knew what a cookie was.  Its funny how Oreos have managed to hang on and become such a family favorite despite all the competition of much fancier cookies that are available.  No nugets going on here, chocolate bits, caramel, icing, or peanuts either.  Just a tasty chocolate cookie shell with a delicious vanilla filling.  Keeping it simple has been the best policy for Oreo lovers for decades now. These little packages contain Oreos that are a smidgen' smaller than the regular box or bag sized variety.  What the cookie and candy industry refers to as the fun size.  That might explain some of the negative comments as to these Oreos being rather cheap with the filling.  In my opinion the ratio is the same, they are just smaller.<br /><br />This 12 pack is an excellent buy on Amazon.  Buy two of them and you get free shipping and for the majority of us, no sales tax.  A fine buy if you have a lots of Oreo fiends in your home that prefer a measured amount of these great cookies.  Like a lot of other reviewers here I tend to eat less of them when they come in the little packages as such.  Great classic Oreo cookies at a good price.  Highly recommended...

review/summary: Excellent sandwich cookie
review/text: Ok, for some of you (NAMELY Mr. A. H. of Detroit, Michigan), anything but a chocolate sandwich cookie, embossed with Nabisco symbols and filled with white creme is a travesty, but Golden Oreos are a worthy addition to the cookie line of Nabisco. These are vanilla cookies, slightly flavored with burnt sugar, filled with the familiar white creme.<br /><br />Unlike classic Oreos, the Golden version have not suffered much from having trans-fats removed. The cookie is still crisp enough and the flavor is the same. By contrast, original Oreos seem a bit softer due to the change in recipe.<br /><br />Another good feature is the fact that Golden Oreos don't leave a dark mess on your teeth. So you can eat one and not check yourself in a hand mirror afterwards if you are being in public. This is a very nice cookie with a cup of tea or coffee and a standard in our house for teatime or dessert.

review/text: Each pack contains 6 Oreos.  That's a tidy size for someone who wants a little snack but tends to overdo it with a big bag of Oreos!  However, having 48 of these in the house has led all of us to a bit of Oreo gluttony.  You know how easy it is..."Oh, there's only 6, I'll have another pack."  As a result our box of 48 has barely lasted a month for three people.  So, I will probably not get this anymore because it's too tempting!

review/summary: Chocolate Cream Oreo Cookies 101
review/text: This is less of a review of the actual cookies; though I rated them 5 stars.  The real merit of this "review" is to provide  information that may help others avoid the confusion that I experienced when I received my order.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the product page on Amazon for "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream."  The Amazon product image clearly said "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream" and I had never seen that product description or package previously.  I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say "Double Stuf" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf.

review/summary: not good
review/text: I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.  You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart.  Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us).

review/summary: keeps cookies tasting fresh and crunchy
review/text: These are always going to be more expensive than buying the single big pack - remember when oreos were packed into three plastic tubes in a plastic box.<br /><br />These oreos always come out crunchy with a very pliable filling that can be easily nudged-rolled off if you don't like the filling.  If Nabisco sold individually wrapped cookies, I'd pay the extra money as I usually only want one cookie.<br /><br />I will always choose to buy oreos packaged in as small a serving as possible despite the expense unless I get some kind of vacuum sealer.

review/text: Great item at $16 (on sale).  My problem with supermarket packaging is the problem that the cookies taste great but once you open the package for about a week the cookies gets moist and taste not nearly as delicious as when the bag was open.  So these small packages, I think 6 cookies each is the perfect size.  They will all taste great and crisp.

They make a good snacking food in the afternoon or even in the morning. Just be warned, these things are filled with sugar. Each pack has 6 oreos, which I tihnk is too much for one serving.

review/text: My review is for the product cookie itself, not what might happen if you buy food from Amazon. Oreo is a classic cookie, and while I can't say that I am a big fan of all their flavors, I really enjoy three flavors - original, Uh-Oh Oreos, and the top of the list, Mint Oreos. The flavor is strongly reminiscent of the Thin Mint cookies sold by the Girls Scouts. Unfortunately, they only sell their cookies once in a while, but I can head to my store any time I have a craving for the flavor of chocolate and mint in a cookie. I even like this better than original Oreo, and that's saying a lot. Nom nom.

review/summary: Chocolate covered Oreo recipe
review/text: Everyone loves Oreos. They're even better dipped in chocolate. I made a plate of them for my son's Cub Scout cookie auction and a plate of my cookies sold for $20. So yummy.<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />2 tablespoons shortening<br />1 package Oreos<br />*optional: 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening<br /><br />**Before you begin, make sure everything is absolutely dry. Even a drop of water will ruin your creation.**<br /><br />Melt the chocolate chips with the shortening in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir until melted. If needed, heat another 10 seconds at a time until melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.<br /><br />Place one cookie in the chocolate and coat. Use a fork to scoop it out, tapping against the bowl and scraping the bottom of the fork on the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on wax paper and let it set. Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate. Plate them together for an eye catching presentation.

review/text: I second Joanna Daneman's observation that these golden Oreos are preferable to the regular chocolate Oreos when you are in public.  Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.  They are addictive.<br /><br />If you like vanilla sandwich cookies, try the Golden Oreos!

review/text: It is hard to imagine something as good as the original chocolate oreo.  That was in the days when Oreo only meant one thing:  Two chocolate wafers and vanilla cream.  The best way to eat those was to soak them until they were soft in ice cold milk (only could get whole milk back then).  Now there are how many things with the oreo name? TOO many.<br /><br />But this! The Golden Oreo.  Truly wonderful.  Totally different than the original oreo.  But wonderful. It is also BETTER than the current chocolate Oreo.  I wish I could taste-test the original oreo for comparison, but cannot be done...

review/text: I've purchased canned dolma for many years, various brands, sizes, and I really think this is by far the best.  I still have a few left from a December 19 party, and each little bundle is a delicious addition to whatever leftovers one has around.  It does not have to be a fancy dinner; just add some of these with some raw vegatables and any old main dish will do!!  This brand has a lemony-ish sauce, and the leaves are less tough than some others.  The rice is fine.  The bundles are plump and not too long.  There is a Greek restaurant not far from me that serves grapeleaves of course; whether the meat and rice type or plain rice, the result is tough, tough, tough, an insult.  Do yourself a favor and just buy these; they keep forever in a good tight tupperware container later on.

review/summary: Best onion soup seasoning mix!
review/text: Okay, so you have to add your own onion and bread.....adding these fresh is a good thing.  This is meant to be a starter mix of seasonings, not an add water and eat soup.  The flavoring of this mix is excellent!  I tried this out on friends and added homemade italian bread and sharp white cheddar cheese and we decided it was the best french onion soup ever!  I have tried onion soups from MANY restaurants in search of the perfect french onion soup and have found ones equal, but none better than this combination.  A friend who also tried this mix has worked at several high end restaurants and with our combination of bread and cheese, she said none of them can match the quality of our homemade soup!  Yes, we could tinker with seasoning combinations to try to match Cugino's, but why bother when Cugino's has already put together the perfect blend.<br /><br />Okay, the sodium content is high, but most good french onion soups are.  And I would agree with the other reviewer to double the amount of onions added because one onion is just not enough.<br /><br />The proper bread and cheese do make a big difference for french onion soups, so don't skimp on quality there and you should be very pleased with this mix.

Make the onion soup per the box direction except double the boil time to thicken the broth.<br />2. Meanwhile, place each bread slice on a cutting board.<br />3. Press and rotate the upside down open end of the crock onto the bread and rotate it to cut it into a circle the size of the crock pot opening.<br />4. Place one of the circular slices of bread into the bottom of each crock pot.<br />5. Place a slice of the smaller provolone cheese over the bread in each crock pot.<br />6. Place a slice of mozzarella cheese over the bread in each crock pot.<br />7. Ladle the soup mix while still very hot into each crock pot about 1/2 inch from the top.<br />8. Place the remaining slices of circular bread onto the top of each crock pot making sure the top is even with the top of the crock pot.<br />9. Place the remaining slices over the top of the crock pots.<br />10. Place the crock pots in the oven and broil until the top layer of provolone cheese is browned and toasty.<br />11. Serve immediately and enjoy after it's cool enough to eat!  Yum yum!  So tasty!

I'm also a big fan of chia seeds and do feel they help me have sustained energy in a subtle steady way.<br /><br />It feels indulgent because of the chocolate but I don't get the caffeine hit like from other chocolates and it feels good for my body - sweet but not too sweet and full of good ingredients - lots of greens.<br /><br />I don't understand the negative reviews here as I LOVE these bars. Perhaps if you are used to eating sugary candy bars these don't taste as good (?) but when you eat healthy food (lots of greens, veggies, natural whole foods), this tastes like a real treat and is a great option for a snack on the go (for travel, too).

review/summary: They taste okay--my Daughters like them.
review/text: I just tasted one for the first time tonight and I thought it tasted pretty good. My 6 and 3 1/2 year old daughters really like them. So, to put it simply, good nutrition, good taste, I think we'll be buying more. I'm sure my youngest would give it a 5, but it's not quite a knock-it-out-of-the-park taste for me, so I feel more honest giving it a 4.

review/summary: Great nutrition, abysmal taste
review/text: I absolutely love the taste of both the Greens + Original Bar, and the Greens + Chocolate Bar.  They're amongst the healthiest, and best tasting "natural" bars on the market today.  I was excited to see something new with the Chia bars, so I bought a box (it was discounted 50%).  I looked at the nutrition facts, very solid.  I figured they tasted just as good, if not better than the Original Greens + Bars.  Boy, was I wrong....<br /><br />These bars taste absolutely abominable!  In all seriousness, I've never had a nutrition bar that tasted so bad, and believe me, I've eaten 100's!  It's hardly even something you can choke down--it's really that bad.  I've yet to try the Greens + Chia Chocolate bar.  Maybe that's edible, but these bars surely aren't.  I give it 1 star for taste, 5 stars for nutrition... but of course, the nutrition doesn't mean much when you can't even choke 'em down.

review/summary: Artery Alert!
review/text: I somewhat liked this garlic chicken dish with black beans and rice, by Hormel. The sauce was nice and creamy, and infused with just the right amount of garlic and cilantro. However, as one reviewer remarked, it was too plentiful and painfully bland. I certainly agree that more rice and beans would've been welcome. The white meat chicken strips were good and of fairly generous proportion. The primary problem with this meal, though, as noted by another reviewer, was the elevated saturated fat content -- ten grams. C'mon Hormel...this is completely unnecessary...please fix it. A teaspoonful of cornstarch could have thickened the sauce just as well, without thickening our arteries in the process!

This stuff is too fine and cakey, it is more like baby powder that was sprayed with an onion scent, and it taste awful to boot!  I called the Consumer Hotline at McCormick and they could NOT locate the UPC code that was printed on the label and the woman on the line stated that McCormick does not make a 22oz. sized container of onion powder so I am not sure what Amazon is allowing to be sold via their website.  All I know is I am out $15 and I still have NO onion powder.  Needless to say I am not happy and highly upset with this purchase.  Please learn from my mistake and don't repeat.

review/summary: GREAT SALT WITHOUT IODINE ADDED --- WHY?,
review/text: VERY CONSISTENT PRODUCT - POURS UNIFORMLY EASILY BUT IS EXTREMELY SALTY<br /><br />0* for GOITER PREVENTION! 5***** for VALUE/TASTE! = *** OVERALL<br /><br />"Morton [NON-Iodized Salt]" is a lot like Morton's Iodized Salt and Coca-Cola, it is available everywhere and you can be sure of what you are getting. Morton makes salt into their reason for being, so we can be pretty sure that they get it right. Every container of "Morton's Iodized Salt" that I have used over the past 50 years was exactly like every other which is the kind of consistency that makes a consumer feel safe. If you want to avoid goiter, however, this is NOT the ticket. Instead you will need to use "MORTON'S IODIZED SALT", and that's an example of how a tiny amount of a trace mineral can go a long way. But Iodized Salt, just like this "Plain Salt" must be taken in very small doses and only when it must be added to something you are cooking.<br /><br />At Morton's very informative website which will not copy here but it goes by there name, there are links to useful nutritional websites such as "THE SALT INSTITUTE". I know what you are thinking, but it does have wonderful color slides of human anatomy showing how much salt is in our body and what it does. Essentially, salt is an essential mineral that is over-consumed in processed foods. However, if you don't eat processed foods, you will need salt and iodine to be added to what you eat, especially if you exercise daily or if you live in a desert or other hot place.<br /><br />This is a product [IODIZED VERSION, NOT THIS ONE] that my family buys once every 3 years, so how could we ever consider saving a dime with a store brand when we have 50 years of satisfied experience with Morton's Iodized Salt? I love the little girl on the packaging also. She hasn't changed much since 1914 and not at all since 1968. Some things can't be improved, just like Morton's Salt.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: Unless you are allergic to Iodine which is almost unheard of, you should be using the "Morton's Iodized Salt" to prevent goiter and not this "Plain Salt" product.<br /><br />[NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY COMPANY OR PRODUCT.]

If you want a more refined flavor between smooth, sweet, and twist you should consider these cookies.<br /><br />I really enjoyed eating these cookies. These cookies are crisp which would allow you to dunk them in milk if you prefer or eat them plain. Their flavor is a nice combination between sweet and coffee. Imagine coffee ice cream and now translate that flavor into a cookie without the creamy flavor of ice cream. Maybe a better analogy would be chocolate covered espresso beans without such a strong chocolate or coffee flavor. I found there a nice pick me up when I was looking for something sweet with a little bit of a boost.<br /><br />I consider these a special treat that this appears way too fast.

review/summary: Coffee, Chocolate, Cookies... WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?!
review/text: If you like coffee, chocolate & crunchy cookies, I can give you my personal guarantee that YOU WILL LOVE THESE COOKIES!<br /><br />In 2004 I introduced a new cookie concept that was really my husband David's idea. Responding to requests to add cookies to our line-up of wholesale coffee shop desserts, I decided on a cookie that could be dipped in coffee (but not like biscotti). David jokingly suggested, "why don't you just put the coffee into the cookie instead of dunking the  cookie into the coffee?" Mmmm, not a bad idea, I thought.<br /><br />But this proved to be easier said than done. The most challenging part was to get that "just dipped in a latte" flavor, that has now become our hallmark. Coffee flavoring was just too bitter. 14 months of experimenting later, I formulated a specially designed wet cookie dough that would allow coarsely ground espresso beans to actually "brew" into the cookies as they slowly baked. Finally! A chocolate chip cookie that truly tastes like you dunked it in a freshly brewed cup of French Roast coffee... soon named "The Chocolate Chip Espresso".<br /><br />I then added different flavors to eventually produce a line of cookies that reads like the menu board in your favorite coffee shop:<br /><br />"White Chocolate Vanilla Latte". Our signature cookie & best seller, made with Madagascar vanilla, REAL white chocolate pieces & bits of espresso beans.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3BG">White Chocolate Vanilla Latte, 5.25 ounce boxes (pack of 4 boxes)</a><br />or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3AC">White Chocolate Vanilla Latte, .09 ounce, 2-cookie single-serve packs (box of 24 packs)</a><br /><br />"Almond Mocha". Made with just the right blend of cocoa, milk chocolate chips, almond flavoring & espresso bits.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3B6">Almond Mocha, 5.25 ounce boxes (pack of 4 boxes)</a><br />or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3A2">Almond Mocha, .09 ounce, 2-cookie single-serve packs (box of 24 packs)</a><br /><br /> "Cinnamon Cappuccino". A snickerdoodle powered up a notch with chocolate chips and coffee bits.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3BQ">Cinnamon Cappuccino, 5.25 ounce boxes (pack of 4 boxes)</a><br />or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3AM">Cinnamon Cappuccino, .09 ounce, 2-cookie single-serve packs (box of 24 packs)</a><br /><br />"White Chocolate Mocha Latte". A rich mocha cookie with REAL white chocolate chips and espresso bits.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3CA">White Chocolate Mocha Latte, 5.25 ounce boxes (pack of 4 boxes)</a><br /><br />And of course our first-ever espresso cookie: "Chocolate Chip Espresso". A buttery, classic chocolate chip cookie super-charged with bits of espresso beans.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3C0">Chocolate Chip Espresso, 5.25 ounce boxes (pack of 4 boxes)</a><br />or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N3AW">Chocolate Chip Espresso, .09 ounce, 2-cookie single-serve packs (box of 24 packs)</a><br /><br />AMAZON EXCLUSIVE -- and a great way to try several flavors at once! Try a "Mixed Box" that comes with 6, 2-cookie single-serve packs of each flavor: Chocolate Chip Espresso; White Chocolate Vanilla Latte; Almond Mocha; & Cinnamon Cappuccino.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H9N39S">Mixed Flavors, .09 ounce packs (box of 24 packs)</a><br /><br />Java Bites Espresso Cookies quickly became the ONLY product that we manufacture. Until now they were only available through gift stores, specialty food stores, coffee shops, and gift basket companies. In response to numerous emails requesting that we sell direct to the public, we are pleased to now offer them through Amazon.com.<br /><br />I hope you will let us become a part of your "healthy indulgences"!<br /><br />Leslie Estes

review/summary: These cookies are ADDICTING!!!
review/text: These cookies are amazing and very addicting.  I love the smoothe white chocolate chips with the espresso taste.  Definately a great buy for a very versatile cookie.  I would HIGHLY reccommend these cookies to anyone!  With the holidays coming, I will be ordering these for gifts for teachers, coworkers, and family members.  What a great gift idea.  I have also used these cookies and incorporated them into wonderful desserts for potlucks and they have been a huge success.

review/summary: I sold my soul to El Diablo!
review/text: ***Edited to add:*** I ordered this when it was sold out, so it was pretty fresh when it finally came to me after a week presumably right after they reordered it--I didn't check the roast date, but it got nice and foamy on top while brewing in the French press. Ordering when Amazon is out of stock is probably the key to guaranteeing you get fresh-ish beans. Requires patience, but if you don't live somewhere you can run out and buy a bag and don't feel like paying crazy shipping fees from the Intelligentsia site, what you gonna do?<br /><br />This coffee has a vivid, complex, dark flavor, yet it's incredibly smooth with no bitterness if you brew it properly. I'm not usually a black coffee girl, but I can drink this one straight up.<br /><br />Since Intelligentsia's description says El Diablo Roast offers a look at some of the coffees available each season, I'd imagine different "vintages" would have a slightly different flavor.<br /><br />Check out the brew guides on Intelligentsia's website. The French press guide will yield you a pretty strong cup if you follow the proportions (which go by grams of coffee to grams of water). But that's just how I like it!<br /><br />Finally, if you're going to drop this much cash on coffee, be sure to buy the whole bean and grind it yourself. I hope Amazon gets more in soon!

review/summary: Love, love, love these!
review/text: I love most of the flavors of this soup, but this is my favorite.  I usually add lots of things to it to make it a hearty vegetarian meal.  I like to throw broccoli florets into the water before I add the noodles, and then add a fried egg and some marinated tofu cubes.  I could live off this meal for months!  I am bummed it's not available at Amazon right now.  I cannot find these in my area at all!

review/summary: Nice change from fried ramen noodles
review/text: These are sold at my local Ingles supermarket. I have tried a variety of flavors and have found most of them to be pleasing. I do find them to be overpriced at the grocery store at around $1.50 a pack. Amazon's price is WAY overpriced.

review/summary: Great Taste, Ridiculous Price
review/text: This stuff tastes totally awesome; I would give it five stars for taste alone.  The price, however leaves much to be desired.  At my local Costco, they sell a 44 oz. tub of this for only $6.95.  Not only do you pay drastically less, but you also get an additional 8 ounces of delicious pub mix as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this item, but do what I do and get it from Costco.  For a company that calls itself 'Top Notch Bargains', I think their prices are a notch or two above that of Whole Foods.

review/text: This item is normally delicious...However, the item was shipped out of date by World Trade..It was stale and oily...I returned both Pub Mix Tubs to Amazon...Amazon's return policy and easy axcess is awesome...I ordered it directly from the company itself later that week (UTZ)...Inquired about the dates on the items and was told (by UTZ)that date is the best sale by date...This date was a month old when rec'd...Not Amazon's fault but, the third party who had it in stock...All dates should be checked before it's sent out to consumers...Good business and common sense...Amazon, you still rock...Not your fault...Thank you

review/summary: The BEST!
review/text: OH my gosh....this is the best pizza sauce ever! I bought it on a whim at the store and fell in LOVE! I went from never making homemade pizza, to making it at least twice a month. This sauce is so easy and so, so good. It is flavorful but not too strong. There aren't too many onions in it and just enough spices. It's much better than I can make on my own!<br /><br />My favorite pizza is just a simple dough, a light coating of this sauce, and some fresh grated (preferably locally made, but ALWAYS premium) mozzarella. It doesn't need anything else for me. One tip, coat the edge of the crust with premium olive oil like Zoe, it really makes a difference!

review/summary: Received expired product
review/text: I ordered this product on June 27, 2012 and received it June 29. The best by date stickered on the package is "030712". Assuming traditional month-day-year dating, that's almost four months past. Even if it's day-month-year dating, it's still close. I would not have even questioned the age of the product if the sticker wasn't there, but why add a 'best by' sticker if it's not needed...and why send it out if it's out of it's freshness period? Because I'm not the one consuming the product, I can't say if the product is bad or not, but I did notice that so far only ONE out of three of the treats I've used actually fits in the Romp n Chomp bone that I bought it for. This totally defeats the purpose of challenging the dog and giving him a treat that takes time to consume when I leave. Instead he grabs the refill treat and wolfs it down. Disappointing since he otherwise likes the bone. I'd hoped to be able to use it as intended with a treat insert once in awhile.

review/summary: Stale/Dried Out
review/text: I just received these refills and opened the box to find that they are stale. I've purchased these in the past from a pet store and they've always been firm, but still chewy. The ones I received from this order are dry and most have cracked into pieces. They are not out of date and the packaging was intact (as far as I could tell), but they are definitely unusable. I gave this 2 stars because my experiences with this product when purchased at the pet store have been okay.

review/summary: Good quality and good value.
review/text: My older cat was totally spoiled by her previous owner, who fed her Friskies dry/wet food all the time (which contributed to her teeth getting rotten). I was able to switch her to Purina One Smartblend (a much healthier dry food) but was looking to add something with less fillers and more high-quality ingredients. We adopted a kitten who was eating Science Diet dry food at the shelter and I decided to switch her over to California Natural as well (SD has a lot of fillers in it despite being "Vet recommended"). CN was recommended at 3 different pet food stores by the employees, who feed it to their own cats (I also scored a few sample bags to test on my girls, which they took to without any problems).<br /><br />Both of my cats love this food and haven't had any adverse reactions. Their coats are still thick and shiny and their litter boxes are easier to clean as their poop is more compressed. The kibble itself is somewhat dense, but the crunchiness helps clean their teeth, which is a bonus. I mix CN with the Purina One and it's been a great combination thus far.<br /><br />As for LCM's review, if the company switch bothers you then fine, choose another brand. I was unaware of any change as the ingredients list is exactly the same as it was last year. If something does change, I'll edit this review, but for now, we're all satisfied.
