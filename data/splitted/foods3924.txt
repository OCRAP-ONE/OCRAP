review/summary: Cat loves it, and doesn't scarf it down like junk food
review/text: I judge this product by my cat's reaction and health. She is not overweight nor underweight, she seems to like this product, she eats it easily but not greedily like it is junk food (which she has done with other brands). The price on subscribe and save is generally great, so overall we like this product and it is easy to purchase it from Amazon.

review/summary: Healthy food, Healthy dog!
review/text: Love the convenience of having this dog food delivered once per month, every month!<br /><br />Love the healthful effects its had on my 12 year old prancing and still lively love of my life standard poodle!<br /><br />He got very sick on blue buffalo and it cost around 300 to have him checked out.....nothing wrong, except his food!<br /><br />Loved getting the free treat pack with the dog food....but they stoopped doing this!  Why Newman's own stopped this, I'll never know.<br /><br />But, I like it so much I've ordered the treats to be delivered every two months, and have just subscribed for their cat food to also be delivered.<br /><br />What you spend on good food you save in vet bills!<br /><br />Love Newman's!!!!

review/summary: Looks healthy but cat won't eat it
review/text: The first thing I noticed about this cat food is that it doesn't smell horrendous. I poured some into my cat's food bowl and she ran over and started devouring it. She didn't do that with the other brands I've given her (IAMS, Hill's science diet, the goodlife recipe). She seems to really like this food and she hasn't thrown it up. I'm not a vet so I don't know how nutritionally sound this product is, but it lists a lot of organic ingredients and it has chicken as one of the first ingredients. I'll post pictures of the bag with that information. I know Newman's Own is a quality brand (I use their pasta sauces and salad dressing) so I imagine this product is high quality as well. It sure seems to be.<br /><br />Update 8-16-12: My cat does not seem to like it anymore after the first week. I mixed it with her old food and she picks around to avoid the Newman's Own pellets. I tried putting just Newman's Own in one dish and the other cat food in another. She won't eat the Newman's Own when it's separate either. I guess she prefers the cheaper cat food.

review/summary: Yummy and Healthy
review/text: For alcohol-free vanilla, this one is both delicious and healthy.  It is great to cook with or to add to your 'raw' recipes, and the flavor is very true.  There is no 'off' flavor that some vanillas can have.  It has only glycerine and water as additional ingredients.  Some other alcohol-free vanillas have corn syrup, and who wants corn syrup?  This can be hard to find in some stores.  Our local organic grocer seems to have trouble ordering it for me (that would be on them, not on Frontier), so ordering through Amazon has proven to be very convenient.  Enjoy!

review/text: This has a very strong vanilla taste to it, but the glycerin has a strange after taste to it. If you are using it in recipes where it is not very diluted (like a beverage) you might notice it. It's a little thicker than normal vanilla extract too. But if you are looking for a vanilla extract without the taste of alcohol (like a milkshake) it's a good choice. I've been using it in my protein shakes and it tastes good.<br /><br />J.Ja

review/summary: Frontier Vanilla Flavor, Excellent Taste! (Gluten free, Alcohol free)
review/text: I have been using Frontier Vanilla Flavor for over a year now.  I absolutely love this Vanilla. Have used it in all my cooking, baking and protein shakes. Wonderful Bright Vanilla Taste, Yum Yum. . .  I also love the texture, which is a little thicker than most Vanilla&iexcl;�s.<br />Here are the Ingredients:  Glycerin, Fair Trade Certified, Vanilla Bean Extractive, and Water.<br />For those of you who don&iexcl;�t know what Glycerin is it is a natural product made from vegetable oil, often coconut or palm oil.<br /><br />Read more: [...]<br />So, it&iexcl;�s very safe. If you are having problems with Coconut and Palm Oil from which Vegetable Glycerin is made from please read,  &iexcl;�Know your Fats&iexcl;� The Complete Primer for Understanding the nutrition of Fats, Oils, and Cholesterol by Mary G. Enig, PH.D.<br /><br />Anyway, Frontier Vanilla Flavor is a wonderful Vanilla to us in every baking, cooking and drink you can think of.<br /><br />The next thing I have to mention is that Amazon.com and it&iexcl;�s sellers do a wonderful job of replacing any bottles that come accidently open in shipping.  My last shipment had some problems with a the seal being broken on one of the Vanilla Bottles and I immediately notified the seller and they immediately sent me a brand new bottle to replace the bad one.  I was amazed at the service and will continued to buy from Amazon, because of their wonderful service.  So, both the Frontier Vanilla Flavor and the Customer Services that quickly replaced my bad bottle deserve 5 healthy stars each.  Which would give them 10 stars in my book. Thank you and yes, I will continue buying from Amazon, because of their wonderful quick service.  I just thought I should mention that here also.<br /><br />Oh one more thing.  Frontier Vanilla Flavor is Gluten free, and Corn free, because it&iexcl;�s Alcohol Free, which is also a big plus in my book.  I get to enjoy my food rather than be sick.  So, thank Frontier for making such a wonderful product.  I will continue to buy this product. �

review/summary: The Best
review/text: We have a year old pug and have always been mindful of nutrition since pugs have a tendency to become overweight.  When I saw this food, I thought it was just a "hype", but after reviewing its contents, we decided to give it a try!  Our dog absolutely LOVES this stuff and I feel it is nutritionally balanced.  Odd that it seems to have the same caloric value as other foods not designated for the needs of this breed, but perhaps it is simply absorbed differently.  Our vet advised us to feed him 1/4 cup twice a day which is considerably less than is suggested on the bag, but he seems to be doing great.  I would highly recommend this food to any pug owner!

I would recommend it and amazon definitely has the best price but you still are purchasing a higher cost product here. for how much my picky guy loves it, it's worth it for us!

review/summary: It's been a lifesaver
review/text: After having the most perfect pug with absolutely no issues for years, I recently took in a rescue pug who was overweight and has a slew of problems with his skin, ears, eyes, etc. I tried a couple of different medications and foods to try to help. Royal Canin Pug food was recommended to me because of the weight management and the ingredients to help with skin conditions. My little guy LOVES this stuff. He is harping at me every morning and night for his food. He is slimming down but the best part is that his skin is clearing up. He no longer has the hotspots on his back and his face is quickly healing as well. I am using ear drops, but believe that combined with this food, he is healing better. He no longer itches all day and he's noticeably happier. Love this stuff and love that the price on Amazon is cheaper than the local stores.

review/summary: Canned Mushrooms
review/text: I bought these because canned mushrooms have been out of stock at my local Wegman's for a long time (Upstate NY).  These are very beefy sized pieces & stems; Fabulous Beef-Steak Restaurant size & quality.  Unfortunately, they are rendered inedible by one major flaw- WAAAY TOO heavily salted: 550 mg. sodium/serving... (A normal bowl of mushrooms is a double serving = 1100 mg. sodium/bowl!)  1/10th that amount, would be PLENTY of sodium (salt).  USDA RDA = 2400 mg. daily (max.).  All I can taste is salt salt salt.  I ordered 4 cans, & am going to try soaking an entire can overnight in a giant bowl of water, (in fridge), to see if the water will dilute the high salt content.  If not, I'll have to give the 2 remaining cans to a food drive.  I will never order these again, due solely to the exhorbitantly high sodium content, which completely ruins these otherwise extra large mushrooms. Obviously I should have checked the sodium content, before purchasing.  My bad.

review/summary: Roland adds a pinch of ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
review/text: Thanks to Roland for adding a very small amount of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to these sliced button mushrooms grown in China.  Vitamin C not only helps to preserve the freshness of these mushrooms but also blocks the formation of cancer-causing nitrosamines, which tend to always form in all salted foods.  Scientific studies from China have good news for mushroom lovers:  [Please click "Comment"]

review/summary: These are really good!
review/text: There are only a few ingredients in these cookies, so they are very simple, but hey... simple is good! They have a buttery flavor with a crumbly texture that goes very well with coffee or tea. They arrived very fresh. The cookies are about one inch square each. I thought it was nice that they come in 5 oz. portions, sealed in individual cans; they don't have a chance to go stale before you get a chance to eat them all. My three year old really loves them as a treat.

review/summary: Delicious and appropriately sized!
review/text: Yes, these suckers are not enormous balls of candy, but they are a terrific option for those of us who want to buy organic, non GMO sweets for ourselves and our children.  We are handing these out for Halloween this year, even though it would be cheaper to buy the jumbo bags of chocolate candy at the warehouse stores.  I personally want to support companies that don't use artificial colors and flavors, and are not contributing to the obesity problems in our country. The 5 lb. bag also comes nearly evenly disbursed between flavors (we checked).  The blueberry is our favorite, but they are all tasty.

review/summary: A big hit!
review/text: I have to say that i am generally skeptical of things that have healthy or organic labels on them. I thought they'd be a good idea though as I started a new semester in college that consisted of all adults over 21 but they're also all under 25. I did not know any of them or what they might be allergic to so I decided to get a sweet treat that was allergen free. I also know the organic thing is big especially among young people. I know it was slightly risky but I ordered the big 5lb bag and I was very pleased admittedly. The distribution of the flavors was pretty even I got 40-50 lollipops of every flavore listed. I know this because I divided them into individual bags each with one of each flavor of lollipop in them and got 40 bags with a few leftovers of every flavor. I handed them out and they recived a great reception. Some of the flavors are more subtle than others because they're made from natural fruit extracts and some people didnt care for certain flavors as others but they all seemed to be mixed and based on individual preferences but over they were a really big hit. I was instantly popular right away and some of them stated even the kids in their families loved them. I immediately tried every flavor and I like them all, some more than others, but again its just a preference thing. I'll be ordering them again for future occassions and just wanted to relate my positive experience to those considering the purchase. I hope everyone has as pleasant an experience with this product as I have.

review/text: I had morning sickness so bad it lasted all day and for 5.5 months, ugh!  I called it baby flu since there was little relief.  Ginger ale and YummyEarth organic candies were the only two things that settled my stomach enough to eat a small meal.  The assorted bag was nice to switch it up depending on my taste that day.  After I delivered my baby girl, I still enjoyed these when I have a dry mouth or would like a little sweetness.  It was so nice to find a tasty organic hard candy, so much tastier than Preggo Pops!

Now, I love these lollipops too.  They are the best!!<br /><br />My son's favoriate flavor is the Cherry.  The Sour Apple is a great flavor too.  They taste just like Granny Smith apples!  I got a lick of my husband's Mango lollipop and wish there were more of them in the five-pound bag, they're too good to describe.  Pomegranite, Strawberry, ...LOVE-EM!<br /><br />In short, If you are looking for a great treat for your little gremlins, these lollipops are it.  They are easy to take with you wherever you are going, and it seems to get quieter whenever the kids stick them into their mouths!  I keep a couple in my purse.

Some (not all) of the TooBerry Blueberry in this bag do indeed did taste like wet dog! Most tasted fine though. All of the other flavors taste fine. How can one batch can taste great and the next taste horrendous? Better quality control is needed, at least on one flavor.<br /><br />However, I did just order a 3rd bag (I eat way too many of them).

review/text: This was our second order of the 5 pound bag and we are still delighted with these lollipops.  My son has multiple food allergies and sensitivities and these candies have never caused a reaction.  It is so nice to be able to give him a treat like every other child.  There is only one flavor in the mix that he does not care for, but I like it so it works out well!<br /><br />The bag contained 323 pops and all the flavors promised.  All candies and their wrappers were in good condition.  I find it to be a fair assortment.  The wet face watermelon had the highest percentage at above fourteen percent, the lowest was a tie between sour apple tart and googly grape at almost eleven percent each.

review/summary: Great Lollipops.  Even Grape tasted great!
review/text: These lollies are delish.  I love all the flavors, even grape, which is usually not my flavor of choice.  It just might end up being my favorite flavor of these.  But then again, it would be hard to choose, because they are all just so darn good.  Watermelon is my least favorite, but my son's #1 request, so it works out perfectly.<br /><br />I got a pretty even assortment, ranging from about 30 to about 50 of each flavor.  I counted about 320 pops, so pretty close to the estimated number. But, these are based on weight, not quantity, when packaged.<br /><br />I am on weight watchers and 3 lollipops are 2 points on the new points plus program.  So I get to satisfy my sweet tooth, without a lot of guilt.<br /><br />I bought this 5lbs assortment and also the smaller container, so that I could refill the container from this bag.  Let's just say, I have enough lollipops for the rest of the year!  (but I don't see a problem with that) :)

They are 100% all natural - nothing is artificial in them. I didn't want to buy them something with a lot of added sugar - which these don't have. What's also great about these lollipops is there are a lot of flavors to choose from. My nieces love the variety and love the taste. And since this was a 5 pound bag and thus there were lots of lollipops I took some for myself and I love the taste as well. There isn't a flavor I don't like.

review/text: Yummy Earth makes awesome lollipops!  It is so nice for my daughter to share these with her friends who have food allergies and know they are safe for our gluten free needs too.  The only flavor that has gotten a thumbs down from our family and most (all?) of her friends is Tooberry Blueberry.  Though they are organic, that flavor tastes artificial and rather unpleasant.  I figure at some point, there will be nothing left but TooBerry in the bag.<br /><br />I have used these to melt and mold with my own hard candy molds and they came out great!  It is so hard to find special occasion candy that is organic/natural, allergy friendly and reasonably priced.  None of the kids get left out on special days!

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: First of all, I just want to say that I hate lollipops. And I do mean HATE. Even dumdums seem to taste really artificial and just like colored sugar. I got these originally because I was intrigued by the organic label. I love that you can actually understand what's in these items and they have a video showing it being made. Great unique taste as well. Definitely well worth the price! My family and friends love it. The assortment is great and they actually taste like different things rather than a lot of candy that's out there.

Just be careful that you understand that once you share them than you will have less to enjoy for yourself  because people keep asking me for more.

You cant even believe what the ingredients are because they taste so good. Several flavors and the sour apple isnt to tart by the way. Amazing and thumbs up to the makers of the product!

review/summary: Much Improved
review/text: I first started buying these when they only had three or four flavors. Now they've expanded their flavors and I like the new assortment, especially the blueberry and strawberry flavors. All the flavors are yummy. There isn't one that we don't like. Also, the ingredient list is more specific than it used to be. No corn syrup, which is the main reason I purchase these. I also like that they are organic. Sure, they aren't exactly like "normal" lollipops, and they contain sugar, but I'd much rather give my children these than artificially colored and flavored candy.

They have natural ingredients and taste fantastic.  Believe all the hype in the other reviews.  I finally did, and trust me.... it's all true!!

review/summary: Yummy Lollipops, but...
review/text: I ordered these to hand them out for Halloween this year, so of course I had to sample some for myself.<br /><br />The lollipops them self are good. In my opinion, they are very sweet and even though some people say they are small... I think they are just the right size for a quick sugar fix.<br /><br />My problem, and I'm probably just nitpicking, is that the stick is so frail. By the end of sucking down a lollipop, the paper part that the stick is made out of would get wet and fall apart, and I'll end up eating some paper at the end. This happens every time.<br /><br />Maybe, if I bite and chew the candy I wouldn't get to where the stick would fall apart... but I suck down and let it sit in my mouth while doing stuff, like playing video game, or watching TV, etc.<br /><br />Other than that, the candies taste great... but I really wish the stick wouldn't tear apart every time, and I end up having to spit out the paper at the end.<br /><br />The flavors in the bag is pretty evenly distributed. So far, I tried all the flavors, and they all taste great. I like the Mango, and the blueberry the most. I think I will keep some for myself and not give all of them away for Halloween.

review/summary: How all candy should be!!
review/text: I was a bit skeptical about these lollipops because I know certain things just don't taste good when they are organic especially sugary indulgences. So I would always pass up on the buying them. The other day I happened to come across a bag of assorted ones at TJ Maxx. I was craving something sweet some it was just perfect timing that I happened to come across these. I purchased a bag of these and I will be totally honest with you guys!!! These are by far the best lollipops I have ever tasted in fact the best hard candy!!! They are just bursting with flavor!! The best part is that you aren't consuming artificial laboratory made candy. In response to the post bellow, the size is actually just right because a lollipop isn't supposed something you splurge on. It just a little simple indulgence that is good to have from time to time. Kudos Yummy Earth!!! :D

review/text: I purchased these suckers on the recommendation of several friends. They all raved, but to be honest, I had my reservations. All I can say is WOW! Not only do my children (4 and 2 years old) love them, so do my husband and I. They have flavors that you don't see in your mediocre pack of Dum Dums. The Pomegranate Pucker and Mango Tango are our favorites, which is good because it seems they are in the majority in this bag. I do wish the flavors were a little more evenly distributed but, overall this is a great product and we will def. be back for more!

They're sweet, but they also have a little bit of a sour flavor.  And they don't taste "off" like some all-natural foods.  They're just yummy.

review/text: They arrived with prime shipping in August perfect - not sticky, not melted.  The distributor for these tells in one of the reviews that you have to order where it says "Ships from and sold by Amazon" to get an even number of all flavors. Look over to the side under the cart and see the vendors listed.  That's what I had to do to find the ones sold/shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />They taste great.  The wrapper for each lollipop tells the flavor.  Three suckers are 70 calories.

review/text: The name says it all...  These lollipops are definitely yummy!  My two year old loves them and I do too.  They're delicious, fruity, not too sweet, and contain no artificial colors, flavors, or nasty HFCS. And at only 20 calories per pop, what's not to love?<br /><br />For those of you who are concerned about the new "even assortment," here's the break-down of flavors in the package I just received:<br /><br />Blueberry - 54<br />Mango - 48<br />Apple - 42<br />Pomegranate - 39<br />Strawberry - 39<br />Watermelon - 38<br />Cherry - 30<br />Grape - 28<br /><br />So, it's still not a perfectly exact assortment, but it's close enough for us.<br /><br />(Incidentally, for any expectant mothers who might be reading this review, please note that these lollies are just tart enough to take the edge off that pregnancy nausea. The "Pomegranate Pucker" flavor seems to be particularly good for soothing my queasy tummy.)

When I saw these in such a large bag, I thought it would be a great idea to save some money and have a yummy, not-so-bad-for-you, treat on hand. I was very pleased when the package arrived! Lots of different flavors and the bag is much bigger than I thought it would be! This will last our family for a long, long time as we are not big on sweets (well, I'm not big on giving my kids sweets I should say! ;).  My daughter reacts poorly to artificial food colorings so this product is a great way for me to reward her, without a total melt down later.  Overall, we are extremely pleased with these lollipops!

review/text: When these went on sale (5 lb bag for $13.50) I jumped at the opportunity to get a bag.  I have two toddlers, so the small size of candy is great for them to hold and their little mouths.  Good portion size, too.  I use them for rewards, special treats after a meal, or to throw in as party favors.  There are SO many, I'm sure it'll take us at least a year to get through them all!  The taste is pretty good too, not too sweet or bland, and I just love the fact that they're organic of course.  They definitely have more flavor than your run-of-the-mill lollipop, though they get just as sticky :)  We love them and give them 5 stars!
