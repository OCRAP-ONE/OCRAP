review/summary: nutritious but odd consistency
review/text: Like the other cerelacs from europe, this cerelac, when mixed properly, forms a pancake batter consistency. If not mixed properly (with warm water), then it can also get clunky, similar to pancake batter which is lumpy. In any case, when mixed properly, my son will eat it; if it is lumpy, my son has a problem biting into the raw dough. If my 19 month son refuses to eat much throughout the day, then I put it into his milk. I simply add 1 scoop into a cup of milk, warm it up, and shake. this way i know he is getting nutrients in the day despite not eating.

review/summary: The only cereal my boy will eat
review/text: We discovered this brand while traveling to the Philippines over the holidays.  In a time of jet lag and tropical heat, this was one of the few items my boy would consistently eat.<br /><br />It can be made with hot or cold water, which is a plus.  Apparently quite popular in the Philippines, this product is basically unknown in the US.  Probably because it is quite sweet.<br /><br />He appears to have outgrown his dependence on this but we sometimes use it as thickener/ filler with yogurt or soups

review/summary: Which is better, the Lavazza Gold or Black can variety?  Well, I'll tell you.
review/text: The major difference between the Lavazza Qualita Oro Espresso (the gold can) and the Lavazza Italian Coffee, Caffe Espresso (the black can) coffees is that the Gold can Lavazza uses 100% Arabica beans from two different countries and the Black can Lavazza uses 100% Arabica coffee beans from only one country.<br /><br />The Lavazza Gold AND Black canned coffees BOTH are:<br />1. Lavazza coffee<br />2. Made using 100% Arabica coffee beans<br />3. Blended from 100% Arabica beans.<br />4. Blended to make espresso<br />5. Roasted and Packaged in Italy.<br /><br />Differences:<br />The Lavazza Gold can coffee uses 100% Arabica beans from two countries:<br />1. Central America and,<br />2. Africa.<br />Note: Lavazza states that the Central American beans in this blend contributes a floral aroma.<br /><br />The Lavazza Black can coffee uses 100% Arabica beans from only one country:<br />1. South America.<br />Note: Lavazza states that the South American beans in this blend are sweet and aromatic.<br /><br />Opinion:  Both coffees are excellent.  They have different characteristics and while everyone pretty much agrees that both are excellent coffees, some will favor the Black Can variety over the Gold Can - and vice-versa.  NEITHER are bad coffees, they just appeal to different tastes and one might perform better in your coffee making procedure/equipment than the other.  That still doesn't make either one "bad", it just makes one variety better suited to a particular brewing procedure and to personal taste.<br /><br />I prefer one variety to the other MOST of the time - primarily because of the excellent result/taste I get from one using my primary coffee making procedure.  When I use a completely different system AND procedure for making coffee, I prefer the other variety.  BOTH are excellent coffees but one is more likely to perform better in your coffee making method and system and give you better results than the other.  Properly made, I sincerely believe that BOTH coffees are EXCELLENT!  Now, please excuse me while I go make myself a fresh mug of Joe (quadruple espresso, nothing added). MMMmmmmmmmmmm....

review/summary: Perfect for Moka Pot
review/text: Usually purchased at my brick and mortar stores, I am so glad to find Oro on Amazon.  Looking at the best by dates, the Amazon cans are much fresher, though they look different from that on the site as the cans are smooth rather than ribbed.  Though the smooth can which was delivered was not as pretty as the one pictured, who cares?  The coffee was fresher and it delivered the perfect smooth balance that Oro does in a Bialetti Moka Pot.  This is the perfect late/cappucino style smooth and sweeter blend than Black, and is certainly a crowd pleaser.  Thankfully I no longer need to buy out all the cans at the store anymore thanks to the Amazon subscription service!

review/summary: Delicioso!
review/text: I am a LOYAL fan of Lavazza.  For two years I lived in Caracas, Venezuela and I would order both Lavazza Black and Gold because I needed my at home espresso! I read the reviews from others, but I had to taste it for myself.  I then moved to Decatur, Al. and... THEY HAVE NO LAVAZZA!! So AGAIN, I continued to order to get my fix. I found myself narrowing down which coffee tasted better.  Although the Black gives a true espresso hit, it is VERY bold.. but, it leaves a sort of tart aftertaste.  The Gold too gives a great espessso hit, gives you a coffee/espresso richness, but the taste over all is WONDERFUL! I look forward to each brew because it truly is a tasty experience. YES, GOLD is my choice of Lavazza!!  Happy Cupfulls to All.

review/text: This is just what I was hoping for in an espresso grind. I've tried many different brands from Amazon in the past 6 months, including Lavazza's Black can variety.<br /><br />The Gold can defeats all others I have tried, by far. It has such a rich smooth taste and packs a very strong flavor, without the unnecessary bitter aftertaste like most grinds. (Especially with sub-par machines)<br /><br />I'll be ordering this again and again, just because I find it the best I've experienced.

review/text: This is very good italian coffee and is worth the $12/lb price. It is medium roast and very smooth with no bitter taste. I find that it comes out best when you use a percolator rather than a drip coffee pot. It is espresso ground so you may end up with some grounds in your coffee using a percolator. If you like Starbuck's, don't buy this coffee.

review/text: While any good Italian has a favorite "small-brand" coffee that is only available in her or his neighborhood "bar" of choice, Lavazza is a good standby for those of us on the far side of the Atlantic.  Amazon's price on Lavazza -- especially if you use their "subscribe and save" option -- really can't be beat, it's about 2/3 of what most retailers in my area charge.  Definitely recommended.

review/text: What I received is not the real Lavazza coffee and I should know since I am from Italy and from the same area where this coffee is produced. When I opened the can, there was no coffee smell and when I made a cup it did not taste like the real thing. In fact, it tasted terrible. I usually buy the product from the local Italian food store and I can assure you what I received from Amazon was not the same thing. I am very disappointed and I will be very careful before I buy any food items from Amazon in the future since, apparently, they cannot be returned.

In my opinion, the Lavazza black can of coffee has a better aroma and a smother taste.

review/text: We have been ordering Lavazza Qualita Oro from Amazon for a couple of years now (a great value with Subscribe and Save), and if you like a coffee that is full-bodied but not bitter, it is excellent for filter or drip coffee. However, we've recently started using a French press, and this grind is just too fine for that method. I'll be looking for a similar coffee of coarser grind (e.g. Illy with the blue band on the label, though it costs more than Lavazza).

review/text: Thank you Amazon for having such great prices for this Qualita Oro coffee.  Lavazza certainly live up to the hype.  An amazing blend, buttery, strong but not overly sweet.  This is the only bean that lives in my Moka maker.  Fantastic smell and color when you pop the lid.  No bitterness, just a full strong taste.  Even the after taste is extremely pleasant.  I usually prefer tea, but I will have this at least twice a day.  The Qualita Oro is my favorite out of the Lavazza line.  It is finely ground, but matches a Moka stovetop maker perfectly.  This may be too fine for a coffee machine though.  No regrets, I always keep at least 8 tins in the kitchen.  This is one of my favorite items to stock up on.

review/summary: Review of Lavazza Qualita Oro Expresso
review/text: I am a regular expresso coffee drinker of some duration, having been brought up in an Italian household. Further, I've lived in Rome and have spent 13 of the last 14 Septembers in Italy.  In short, I have some experience in the matter.<br /><br />It has been my custom to bring home various expresso coffees from Italy upon our return. Lavazza makes several types of coffee, and I've tried them in the past. The results of my purchase of the 8 oz cans confirms my earlier suspicion that it is of modest and moderate quality. The brewed coffee has a cloudy and turbid appearance, with fair taste quality.<br /><br />In my view, and that of most Italians, if one can only buy Lavazza Qualita Oro, then do so, but, unquestionably, Illy is the brand to buy.<br /><br />vatvince'37

review/summary: Good Espresso
review/text: I'm no connoisseur of coffee, but this is the only espresso that my guy will drink apart from the packs he brings back from his favorite cafe in Rome.  I will say that this doesn't have that burnt taste that so many dark roasts have.

review/summary: The best
review/text: It is the best coffee I've ever bought to make coffee at home (not in the coffee maker). I enjoy it every morning. Can't live without Lavazza Oro. I had a problem when I first came to Unites States (I'm from Europe). I couldn't find good and tasty coffee here. I kept trying different kinds, spend a lot of money and then I found this in Italian store, then on Amazon.com (it's a little bit cheaper than in a store). And it is cheaper then those untasty ground coffees in the regular stores. It is really good. I better not drink any coffee if I dont have Lavazza.

review/summary: Good, but not Illy
review/text: Illy had been my preferred brand of espresso, but after moving recently the closest source was 15 miles away and exorbitantly expensive. After shopping around for alternatives, I decided to give the Lavazza a try.<br /><br />To be clear, I am not an espresso snob. I may roast my own beans for drip coffee, but my espresso generally goes into milk and syrup. That said, I do think there is a noticeable quality difference between the Illy and Lavazza, with the Illy clearly coming out on top.<br /><br />If you are drinking straight espresso and have a good machine, you might want to look for alternatives. If you're primarily making coffee drinks and aren't too picky, the Lavazza is a fine choice for about half the price of Illy.

review/summary: A Former Campbell Soup Customer
review/text: This was always one of my favorite Chunky soups.  However it seems that when Campbell started advertising their new 'leaner cuts' they interpreted those words to mean quantity rather than quality. Last can of Sirloin Burger contained 4 pieces of meat (2 per serving).  Same with their Select soup.  My White Bean Chicken Chili also contained 4 pieces of chicken for the 2 servings. Guess it was a way to cut down on production costs but not price. I like to get what, I hope at least, I'm paying for.  I complained to Campbell but never heard back on my e-mail. Since then I have switched to Progresso and other brands.

review/summary: One of the BEST Chunky Soups!
review/text: I LOVE this Soup! Little "burgers" with thick gravy float in a sea of hearty vegetables. Unlike many other canned soups, these have real meat and veggies of "size" that you can sink your teeth into!<br /><br />You do have to be careful of "can size" when comparing prices (for quantity). This size is 10.75 ounces ( the smaller can size), the other reviewers are comparing to the 18.8 ounce sizes mostly seen in the bigger supermarkets and "Box" stores. This size is perfect for me for a quick lunch or snack. I appreciate being able to purchase these in quantity-a "case" price, delivered to my door!<br /><br />Many Amazon buyers may be confused. Yes, you can probably find and purchase this and many other Grocery/Gourmet items somewhere else for less money. Although I am far from wealthy, I use the Grocery  products and delivery "services" Amazon provides as a Convenience. Saves me "tons of time" and for me, my "time" is more valuable than saving a few dollars or searching for sales.<br /><br />I choose to spend my time and energy on more relaxing and creative pursuits, rather than chasing after the best price of cans of soup, gourmet snacks, or favorite cereals. If I can buy it online-I probably will!

Can probably buy the bigger can at walmart for less money per can, but while trying to lose weight, the smaller can is nicer.<br /><br />A really good cheap meal with a half a cup of brown rice made in a rice cooker.  put it in a bowl, add a little garlic powder, add can of soup, mix it in, and microwave for 3 minutes.  Really good and filling.  Add it with a glass of v8 for a really filling and healthy meal.<br /><br />Besides price, only other drawback i see is a lot of sodium.  But I'm a big guy and still learning about this stuff.

review/summary: Easy to install, works great
review/text: I bought this after my two labs decided that the neighbors yard was more fun than my yard.  My neighbor didn't mind the company but then they decided to expand their travels into his neighbors yard!  And from there they had access to the street and beyond.  I have a long length of chain link fence that I could not prevent them from digging under.  This put a stop to their unauthorized playdates!  It was easy to install - it does not require much experience or handyman abilities.  I used some pvc pipe to thread the wire through in areas I did not want anyone getting zapped, such as the gate entry.  I also insulated the wire in areas where there are bushes and grass growing.  It produces a memorable, effective but not injury producing zap.  My dog got zapped once and has since stayed a few feet away from the fence.  When he got zapped he was startled and jumped back.<br />Tips for setting up - the wire can't touch the chain link or supporting metal posts.  Use flexible irrigation hose or pvc pipe in areas where the wire might get grounded and them become ineffective.<br />NEGATIVE: It is not weather proof.  It puzzles me that a product obviously designed for outdoor use is sensitive to moisture.  It is not always practical to put the control indoors.  I have it inside a plastic "shoe box".  They really should consider where this product will be used and make it more durable.

review/summary: VERY DISAPOINTED!
review/text: I have installed this product per the instructions. It has produced maybe 5 shocks in the past 2 months. Most of the time you can hold onto the wire and nothing happens. Unfortunately the fur from the dogs insulates them from the wire. The only time i have seen it take effect is when the dogs sniff the wire and even then its not consistent at all. Once they know it doesnt do anything they simply run straight through it. In fact most of the time they stand under the wire with it touching their backs - the light is flashing as it should and still nothing. I have 3 dogs (2 LABS AND A PUG) and not one is remotely afraid of walking straight through the wire. Trouble shooting says its more than likely a bad ground. I have 2' metal rod driven into the ground and it still doesnt work. Like I said... if your pet has hair on it (as most do) this product is useless. Even if they were bald this product would be useless. Dont waste your money!

review/summary: Worth Every Penny - Wellness CORE dry and Wellness Grain Free canned
review/text: Over the last two years, our older cat (now 11 years old) had ongoing issues with diarrhea and vomiting.  After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach.  We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering.<br /><br />She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic.  At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her.<br /><br />Last month I decided I didn't have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms.  I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had.  Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to "getting older" or her "hairball sensitivity" since none of the test had pinpointed a problem.<br /><br />After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food.  I didn't bother to transition her, just started her on it right away.  Besides, she wasn't keeping down much of the other food anyway.  She took to it right away, and she's a picky one.<br />Within two days, the diarrhea was gone.  Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat.  It's been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I'd found this food sooner.  No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box.  My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true.  A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor.  I didn't believe it until I...well...didn't smell it.<br /><br />I'm transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it.  The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food.  You'll also want to note that it doesn't have preservatives, so it's bound to have a stronger smell.  The wet food actually smells good, for cat food.  We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken.  I'm sure our experiences will vary, but I've watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit.  So I'd say she gives her claw of approval.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's pricy, sure.  But it's worth it for us.  Considering the money we're saving in paper towel clean up expenses alone, we're probably saving a buck or two.  I should also thank Amazon for making it Prime eligible, so it's easier to buy it here than to find it in the store.  So now, instead of begging me to feed them, our cats can start mauling the UPS man.

review/summary: Amazing results with this food!
review/text: We tried this food after our 1-year-old Bengal kitten began to develop symptoms of food allergies (gas, bloating, constipation, vomiting).<br />We've been feeding Core for about 4 months now, and she has been symptom-free since the end of the first week!<br /><br />In addition, our 7-year-old cat has also had remarkable and unexpected results.  She has dropped weight, her eyes are bright, kitty acne on her chin has cleared, and she acts like a playful kitten again!<br /><br />Other notes about this food:<br />-Core costs more than our previous food (Pet Promise), but they don't scarf it down like the old food.  They get excited and eat for a few minutes any time the bowl is filled, but then they just return to nibble from time to time.  So, a bag of Core lasts longer.  Perhaps this is because they are getting the protein they need without having to eat pounds of food!<br />-This food smells like fish meal, and tends to give them slightly stinky breath, but it is not overpowering.<br />-Small, round kibble is crunchy, but not as hard and dry as most commercial dry foods. Our picky eater had no problem with the transition.<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend this food.  I'm in awe of the truly priceless health changes we have seen in our cats, and only wish we had made the switch years ago!

I barely got it into the kitchen cabinet without the cats. Needless to say, they HEARTILY APPROVE of the flavor and size of the kibble and scarf this stuff down. Cats are happy, I'm happy! I can also feel good about feeding them one of the few very high protein dry cat foods on the market with premium, wholesome ingredients. As soon as I switched them to CORE, their coats got much softer and silkier and their eyes cleared up, and I know it's not my imagination. They have had ZERO vomiting or stool problems as well. My cats are on their second bag of CORE and will be happily eating CORE for the forseeable future.<br /><br />Cons: The bag's plastic seal is hard to re-seal, it's expensive, and it has a strong fishy odor which my cats love and I don't mind, but it may bother some humans.

review/summary: Start gradually
review/text: My 11-year-old cat is very pioky. She will allow nothing to pass her lips except dry cat food and water...no canned cat food, milk, meat, cheese, treats...nada.  So it is almost impossible to give her any kind of medication.  She had developed a cough and showed some other signs of aging.  After reading about the benefits of a grain-free diet I got Wellness Core for her, which she enjoyed right from the beginning .  But I got too enthusiasitic about finding something she enjoyed so much, and increased the percentage of the new food too fast.  She got the first stomach upset of her life with diarrhea and vomiting and feeling bad for a day, but recovered after a 24-hour fast.  I backed up with the new food, and now, after about six weeks, I am up to about half the Wellness and the rest her old dry food.  She is doing fantasticly!  Her coat is lovely and silky, and she plays more than ever.  The coughing has stopped.  Her stools are great and there has been no vomiting except for two fur balls.  I am delighted with the results of the change to Wellness Core.

review/summary: Wellness Core adult and kitten food
review/text: This is indeed a much better alternative to the mainstream dry cat food. No dyes, (which is more and more the cause of vomiting in cats), no significant carbs-a key cause of feline diabetes which is on the rise also. That said, the reaction of our family's cats to this was mixed, a couple  really liked it, others who are not fond of fish only nibbled at it. It has a significant fishy, meat odor when opened which luckily isn't as pervasive as cooked onions or bacon. However since it is high in protein your cats will use the litter box more often.<br />Lastly, yes, it is more expensive, but how much do you spend on yourself every month for food? You made a commitment when you got your pet, so if you love your cat and want your companion to be healthy and around for a longer time then buy this food, or Innova. This is not a cure, just a healthier more natural diet for your cat.

review/summary: Blocked Bladder
review/text: I switched to this food from Innova. I have a male and a female cat. They've been eating it for about a year. They're 2 years old. The pet store we were buying Innova from started replacing Innova with Innova EVO, and my cats would eat it-- but they were breaking out on their chin from it. They offered other things, but I ended up using this. It was a special order, but I'd sampled the bag and the cat acne disappeared.<br /><br />This past month, my male cat started peeing on the floor. We thought it was due to the stress of moving and our new baby and ignored it. Then he started to meow a ton. We thought he wanted more attention. He was still playing with our other cat. We ignored it. Then he started shaking while trying to walk to the litter box. We took him to the vet at 4a. He had a blocked bladder. Per our vet, he'd been hearing this a lot from male cats who are eating Wellness core. Honestly, I think the only reason he didn't have symptoms sooner is that I was giving him Innova EVO wet food for awhile in addition to the dry food. The other cat didn't eat it, so I didn't want to get food that both of them couldn't enjoy.<br /><br />Fixing a blocked bladder is VERY expensive. Also, there is no guarantee that your cat will be completely unblocked after treatment. Thus far, our guy is doing well. We still crate him to make sure he's peeing, eating, and drinking. It's hard to monitor this with two cats otherwise.<br /><br />Our male cat is now on a Prescription diet from the vet recommended brand that I'm not too fond of... He seems okay. We've switched our other cat onto the same diet.<br /><br />I will never purchase Wellness CORE again.

review/summary: Wellness CORE Cat Food
review/text: Wellness CORE Cat Food was recommended by the vet because my cat is extremely allergenic.  I tried her on it and she took to it immediately and shows no more signs of allergy.  She has gained weight, her hair has gone from dull, unlealthy looking to a sleek, full coat, and her eyes are no longer uninterested.  She is now full of play and quite an adorable pest.  I put my other old cat on it too, and she also shows a vast improvement in her health.  I recommend it to anyone who loves their kitty!

review/summary: Wellness is More than a Brand Name
review/text: I did a lot of research about cat food before I adopted a new kitten last year. Guess what? Surprise! A lot of major brands of cat food are the equivalent of deep-fried chicken and fast-food cheeseburgers for humans.  Many of the brands that advertise a lot and sponsor cat shows are the worst offenders.<br /><br />Cats are predators, and predator = high meat-based protein diet.  Grain-based protein sources are high in carbohydrates and gluten.  You'll never see see wild tigers in animal documentaries eating white bread and corn on the cob, even if they knew where to get them.<br /><br />I feed my adolescent cat a combination of wet Wellness canned food and Wellness Core dry food.  I did try another brand of dry cat food before purchasing Wellness Core, but she would just beg for more wet food and only eat enough of the dry to stop her hunger pangs. No problem with Wellness Core.  She seems to like it.<br /><br />I trust the Wellness brand.  All I have to do is look at my cat and see why:  her coat is glossy, her eyes are clear and bright, and she has a lot of energy (maybe too much)!<br /><br />Here's another tip:  Read the list of ingredients of dry cat foods.  If you see a lot of sulphur and sulfate compounds, be prepared for VERY unpleasant number two cat box odor.  These compounds are guaranteed to turn the smell dial all the way up to maximum.  You can't totally avoid sulfates - they're necessary for cat health, but Wellness has them in moderation.  The dry food I tried before buying Wellness Core had LOTS of sulphates - and LOTS of bad odor. Don't blame your cat when you're the one feeding her/him.<br /><br />So Wellness products cost more...so what?  If you eat well, your cat should too.  Health problems caused by cheap cat food are expensive, painful - and avoidable.  Save your vet dollars for things you can't control.  You can economize by shopping for the best price and/or buying in larger quantities.  Save your nose too!

review/summary: Best catfood brand
review/text: Wellness Core is a really terrific brand of cat food.  It's one of the highest rated cat foods I've found.  I love that it's made from natural ingredients and is grain-free.  I do like to supplement this with a little canned food (Wellness of course).  My cat's fur is really soft and luxurious.  Plus the cat loves the food so much so that she ripped open the bag and started stealing the food because I unknowingly did not stash the food in a sealed container.  All open cat food and treats are stashed in a weighted down sealed container to prevent more cat burglar activity.<br /><br />I'm a new cat owner as you can tell.<br /><br />The only Con is it's pretty expensive, but it's well worth it to have a healthy pet.

review/summary: 2.5 lb. sickly cat doubled weight in 2 days!
review/text: It has been two weeks and now she weighs 6 pounds.  I am amazed & so happy.  Angel is a 12 year old Siamese.  She had been 2.5 pounds for at least 2 months.<br /><br />  The vet's diagnose was mostly "Old age". He gave her some iron & okayed some online liver support pills I had bought when I saw that her poo had turned yellow, or sometimes beige.  I also switched her diet to grain free with daily raw hamburger (frozen for 3 days to kill parasites), tuna & sardines.  She ate all that all the time but still never gained weight & her poo stayed the same too.<br /><br />I went to a prayer forum about her as a last ditch effort and someone there who used to work for a vet recommended Wellness Core food.<br /><br />Angel & a younger cat, Jet, loved the new food right away! The yellow looking poo turned dark over night.  In fact even Jet's poo darkened.  Now I can't tell which is whose.  I have not been giving anything but this food for over a week and they are thriving.  The only problem is that Jet is starting to look a bit like a puff ball - Lol - since I have to leave the food available all the time for now so Angel can always get to it and keep gaining.

review/summary: Kitty LOVES this food; too bad it's so expensive!
review/text: I bought a small bag of this food for my Savannah cat when his normal food ran out (Taste of the Wild - green bag) and the local pet store didn't have it in stock. I was worried that he would reject the food or it would make him sick because I've heard horror stories of trying to switch cat food too quickly. My cat, however, LOVES this stuff. He never begs for food and doesn't try to get into the cat food bag, but with this stuff, he was trying to get his head into the bag before I had a chance to pour some into his dish. He ate it all up, much more quickly than his other food, which is also high-quality, high-protein dry food. He had no bathroom or vomit problems and seems to like it at least as much as his "green bag" food. It's expensive, though, so I'm only using it as a supplement to his normal food, plus I leave some kibble hidden in his cat condo as "cat treats" for him to find when we're at work. He ALWAYS finds it. If I ever make enough money to spend $$$ on cat food, I'm definitely switching him to this stuff.

review/text: Doesn't matter how good it is for your cat, if Wellness can't make the taste appealing enough for cats to try it!  I have two adult cats, one very picky and one that eats everything put in front of him. Neither one would touch this very expensive dry food. The non picky cat just sat and looked at the bowl full of the Core dry food. He never even approached the dish to sniff it. Can Wellness make some samples of this for us to try? Oh, by the way, both my cats love the Wellness canned cat food.

review/summary: I love it and my kittens do too.
review/text: I asked my vet what to feed my two eight week old kittens. He recommended feeding them a grain free diet. I switched my kittens to Wellness Core mixed equally with EVO Turkey and Chicken Formula Dry (and canned) Cat and Kitten Food and they love both. Their coats look great and they seem to be thriving.<br /><br />I decided to mix the two brands since EVO has a higher protein and fat percentage, which is good for kittens. I've kept Wellness because I applaud their natural philosophy and their use of naturally-occurring micro-organisms to aid in a healthy digestive tract. I've also noticed that the kittens poop doesn't smell as strongly with Wellness as it does when they're on a full EVO diet.<br /><br />My kittens have not had diarrhea or any problems digesting the food since I started them on it a few weeks ago.<br /><br />FYI, I had heard that cats eat less on a grain-free diet. I didn't believe it until I witnessed it myself. They truly eat less.

And nothing bad happened with the diet change, but both kittens became equally became as active, with the one losing his little extra weight, and it even helped the other fill out a bit more, so this food works great for any cat seemingly.

review/text: I really love Wellness and really want my cats to eat it, but with the exception of two flavors of the regular wet food, they just do not like it. When one of my cats was a kitten, she loved the Wellness kitten formula, but that was it. I can't get either of them to touch CORE canned or dry food, even with their old food mixed. This has resulted in a number of returns, which really made me appreciate the company's guaranteed satisfaction promise!  I'm trying to narrow it down, but I think they both don't like either the smell or taste of potatoes, rosemary extract, or cranberries. Obviously, very cat has their own taste preferences just like us humans, but I just wanted to caution other owners to try a sample before buying a large, expensive supply...

review/summary: Grain-free cat food
review/text: My eight year old cat is indoor/outdoor and likes dry food. Occasionally, we would feed him some canned food. For at least two years we noticed symptoms of diarrhea. The vet de-wormed the cat several times, but the diarrhea persisted. We decided to check the listed ingredients on the labels of the dry and canned food our cat eats. We were quite surprised that most protein in the popular brands comes from wheat and corn gluten, a protein that is known to cause intestinal problems in some people.  Grains and grain gluten are also listed as ingredients of most brands of cat canned food.<br /><br />I just got the Wellness Core Grain-free Fish & Fowl food today, so it is too early to see if it will cure our cat from diarrhea. Nevertheless, our cat was very happy with this new food and devoured all that we gave him.

review/summary: Try a sample first
review/text: Just like other reviewers, my cat also went on a hunger strike rather than eat this food. I DID gradually switch foods and yet when only the Wellness food was left, he would refuse to eat it. He lost over a lb over this whole ordeal. The only way I could get him to eat was to sprinkle some other cat food on top. (Someone randomly gave me some since he knew I had a cat.) What ended up happening for the past month was that the cat would pick around the Wellness pellets and eat everything else. I finally had enough and bought the food he's been eating for the past year (also grain-free, also expensive). He acted like it was Christmas and gobbled down the whole bowl, just like old times.<br /><br />My cat is NOT a finicky eater by the way. He is a stray that we found last year. Up until this purchase, he has eaten everything we set in front of him. Maybe your cat will love this food. Maybe not. Try a sample first because I'm pretty mad about wasting $30.

review/text: I really wanted my cat to like this food (especially considering how expensive it is), but she just doesn't want to eat it. I introduced the food to her by mixing it in with her old "junk food" dry kibble, as recommended. She simply eats around the Wellness kibble, and I find little bits of it slightly chewed up/spit out by her bowl. I've been testing to see what happens if I don't feed her again until she clears her little bowl of food, but she just mopes around howling (something she normally doesn't do) and starves herself instead of eating the Wellness kibble. What a waste. :(

It's expensive, but since my schedule makes it difficult to him feed an all-wet diet (I do a combo of wet and dry), it's worth it to me to make sure his dry food is as healthy and cat-appropriate as possible.<br /><br />Just remember is that this food has a higher caloric density than most, so you don't need to feed as much as you would most dry food.  The feeding guidelines on the back are too much for most indoor-only cats, so adjust accordingly.

I rate the Wellness Core 3 Stars, as I haven't completely given up yet on mixing it in with other foods he likes: California Natural Chicken and Rice Dry Cat and Kitten Food; Innova Cat and Kitten Food; Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kittens; and Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Cat Food, Chicken Recipe.  The Wellness plastic bag is one of the nicest kibble, dry cat food bags on the market, featuring a resealable strip, which is a nice feature that some other kibble cat food bags, that are seemingly more paper based, do not have.

review/summary: Caused my 15 year old cat to have diarrhea for first time in his life.
review/text: I have a 15 year old neutered male domestic short hair kitty who is overall very healthy and happy. I was excited to put him on this food after doing extensive research because it was high in protein, grain-free and had several great reviews. I had him on Innova Senior, but it was a little dry and he didn't really "love" the food. However, since starting to feed Wellness CORE a few days ago, my kitty has had diarrhea every time he uses the litterbox. I've owned him his whole life, and he's never had diarrhea before and it's the only thing that's changed in his diet (he also gets Wellness wet food at night). Although I already have him on a high protein, low carb diet, I think the even higher level of protein in this food might be too much for his digestive tract to handle. I'm going to give it a few more days to see if the condition improves and maybe is just a side effect of the transition, but I'm not pleased by the initial experience. We'll see what happens.

review/summary: Disappointment!
review/text: My cat went on a hunger strike rather than eat this food.  I think it's the fishy smell, which is very disagreeable.  Save your money!  The ingredients are fine, but what a waste of money!

review/summary: Worth checking out
review/text: I was skeptical when I first heard of this product but decided to give it a try.  Amazingly, it works!! While it isn't the best chocolate cake I have ever had, for gluten free it is pretty darn good, at least good enough to satisfy a chocolate craving. This would be a great product for kids with celiac to take along to a birthday party or while traveling because all you really need is water and a microwave. Just don't make the same mistake I did and microwave the lid because it is NOT microwave safe, though the directions clearly state this.

review/summary: Great quality, hard to find
review/text: Brazil nuts fans, ever try to find these to purchase separately at the grocery store?  I could only find them in mixed cans.  These were shipped promptly, and the quality was great. I got the lightly salted ones. I have ordered twice now, and will order regularly.<br />Amazon is a great way to find hard to get items!

review/summary: Disgusting...
review/text: The sardine are hard and dry and have an off, metallic taste to them. The sauce is nice, but not what's swimming in them. The sardines don't fill the can, and really are unpleasant. These also contain MSG, maltodextrin, and xanthan gum which isn't mentioned in the ingredient list which of course is incorrect. I saw a brand name and really expected better quality than these. Avoid!!!

review/summary: Hot, but not
review/text: Since Amazon doesn't carry the hot and spicy sardines I love, I thought I would try these.  For whatever reason, this product has a very metallic taste.  All but the first can are still in my pantry.  They will probably end up in the next neighborhood food drive...

review/summary: Hello
review/text: This product would be better, but somehow the taste seem to have been altered. Its got a boxy taste to it, or maybe I got an outdated item. I am still trying to figure out why, or what had gone wrong with the sardines. They taste different than the ones I use to love to eat.

review/summary: Bleh.
review/text: I love canned sardines, but these suck hardcore. They're small, tough, and the hot sauce tastes terrible. If you want yummy canned sardines for a decent price, I'd go with Beachclif. They fill the whole can, are tender, and are delicious. Never buying Chicken Of The Sea sardines ever again. Ugh.
