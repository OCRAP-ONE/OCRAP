review/summary: FROM CHINA: BEWARE
review/text: Shame on me for not looking at the other reviews from Starwest Botanicals Organic Products, where many customers are dissatisfied about the fact that the product comes from China.  It is "certified" organic by the Chinese, which as we all know means that it is certified to be made from fertilizer and small animal parts just like the milk they feed their children.<br /><br />Not worth the trouble to return - I will be dumping this in the trash and hoping that any resident rodent population partakes in the leavings.

review/summary: Doesn't look/taste like garlic
review/text: The color looked very white compared to the other garlic powders I have used so I tasted it as is and it didn't have strong garlic taste at all. I tried to make sauce for my chicken anyway but it didn't blend with other liquid ingredients. I have been using garlic powders for a long time but this is not what I expected. Very disappointing. They are in my trash can now.

review/text: Guess I should have read more review before purchasing! I ordered three 1 pound bags of garlic powder. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found a box of tampons! The label inside the box even says garlic powder.<br />At least Amazon is willing to refund my money, but I have to send the wrong product back and I still don't have the garlic powder I need.

review/text: This product has almost no flavor and aroma, contrary to the product's description.<br /><br />I have read that some companies use Chinese instead of European black truffles. The Chinese are supposedly cheaper because they lack the flavor and aroma of the French and Italian black truffles.<br /><br />This product is certainly not worth the price.  You basically get a tube full of what may well have been a paste made from black colored cardboard and oil.

They also offer fresh truffles (in season), frozen truffles, numerous pastes, truffled oils, truffled vinegars, truffled pasta, truffled bonbons....<br /><br />You can't go wrong, if you're well-informed.

review/summary: I too was very disappointed in this product!
review/text: I've tried tuna helper in the past on occasion and found it to be very tasty but this time, when I thought having a few boxes on hand would be a good idea.....I was very wrong.  As stated by all the other reviewers....they did not come with the customary crumbs for the top of the casseroles.  And the flavor was so bland and mild as to not have any at all.  After trying two flavor packages from two boxes of Tuna Helper in one casserole to no avail, I ended up having to add a can of creamed soup to give the noodles flavor beyond the strong tuna taste.  Of course that just added salt injury onto salt injury!!  Either Betty Crocker has changed their box contents and their flavor packets or these cases from Amazon are the 'irregulars'.  I will not be buying this product again....they are truly awful!  You can buy the noodles alone for a whole lot less if you need to add other products just to make it tasty.

review/text: This product is great for people who don't have time or the talent to cook interesting dishes. I add chicken and peas instead of tuna. I still prefer "creamy pasta" and add my own fresh parmeson, but amazon doesn't carry it in bulk any more for some reason? This one of those products that you have to buy in bulk to get a reasonable price as it is too expencive per box in the retail setting.

review/summary: a good alternative to soy milk
review/text: This is a wonderful product for those who do not like/tolerate real milk and/or soy milk.  Since I was little, I have disliked the consistency and taste of milk.  While there are a variety of soy milks in various flavors, I find most to be of a thin consistency and overly flavored.  When So Delicious came out with their unsweetened and original coconut milk flavors, I was ecstatic. The consistency was like real milk but had a flavor I actually enjoyed.<br /><br />These little So Delicious shelf stable containers are perfect for work or an outing.  I love the convenience of a grab and go container.<br /><br />Until 2010, it had been years since I had cereal with a bowl of milk.  Now, I regularly pair cereal with So Delicious.  Whether consumed on its own or with cereal, this product is just awesome. I regularly use it in recipes in place of milk and have even made a pudding with it.<br /><br />So Delicious Unsweetened has 50 calories per cup and the Original flavor has 80 calories per cup.  While So Delicious has a significant amount of saturated fat, it is a good form of saturated fat that can actually help a person maintain a healthy weight.  The saturated fat in So Delicious are medium-chain-fatty-acids and your body uses these MCFAs as energy.<br /><br />So Delicious has three various flavors of coconut milk and while I started with the So Delicious Vanilla and Original Flavors, I now prefer the 50 calorie unsweetened option.<br /><br />So Delicious is vegan, soy free and lactose free.

review/text: This is horrible. I almost spit it up on my computer screen, but managed to run outside and spit it out. It tastes like a cow ate a cake with vanilla frosting and a hint of coconut. Then they milked the cow and left the milk out in the sun for a couple of weeks then re-refrigerated it. I think I tasted more of a sour cream taste than coconut. This drink will re-define what you think of something that tastes bad.

review/summary: The best brown rice pasta ever
review/text: The problem with the rice pastas I've tried always comes down to taste and texture.  The taste misses the mark of true pastas and the texture is somewhere between slimy and mealy.  Not so with Tinkyada's Brown Rice Pastas.<br /><br />I first heard about Tinkyada from a friend whose wife is old-school Italian.  Joann swore that Tinkyada was almost as good as fresh homemade, a claim about which I was skeptical.  However, I've been using Tinkyada for almost 3 months now and can't imagine trying any other brand.  One other plus in its favor is that it is more forgiving to cook than other rice pastas I've tried, allowing overcooking with no unfortunate culinary consequences.<br /><br />If you're trying to get some (or all) of the gluten out of your life or if you just want to find a really good pasta, I can't recommend Tinkyada highly enough.

So, if you get them, try not to have any expectations...if you do, you're not likely to be pleased.<br /><br />There are 5 boxes, and I gave four of them away, to siblings and children.

About square or ounce of dark chocolate per day above 60% cacao is now recommended by health experts.  I love this affordable Ghiradelli chocolate.

This 86% Cacao chocolate is not too bitter for me.  I now prefer it over milk chocolate.  Highly recommend this chocolate.  It's a non-guilty pleasure--one of the few out there.

I like the 86% for a break from the 72% & for extra zing. I gave one of my friends an 86% square; and, he accused me of trying to poison him! Work up to the 86%.<br />I love the squares which help me control my portions. 4 squares is the serving size SO if you just eat one a day it's about 70 calories! Ghirardelli is middle of the road for premium chocolates which means they're really good.

review/text: I've been using Adagio Teas for several years.  I love the 1812 Gunpowder Tea and have it sent repeatedly,  I've also bought tons of their Berry Teas for the college kids.  They love it and its a great pick-me-up.  Because of the stress at college many of them use the Chamomile or Peppermint tea for their tummies.<br /><br />The people with Adagio are very helpful.  And all their teas are excellent and reasonably priced.

review/text: But I'm still giving this tea five stars, even though I hated it.  Why?  If you love Gunpowder, you'll love this tea.  It is the smokiest tea I've ever had in my life and the taste stays with you for a long time.  In fact, I started to feel like I had just smoked a cigar, because the smokiness is that heavy.  I prefer Adagio's Hojicha over this and if you're not sure about the smokiness of this particular tea you might want to try that instead.

review/summary: Much Too Salty
review/text: Having enjoyed other Shore Lunch products, their Chili mix and chicken and fish breadings are great, I was very disappointed with the Tortilla Soup Mix.  It is so salty that I wound up adding cut raw potatoes to the next 2 packs while they were simmering.  That absorbed the salt and made the soup edible.  Since I added only a can of salt-free diced tomatoes the mix is the culprit -- way too much sodium to be healthy.

review/text: Addendum to the review I wrote previously:  Use caution when ordering.  I ordered when there was warm weather and the honey had seeped out of the containers and made a big mess.  I salvaged most of them, but it was a pain.<br /><br />I'm on a health kick so I'm buying the raw, local honey at the neighborhood food cooperative from now on.<br /><br />This honey does not seem to be whipped, but it is a little thicker than the stuff in a bottle.  But, still, it is an excellent deal-half the price as honey in the store and honey in the tub is less messy.  Kroger's has honey that is really whipped and it is even easier to use but costs more than $5 for a 16 oz. tub.  The best part, it's made in good ol' Kansas, U.S.A.

review/summary: Good Cold Shipping by Amazon
review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

review/summary: Did NOT receive item as pictured, mylar balls were ruined
review/text: Instead of coming in a nice bagged package, as the picture shows, I received 4 mylar balls shoved loose into the mailing envelope. There was no sign of the original packaging. They were crushed flat and ripped in several places, and appear to be old and dusty (possibly used?) The balls were so badly flattened that I could not return the balls to a "round" shape even when I tried reshaping them. It may seem petty to complain about packaging for a cat's toy, but the items recieved were NOT as pictured, and were squished entirely flat and all 4 of them were torn. I was very disappointed that I did not even receive new-looking items from this seller for the price I was charged.

Shes attracted to the crinkle sound right before i throw it but they dont go very far cause they're so light + they stop moving almost immediately when they hit the floor so she loses interest pretty quickly. As with most cat toys, you just never know until u get it home. 1 cats treasure is another cats yawn.

review/summary: Cat loves them!
review/text: Bought three packages of these for my cat since she loves them so much.  She spends up to an hour batting them around and she's trained us to throw them for her.  I think it's the crinkling sound that makes it attractive to cats.

review/text: My kitties love these!! All I have to do is crinkle the toy a bit and they come running!  I wish they were cheaper, though.  And I do periodically have to check under furniture, stove, other appliances, wine fridge, etc. to "rescue" all of their toys...

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: These crinkle balls are pretty much my cat's favorite things on earth, other than food. I have two kittens and they just go crazy for these. It seems to be especially fun on a hard surface. The only problem is that they eventually end up under the furniture or some other inaccessible place. I plan to have a stock pile. If I ever need to distract my cats, this is my go-to.

review/summary: Many cats love this toy, but the dye leaks into their water...
review/text: At our animal shelter, this toy is a big favorite.  It is shiny, colorful, lightweight and makes a crinkling sound when crushed or batted.  I would give it five stars except for the fact that if the toy gets batted into the water dish, the dye from the toy will leak into the water, discoloring the water, and the cats will not drink the water anymore.  I am not sure if the dye is toxic or not, so I'm glad the cats don't drink it.<br /><br />I would not recommend this toy for cats confined in a small space with an open water dish, but otherwise, this is a great item!

review/summary: A Playtime Favorite!
review/text: These crinkly little balls have provided hours of play for our two cats.  The balls can be thrown for fetch, hidden in a old Amazon box for some hide-n-seek, or just batted around and fought over.  They are quiet enough that you don't notice the cats playing with them at night, until they lay stand on your chest in an attempt to get you to play fetch!<br /><br />The Mylar balls wear down over time, getting flatter and less round, but they don't lose much of their material and hold up to rough play very well. Your cats will enjoy these toys, and you'll be willing to fish them out from under the couch time and time again.

review/text: My cat hates the noise it makes as much as she is indifferent to the toy. I had such high hopes with the other rave reviews but found this to be another collosal waste. the only toys she's liked are the zany mice, real laser pointer, and the wand with the long pice of flannes.

review/summary: crinkly fun
review/text: All my cats love these, especially my littlest girl.  None of my cats is a chewer, so this toy does not require supervision.  If your cats tend to chew these, they will need supervision as you don't want them ingesting mylar plastic - that being said, most cats are not chewers, so I think these are generally safe.  Also, these balls are large enough not to be accidentally swallowed, while still being small enough for good play.  Easy for cats to carry, light enough for great batting around and chasing and most cats love the crinkle noise - mine have terrific fun and will play by themselves with these even in the middle of the night (don't worry crinkle sound is not loud enough to disturb sleep, and I'm a light sleeper).  Bonus - not hazardous to MY health either - i.e. if your cat leaves them laying around (like mine) and you step on one by accident (as I often do), they just squash so you don't slip, fall or trip - plus they can be fluffed back up after squashing, good as new. Win win.

review/summary: Not what I was looking for
review/text: I was looking for some jasmine extract to make some thai desserts with.  When I opened this bottle of jasmine extract, it sort of smelled like jasmine, but also had some other weird (not so great) smell to it. I tried using it once, and dumped the rest down the drain. It also came in a plastic bottle, which I found curious, as I was expecting glass.  I have since found much better jasmine extract elsewhere online.

review/text: Why would anyone spend $8.99 plus $5.50 minimum shipping for nuts without knowing the quantity to be supplied?  One wonders if it is 6 oz, 9 oz perhaps 15 oz (fast becoming the "supermarket pound") or even 16 oz.  But the scant information supplied does not tell the interested buyer this crucial fact.  I suppose we are expected not to care about such details.<br /><br />PS: They did not offer the option of "no stars."

review/text: We used to buy Nutiva in 29oz & 54oz from Whole Foods.  We're using more coconut oil; it is good stuff - you know that or you wouldn't be reading this :-)<br />Anyway, we started with a single 1-gallon order to see how "bulk" would work.<br />It worked very well - the order shipped promptly and was securely packed.<br />Now that first gallon is about used up, so getting ready to put in another order (I'll be ordering 4 x 1 gallons this time).<br /><br />I wanted to write this & say thanks to Natures Approved; I like what they do.<br /><br />We're saving our old Nutiva jars to have an easy-access cupboard size.  This seems to have a bit lower melting point than Nutiva - I ordered in late summer, so it arrived all melted (no leaks - did I mention they were great about secure packing?).  I didn't think about this at the time, but being melted made it easy to pour into the smaller containers.<br />*shrug* What's not to like :-  Highly recommended.

review/summary: NOT for the wheat-sensitive!
review/text: I made the unfortunate assumption that organic corn puffs would be wheat-free.  The online product info doesn't say either way, but the package, once you receive it, does warn that they're made in a facility that also processes wheat.  As someone who does fine with corn but is allergic to wheat, I had a violent reaction to them.  They taste good, but they're definitely not for anyone who needs to avoid wheat; that should be prominently stated in their description.

It's light, crisp and tasty--and knowing that its essence was just as the Great Architect God had made it, made it all the more enjoyable.

review/text: My wife and I can go through these pretty fast. We eat them as snacks while watching TV. Amazon's bulk lot of 12 bags is cheaper per bag than buying at the local co-op. After eating 4 bags so far, we haven't had any issues with stale puffs. However, just like the locally bought ones, they do get stale pretty quick after opening (few days).

review/summary: Not fresh- stale
review/text: I have eaten this before and am usually satisfied with the product when purchased in a store like Whole Foods. However, I thought I would try an online purchase because I can no longer get the cereal where I currently reside. Bad mistake. This cereal was stale upon receipt, not so much in taste (although it was oddly bland), but more in texture. I'm not sure whether this is because of how it was packaged but I noticed that the bags were strangely thin in places. I cannot recommend this unless you like old tasting puffs.
