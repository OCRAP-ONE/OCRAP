review/summary: Quite the disappointment
review/text: Tried Stubb's Pork Marinade for the first time today expecting great flavors with possibly a little kick on my center cut boneless chops. Even went as far as marinating 6 hours prior and basting while cooking but found my pork chops basically flavorless. There was a slight and I mean slight vinegary taste but other than that, it tasted like a plain old pork chop with no seasoning at all. I've tried so many other marinades on the market which are a lot more successful than this one.

review/summary: Stubbs is The Best
review/text: First - The description is WRONG for ingredients. Stubbs does not use high fructose corn syrup in their products. They use all natural ingredients. All Stubb's products are Gluten Free. They are all amazing. We just put a pork roast in the crockpot and pour the pork marinade over it and let it cook all night. It's amazing. The prices on here are high. Walmart sells all Stubb's products for $2.50 each but if you can't find what you want I guess you have to pay these high prices. Still they are worth every penny. We also use the beef marinade all the time with beef short ribs in the crockpot and the herbal mustard rub. I use that on my tofu scramble with lots of curry powder. The mustard rub goes great with curry. The bbq sauces are great too!

review/summary: I like it but some may have issue with several of the product's ingredients
review/text: I don't have a problem getting my 8 glasses of water each day but I sometimes like a little beverage diversity and individually packaged drink packs are a good way to add a bit of a kick to water.  Because these are individual packets, it is easy to keep a few in a gym bag, work desk or purse.  I think the flavor is pretty good with no strange aftertaste.  I purchase my Wyler's lemonade at my local grocery store for about 10 cents a packet.<br /><br />Some individuals may be concerned to know that this product has aspartame and acesulfame potassium. A lot of diet beverages use these additives. Both have been linked to cancer in rats and both were deemed one of the top ten worst additives by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. So, if you are cautious about additives in your food, this product may not be for you.  A serving for this product is 1/2 of a packet and 1/2 of a packet has 5 calories and 20% of your daily vitamin C.  To make a full, sufficiently flavored 16 ounce glass, you really do need the entire packet.<br /><br />If you are seeking an alternative product that does not utilize these controversial ingredients and has more vitamins, I would recommend Acai Lemonade by NOW Foods. It is somewhat pricey but can be found more economically off of Amazon. That product has 15 calories and is loaded with vitamins. It has 100% of you daily vitamin C, 25% of Vitamin A, 50% of Vitamin D, 50% of Vitamin E, 50% of Thiamin, 50% of Riboflavin, 25% of Niacin, 50% of B-6, 50% of Folate, 50% of Pantothenic Acid and 1670% of Vitamin B-12.<br /><br />Wyler's Light Pink Lemonade is really flavorful, easy to pack and can be very economical.  Those who want to avoid sugar substitutes may want to use this product in moderation or steer clear.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.

review/text: This product is great!!!  Makes you drink water more often.  Walgreens was selling the 50 pk for $5.00 but discontinued selling.  WHY?!  The 8pk can be purchased for $1.00.  So why is this retailer selling a 12 count for $32.50 or $2.70 per 8 pk box?  You can buy 12 boxes yourself and pay $12.00.  The math isn't adding up.<br />Anywho....Still I think this an innovative product designed to make water good to drink with only 5 calories.

review/text: I'm one of many women in the world who find it extremely hard to get my eight glasses of water in each day. With the Wyler's Light Pink Lemonade packets, I've found that I'm actually drinking a lot more water than I used to. I started mixing a packet in my water bottle once a day; now I'm mixing up about three bottles a day! This stuff makes water taste so good! It honestly doesn't have that Nutri-Sweet taste that a lot of "light" drinks do. I'd definitely recommend this product to everyone I know!

review/text: My husband and I have enjoyed good coffee for over 25 years.  We're always trying new coffee and our favorite bean has been Sumatra up until now.  We tried Zoka's Colonel Fitzroy a couple month's ago and immediatley decided it was our new favorite.  It's similar to a Sumatra, but has a hint of chocolate unertones.  I love it because I can drink it black.  It has no bitter aftertaste.  Drinking coffee black allows the rich sweetness to resonate and means no calories.  Making it a keeper for sure!

review/summary: It's certainly worth a try!
review/text: I've had only Zango mangosteen juice and Thai mangosteen juice previously, so I didn't actually know what pure mangosteen juice was like.<br />It is very much like cocoanut milk. Almost the same color and consistency and an even milder flavor. There is no pulp or plant ground up in it so it is very smooth. Sometimes I drink my dose by itself, other times I mix it in any juice because this mangosteen juice doesn't change the flavor.<br /><br />I've heard alot of health claims about mangosteen, pomegranate and acai but I really can't say it's done anything for me, I've only been taking mangosteen for a couple months. I just enjoy knowing I'm putting the good stuff in my system.<br />I like the Amazon automatic delivery system, too, since I can't find this locally, it saves me time and money.

review/text: I personally know several people who recently tried this new 100 percent mangosteen juice. The juice is "Mangosteen Queen" sold at the mangosteenjuice.ws that is similar to the Dynamic Health Gold mangosteen.<br /><br />These individuals report higher energy levels probably due to sleeping better and disappearance of pains they have had prior to drinking these type of mangosteen juices.<br /><br />One even received comments of looking ten years younger without soliciting for it.<br /><br />I for one lost my suceptibility to allergy due to pollen in the fall; something I have had for many decades. I must admit that I only drank this pure mangosteen for maybe at most 3 days at a time for perhaps 4 times since August due to cost. Drinking it even inconsistently at 1/2 to 2/3 cup a day has its rewards apparently.

review/text: Cheesecake arrived within a week of ordering.  Packing was amazing, ice in the pack was still frozen, and so was the cheesecake. We let it thaw to room temperature.  It is delicious, creamy, crust is perfect...but for me personally, it is super-sweet.  Typical of my taste, I just don't like super sweet anything. So, if you have a love of cheesecake that really is 'New YorK' style and really love super-sweet, then this is perfect for you.  For those of us who love creamy cheesecake with a nice crust but are more reserved on the super-sweet, think twice.

review/text: This is a resubmittal of a previous review.  Originally, when I received my cheesecake I was very disappointed with the careless way it had been packaged and delivered - and I said so in my review.  I NOW say that if anybody ever says that Omaha Steakes doesn't care about their product feedback, do NOT believe it.  After submitting my original review, I was contacted by Mr. Sendgraff of Omaha Steaks who apologized for their poor packaging and inormed me that Omaha Steaks has a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all their products and, that he was refunding my entire purchase price, including shipping.  Even after I told him we had eaten the cheesecake, and it was really quite good, he insisted that my experience had not met their 100% satisfaction guarantee standards and my refund would stand.  I say, THANK YOU, Mr. Sendgraff, you are a credit to Omaha Steaks Customer Service and have restored my confidence completely.  I'm looking forward to my next purchase of an Omaha Steaks product.

review/text: I love these mangos! I have to hide at least one bag from my fmaily, so I can have some. They are not to hard, as somethimes dried fruit can be. The flavor is excellent. Sweet, but not too sweet. They are quite good in homemade granola. The price was great.

review/summary: SO GROSS!!
review/text: I eat dried mango almost everyday and have tried so many different brands, but this brand is the worst. I almost thought it was spoiled, but every 1 of the 6 packs tasted the same. Mushy and overly sweet. I had to check the package to make sure sugar wasn't added. I would definitely try a different brand!

review/text: I have eaten Kopali Organic Mangos from grocery stores like Whole Foods before and they were excellent. The ones I received were horrible. I had different members of my family try them and they felt the same way. Then when I tried to return the remaining packages Amazon could not find my account and by the time it was straighten out it was too late to return them. I will not be purchasing food items from Amazon again.

review/summary: My dog love them!
review/text: my puppy lab has sensitive stomach, and she can't digest any food/treats that are made with animal products, so I always read the label and make sure there are no animal products. This treat doesn't contain any animal products... It's made with Pumpkin, Oatmeal, Ground Brown Rice, Tapioca Starch, Vegetable Glycerin, Ground Potatoes, Brown Sugar, Canola Oil, Ground Oats, Mangos, Gelatin, Cinnamon, Salt, Natural Mango Flavor, Phosphoric Acid, Sorbic Acid (a preservative), Mixed Tocopherols (a preservative), Rosemary Extract.)<br />I gave her some, and she hasn't had any accident (diarrhea or vomiting) yet. sensitive belly approved!!<br />Also the mango flavor smells really good.. I was really tempting to try one, but i didn't.. lol<br /><br />But why 4 stars? 2 reasons that I give this 4 stars although my dogs and I really love it.<br />1. It's only 5 oz.. It's about $1.4 per 1 oz. I don't mind spending money on good stuff, it's a lil bit pricy for me..comparing to other comparable treats that sell for $9-12 per a pound. (it's just my opinion)<br />2. Not good for training. They're little bit chewy for small dogs.. My dogs chew one treat for a long time.(about 15-20 sec) They're good for snacking though..<br /><br />Anyway, although I gave this product 4 stars, I really highly recommend this for the quailty and deliciousness..

review/text: My dog loves these and they are the perfect size so he can have a few a day. One of my favorite things about fruitables is that they smell good! They don't make my dog's breath smell weird or my hands after I give them to him. This was my first time buying this flavor and my dog loves them. I also recommend the apple/bacon (same skinny mini size) and pumpkin/apple (larger sized treats).

review/summary: NOT Edible
review/text: The glitter itself is very beautiful, however I wanted to clarify for all future buyers that it is NOT edible as seems to be implied many places. Note the disclaimer they have included in the product description. The label on the package (which is covered up by an inventory label that has to be very carefully removed to be read!) clears says it's "For Decorative Arts and Crafts" and an in-depth google search will reveal that this product SHOULD NOT BE eaten. So basically it's very, very expensive glitter.

review/summary: These are the bomb!
review/text: So you don't want to spend $100/oz for truffle, here's a great alternative. Use this formula to build your fantastic sandwich.<br />(Buns) + (Spread) + (Meat) + (Creamy) + (Veggies)<br /><br />I used Chabatta buns I get at Albertson, toasted in a small oven, spread Urbani Truffles and mushrooms, layer with thin slices of prosciutto, then topped with four thick slices of hass avocado, and a few mix green. There's your fancy, sexy, impress your gf/bf/family/friends sandwich.<br /><br />The only bad part is it doesn't keep very long in fridge. Urbani Truffles and Mushrooms add an umami flavor to the sandwich so it can go with any of your favorite sandwich. I usually just a make two sandwiches and had to throw away the rest when it went bad in the fridge. So plan ahead, it's a small 6 oz can that can serve up to four sandwiches.<br /><br />Plus it's cheaper via Amazon.com. I saw these at Wholefood for $19.99/can.<br /><br />This is my first review so it was that good that wanted me to write a review. Get it, and enjoy it with your family.

review/text: This is amazing bread. I made it for Christmas and I have to say this is the most delicious and moist pumpkin bread I have ever had. Unfortunately it seems to be seasonal. I actually went back and bought 10 more kits to clean out what the store had left.<br /><br />The kit comes with icing, the flour mix and a can of pumpkin puree. The icing is not very good, melts and turns clear after a few hours, I recommend you use your own icing.<br /><br />This is something you need to try.

Not sure if this is a charaterisic of this appellation or what, but I will order the New Zealand kit next time. I keg, rather than bottle, the wine so I have the flexibility of pouring one glass or one liter and it does mix nicely, so I see a lot of sangrias this summer.

review/text: I just didn't like this flavor.<br /><br />I have found that the coffee from Donut Shop tends to actually be quite fresh for a pre-ground product.  I have no complaints there.  However, this is my first chocolate offering from Donut Shop, and it really has an unrefined, pure cocoa flavor.  That might be just the ticket for a lot of conisseurs, but I'm not much of a chocolate fan.  And to me, the pure cocoa added a really bitter bite to anotherwise smooth coffee.

review/text: These little bees showed up perfectly packaged two days before their arrival estimate.  They are super cute and made me extremely happy.  I was afraid they'd show up and be rock hard, inedible, and with goofy coloring that was just a little bit off.  But they are exactly as they appear in the photo - the white is where it belongs, the stripes are solid and straight, they are delicate but firm and will be the perfect addition to my little beehive cupcakes.<br />I fully intend on ordering more product from this seller in the future with confidence.

review/summary: They call it nature's sports drink
review/text: I have seen delivery truck for this drink driving around town.  On the side they had "Natures Sport's Drink".  I never thought of Coconut Water as a sports drink but I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />The package the drink comes in is "Tetra Pak"; which is a fancy way of saying juice box.  Because this seems very similar to the way I used to drink my Hi-C Juice when I was in grade school.  No straw here though, just a foil covered hole in which you peel off the foil to drink.<br /><br />Ingredients are as follows: Natural coconut water, pink guava puree, cane juice, vitamin c, and natural fruit flavor.  Not too bad, sounds good, you have to add vitamin c to give the drink a little zing otherwise it comes off too bland, and they at least admit to adding "natural fruit flavor" which if you read the FDA website doesn't really have to be that natural at all.  But all-in-all the ingredients list looks good.  One container is 8.5 ounces, one serving, and you have 78 calories, no fat, 128mg of sodium, 302mg potassium, 18.8g of carbs, with .5g of that being fiber and 16.6g being sugar.  You also get 0.8g of protein and the added vitamin c gives 183% of your daily value.  Let's move on to taste:<br /><br />Serve cold, shake well, and open...tastes like coconut and guava.  I guess I should have expected that.  It feels fairly light on the tongue, not that oily mouth coating feel you get from regular coconut water.  O.N.E. claims they get the water form green coconuts before the meat forms, so that accounts for the lack of oils and fats.  So you get nice tropical flavor.  Like a really watered down pina colada.  Sadly I am unable to perform blood work and tell you if my electrolytes are being replenished but I am enjoying the flavor.  So if coconut and guava appeal to you, and you would like those flavors in a natural sports drink, this may be the drink for you.

review/summary: "...with a 'SPLASH' of Pink Guava"
review/text: I'm somewhat perplexed as to why reviewers slammed this for not having enough flavor because the name says it all. This is supposed be a light, subtly flavored beverage. I think it's delicious.<br />I'm also left scratching my head as to assertions that this product contains sugar; it contains CANE JUICE which is not only far more dilute than sugar but is enjoyed on its own as a delicious, healthful beverage and is well worth sampling if you can find it (it's fairly easy to find fresh in NYC's Chinatown). For the record, it's not sickeningly sweet and is claimed to have anti-cariogenic properties (I love the stuff). Don't downgrade a product because you don't know how to interpret what's printed on a label (let the negs begin).<br />O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava is very refreshing when you're in need of an electrolyte boost and I agree with other reviewers that 8.5 ounces is insufficient for a fierce thirst; I hope O.N.E. has this flavor slated for 1-liter packaging. The flavor is exquisite, as is the color. This also makes a great base for a pink guava smoothie--blend with a frozen banana, coconut milk (canned is fine), frozen pink guava pulp, and a sweetener of your choice (coconut sugar would be great). Delicious AND pretty! You could also, if you prefer a different liquid (such as yogurt or fruit juice), freeze it in an ice cube tray and add to the other ingredients to thicken and chill your smoothie--it's the kind of product you can get creative with if you're into playing in the kitchen.<br />To sum it up, O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava does NOT contain added sugar, doesn't claim to be a juice, and is well worth trying, especially if you can find it on sale. In addition, although I'm a Vine Voice, this product wasn't offered to me for review; I'm of my own initiative evaluating my own purchase. Enjoy!

review/summary: Well, I didn't hate it
review/text: It was somewhat thirst quenching, but I was not totally satisfied. Maybe it was because the 8.5 oz. size seems like less than I want after I really work out. Maybe it was because the coconut guava flavor (both are flavors which I actually love) seemed super watered down...they should have added more guava! The upshot? I just felt this product fell a bit short on all counts. If I get it for free on bike to work day, I won't turn up my nose, but I wouldn't buy it when there are other options.

review/summary: Disappointed by the New Formula Change
review/text: I loved this product and participated in the subscription service. However, my last shipment came in a newly designed box and the formula of the coconut/guava mixture had changed.  There is more guava juice now, which I find overwhelming.  The sugar content has also increased.  I've had to purchase plain coconut water to mix with my last order to tone down the guava flavor.  I am not a fan of the change and plan to cancel my monthly subscription.  Beware if you were a fan of the old true splash of guava formula.

review/summary: Maybe not for purists, but may entice others
review/text: I had read the reviews about coconut water and was unsure whether to try this. It seems the taste either works for some or it doesn't. Some say it is an acquired taste. I do like the taste of guava, so I thought this would be a good way to sample some coconut water. I let it chill fully. Okay, actually I put it in the freezer and forgot about it. Thank goodness the aseptic pack did not burst. Once it was liquid again I gave it a taste and I was very pleased. The "splash" of guava was not overwhelming to me, as pure nectar can tend to be. It complemented (masked?) the flavor of the coconut water and was quite refreshing. Pure coconut water is not sweetened, as this one is, so that is a consideration for some. I think I am ready to try some of the pure coconut water now. There are other flavors of this type, too. I really liked this product.

review/summary: Too salty for my taste
review/text: Just to give this drink a good chance, I stuck it in the fridge for a couple of days, shook it really well, and tried it straight, without ice.  The color was okay, the consistency was okay, not much of a smell.<br /><br />Then I tasted it, and the first thing that came to mind was, it's salty.  I had my wife try it as well, and she had the same feeling.  I looked at the product info, and it states that it has 5% of the USRDA for sodium, which is too much for a drink, in my opinion, especially a "Coconut Water".  Something like Gatorade, which is for electrolyte replenishment, I can forgive, but not for this.<br /><br />I then thought more about the taste, besides the saltiness, and what I really had to conclude was that the the mix of flavors didn't do anything for me.  No real sweetness from the coconut, no sourness from the guava.<br /><br />Overall, Not crazy about it.<br /><br />Now, I do have something positive to say about the container, it held up well, and it's relatively easy to open, although I'd add a ring to the aluminum foil-like pull tab.  But at least the container's mostly paper and potentially better for the environment?

Both my son and daughter love this, although it's sweeter than the regular coconut water (which they won't drink unless I make a smoothie with it).  It's a nice way to get a little hydration into kids after playing outside or sports and much better than the sports drinks too.  Very happy with it and I also like it.  It's a bit pricey though, sometimes you can find it on sale at the stores which is a better price than here on Amazon.

Needless to say the stuff you get in the frozen can is nowhere near as good as the real thing.<br /><br />POG is best for vacations, unless you want to develop diabetes... This is a great alternative. I already enjoy the mango flavor and the pineapple is alright, but the pink guava version is my new favorite. I only wish they made the flavored coconut waters in the larger one liter size...

I use it after my daily workout to replenish electrolytes and it seems to work great. However, I was very disappointed when I went to re-order. It previously cost my $15 and now they want $25 for the same thing. I had to go to an external website to purchase it for $15. This is very disappointing to me, since I prefer to do my online shopping on Amazon. Also, they took away the Subscribe & Save feature on this. Not happy...

Looking to buy more when I can get it and especially if I can get it on sale. This guava flavor seems to only be sold by ONE. I have also tried Vita Coco and Naked Coconut water with peach and Mango flavor. I like these too but all their prices are higher on Amazon than some of my neighborhood health food stores. I have also used it in a home made vegetable smoothie with delicious results. I would love to see O.N.E offer their coconut water in a larger juice box like 11.2oz. After an intense work out I could use a bit more. It's worth giving it a try!

One is ONE. ;-) The guava really adds to the flavor. I also just tried the mango and will be ordering that soon as well. There's a lot of variation with coconut water. Some taste just like water, some have a mild sweetness, some are more coconutty than others. And some are bitter. I recommend trying several to see what suits your tastebuds and budget.
