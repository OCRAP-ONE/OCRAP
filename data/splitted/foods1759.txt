review/summary: Dandy Blend exceeded expectations
review/text: Just to second earlier comments, this product exceeded my expectations. Sure, it's not coffee, but it's the best substitute I've found out there if, like me, you have to give a cup o joe up for medical reasons. And it's made partially from dandelion root: "The Easiest Way to get Dandelion in Your Diet!"  I'm not totally clear why that is necessarily such a good thing that you'd make a point of getting it INTO your diet, considering it's a WEED! Go figure.

review/summary: This stuff is awesome!
review/text: Dandy Blend is awesome! Why drink coffee when you can drink Dandy Blend? Coffee has lots of things in it that are bad for you (check the web), even though people don't like to admit it. Dandy Blend is a liver cleanser and it tastes great. You can drink it hot or cold. I usually drink it hot and add a little rice milk to it to give it that creamy taste. Mmm, yum. I think I'll go drink a cup right now. It is so much better than all of the "coffee substitutes" out there. (I've tried them all.)

review/summary: Pretty Decent Alternative to Coffee
review/text: I am a hot beverage drinker..in particular coffee and herbal tea.  When my doctor dictated I stop drinking coffee and acidic herbal teas, I was not a happy person.  I looked a long time and tried multiple alternatives to include high-end decaf products.  Since I am a black-no sugar-no frills of any kind in my coffee drinker, it's hard to hide funky flavors and aftertaste from me...this is a very good alternative for the $40 a lb decaf beans and I can make it by the cup not the pot.  I will not tell you this tastes exactly like a cup of strong French roast BUT it is reminiscent of one. We call this Kinda-Coffee in our house.  I have served it to people who use creamers and sugars to see if they would say anything and they were clueless it wasn't coffee afterwards,  which surprised me.  It is a fine powder and dissolves immediately in hot water and ready to drink instantly with no crunchy bits at the bottom.  Because it is a light weight powder, this bag will last a long time (guessing the equivalent of 2 large cans of coffee) and no wastage in the pot.  I use a  level spoonful per cup to give an idea of how much you might use.  It has a  pleasant aroma and flavor when drank hot, kinda like coffee...as it becomes tepid, it tastes a lot less like coffee to me and frankly a little funky, but there again, tepid coffee taste like crap to me too...so that may be my weird hard wiring not the product.  Would it pass as ice coffee...couldn't tell you personally...but my spouse likes it, but again, they are a cream and sugar person.  In our experience people who use creamers and sweeteners didn't notice,  whereas the purist (black, no sugar) thought it was instant coffee. This is a great product for those of us forced into lifestyle changes kicking and screaming but you might want to purchase a sample pack or smaller bag first. I haven't seen the "single packs" available on Amazon yet but I got mine from an online store called Dresslers.com for a penny to try.

review/text: My son enjoys this product, and I don't blame him.  It is SWEET.  Not surprisingly, since the first ingredient is JUICE, which is basically adding just empty calories for sweetness (as my pediatrician confirmed).  I won't be buying this product again.  Babies need whole fruit ingredients - juice is not considered an ideal food for them.  I also saw that Sprout's pack with cinnamon apple oatmeal also has juice listed as the first ingredient.

It's pretty hideous and I recommend you read the nutrition facts per serving size before consuming (Crack it off in quarters inside the package and then open).

review/summary: Heat--but not suicidal?
review/text: I enjoy puchasing Anchor Bar wing sauce. In case the reader does not know it, the Anchor Bar in Buffalo is the home of the Buffalo chicken wing. It was invented on the fly way back when. And Buffalo wings continue to be popular in Buffalo and elsewhere.<br /><br />The Anchor Bar still serves wings, although I haven't been there in many years (they used to have live jazz a couple nights each week, adding to the ambience). My experience includes a helping of "hot" wings before seeing a hockey match featuring the Buffalo Sabres with some friends. And, yikes! It burned, brought a huge amount of heat. The bottled "hotter" sauce that I had previously tried turns out to be more like a mild to medium batch of sauce. So I ordered the "suicidal" to see if it matched the actual hot sauce at the Bar. My son and I wimped out though, and mixed some hotter sauce with the suicidal. The end product did have some  heat--but nothing like actual hot sauce served at the Anchor Bar itself. Next time, my son and I will try chicken wings with ONLY the suicidal sauce and give it a fair test as to how close it comes the real hot sauce from the Bar.<br /><br />Anyhow, we enjoyed our chicken wings a lot with half hotter sauce and half suicidal. But the true test is yet to come!

review/summary: The "Chronic" of Green Teas
review/text: I recently took up drinking tea, green and white to be exact. As a newbie I started off with the commercial stuff like Lipton and Celestial Seasonings with pure tea bags. The taste was ok but In all honestly it didn't do anything for me. I began doing a bit of research and found that loose leaf tea was more potent and flavorful due to the fact that they use whole leaves rather than the "dust" leftover they use in tea bags. A bit more research brought me to Japanese green tea which recognized as the best of green teas in the world. I started off drinking Traditional Medicinals Japanese Bancha, then I started drinking their roasted Hojicha. While a bit better than your average Lipton Tea, I knew tea could be better. I started using loose leaf Sencha which was great and before long I came upon drinking Matcha. Matcha is great but it is frothy and mainly comes in powdered form for shakes, desserts or ice cream.<br />Gyokuro on the other hand is the REAL DEAL. This stuff is truly what a green tea is all about. Very dark greenish bluish color with a strong pleasant aroma. The taste is pure and fresh and simply tastes like "green tea" and not grass. It only takes about 90 seconds steeping time and the brewing temperature just under boiling point. The color of the tea is a very bright clean looking green which tastes as good as it looks. I dare you to open a tea bag of Lipton, Traditional Medicinals or even loose leaf Sencha and compare alongside Gyokuro. You will laugh as the others look like trash compared to Gyokuro, I kid you not. I suggest any real green tea aficionado give it a shot; you wont be disappointed and I can assure you you will never go back to drinking anything less. It is expensive but so well worth it. Serendipitea is a great brand, Hoshino is the place for the best Gyokuro in Japan.

I brew it at 140 degrees with filtered tap water (heated by a Zujirushi water kettle), and it is delicious. It will also make delicious iced tea if you brew it with room temperature water and then ice it down.<br /><br />Other reviews talk about the cheap packaging and they are definitely correct. The plastic bag is extremely flimsy and will tear. I transfer mine to a tea tin or glass container. However I did not notice any plastic flavor imparted to the tea.

The SerendipiTea product was missing all the complex flavors and had a bitter taste. There was nothing smooth or relaxing about it.<br /><br />For what it's worth, the brittle cellophane packaging was torn, and there was loose tea everywhere in both the tea box as well as the shipping box.  By comparison, the Adagio Gyokuro packaging is a heavy sealed plastic bag with an internal zip lock.<br /><br />If this was ever a Gyokuro, it died somewhere in transit.

review/summary: Huge Disappointment!!!
review/text: Having explored the world of Japanese tea for several years, I'm always keen to find new companies and explore their tea and teaware. Serendipitea was not a good choice sadly,(especially given the fact that they (Amazon) do not accept any returns. Tea arrived in a VERY cheap cellophane package that had been loosely sealed with a heat press to  melt the plastic and a plastic sticker folded over the top which did little to keep the tea from spilling out. Accordingly, the tea had a STRONG plastic odor and had lost any semblance of its essential tea oils. To be fair, this was likely a high quality Gyokuro in another life(a yame perhaps?) Unfortunatley, I'll never know as the pathetic packaging ruined its flavor. I've tossed it in the dust bin and relegated it to experience. (I wouldn't even give these pathetic "sweepings" to an indigent, much less good company) Stay far away from their teas (their kukicha is packaged poorly as well and has little flavor) Consider Charaku and Rishi as they are excellent sources of quality gyokuro and sencha teas. They use a high quality foil lined resealable pouch that does not impart any plastic odor or cause the tea to lose essential oils.

review/summary: REAL green tea
review/text: The Good:<br /><br />The difference between gyokuro and your average supermarket green tea (or even other premium green teas) is immense, but odds are you already know this if you're looking to order gyokuro, but for those unfamiliar I will elaborate.  You can smell it before you even open the package (even more so in my case, see The Bad) and the aroma is VERY fresh.  The aroma and flavor may not be appreciated by all because it is more potent than most green tea, with a grassy/seaweed hint/smell.  The tea leaf itself is pretty dark green with a bit of glossiness to it.  The cups of tea you get from the leaves however is a bright very green color, not the dark brownish green result you get with most generic, steamed green teas.<br /><br />I've always drank my regular green tea sweetened with a bit of honey.  However, I find myself able to enjoy the unsweetened flavor of this tea.  In fact, adding even a little bit of honey ruins the unique flavor IMO.  You can easily and enjoyably use the tea leaves more than once.  The first infusion is powerful and delicious, the second and third are very similar.  I personally found the 4th to be notably weaker, but still enjoyable.  Being able to infuse this many times without sacrificing much by way of flavor pretty much compensates for the fact that you must use more tea per cup than most teas (1 gram per 1 fl oz or so).<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The sealed bag inside of the box had a 1-2 inch tear in it and tea leaves were floating around both inside the serendipitea box and the bigger box amazon shipped it in.  Clearly more care needs to be put in the packaging and keeping it air-tight so that it can be delivered as fresh as possible.  I may try a different brand for my next order because of this.  Also, make sure you don't follow the directions on the sticker on the box, as they are just generic team brewing instructions, not specific to this unique type.<br /><br />Final Word:<br /><br />A great tea for people who enjoy the flavor of the green tea itself.  If you're like some people that I've shared this with (the ones who only like a hint of tea flavoring in their enormous mugs of sugar water), it's probably not for you.  The taste can be unpleasantly bitter to some, especially if prepared with too hot of water or if steeped for more than 2 mins) and some people are put off just by the aroma alone.<br /><br />If you're not sure how to prepare this tea properly, google it.  I highly recommend getting a big infuser/filter so that the tea leaves have room to expand fully.  I used my Swiss Gold TF-300 and was surprised at how much volume the leaves took up once they got wet, it pretty much doubled, and since you have to use more tea leaves per cup of this kind of tea already, you'll want to make sure you have enough room or make smaller cups than normal.  Also, the T-Fal electric tea kettle has a adjustable temperature dial, and the low setting works great for making this (you only want about 140 degrees F).<br /><br />Overall I enjoy this tea, but due to it being harder to make than, say, regular sencha, and the fact that it is prepared in smaller amounts (and at lower temps, so it gets cold fast), this isn't my every day tea.  Coincidentally, this tea is typically served for guests and on special occasions in Japanese culture and not usually an every-day tea there either.

review/text: I've been waiting for this variety to come to Amazon, since purchasing a box locally (and paying a pretty penny...$4 a box!) and really enjoying it.<br /><br />Don't let the "cocoa" in the description mislead you...this doesn't taste like hot chocolate. The cocoa flavor is really subtle, and it gives this tea a really full, rich taste. I am usually a coffee drinker, but I think I could switch for this tea. I take it with some milk and sugar. Highly recommended.

Why though does the only case-price available here ($35) work out to be $5.83 a box when you can buy this for $4/box in most stores, and all the other Good Earth lineup via Amazon are approx $18-$20 case? Weird.<br /><br />(*Edit* - Nov 20 2010) = Looks like the $35 price has been corrected and this is now inline with the other Good Earth on the site at around $19 - good stuff.

While this coffee isn't a French Roast, it clearly taste stronger than my  FOLGERS FRENCH ROAST.  Highly recommend for anyone who prefer a "darker" stronger taste with extra kick.

Great if you like "medium" taste<br />4. 1.5 STARS [Yuban 44oz (costco) ] very disappointed, so light as if its a bad decaf coffee

review/summary: Awesome coffee for the price...
review/text: Like many others have said, if you have a local Kirkland, it's probably best to get this coffee locally and save yourself $10-$15. I got this for about $13 and it's worth every single penny. I have a real love for Colombian coffee and prior to this, I was drinking Yuban. Well, Yuban was very good when I first tried it. I'm not sure what happened but now their coffee just has a different taste and not for the best I might add.<br /><br />When I learned that Costco has their own branding of coffee, I just knew it would be both cheap and big in quantity as well. But would the quality hold up? Well, being how I enjoyed many other Kirkland products, I can safely say that this Colombian coffee is a worthy addition to that list. Being how it's virtually impossible for someone to describe just how a coffee tastes, you'll just have to try a sample for yourself and see if its to your liking. Personally, I still think Yuban is the best when I have first began drinking it a couple of years ago but Kirkland's Colombian coffee definitely is very good as well. It's really hard to beat the price and quantity. This can is huge! Being how its grounded very finely, it should make for good espresso shots. I brew this using a Melitta filter and the coffee comes out just as delicious.

review/summary: Best Colombian Coffee Ever - $13 locally
review/text: My friend bought me three three-pound cans at Costco today for about $13 a can.  I paid him $40 for all.  Because it is a finer grind, less is needed for brewing.  Opening and using one can at a time I have packed coffee in four quart-size freezer bags to put in freezer and use one bag at a time, keeping enough out to last a couple of weeks.  Absolutely delicious coffee!<br /><br />Update 9-12-12:  I think coffee prices have fallen at Costco because a couple of weeks ago I bought an additional five three-pound cans for $60, they are down to $12 a can.  I probably have enough coffee to last two years.  Maybe I am turning into one of those Preppers who prepare for the apocalypse with stores of food.

review/summary: Real Darjeeling tea, finally !
review/text: Ever since Lipton Green Label stopped selling Darjeeling tea in USA, its been a constant fight to get good Darjeeling tea. I have grown up in East India, where we used to get Darjeeling tea directly from the garden. The whole leaf full flavor, which after about 3 to 5 minutes of brewing makes a golden brew, which resembles the color of early evening sky, right after the sunset while its gentle aroma slowly fills the room, it makes a great start of the day.<br /><br />Ever since coming to US I used to bring a huge packet of tea from India, or compromised with Lipton. After Lipton stopped selling I tried Twinings, but its not full leaf tea, its a cut and the flavor rather light.<br /><br />I discovered the Coffee Bean direct last month, just took a chance, and oh boy, this is exactly what I always wanted. The best of the Darjeeling is right here. The price is very very reasonable compared to quality of the pack I got. Now, one thing to remember, no matter which tea you buy, it varies from pack to pack, but most of the time they get their tea's from same garden and taste similar. I don't really know it will be same for the next pack, but for now this is definitely the most authentic Darjeeling tea I have ever tested around this side of the earth.

review/text: It has become increasingly difficult to get good Darjeeling tea.  I tried this one because it had some good reviews, however, it doesn't look, smell or taste like genuine Darjeeling tea.  The taste of Darjeeling differs by when it is picked and most tea companies sell a combination of 1st and 2nd flush.  This company does not specify but it didn't taste anything like Darjeeling and I have tried first, second and autumn flush as well as monsoon.  It was very bitter and astringent, it didn't look good when I opened it so I only used 1/2 teaspoon of tea.  However, the brew was dark and bitter with a nasty aftertaste,really undrinkable.

review/summary: Delightful Darjeeling
review/text: This is my favorite tea, and if you look around at my other reviews, you can see I drink a lot of tea. I average two gallons a day (some green, some decaf, some oolong, lots of black and this delightful Darjeeling). That doesn't mean that I know what I am talking about. It does mean that this tea has lots of competition.<br />I don't hesitate to call it my personal favorite (but I will still drink the others as long as God gives me breath and hot water).<br />This tea is delicate and yet refreshing. It holds up pretty well even if over-steeped.<br />I think if you like Darjeeling, you will be surprised at how good this is for the price. If you are not sure (or have not had Darjeeling before) it is technically not quite a black tea and not quite a green tea. It is similar to oolong in strength, because of how it is processed. It is more like black Indian tea in character because of where and how it is grown.<br />This is certainly one of the lowest-priced ways of trying it if you are not sure.

The $$/lbs is excellent however the quality is noticeably inferior to M Hope. I gave it 4 stars because it is quite drinkable for an everyday tea IF you prepare it correctly. I don't like bitterness. But, I do like rich complex flavors. To achieve this I use 25-30% more leaf and reduce steep time by 30 seconds. This method produces a good (not great) flavor without the harsh bitterness. It is a good bargain even when I add more leaf to the brew. Yes, I would buy it again....provided M Hope is still not available.

I have looked for a long time for a replacement for Lipton's Green Label Darjeeling which I can not find anymore.  This is just as good or better.  The bag is also generously sized - a plus!<br />Update Oct 2012:<br />I have found that this tea is hit or miss.  Sometimes it is a good Darjeeling, sometimes it seems to be some other type of tea.  Still nice, big leaves, but not the classic Darjeeling flavor.  Green Label is available again, and it has always been of constant quality.

review/summary: Pricey Sack 'O Nuts...No If's And's or Butts... But Buy Them You Must!
review/text: I have reviewed these macadamias several years ago and I am updating my review based on recent frequent purchases. I have purchased macadamias from literally every growing region on the globe, including South Africa (Planter's), Costa Rica , Australia (Trader Joe's) and Hawaii.  Nothing, and I do mean nothing, has the fresh, intense, buttery and unique aroma of Mauna Loa macadamia nuts. Other macs all taste mealy, bland, tasteless or rancid, including most generic store brands. The rich, volcanic soil of Hawaii continues to produce the finest macadamias on the globe in my opinion. If you are a distinguishing connoisseur and aficionado of the nut, you must have them or face serious withdrawal symptoms.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite the purchase of Mauna Loa by Hershey Chocolate Corp. in 2004, the availability of Mauna Loa products, particularly on the East Coast of the U.S. remains challenging. This is because of increasing global market demand, shelf space limitations and slotting fees charged to supermarkets and other retailers to stock the items and recent unfavorable climate conditions on the Big Island.<br /><br />Mauna Loa has had significant price increases since 2010, particularly with the 4.5oz canned nut products. However, these nuts are still worth every penny if you purchase them fresh. I have since switched from purchasing these in the 4.5 oz. "6-pack", to 11 oz. pouches with Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" Subscription, because they are a bit cheaper and there is no additional charge for shipping.  Mauna Loa has finally embraced putting easy to read Best Buy ("BB") dates on its products and this makes it easy to insure that you are getting fresh product. I hope I have made this an easy nut to crack!  Happy Munching.

review/summary: Cheesecake Mixes To Die For!
review/text: Have you ever heard of the Caramel Nutter Butter or the Creamsicle Dreamsicle? I bet you already have heard of it. This is just two of the great tasting flavors of the popular Pam's Pantry Cheesecake Mix. This is the most sought after cheesecake nowadays because of its multiple use, aside from its heavenly taste. It can be used not just to prepare the best gourmet cheesecake desserts but also as a muffin spread, cake frosting or even as a frozen drink treat. My favorite flavor among four available flavors is the funfetti. Try it and you will understand why it's my favorite.

review/summary: Peppery Goodness!
review/text: I finally decided to give the Wild Hare Beef Jerky a try since it kept popping up on my Add On options whenever I ordered my K-Cups. My family loves jerky and so I thought it would be a good idea to try something besides the grocery store favorites for a change.<br /><br />Size: The 3 oz package came with 10 jerky pieces (not strips) and its apparently a Grand Champion Recipe winner from Wisconsin, so I figured we were in for a treat!<br /><br />Texture: This is a thinly-sliced jerky, robust and chewy, gives your teeth something to work on<br /><br />Flavor: Peppery! I love pepper so this was a nice surprise over the saltier versions we have tried in the past. There is a slight smoky flavor to it, but doesn't overwhelm the beefiness<br /><br />Price: I bought the 3 oz for $7.00 which seems like a good value and the smaller size gave me the opportunity to try the teriyaki and hot cajun.<br /><br />I will definitely order this again and might try the beef sticks, too.

review/summary: *Quality* Product But Hard To Break!
review/text: I love Stella & Chewy's and have been feeding their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BGB24S">Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Raw Duck Duck Goose Dinner for Dogs, 16oz</a> as well as their frozen raw and other flavors to my Shiba Inu puppy and she LOVES it! Ever since my vet recommended the brand for finicky eaters, I've been giving it to Monju (mixed with dry kibble).<br /><br />Anyway, STELLA & CHEWY'S CARNIVORE KISSES SALMON (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MQEN0O">Stella & Chewy's Carnivore Kisses, Freeze-Dried Raw Angus Beef Dog and Cat Treats</a> are the same way) are of the same top quality as their meals. They're small, but not bite size (unless you have a big dog), freeze-dried pieces of salmon that's great for giving as treats. They have that strong fishy-scent that dogs love, so your furry child will be able to find them with no problem.<br /><br />The reason I took off one-star is because the treats are hard to break apart. Since they're freeze-dried, when trying to break into smaller pieces the KISSES will splinter and shred, which makes it hard to give a small quick bite for a reward during training. Even if you were to break them apart before hand, the treats still shred so it's hard to get small bite sized pieces.<br /><br />Also, if your pooch is able to get the whole treat in his/her mouth, it still has to be chewed, taking time away from focus, if you're using as a training aid. Other than that the treats are great.

review/summary: Small, Sweet Breakfast, Snack or Dessert
review/text: As described, each box of cereal is small at 11.4 ounces. One serving size is 3/4 cup of cereal (there are supposed to be 10 servings in a box) with 120 calories, 11 grams of sugars, 3 grams of fiber, and 24 grams of total carbohydrates per serving. If you measure 3/4 cup, it's a very small bowl. Add 1/2 cup of skim milk, and the calorie total is 160. Kellogg's Krave is sweet, crunchy and has a nice chocolate flavor... something this reviewer thinks would make a better snack or lower calorie dessert than "breakfast", since it only has 2 grams of protein per small bowl. Overall, the nutritional values are good for vitamins and minerals; better than a small bowl of ice cream or slice of chocolate cake.<br /><br />Kellogg's Krave is very tasty. Keep in mind, if you fill a regular cereal bowl, you'd have at least 22 grams of sugar for your breakfast, and would then only get 4-5 servings per box. While I'm inclined to eat a small bowl as a chocolate flavored snack, my sons like it as a breakfast cereal.

review/summary: Another chocolate disappointment
review/text: I was excited when I saw the commercial for Krave.  Being a genetic chocoholic (my entire family as far back as we know) I knew I'd try it as soon as it hit the shelves in spite of not being truly satisfied with *any* chocolate flavored cereal - ever - even as a kid.<br /><br />I purchased a box of each variety and tried the "plain" one first. Of course the first thing I had to do was bite one in half to see the chocolate center.  I had to really look to see the very small, thin strip of chocolate on one side of the inside of the hollow pillow.  Nothing like the box photo which seems to show a full chocolate center (could that be considered false advertising?).  I ate a few dry.  They were "just OK".  The outer shell is somewhat bland but the chocolate seemed to come through a bit, however nothing as strong or full as I'd expected.  Considering the size of the strip I wasn't totally surprised at this result.  So out comes the milk for a bowl full.  It works OK with milk but has a very odd mouth feel.  Somewhat grainy but the chocolate stood out more and presented a more chocolate flavor than when eaten dry.  It's not a *great* chocolate, tasting much like a chocolate syrup mixed with a chocolate spread, but acceptable for a breakfast cereal having a bit more chocolate flavor than most.  Then the side effects hit.  The chocolate didn't really melt as much as it combined with the shell turning into a paste that stuck to my teeth much like a gummy snack.  Bummer.  Then, after only a few spoonfuls, the shell began to get soggy.  The mouth feel was a bit better when soggy (not as grainy) but the gummy effect seemed to intensify.  I was very disappointed with the cereal and couldn't wait for the box to empty so I could move on to something better.  The sad part is I still have a box of the chocolate outer shell variety that I just can't bring myself to open.<br /><br />I *did* cut the product coupon off the box just in case the chocolate outer shell version is better than the "plain" version.  I have a strong feeling that coupon will expire.

Sugar wise it's on par with Lucky Charms (11g per 3/4c vs 14g per 1c), but to be honest it has no mass. They're really fluffy, like crunchy styrofoam peanuts, and feels like a mouth full of sawdust as you chew.<br /><br />Pros: Your kids will love it due to the sugar<br />Cons: Not incredibly healthy, texture is no good.

review/text: I got these through the Vine program because I am a chocoholic and thought I would enjoy them.  As a kid I was "cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs" and this cereal is the adult version.  I mean they taste almost identical to Cocoa Puffs, the same texture and everything, with a bit of a chocolate creamy center.  They taste awesome and I only have one bad thing to say about them and that is they are not filling at all.  They are kind of airy so even though I ate the recommended amount of 3/4 cup I was still left feeling pretty hungry.  So overall, I think I will be eating these as an in-between-meals type of snack when I am craving chocolate.

It wasn't overwhelming.<br />If you're looking for a way to get more fiber into your kids, this will be a good one to try.

review/summary: Tasty Cereal, Especially as a Milk-Free snack
review/text: Kellogg's Krave does a fairly good job navigating the area between savory and sweet for a breakfast serial.  Essentially it is a basic cereal with a creamy chocolate stuffed inside.  Like many little chocolate raviolis.<br /><br />At my first bite, it was odd.  After about three, I was in.  The chocolate inside for better or worse, tastes and has the consistency of real chocolate, almost like a Nutella.  The bad news is that it does not hold up particularly well to milk.  When the outside gets a bit soggy, you are left with a creamy chocolate streak covered in a soggy cereal.  It still taste good, but the texture is very off putting.<br /><br />All in all however, it is a good effort for a new cereal from Kellogg.

review/summary: Unique Flavor- Worthy of a Try
review/text: The history of incorporating chocolate into breakfast cereal is a little hazy but we know with certainty Kellogg's had combined the stuff with its Rice Krispies line in the 1950s (hence Cocoa Krispies were born).  We know that in the time since, chocolate has become an absolute staple in the breakfast cereal world but, generally speaking, has been relegated to the domain of children's cereals while adults are expected to enjoy more "sensible" selections; often with the terms like oats, grain, fiber, or corn in the title.<br /><br />Of late it appears Kellogg's is doing its best to blur the lines between such stereotypes and entries like their Special K Chocolaty Delight and Krave (reviewed here) are prime examples of this evolution of reasoning.<br /><br />Beginning with the box itself, Krave makes clear the notion that this is adult-targeted in presentation; no flashy colors, no cartoony mascot and certainly no prizes to be found inside.  What you do gain by studying up on the cardboard is that Krave is a crispy multigrain cereal outside with smooth chocolate inside- and that it's made with real chocolate at that.<br /><br />Additionally a quick scan of the side of the box reveals that every serving is made with 9 grams of whole grains and is a "good source" of fiber; in this case 3g per serving.  But enough with all of the dry facts, the real deal breaker when it comes to a market with as many great choices as the cereal aisle has to offer is taste.  That said, to my perpetually juvenile taste buds, Krave tastes pretty darn good.<br /><br />The initial flavor is undeniably that of the corn outer shell but it's not as crispy or firm as say Cap'N Crunch.  Rather it's fairly airy and light and doesn't take long to absorb milk.  Fans of extremely crispy cereal may be better off looking elsewhere (or eating fast).  The chocolate is surprisingly rich and not the usual powdered affair typically associated with cereal.<br /><br />In all, the smooth chocolate and airy crispy corn combination work surprisingly well together.  It seemed to me like the corn taste actually becomes less and less prevalent as the outside of the cereal absorbs milk.  By the time the bowl is complete, I was tasting mostly the soft chocolate filling (and had no complaints with that).<br /><br />In conclusion, Krave is certainly worth the price of admission.  I typically try not to allow myself to get too attached to new cereals, as brands tend to appear and disappear so frequently with little to no warning but after a few bowls, I think it's safe to assume Krave could build itself a lasting niche in the competitive market on account of the fact that there really isn't a flavor/ consistency exactly like it out there.  I will definitely be adding it to my rotation.

review/summary: Perfect amount of chocolate without being too sweet
review/text: Kellogg's Krave cereal is really tasty.  I like it for a snack, myself.  The outside is crunchy, but soft in milk, and this inside, which I was afraid was going to be almost too sweet, is the absolute right amount of chocolate.  I do wish it had more nutritional value, but it tastes great, and I'll probably buy this again to snack on.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I'm not a huge chocolate fan but I do like some, so I thought I would like this better than the double-chocolate Krave.  And I do. It's not too sweet and not too chocolate-y.  But I don't like soggy cereal and this does not stay crunchy enough in milk for me.  However, like many of the other reviews, I tried it dry as a snack and found it works great that way.  Throw in some peanuts and dried fruit and it makes a great trail mix, too.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I am really enjoying this cereal. The flavor and consistency is something like a combination of Cap'n Crunch and Count Chocula. The cereal is crunchy, but not overly so. It is actually quite soft when served with cold milk. Not too sweet. Just sweet enough to take care or your sweet tooth without overdosing you on sugar.

review/summary: A good chocolate treat!
review/text: Half the box went for breakfast and I ended up snacking on the other half. The chocolate is quite good and I really enjoyed the crunchiness. Will I replace my normal cereal eating favorites with this? Probably not, but it will be a perfect once-in-a-while treat. Who am I kidding, I'm buying more on next grocery run...

review/summary: innovative
review/text: Cereals haven't really been very exciting since somebody figured out that you can sell more to kids if you coat the grains with sugar. However, Krave is actually a fresh idea in a supermarket aisle dominated by the health-conscious and the sugary extremes. The cereal has a whole grain exterior with a chocolate inside. The exterior is soft to the bite while the chocolate taste is subtle - definitely noticeable, but toned down from those sugary excesses. It's neither too unhealthy nor tastelessly healthy - just the right combination. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something besides Cheerios or Cocoa Puffs.

review/summary: No "Kravings" here
review/text: I have to say that I really like the packaging.  The cereal name and part of the image have raised graphics that I felt as soon as I picked up the box.  However, the cereal falls a little short of the cool packaging.  I have tried both the Chocolate Krave (as shown here) and the Double Chocolate Krave.  The Chocolate variety has a better flavor, as voted by our household of 3, but that is not saying much.  You will have a more enjoyable cereal experience if the cereal is consumed straight from the box, without milk.  Once milk is added, it turns soggy and mushy, like dipping your toast into milk; not really a pleasant texture.  The cereal itself is very grainy/gritty, almost fibrous, although not tough.  There is just a hint of chocolate.  Actually, there is very little chocolate inside. The chocolate has the consistency that reminds me of a brand name chocolate-nut spread, but definitely not the same wonderful flavor.  I will not re-iterate the nutritional information, as one reviewer has already presented that information. Overall, this cereal is unlike any cereal I have had before, and I cannot say that I would purchase it again.  It is a little disappointing.  If you need a chocolate cereal fix, Kellogg's has better choices available.

review/summary: Cookies for breakfast?
review/text: Just had a small bowl for dessert, after dinner; quite delicious. However, I really question whether parents are going to be happy about letting the kids have this cereal for breakfast; it really is more like cookies than cereal. Of course, if the kids learn about this, and once they've tasted it, they'll clamor for it. I foresee  acrimonious scenes in the cereal aisle of the grocery store.

review/summary: Very Tasty, But
review/text: I grew up with Kellogg's products, so I really like them.  Krave is no exception.  It is very tasty, is made with whole grain, and does have 25% or more of many of the daily vitamins and minerals that are recommended.  However, you should take into consideration that it has 120 calories in a 3/4 cup serving, which includes 11 grams of sugar, 100 mg of salt, and 3.5 grams of fat (Milk not included).  This is not bad compared to other sugary cereals.  Therefore, I believe it may be good as an occasional treat for breakfast, but not to eat on a regular basis.

review/summary: Not Fully Cravable
review/text: When it has came down to Kellogg's, they have honestly had some really good cereals, and some that could've just been a dash more for everyone to love. That was honestly the case with their latest cereal, Krave. The chocolate cereal handles well at heart, yet there honestly could have been a bit more in the chocolatey taste from each tasty morsel. I overall was expecting more in each bite, and felt a bit shortchanged on what I was eating. It isn't a bad cereal at first, but not really anything worth buying in the long run as would be the case with Rice Krispies or Corn Flakes.<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Taste: C<br /><br />Overall: C

review/summary: Better by the handful than in the breakfast bowl
review/text: It seems that most of the major cereal companies these days are jumping on the Chocolate Bandwagon.  We have Chocolate Cheerios, Chocolate Chex, something called Kashi Cocoa Beach to name a few.  Kellogg's has entered the race to the top of the shelf with this entry - Kellogg's Krave.  Its special claim is to have a crispy multi-grain cereal outside and a smooth chocolate filling.  Its taste is pleasant but not overly chocolaty. I found that the product does not hold up well in milk losing is crispiness quickly.  It IS a good snack for reaching in the box and grabbing a handful to eat in front of the TV when you just need a bite of something good.<br /><br />When comparing it nutritionally to a couple of the other Chocolate cereals I mentioned it falls in the middle calorie-wise; the fat grams are higher but the sodium is much lower.  It hits the middle in carb content; has the most fiber and at 2 grams of Protein matches one & is better than the other.  I won't list the exact numbers as several other reviewers have already done that.<br /><br />For me, cereal just isn't a vehicle for chocolate.  I'll continue to have my oatmeal in the morning and have my chocolate when my sweetie brings me a heart shaped box tied with a ribbon.

review/summary: Doesn't Sate my Kravings
review/text: I like chocolate and sweet cereals so I bought this as soon as I saw it on the shelves. It's a chocolate-filled, crunchy cereal. I like my cereal with milk but I quickly found that this is the most soggy cereal I've ever tried. Because of the texture, it's limp and wilted in no time. Like others have said, this has a grainy texture that is still noticeable when it's soggy. Very strange.<br /><br />The crunchy outside does taste decent with the chocolate filling but the filling is too liquidy. A thicker filling would have made me happier than something so syrup-y.<br /><br />It's not as bad as you might think for a sweet cereal. It has plenty of vitamins and minerals but, of course, plenty of carbs, too.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I prefer some Frosted Flakes for a sweet, breakfast cereal.

review/text: I can't understand all of these negative reviews.... I tried this cereal while visiting family in Alabama and fell in love!  I'm a chocolate lover, so maybe that is why I really liked it.  It did not have any kind of burnt chemical taste to me... Anyway, back home in Alaska, this cereal cannot be found.  Maybe it is just too new?  So thank you Amazon for giving me the option of buying this cereal!!!  Sooooooo good!!!!

review/summary: I crave Krave
review/text: I'm pretty impressed with this cereal.  I gave it to 14YO son to try, knowing he would like the chocolatey center.  Normally in our house we buy only the common-sense type cereals - oatmeal, plain cheerios and so on - so this was definitely a treat for him.  Predictably, he loves it and wants it every day - not just for breakfast.  He likes the chocolatey center which he describes as softer than actual chocolate but more solid than chocolate syrup, and the outside stays crunchy while immersed in milk long enough for him to get through a bowl.<br /><br />What impressed me was looking at the ingredients.  For starters, there is no "high fructose corn syrup" or corn syrup of any kind, in this product.  The ingredients for the cereal coating are all whole grains, and even the chocolatey center is comprised of mostly wholesome ingredients.  Sugar, yes, but at least the ingredients are recognizable - not a bunch of chemical sounding names.<br /><br />Naturally, son would like this to become a staple in the house so he can eat it every day.  Price will determine that - I suspect due to price it will remain a treat.  However I will purchase it again.

review/text: If you love chocolate (like I do), then you'll probably enjoy this cereal.  The cereal squares are multi-grain and filled with real chocolate.  Yum!  I enjoy eating this with a bowl of milk or I drop some into a container of plain yogurt.  I can see this being a family favorite, with kids and adults alike.

review/summary: Pretty awful, even for a chocaholic.
review/text: I am a chocaholic, so when I saw that Kellogg's came out with a chocolate-filled cereal, I knew I had to try it in hopes that it would help with my chocolate cravings (note: I bought mine in a grocery store, not from Amazon).<br /><br />I tried it first the traditional way--with milk.  Didn't care for it at ALL. The texture of it in milk (the mouth feel) was alien and grainy.  Won't say it is the worst cereal I've had (FiberPlus Cinnamon Oat Crunch gets that honor), but it comes close.<br /><br />Then I tried it as a snack, right out of the box.  The cereal coating is not as bad this way.  I got more crunch and less graininess.  If I ever eat more of this cereal, it will likely be this way.<br /><br />For those who care about the nutrition, here are the stats for a 3/4 cup serving:<br />Calories  120<br />Total Fat  3.5g<br />Sat Fat  1.0<br />Trans Fat  0<br />Poly unsat  1.5<br />Mono unsat  1.0<br />Sodium  100mg<br />Total carb  24g<br />Fiber  3g<br />Sugars  11g<br />Protein  2g<br />Vitamins A, B1, B6, B12, C and D and some minerals.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />1. Krave is too sweet for me...the cereal coating has some sweetness and then the "chocolate" inside is liquidy and tastes like cheap chocolate syrup. Not satisfying for THIS sweet tooth.<br /><br />2. The "crispy cereal outside" looks like sprayed styrofoam insulation. It is clearly some amalgam of stuff that is squirted into forms or something. It doesn't look and doesn't have the mouth feel of anything else I've ever had.<br /><br />3. The "crispy cereal outside" has a nasty, grainy texture and mouth feel in milk.
