review/text: This is a great low carb alternative.<br />If you overcook it just a little bit, it will taste better and have more of the regular pasta consistency. I would really recommend this to anyone doing low carb. Wish it came in more shapes though, it seems only penne is available.

I first used it to make a caesar salad with a hint of avacado. We served it to our dinner guests and they all raved about it. Warning, use sparingly as you only need a little to get the flavor boost. A very worthwhile product!

review/text: I love love love these! They are great as an afternoon pick-me-up when I want something sweet tasting but have eaten healthy all day, and don't want to spoil that. I'm not diabetic but I do think it's important to eat as if I were, who needs all the sugar found in regular everyday snacks and drinks. These are so full of flavor--coffee/espresso combined with chocolate is always a winner; sweetness comes from the use of Agave, a low glycemic choice. The other flavor I go for is the Cranberry-Orange Spice. All the choices are great because they have the healthy basis, with Omega 3's and Fiber, so I don't have to scrutinize each box/flavor like with some brands. I even brought a box of each flavor to share at a family gathering because half the group is active and the other half is not, and these are good for both!

review/text: I bought this because it is supposed to be healthy for you.  But it doesn't matter how healthy it is if you can't stomach the taste.  The best I can describe it is like dirt with a hint of cranberry.  At first I didn't think it was terrible - but if you just want to sip it, forget it.  It gets worse with each sip.<br /><br />Since I wanted it more for a relaxed beverage - I just can't tolerate the taste and either had to guzzle it or dump it.  I even tried to make iced tea and mixed it with equal amounts of black tea bags...that dirt taste is just so strong it couldn't even help make it more tolerable.  I will not purchase this again.

This macaroni, however, tasted wonderful!  I think that this has a lot more flavor than the Kraft macaroni and it's so much better for you too!  At first, my two year old would not try it as it was not the yellow color of the Kraft macaroni.  So, I added a little bit of orange food coloring (the sauce is white so any color would work perfectly) and he was so excited about orange macaroni that he gobbled it right up, telling me repeatedly how yummy it was.  I think we can have some fun mixing up the colors in the future.  I would highly recommend this!

review/summary: Best Whole Wheat Mac & Cheese!
review/text: This is the best tasting whole wheat mac and cheese out there!. All the ingredients are naturally wholesome making this a healthy and tasty dinner. Each box makes sooo much, the nutrition content is based on 1/3 of the box but I would say that there are actually about 4-5 servings once prepared.<br />The calorie and nutrition content listed on Amazon is only for the ingredients in the box. The preparation directions call for a quarter cup milk and a quarter cup butter or margarine. If you're looking for a healthier option... I make mine with only a tablespoon of "Olivio" spread and about a third of a cup of "Almond Breeze Unsweetened Original" almond milk. This will reduce the amount of fat and calories and it comes out tasting fabulous! If the sauce is a little runny put it back on the stove for a few minutes, stiring constantly, until the sauce thickens.

The pasta itself is good, but the cheese powder was so incredibly salty I threw most of the finished mac and cheese away.  Now, faced with the other eleven boxes my only option seems to be use the pasta and part of the cheese powder, add my own cheese to the mix and hope it turns out ok.  Which will make the whole thing much less convenient and one whale of a lot more costly!<br /><br />Hodgson Mill usually makes good stuff and this is a real disappointment.

These Hodgson Mills whole-grain products don't seem to trigger that reaction as much (although I still have to be somewhat cautious). This mac & cheese is just terrific! Tastes marvelous, no additives, when cooked al dente has a nice "tooth" to it. It doesn't get any better than this. My husband who isn't nearly as committed to eating "better" as I am likes it, too.

review/text: Purchased this on July 27th.  Made a box of it when it arrived for dinner.  It wasn't anything like any mac and cheese I've ever eaten. Bland, texture not quite right, wasn't a smooth sauce; it just wasn't really all that appetizing for us.  I've been hesitant to try another box, and since and it's been months, I doubt we really would want to eat this again.  I guess it's time to find a food bank to donate it to. (I hope they like it)

review/summary: Mom says it is yucky
review/text: My family eats and likes 100% whole wheat pasta, crackers and bread, so I thought we'd like this mac n cheese, too. This product tastes awful. What a bummer to own 12 boxes of yucky mac n cheese! I tried mixing it with other mac n cheese to make it tastier, but nothing can overcome the bad taste of this pasta. I finally threw the remaining Hodgson Whole Wheat Macaroni in the trash and kept the cheese packets to sprinkle on popcorn.

review/summary: Didn't stand behind their product !
review/text: Macaroni is referred to in various medieval East Africa sources, though it's not always clear whether it's a prepared dish or a noodle.<br /><br />However, pasta and cheese baked dishes are recorded in cookbooks of the time such as the Liber de Koquina showing that they were a known prepared style of dish. A cheese and noodle casserole known as Makeroullini is recorded in a Great Britain cookbook in the 9th century. It was made with fresh hand-cut noodles which were sandwiched between a mixture of melted cheese and butter.<br /><br />It was apparently considered an upperclass dish even in Italy until around the 13th century; now only lazy and fat people eat it in the United States.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Found Weevils (A weevil is a beetle.  Weevils are often found in dry foods including nuts and seeds, cereal and grain products, such as pancake mix.) inside all my boxes and Cheese mix.  I emailed Hodgson Mill and they tried to blame Amazon.  They didn't stand behind their product nor seemed to care at all.  They sent me 5 .35 cent coupons for my next purchase(!).  I also had problems with molded boxes in their couscous.  I won't be buying from Hodgson Mill EVER AGAIN.

review/text: I use Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends ~ Poultry Magic for all my poultry and stuffing needs. The problem is the only store that sold it (Superfresh) in my area just closed down. It adds that kick that my family and myself likes. I normally buy it in a 2.0 oz. jar for about $3 plus. So there is no doubt the 24 oz. can was a better value. It shipped fast (3 days) and came with a little catalog with all their other spices, most of which I didn't know existed.

review/summary: Somewhat resembles peanut butter-- maybe
review/text: I purchased this in a grocery store, not amazon, but having read these reviews I wanted to offer my view. I absolutely cannot believe the other reviews that say it is good or the closest thing to natural peanut butter. Neither the texture nor the taste come close to even the cheapest supermarket brand peanut butter, never mind tasting like a quality natural product. It has intense off-flavors, somewhat reminiscent of tapioca gone bad, or perhaps it's something like a sweet chemical-like flavor/smell. And the texture is way wrong. It is too thin, almost liquidy. Just yuck. Better'n Peanut Butter isn't even better'n nothing.

review/summary: Better'n Peanut Butter vs. Jiff
review/text: I am pleasantly surprised that this stuff taste better than any of the natural peanut butters I tried to replace Jiff with. While it does not taste better than my favorite it is the closest. I would rather eat this than Peter Pan, Reeses, or any other similar competitors. My main purpose for this peanut butter was to replace Jiff because of its ridiculous fat and caloric count. I now eat this 9 out of 10 PB and J's. It suffices enough to replace Jiff. I have no guilt when eating peanut butter now with the amazing nutrition of this product and unexpectedly good taste. I keep Jiff around to eat maybe once a month although I would not die if I was never allowed ot purchase it again come tomorrow. I am not a health freak, but I just started working out again 3x's a week and this really helps me shed calories and fat while supplying some nice protein and fiber. God bless greek yogurt, canned tuna fish, and this peanut butter for keeping me healthy and not looking like glutton.

No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth, must be from the wax.  I was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead.  The sad thing is that they do NOT have to use trans fats to get flavor.  They just don't care.

review/summary: Smells Bad, Tastes Worse
review/text: I've been experimenting with different cooking sauces and found this on sale at my local grocer, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's a really think sauce, almost like ketchup, but has a coarser texture.<br />When I heated it up in a pan, it just sat there and didn't spread out much.  I finally spread it around with a spatula and added my chicken.<br />It smelled like cheap vinegar, not like any kind of curry sauce I've ever tried (and I've tried quite a few). It tasted a lot like cheap vinegar, too. I added a little bit of tandoori powder and a little bit of Thai basic cooking sauce I happened to have handy and managed to save the meal.<br />I still have half a bottle of the stuff and I haven't decided what to do with it (Toss it? Mix it with something else?). All I know is it's no good by itself and it has managed to stink up the whole apartment.

review/text: Seriously, this is some GOOD stuff! It's not particularly spicy, especially if you're the sort who's into trying the hottest of the hot sauces, but the flavor is phenomenal! The garlic taste is strong but not at all overpowering. It's not the sort that has a load of vinegar in it, which is a huge plus in my book. When you get it, I highly recommend opening it up and taking a whiff. The scent is out of this world.<br /><br />Basically, if you're looking for a sauce that's light on heat but big on taste, get this one. You will absolutely not regret it.

review/summary: This is THE BOMB on Salmon!!
review/text: All you need to make THE BEST SALMON is to sprinkle a little of this on one side of the salmon, and bake/broil the requisite time.  In my infrared toaster oven (which cooks faster than most traditional ones... you may have to up to double the time in those),  I simply put some aluminum foil on the small tray, lay the salmon fillets down on that, sprinkle a little Zatarains Creole seasoning on the top, then put it in on 425 for about 10 minutes.  DELICIOUS!!!  And incredibly easy!!<br /><br />I've tried other Creole seasonings to make Salmon, and the two I've tried didn't even come close.<br /><br />AND, salmon is pretty forgiving, so if you overcook it a bit, no big deal, it'll still be good.<br /><br />Try it, you'll be so thankful you did, and will not bother with all the hassle of mixing special sauces for your salmon.  When I go out to a restaurant, I rarely ever order the salmon, because I regularly make better (almost always) at home for a lot less money.

It's a must for jambalaya, gumbo, and anything considered creole.  I especially like it in country gravy, but it is good in any gravy.  Use it on baked potatoes instead of regular salt, it's great in casseroles, stews, ham and beans, and so many other things in which you would normally add salt.  It turns ordinary hamburgers and meatloaf into a memorable meal.<br /><br />I've had many compliments about the flavor of foods in which I've used the Zatarans.  As another reviewer said, this is a must to keep in your spice rack.

review/summary: Add a Taste of Louisiana to Any Dish
review/text: Zatarain's Creole Seasoning is a flavorful, versatile blend of spices that can add a taste of Louisiana to any dish.  I have only one complaint.  It's way too salty!  By comparison, it has almost twice the sodium content of Grace's Caribbean Tradition Jerk Seasoning.  If you really like to put some flavor in your food but don't care for salt, you're out of luck with Zatarain's.  Now, I recognize I both like more flavor and far less salt than most, but a lack of salt can always be rectified with the shaker everyone has handy.  There's nothing I can do.  Sadly, this has left my can of Zatarain's sitting on my spice shelf unused and forlorn.

The flavor is not overwhelmingly tart or strong and blends nicely with other flavors.  Its very smooth tasting as opposed to the grittyness of other brands.  They source this from Peru and package it well.  Highly recommend this Cacao if chocolate is your thing.

review/summary: Sooooo Delicious!
review/text: I had never tried raw cocoa powder before, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it tastes just as good as the roasted kind.  I make the best sugar-free, healthy, chocolate milk, milkshakes, and ice cream with this cocoa powder using raw cow's milk and Kal white stevia powder. I use one tiny scoop of stevia per cup of milk, plus one heaping tablespoon of cocoa powder and blend it up.  It's also delicious with bananas, peanut butter, peppermint, strawberries (tastes like chocolate-covered strawberries), coconut oil (tastes like Mounds candy bars) or blueberries blended in.  I can't get enough.  I only hope that this cocoa powder is truly raw, and not roasted at low temperature.

I have tried the other coconut water products and they are good, different because they are supposed to taste like the water of green coconuts but still good.  I have tried "ONE", "ZICO" and "Naked" and for the most part they are good but all for some time time tasted like dirty water.  I don't know if this was a problem with the product or what but I endede up canceling my subscriptions to these coconut water brands.  "Vita Coco" always tasted funny to me so I just bought it once.

review/summary: not pure, but i still like it
review/text: ok.  having read the poor reviews, and still wanting a cheap product, i bought this through subscribe and save, and on sale, and it came out to about a dollar per can.  this tastes similar to products i've tried in asian supermarkets that advertise 70% coconut water, and 30% sugar water, essentially, and which taste pretty good, imo.  the ingredients in this product: coconut water, water, coconut meal (the pieces of coconut in the product) sugar, and potassium metabisulfite (preservative)-  130 calories for a 11.8 oz can, 26g sugar. Coca cola has about 150 cal for 12 oz, and 40g sugar, as a comparison.<br /><br />so, if you are drinking this for health, you would do much better with pure coconut water- vita coco-60 cal for 11.2 oz, 15g sugar, which i also think tastes great (sugar adds lots of calories!)  but,if you're drinking this for "fun," (i just like the taste, and coconut water in general feels more hydrating when i drink it),  i figure you're still getting some of the health benefits of the coconut water, even if you're going to drink some sugar water in the process (i put sugar in my coffee and tea...), which i don't mind that much, since i'm not downing this like water or anything.  it also is the only thing my husband will drink, cuz he thinks pure coconut water is bleah.<br /><br />i give it 4 stars, cuz it's good for what it is- a cocktail coconut drink (think cranberry juices)--however, they SHOULD let you know on the website this is a cocktail, though (very BAD advertising omission).  also, many of the cans were dented. but, still, the product is yummy.

I had a case of V8 come so damaged I refused the order upon seeing it; but that has nothing to do with the V8, does it?  Amazon shipped a replacement that was fine.<br /><br />Yep, diabetics need to be careful and read labels.  I sympathize.  So should all of us quit drinking orange juice?<br /><br />The question is, what's in these particular cans?  What I found was delicious coconut water, along with the tantalizing  little pieces of coconut that are fun to feel stuck in your teeth.  I like that little bit of food with my beverage.  This coconut water, served cold, is a great, refreshing break.  Plus, my research seemed overwhelmingly in favor of coconut water's nutritional aspects and declared it the coming thing.<br /><br />So, I just ordered another case and I'm highly recommending this, if you like coconut.<br /><br />Oh, no shipping problems and I'm about to order my third case.  I think they're learning how now.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/text: My cat is picky, especially when it comes to dry food.  She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.  I switched my cat from friskies to Hills Scienc Diet when she grew to adulthood.  Then I decided to try one of those natural diets, with no fillers, and only uses real meats and blah blah blah.  One she wouldn't go near, and the other she would eat reluctantly.  Except the super active, petite 7lb 4oz tortie grew to just over ten pounds, waddled when she walked, because she was horribly obese, and slept 24 hours a day, waking up only to eat, and her coat was staritng ot lose it's shine.  That scared the hell out of me!  So I switched back to Hills.  With a week, she was starting to show interest in toys again, and was already starting to lose that swaying flabby fat belly.  Now she's back down to 7lb 7oz, and very active, healthy, and happy.  I will NEVER switch her food again!

review/summary: Expensive, but it worked!
review/text: I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with "meal" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.

review/summary: Great for pukey cat
review/text: My cat was born in August 2001, so he's almost 10 years old. Three years ago he started to throw up quite frequently. The vet ran tons of VERY EXPENSIVE tests and for the most part ruled out anything that can be treated. We tried changing food but nothing worked. I tried giving him home cooked food as well and that made throwing up even worse. So one day I was in a pet store and the clerk said he had the same problem with his cat and suggested the MOST EXPENSIVE FOOD IN STORE. I was skeptical but I had nothing to lose (but money). Three years later my cat is doing fantastic. He only throw up when I feel bad for him and give him tuna as a pity treat. He's healthy, bouncy and seems to enjoy food. The big bag lasts us for ever. We bought a bag on November 5th and today again on March 19. That's 4+ months for $40 (which is how much the bag costs in pet store). I think I can afford $10/month for my buddy. I have no idea what's in there and I don't really care. All I care is that my cat looks happy and healthy. Food purists who believe in feeding cat organic chicken and brown rice might not care for it.

She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: stops fecal balls
review/text: My eight month old kitty, Jitterbug came to us eating Science Diet and everything was fine.  I slowly switched him over to Purina indoor, which I've always fed my cats and had no problems with.  Well I started noticing Jitterbug was leaving small little balls of poo all over the house!  Instead of taking him to the vet and paying a lot of money on tests I thought I'd try this expensive food first and what do you know, no more poop balls!  It's too bad it's so pricey, but if I don't have to deal with feces outside the litter box, I'll pay top dollar.  My cat has been on this formula for a month now and I'm very pleased with the results.

review/summary: Worth the money!
review/text: Our cat was a stray that showed up at a friend's farm.  He was in very bad shape...very skinny, lethargic, and his fur was very wiry!  We got him on the mend with a visit to the vet and some antibiotics.  But it wasn't until we started feeding him Science Diet that we noticed the change in his fur.  It made such a vast difference!  He has the softest fur I have ever felt on a cat!  The Science Diet seems to help with the hairballs, too.  It is a bit expensive, but it's worth every penny to me.

review/summary: Helps my cat's teeth
review/text: I'm not thrilled about the fillers and ground meal stuff in it as a food.  I try to look for better ingredients.  However, my vet said my cats had some tartar and sore gums.  I started mixing this stuff in with their regular food, and now (2 years later) my oldest is 4 with healthy teeth and gums.  I saw improvement in just a month or so.  Now looking at several annual visits in a row with good dental health and no tooth brushing.  Kitties seem to like it.  Healthy weight cats with dry food to graze on all they want.  I order from petfooddirect though.  When you consider the shipping costs, it's usually a little cheaper there unless amazon has it for free shipping.

review/summary: Great product, but trust your vet not the hype
review/text: I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.
