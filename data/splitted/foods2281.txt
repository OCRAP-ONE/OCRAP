review/summary: Broadway rolls a disappointment!
review/text: I was so excited to hear they were bringing this sweet strawberry flavored licorice roll back....only to order two boxes and I could tell the minute I opened wrapper and smelled them, they weren't even close.  What ever happened to the sweet original licorice taste from when I was growing up?? Licorice now tastes waxy and synthetic.....so bummed!

review/text: I bought these from another vendor and spent $22.00 which was a waste of money.  They DO NOT TASTE ANYTHING LIKE THE OLD DELFA ROLLS.  I am 49 years old and ought to know what they tasted like.  Don't waste your money, the product isn't bad just not what I was looking for in a retro candy and craving from my youth.

review/text: As noted, the flavor isn't even close. But I have found a company that is making a red licorice with a hauntingly similar taste. Look up Tubi's Tire Tread Red. The smell alone will bring you right back to the original Delfa. Not the thin ribbon or the flexibility of Delfa/Danish Ribbon. Other than that, very close.<br /><br />Red Licorice, Tire Tread - 7 oz,(Tubi'S Organic Soft Licorice)

review/text: as the other reviews have noted, this is NOT the same flavor (or even coloring - the color is a pinkish color, not the deep red I remember). it's not bad as such, but don't tell me you've brought something back when you've really just recreated the look of the original.  I don't remember Danish licorice in black, and the black licorice from this company is actually pretty good, but these red ones are NOT what you remember.  I'm just glad that i found them at a bulk store so that I only bought one roll and not a whole box like I intended to here.

review/text: I was horribly disappointed when i received these. Wasnt till after the fact i saw there "new and improved flavor" blurb somewhere. WTF . . . . why bother bringing them back if they are completely different? Save your money if you are expecting them to be anywhere near the original Delfa Rolls. I ordered a case and was one of the first to get them when they came out, pretty much gave 'em away and pitched what was left. REPEAT THESE ARE NOTHING LIKE DELFA ROLLS other then shape. I guess what puzzles me the most is why go through all the hype and why change it at all? Isnt it just as easy to make them the same as long as they are going through the effort of marketing them as a re released product?

review/text: I wish I would have listened to the other reviews.  I had to see for myself because I loved the delfa/danish ribbon rolls so much and I liked them a little on the chewy/stale side so I thought it was worth a shot.<br />Seriously, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR $$$$!!!!!<br />These taste NOTHING like the originals.  They taste like cherry cough syrup would taste if it dried up!<br />I even had a friend try them who never had the originals and she took one bite and spit it out. I would not have even given these one star but you have to give at least one to review a product.<br />I sent the entire box back, I was so disappointed, delfa rolls were my favorite and I was so excited to see they came back.  Well turns out they didn't......<br />If you are like me and have to try something for yourself please don't waste your time or money; and if you still want to try them make sure you can get a refund.

review/summary: Texture of the old ones but not the taste.
review/text: I miss Delfa Rolls!  This was the second box I purchased.  I was so excited to see the look of the candy but when I took my first bite I was disappointed.  There is only one thing wrong with this knock-off.  They use too much flavor.  I had the pleasure to open one random package of these candies to find it having a pale color.  I didn't think much of it until I had a taste.  It was just like the old ones.  It must have been one of the last ones on the line when the flavoring had to be replaced.  It was soooooo good.  But 1 out of 24 is not a good ratio.  Wish I could get in touch with someone at the factory and tell them their error but it seems as if they are made in China.  Oh, well. It is a good substitute but not a replacement.

review/text: I have loved these from the beginning when they were delfa rolls and then danish ribbons. I was devastated when they were nolonger available and could not wait to try the "new formula" because they are not the same and they have a more artificial manufactured strawberry flavor. I searched for their return online since I am a fan along with my sister and husband and we adopted the new taste and it grows on you and becomes oddly addicting with the same texture that you love to unroll.

Lingonberry has also been shown to increase red blood cell and liver enzymes needed for antioxidant protection. We need antioxidants to protect vessels and nerve tissue, and also to help decrease the damage from inflammation. Proanthocyanidin extracts from lingonberries were also found to be effective against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which can cause a wide variety of infections.

review/summary: An Outstanding Balanced Strong Cup of Black Tea
review/text: I love a very strong, unsweetened (though I live deep in South Eastern Sweet Tea territory) cup of black tea.<br /><br />I love this tea because you can brew a very strong cup if you like - but without any worries about over-brewing bitterness and such (such as with Typhoo et all) It also doesn't "stack" poorly. I.e. I brew 6-8 bags in my kettle and cut it half to the fridge container (so figure 4 bags per pot) and the extra strength from multiple bags as well as extra time it still comes out very clean strong tea.<br /><br />As in drop the bags into your kettle and in five minutes you're done. Forget and leave them in for 60 minutes? No problem - barely a difference (I'm making iced tea so I don't hover over or immediately pour after normal steep time).<br /><br />All in all - an outstanding cup of black tea. And as strong and you like it. Buy it by the 12 pack as it's somewhat variable in availability.<br /><br />12 pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAZEWA">Lifeboat, Tea, 80-Bag (12 Pack)</a><br />Single pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H7IKPA">Lifeboat Tea (80 Tea Bags)</a>

On top of that, another local store sells the same brand and type for 37% higher cost - and, Amazon sells them in a 6 pack, with the individual cost about 16% more!<br />If you like these, check out a local Kroger owned store for their price.

review/text: ....and buy Camellias when you're making Red Beans and Rice. As a New Orleans expatriate, I can verify that no other brand of bean produces the same results (ie, thick, creamy gravy) when you're trying to cook this dish. Simply sort (very few bad beans or dirt in this product), wash, soak overnight, then throw 'em in a pot with onions, celery, bay leaves, a little minced garlic and water (a pretty good recipe is printed right on the back of the packaging). Add salt, pepper, cayenne and tobasco to taste. If you like a heartier variety, throw in a hamhock, andoille sausage or some diced ham that's been browned in a skillet. Serve over rice. It's the Monday lunch and supper of choice in New Orleans for over a hundred years. The best buck-and-a-half food bargain there is.......

review/summary: The genuine article
review/text: Red beans and rice is such a simple dish.  Everybody in New Orleans eats it on Mondays, from cab drivers and port workers to businesspeople and Tulane kids.<p>New Orleaneans (native or adopted, displaced or otherwise) know that red beans and rice is a very subtle dish.  The beans at Dunbar's, Mother's, and Ye Olde College Inn (all famous for the dish) are all different, and everybody's mother has her own recipe, too.  There are many variables involved in getting it to come out just right, from the choice of meat to the number of bay leaves to add to the pot.  <p>The most important is in choosing beans.  Red beans and rice cooked by displaced New Orleaneans elsewhere doesn't always come out as creamy as people in the city are used to--often they're thick and starchy and the beans need to be put in a blender to get anything resembling the gravy in the authentic dish.  One reason for this is that Americans outside of New Orleans and the Deep South really don't eat beans, red or otherwise, and the beans sit on the shelf and toughen.  The second reason is that the &quot;red kidney bean&quot; popular in New Orleans is not the same thing as the kidney bean used in three-bean salad or Texas chili.  It's smaller, hence it cooks faster, gets creamier faster, and has a more intense color and flavor.<p>Camellia beans are authentic Louisiana red beans--the small variety--and they're probably the most popular in New Orleans.  They enjoy such a good reputation because they're almost invariably fresh and they produce the creamy pot of beans that, more than any other dish, reminds us of New Orleans.

But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/summary: No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts
review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick.

I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/summary: Fab, as long as you understand what's in them!
review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

review/summary: Good enough!
review/text: For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

review/text: I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!

review/text: My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/summary: Big Chocolate Taste
review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/text: While I was in a coma I ate these for desert.  They are very good tasting, don't have any "Sugary muck" taste, just plain, but really filling and don't give me gas.<br /><br />I like them with iced tea or pelican juice.<br /><br />Since there's no Sugar in them you can leave them out in the sun without getting a diabetic seizure.  Ants don't like them for some reason.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: My beagle is 9, we have struggled with dog food for a while and I had settled with Science Diet. One day, I walked into a boutique dog store and they told me I had to try a sample. My dog LOVED it. I figured, it's the same price as the Science Diet was, so why not go for it. I am SO pleased that I did. She now has the softest fluffiest coat.  She has more of a spark in her step and her digestive challenges have eased. I very very rarely hear her stomach "gurgle" the way it used to. Again, Amazing. I hightly recommend.  She LOVES it, cleans her plate now when she never did that before.

review/summary: Good, but not extraordinary
review/text: The chocolate babka arrived in a timely way. We liked it, and I'd say it was a bit dry and crumbly, but it had a good flavor. Altogether, I would say it's "good," but not extraordinary. If it's the only babka in town, though, you might want to consider it. Probably slicing and toasting it would give it a better texture and warming up the chocolate inside so you can revive it a bit. P.S. We decided to order the babka after watching the "Seinfeld" episode on babka for the third time. That babka was probably a million times better, but this one is easy to get.

review/text: These Glory brand beans with potatoes taste wonderful.  I don't usually like green beans much, but the way these are seasoned makes them taste great.  (It's a salty and bacon-y flavor that is hard to describe.)  I especially like to use them as an ingredient in shepherd's pie.  The only problem I have with them here on Amazon is that the Amazon price is roughly 2� times higher than the price in my local grocery store.

review/summary: PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!
review/text: Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.  In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :)<br /><br />I got a great deal through Amazon on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs.  They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of crap food.  People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal.  But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust.<br /><br />Get these treats.  You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually.

review/summary: Dog loves them
review/text: We purchased these for our poodle.  She is the smaller breed (appx. 10 pounds) so I was a little worried these might be too big.  As a whole piece, the treats might be a little large for her, but they can be broken in two very easily.  The bag actually shows you how to break them in two, of course it's pretty self-explanatory as each treat has a cut down the middle of them.  So, the actual size of the treat should not be an issue for those with large or small dogs!  As far as taste--of course I can only rely on how well our dog likes them-she loves them.  Of course she is a little piggy and likes everything, but she really seems to be more fond of these than cheaper treats we have given her.  Overall I am pleased with these treats and I would recommend them if asked!

I actually tried them myself (i try all the treats i buy him before subjecting him to them because i will NOT feed him anything I find disgusting) and they're not too bad - tastes a bit like oatmeal. I do love how you can actually see the pieces of apples and carrots in the treats and I love how the ingredients are certified organic :)<br />btw- the little story on the back of the bag "Newman Dog Tells All!!" is hilarious!!

review/summary: A+ from picky eater
review/text: In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't buy from Amazon - I bought these at PetSmart, but I wanted to do a product review because these treats are worth buying in bulk - they're amazing!<br /><br />These little treats are wonderful.  I am extremely picky about what my dog eats because he's had digestive problems in the past and also because I believe dogs shouldn't be fed the unwanted junk leftover from the corn/grain industry, food that has been irradiated, or food that is made in questionable countries (cough* China * cough cough).<br /><br />Not only are these Newman's Own treats a good price, they are a good size and are indeed made with quality ingredients.  As another reviewer said, you can literally see the oats and such in the baked treats (see the product picture I took).  Plus, they're shaped like little hearts - adorable!  The best things about these treats, however, are that (1) they're made in Canada from a company we all can trust, and (2) my dog absolutely loves them. These treats are made from certified organic ingredients with 7% fat (min).  With all the pet food recalls and my inherent distaste for low quality, Chinese, irradiated, or high fat treats these treats are a winner!<br /><br />Also, my dog is a terribly picky eater when it comes to treats (which is hilarious because he'd eat cat poop if I let him).  He has never eaten any biscuit that was not literally made in a bakery from a boutique.  This has cost me lots of money in the past (in finding treats he likes, and having to deal with the bags and bags of treats he didn't like such as Blue Buffalo, Mother Hubbard's, and Wellness bars).  I bought a 13oz bag of these at PetSmart today for 5.00 (far less than I spent on the other brands), and my dog will not leave me alone.  He literally dances to get my attention because he wants me to give him one of these treats.  It seems like neither of us could be happier with this product.  If I can remember, I will do an update once the bag is gone to see if this trend has continued.<br /><br />Is there anything Newman's Own cant do?

review/summary: Whats happened in Oct 2011  not 2009
review/text: Three years ago we found out our dog Bella had severe food allergies.Fish,potatos,veggies,fruit and a few other selected foods are all she can eat. I look and could only find Newmans Own Salmon&Potato treats for her to eat.Since then they come evey 2mths ,by Sub&save. Today when I opened the first package I was shocked. The normally,heart shaped treats that are light, airy, thick, and easy to break,were nothing but,dark,flat,hard to break rocks. So my question is "What Happened?" Not only was it one package but all six. If this is their new product,they lost a customer.But if it was a bad batch, I say how dare they send this out to consumers,take their money,and think its right.Today there are many treats made that she can eat,but I stuck with Newmans out of loyalty,because they were first in making a great product Bella could eat.And Bella really loves this treats.I hope Newmans can fix this.

Unfortunately, my two dogs (male 9 yrs & female 3 yrs) just are not impressed. I think perhaps if the 'cookies' were a little less dry and / or their excellent quality ingredients were just a little more aromatic that they would be more tempting and desired by my spoiled, but well loved dogs. If I break the cookie in half, it seems to release slightly more tasty aroma and I can almost talk the dogs into them.

My Yorkie loves duck breast jerky, but those treats are made in China, and I'm not sure I trust products from there 100% after the poisonous ingredients that were found in China-made dog food in the recent past.  Of course, I didn't expect my dog to enjoy these treats as much as the meaty duck, but he reacts the same way to these cheesey treats as the duck breast!  When I have one of these treats ready for him, his responses to commands (sit, lie down, etc.) are instantaneous - he really wants the treat!  I was concered buying 6 packs at once without first testing them, but now I'm glad I have 6 for him.  GREAT PURCHASE, and I'll be buying other Newman dog products in the future

review/summary: perfect food for my old dog :)
review/text: Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets. After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight. Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years. After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat. That may be age related as well. But the stomach upsets have stopped. And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula.

review/summary: Natural Treats; a product I trust
review/text: It isn't easy to find packaged food for pets that I can trust.  I have been doing a lot of reading lately about what actually goes into most commercial brand pet foods, and I am appalled.  I decided to start cooking for my brood, but the puppy was going bonkers for bicuits, which was kind of freaking me out.  I never thought I'd find something on the store shelves that satisfied us both...and then, in a WalMart in Honesdale PA (where my family owns a vacation home) I saw these.  I trust Newman's Own, so I read the ingredients.  I was happy, and my dog loves them, but I couldn't seem to find them back home in NJ, so I searched Amazon, and here they were.  I am slated to get a case every other month, but I might need to up that to once a month!

review/summary: A perfect treat!
review/text: We were given a partial bag of these treats by a friend who no longer needed them. Our Boston Terrier loved them! Upon researching the product, and finding them to be a good product as well as a good bargain, we purchased 2 cases of them... not for our dog specifically, but to give them to our local Bank so they could give treats to the dogs in cars that came through the drive up window. (Our dog loves to get treats at the bank)... We have gotten great responses from our friends at the bank.<br />We appreciate giving treats that can be dependable and healthy for our pet family. Thank you!
