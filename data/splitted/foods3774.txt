review/summary: Not a Stage 3 but Well Balanced and Good
review/text: Most Stage 3 meals are thicker in texture and a bit chunky as baby transitions to eating more solid foods. Our baby is now 9 months and starting to gum up his own food. We puree most of his food at home, but as that is hard to do with beef, we looked for a packaged beef meal that we could rotate in. The first time I fed my son this meal, I bought just the pouch with me to the mall and was surprised at how soupy it was. It is very runny and a bit tricky to feed baby with a spoon.<br /><br />I do love the ingredients though--tomatoes, carrots and peas along with the beef. We still use this meal but I usually thicken it with some pureed peas at home. When I need to use it as a take-along, I bring along a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QZBEFK">OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2-Ounce, Set 6, Clear</a> container with a bit of rice cereal. When it's meal time, I open the package and mix it into the container with the cereal. That seems to thicken it well enough that more goes into his mouth than all over his face. Hope this helps. :)

review/text: My 13mth old loves all Plum training meals and we love the convenience of the packs but this one is definately NOT a take-along, it is way too runny.  We tried and what a mess!  Baby loves it though so we just give it to him at home.  I would like for Plum to make a heartier version for tots.

review/text: I have always purchased Eden Kukicha in tea bag form. I purchased the Loose Tea and was pleasantly surprised at the difference between the two forms of this tea. The loose tea is has a much stronger and fresh taste as compared to the teabag form. It does take a bit more time to prepare however the time spent is well worth it for the end result. I purchased the Loose Tea through Subscribe and save and the case arrived in great condition and on time. The resealable Eden Kukicha loose tea packages are great for storing your tea without worrying about extra storage containers. Overall this was a great purchase and I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good cup of Kukicha twig tea.

review/text: After searching far and wide for real Hungarian paprika, I finally found Frontier Paprika. The product arrived in two 16-oz foil bags. They are a little inconvenient, but if you have a spice container or something of the sort, the paprika can be poured there for easier use. The flavor is sweet and pleasant. And it imparts a lovely red color to food. I love cooking with it. I cook a lot of Hungarian food and paprika is a must!

review/text: My daughter is 6 weeks old and we have had her on formula since day 3. She was very fussy when we tried Enfamil and Similac. We talked to my parents and they suggested using a soy formula since I had milk allergies as a baby. We tried the Enfamil soy and she was still really fussy. So, we decided to try Isomil Advance. She has been using it since and she is much less fussy. She is sleeping much more soundly now too! It is wonderful and even though it IS more expensive, it is totally worth it to be able to get a good night's sleep!

review/summary: Perfumy disappointment
review/text: ***<br /><br />Tazo's Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium tea that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot"; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon". Tazo describes the aroma as "citrus, lavender, light smoke".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />***

review/summary: Tasty, sprightly and delicious!
review/text: Earl Grey is supposedly the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smokey flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men. Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.<br /><br />Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blend of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are as the box states "the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India." They provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend. The fragrance is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. A tasty sensual delight!<br />Earl Grey is traditionally served black, sometimes with lemon. I prefer it with cream. On a warning note, if you keep this tea in the cupboard for too long it will get old--the taste becomes very thin and harsh. Brew it from fresh teabags and you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Amazing everyday cuppa joe
review/text: I'm sorry to say I passed up this New York-style ground coffee in the grocery aisle time and again, mistaking it for all those other cans that wreak havoc on your stomach. But when the price of Folger's started skyrocketing, my boyfriend caved and tried out a can of Chock Full O' Nuts.<br /><br />Who knew it'd become an addiction? Since he and I both prefer our brew on the strong side, it works pretty well using three level scoops plus one somewhat-heaping scoop to four carafe cups of water. The ratio seems to work well in both our brands of automatic coffee makers, whether we use a paper or gold cone filter. You might want to try it daily for about a week, tweaking the ratio, before making up your mind.<br /><br />It's a good deal if you can find it on sale, although it's still more than brands like Maxwell House.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee snob, but in my book, this beats Starbucks, Caribou Coffee, Folger's, Dunkin' Donuts, even Tim Horton's--at least for an everyday coffee. We both buy the classic, which seems to have a rich, deep sort of taste that's so good to wake up to.<br /><br />Here in Michigan we've been able to buy it in the Meijer grocery chain and occasionally at Rite Aid pharmacy. Unfortunately it's getting harder to find--my guess is that people confuse the retro-looking can (which I personally like) with other cheapie coffees. It may not be gourmet but this brand o' caffeine has become my habit o' choice.

review/text: Oh - I have been using this coffee for 16 years now, and I always use four (4) heaping scoops. Yes, I have a cheap Mister Coffee coffee-maker - but it works. I'm not about pretense, but value and tatste. The best thing about Chock Full o' Nuts is that you get a strong flavor WITHOUT bitterness (something the Folger's and Maxwell's will never achieve). I stumbled upon this value priced coffee at a private dining club I worked for when I was just a pup. The flavor is exquisite and the price is modest. I'm lucky to be able to purchase this at a local discount store in town for around $6 a can.

review/text: BETTER COFFEE THAN OUT OF A VENDING MACHINE<br /><br />It is supposed to be "better coffee than a millionaire's money can buy" according to the jingle I heard countless times on radio and TV in the 1960s. Well, let's not get carried away.<br /><br />This coffee is reputed to have been used daily in Manhattan for decades, since 1932, at the "Chock Full O'Nuts" coffee shops that peppered Midtown for nearly half a century until 30 years ago. We can, of course, still purchase it at our local grocery. It does have a strong but somewhat mellow taste for mainstream pre-ground coffee. If I can't find Yuban locally, I will settle for the 'Columbian Chock Full O'Nuts' before this one.<br /><br />This is a good product [better than most] and a good value, but Yuban seems more full bodied and much more mellow than this or even their 'Columbian' offering.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

This coffee in NO WAY is "chock full" of nuts.  I was hoping to find some kind of nut, but no.  No peantus, no cashews, no almonds, no pistachios, no chestnuts, no nothing.  Rather, it's plain, regular coffee.  And bad coffee at that.  Do yourself a favor, and don't get this coffee, with your hopes up, as I did.  It will only lead to disappointment.

review/text: The comments by the individual that compared this to the nutrition and flavor of popcorn motivated me to leave a review. Although I would guess that the nutrition in this cereal isn't that much superior to popcorn, that reviewer's comments were foolish and unhelpful... I'm not submitting this as a direct comment to his review, because my remaining remarks stand alone as a separate review: This cereal is a good choice for those that love having cold cereal, but want to cut down on the calories and carbs generally associated with most cereals. The size of the grains is nice and the number of grains gives variety. This cereal is not a good choice if you need a sweet or intensely flavorful cereal or if you're looking for lots of dietary fiber or fortified vitamins/minerals. I don't need a cereal that's sooped up in nutrition because I get my dietary fiber and vitamins and minerals from organic produce and other sources. I can have a bowl of this with skim milk or soy, a few strawberries and stevia for flavor and I feel like I've indulged at only around 200-220 calories.

It fills me up and I feel good when I eat it. My grocery store ran out and I bought some puffed wheat...blech! I ate it but it got soggy, didn't have much flavor and just wasn't my Kashi! I hope this never gets discontinued because I seriously wouldn't know what to replace it with and it's a huge staple in my diet!!

review/text: This is the only Kashi product I like. It is low calorie (100), fun to eat, doesn't get soggy fast ( I like crunchy cereal, won't eat soggy )and a good out of the box snack if you're desperate. Tastes good if you like puffed cereal. Works well with my eating plan.

review/text: I lost 20 lbs. eating this as a part of WeightWatchers plan. A bit of Splenda, fruit, milk, it makes a great filling breakfast. I spend alot of time reading labels and this is one of the only cereals at HEB without a bunch of sugar. I am going to keep it in my cupboard at all times. HEB quit carrying it and instead have the Honey Kashi. So I ordered a case from Amazon! A lot cheaper and less hassle. It arrived quickly.

review/summary: Reduced box size
review/text: OPEN LETTER TO KASHI and AMAZON:<br /><br />I have been eating nothing except this cereal for years and years. In fact I used to get a package of six boxes every month through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program. Unfortunately its no longer offered through there and i buy it elsewhere.<br /><br />All that aside, did you really think you could shrink the 7.5oz box down to 6.5oz,  otherwise leaving it identical and pass it off as the same for the same price?<br /><br />I can appreciate that costs go up, but was it really necessary to do it in this manner?. The number of boxes i purchased was based on how quickly i go through a box.. and heres a newsflash.. 1oz is not an insignificant amount in a 7.5 oz box.<br /><br />Why couldn't you just put up the price on the 7.5oz box or make known the intended change, thereby allowing customers to alter quantities ordered as needed. Did you think we wouldn't notice?<br />Sorry Kashi, but the manner in which this  (perhaps to some) insignificant change was handled, speaks volumes to me about your company. In fact it makes me wonder how much of your earth friendly grass roots message, is just clever marketing.<br /><br />Very disappointing.

review/text: The size of the box has changed and so has the amount of the cereal.  It use to contain 7.5 oz, but now contains only 6.5 oz for the same money at our local Fry's.  I used to get this direct from Amazon at a subscribe and save item, but they no longer carry it. The third party merchants are charging $7 and up per box. I am able to get this cereal at our local Target and a great price.  They had it on sale and I purchased 6 boxes.  I think this is a healthy and good tasting cereal for those that don't want or can't have lots of sugar.  I mix it with Trader Joe's O'S.  The 5 stars is for the cereal, not for the price or packaging.

I just noticed, however, that the newer box of Kashi Whole Grain Puffs sitting on my shelf is dramatically thinner than the box from my last shipment.  Turns out that the old box contained 7.5 ounces and the new one has only 6.5 ounces. The "price reduction" actually is due to a smaller quantity of produce per box.

My nighttime sweet treat is hot air popcorn<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IUWA">Presto 114316 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV2KQ">Eden Organic Yellow Popcorn, 20-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> mixed with sugar free pudding.I was getting tired of this every night and was hoping to find another treat to add to my snack list. I decided to look at cereals and found this. I now mix 2 cups of the cereal with 1 container of sugar free pudding and LOVE IT!! I get the sweet crunch and it takes awhile to eat it. Check out the nutrition label...Whole grains, no sugar, no salt,only 70 calories per cup and no added junk. I'm so heppy with my new treat and thrilled to find it at a better price on Amazon.

review/summary: Amazon saved my Breakfast!
review/text: Been eating Kashi Grain Puffs daily for YEARS! It's Whole Grain, tasty, though a little on the bland side, virtually fat-free, salt-free, and sugarless. My diabetic sister-in-law told me about it.<br /><br />It's one of two cereals in my multi-part healthy breakfast cereal concoction, the other is "Maple nut granola" from the bins at Whole Foods(WFs). The other ingredients, especially the granola and the cranberry relish, make it VERY TASTY!  Other ingredients listed below, if you're interested.*<br /><br />Anyway, for some reason, Whole Foods Corporate decided not to carry this particular Kashi product anymore. I've always thought of it as Kashi's flagship product, and it certainly sold well in the WFs we frequent. So, I did what I always do when I need/want something, check Amazon. And voila, there it was, and a little cheaper, too. And that is how Amazon saved my breakfast!<br /><br />* Other ingredients in my breakfast bowl: ground flax and sesame seeds, wheat germ, chopped walnuts, homemade cranberry-orange-walnut relish, other fruit in season, Keifir, boxed soy and almond milks, and occasionally almond extract for a special treat.

review/summary: Favorite Puffed Cereal
review/text: This has been my favorite puffed cereal ever since I found it quite a few years ago.  It tastes much better than the usual puffed rice or puffed wheat.<br /><br />However, it disappeared from my local supermarkets a while back.  Now, all the Kashi producets being carried have flavors and sweeteners added.  I do not like the taste of sweetened cold cereal with milk.<br /><br />Not sure what some of the other reviewers are complaining about - if you do not like the taste of puffed cereals, why complain when one tastes like a puffed cereal?  Even then, this has much more taste than most.<br /><br />Also, maybe it does not have the artificial addition of extra vitamins or minerals, but it does have the ones naturally found in the whole grains.  And who wants to get all their daily vitamins from one bowl of cereal - unless they prefer to eat junk food for the rest of the day!

I add thawed frozen fruit like cherries or raspberries, or sometime I buy the freeze-dried fruits and put those on. A little fat-free milk and some stevia powder and I have a complete, healthful meal that is filling, satisfying and extremely good for me. I hope Kashi continues to make this terrific product. This is making me hungry. I am going to go have a bowl right now . . .

review/text: I was looking for a low sugar cereal, and these are definitely that, but they do lack much flavor - I throw in blueberries or bananas, but they just don't seem to feel substantial in my stomach.  They're essentially much like puffed rice, and taste alright, but just not much flavor, like I said.  I ordered in the large quantity, and was glad when they were finally gone.  But, to find a replacement low sugar product that is better tasting, will be a challenge.

review/summary: Wellness puppy food
review/text: My boston terrier/english bulldog puppy's coat became shiny on this food, his breath smelled good, his gas wasn't stinky, and the food appears to have excellent ingredients.  However, after over a month of eating Wellness, his stool never became firm (which it was on whatever cheap food he was eating at the breeders). It alternated between runny and mushy. I'd read similar reviews on various websites, but decided to try it anyway (everyone's experiences are different). Although I have no way of knowing this, I wonder if some of the fancier dogfoods overdo it with the flax and greentea---it would certainly give me the runs.  Anyway, I think it's a good food and may work well for some dogs, but we've had to transition off of it to Merrick puppy plate, which, although it has similar ingredients, seems to be firming up the poop.

review/summary: 1 Month Review
review/text: Back Story: I adopted a border collie from the pound and kept her on the same dog food she was getting there, which was IAMS Puppy. She had terribly smelly and often very loose stool, including occasional diarrhea which made both of us miserable. She started wanting to go outside to eat grass, so I knew something was wrong in her tummy.<br /><br />I decided to switch dog foods and started doing some research. Looking over ingredients, figuring out the price per day of food for different brands, etc...<br /><br />I found that as far as ingredients, the food appears to be very high quality. More meat, less filler, more quality ingredients. As far as pricing, this food came out to about $1.02 per day, whereas IAMS was only about $0.50 per day. Definitely a big price difference, but hopefully it will prove worth it for my puppy's health. I also looked at Innova puppy which looked comparable and came out to about $0.96 per day.<br /><br />1 DAY: I brought the bag home and even before opening it she showed marked interest in it's contents. I opened up the bag and she started chewing on the cut away strip of bag; it was obvious she loved the taste.<br /><br />**Big point in this 30 pound bag's favor, it is resealable.<br /><br />I mixed a handful into her IAMS and she was much more eager to dig in. For now, this looks promising, though costly. Resealable bag, quality ingredients, puppy likes the taste, twice the cost of IAMS.<br />Based on day 1: 3/5 stars.<br /><br />1 WEEK: She has now worked her way to all Wellness; she hasn't had any diarrhea and her stool and smell seem to have improved. The resealable bag still seals. Based on the apparent improvement in her bowel functions I would rate wellness 4/5 stars.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be even more improvement after she has been on Wellness for a month and away from whatever was making her ill in Iams. I am guessing it may have been a food allergy.<br /><br />1 MONTH: Diarrhea recurred several times, so it didn't turn out to be a miracle cure food. Bag still reseals. Stool/gas smells worlds better than before.<br /><br />What it boils down to is:<br /><br />+Higher Quality Ingredients than most brands<br />+Resealable Bag<br />+Significant Reduction in smell of stool/gas from Iams<br />-Twice the cost of Iams<br /><br />Final Rating<br />4/5<br /><br />Update: I've worked my way through the bag now and I also narrowed down what was causing her loose stool/diarrhea after a particularly bad day. She would refuse to drink water until I offered her my bottled water; she is now on purified water and wellness dog food and her stool has firmed up, not a single day of irregularity since.<br /><br />Oh, and the resealable seal still seals; down to the last kibble.

review/summary: My dog loves Wellness!
review/text: My 5-month-old puppy had lost interest in his Iams Puppy food, so I was on the lookout for a tastier brand of dry puppy food.  I read the reviews of Wellness on Amazon and said, why not, let's try it.  Now we are hooked--Dexter LOVES his Wellness!  He gobbles it all up in one sitting (he used to eat a kibble here and a kibble there with the Iams).  He seems happy and healthy and looks great too (shiny coat!).  He doesn't have any specific health problems (I saw in the reviews that some dog owners tried Wellness to treat allergies and such) but I am hoping Wellness will keep him on the up-and-up.

review/text: I spent a lot of time researching premium puppy foods and settled on Wellness. I wanted a food that didn't contain corn or wheat and other non specific meat products. My 14 week old puppy had no trouble switching to Wellness, in fact she is no longer picking around her dry food like she was on the previous brand I bought. She hasn't been on it long enough for me to have noticed a change in condition or coat, but i'm confident it will. My only complaint is that the so called 're-sealable' bag doesn't actually reseal.

review/summary: Could not get firm stool with Wellness Just for Puppy
review/text: I had my Airedale Terrier puppy on Wellness Super Mix Just for Puppy from about 10 weeks to 14 weeks. During this time I had loose stools to no stools (i.e. the squirts). It was very frustrating. The ingredient list looks great and I was looking forward to feeding this kibble but it did not work out for my puppy. I switched her to my adult dog's kibble out of frustration and suddenly perfect poops. My adult eats Wellness Core orginal. I asked my vet if it would be ok to continue feeding the adult food to the 14 week puppy and she said it was fine.<br /><br />My recommendation is to buy a small bag of Wellness Just for Puppy at first and if you don't get good stools then switch to something else immediately - don't wait around like I did. Not every food is going to work for every dog.

review/summary: Dog doesn't like it.
review/text: This was the first food I fed my puppy. She's always been skinny and we can leave food out for her to nibble on all day. That is until we switched to a different dog food (Wellness core). As soon she tried her new food she ate the whole bowl! It's only her third day eating the new stuff and she's already visibly gained weight. It's kinda sad to realize that she's just been forcing herself to eat this food.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars because there's nothing wrong with the ingredients that I know of, but make sure your dog is willing to eat this bland food.

review/summary: Good healthy puppy food
review/text: We bought this for our mini schnauzer. She was on a cheaper brand when we got her and was going to the bathroom about 3 times a day. When we switched her to this it cut that back to about once a day. It is much healthier and has less filler product. She seems to like the taste. It also fits well in a kong, so we put that in there with a little peanut butter and she goes nuts for it.

review/summary: My puppy loves it, good for your dog
review/text: Got my 1st puppy 4 weeks ago and wanted to give him the best that I can. After thorough research, many people recommended Wellness. I purchased it at Petco and my puppy loves it. He's pretty food motivated so I do not know whether he will discriminate against any kind of food. It does leave my baby with stinky breath but nothing a breath freshner dental chew can't solve. I will feed my puppy Wellness for the rest of his life, if he continues to like it, which I hope he does.

review/summary: My Puppy likes Purina Better
review/text: My Puppy was on Royal Canin but we switched her to Wellness Pupy b/c I eventually wanted her on Wellness Core but she doesn't seem to like it.  I have to mix the can with it in order for her to eat it.  She was with a dog sitter for a week while we were out of the country and she came back with her food container full.  She seemed more solid, like she'd gained a lot more weight in just a week.  Apparently she ate their dog food and wouldn't touch her more expensive food.  Now that she's home, she's gone back to barely eating it.  I'll try another brand after we finish this bag.  I'm sure the nutrition in it is great  but if I can't get my dog to eat it, what good is it?

review/summary: My Frenchie Loves This Food!
review/text: I've been feeding my French Bulldog puppy Wellness Super5Mix Just for Puppy since I brought my him home with terrific results.<br /><br />Wellness passed the puppy taste test with flying colors and my pup loves dinner time! He happily scarfs-down his entire meal during feedings. The individual pieces are small enough that even at 12 weeks he as able to safely and easily eat this food.<br /><br />Wellness claims that their food is "fit for human consumption" and while I'm not keen on testing that claim the ingredient list is impressive. Real pieces of meat - not byproduct as in cheaper foods. No fillers like corn and wheat which can cause allergies are present at all. Also, Wellness doesn't use any dyes in their puppy food. The food is a nice consistent brown color.<br /><br />My puppy has a nice healthy coat, isn't itchy and best of all he has plenty of energy.<br /><br />Wellness is a bit more expensive, but in my experience it's worth every penny to keep my pup happy & healthy.

review/text: I liked that the ingredients list was full of healthy things and had no corn or fillers. My puppy liked the taste. However, I'm rating this a 2 because while on Wellness, he had the runs. His poop was always super wet and mushy and sometimes it would be all liquid. I've tried the Eukanuba Natural Wild Salmon puppy food and he likes that, it's also healthy without corn or fillers, and his poop is firm and normal.

The past two weeks, hoewever have been tough.  After ruling out a possible infection, I determined that the this product was causing diarrhea to my dog.  When reading the nutirent information, this kibble is very rich in protein and fat.  I think my dog is stating to change and the food is no longer agreeing with him.

review/summary: Works for my pup!
review/text: I have a Boston Terrier who has been on this product for quite some time. I tried a bunch of different foods before this, but they all had various problems--and she had a very sensitive stomach. This food works wonderfully for her and I've had no problems with loose stools.<br /><br />One thing to be sure of, if you're transitioning to this food, is to not do it suddenly--that may cause problems with the dog (including diarrhea). My vet advises slowly transitioning over to a new food, blending it in the old, and taking 1-2 weeks before the new food fully replaces the old. Completely changing the food can have a bad effect on some dogs with sensitive stomachs.

review/summary: Pug Puppy and Cat Hate Wellness
review/text: I recently purchased this puppy food at my local feed store. I usually buy another brand called Nature's Recipe: Chicken, Sweet Potato and Pumpkin which is grain free and my pug puppy seems to really like it. However, noone sells it locally and I have to drive an hour away to the bigger city to get it. After running out of my puppy's fave food and not wanting to make a long drive, I settled on this puppy food by Wellness. As soon as I poured it in her bowl, she took one sniff, backed away and then looked up at me with her funny little pug expressive face. To be honest, even though it is dry food, the appearance was very unappealing. I thought I'd give it a day because after all Wellness is not only a very expensive food, but is a highly rated brand. For that one day, her bowl remained untouched and my little puggie was constantly begging for our food during our meal times. Needless to say, I made the one hour drive to replenish her favorite food.<br /><br />I had the exact same experience with my cat as well. I ordered a huge bag of highly rated Wellness cat food some time ago and after reading all those reviews about how other people's cats just go crazy about the stuff I thought for sure my cat would like it. One day my cat walked to her bowl, looked up at me, back down at her food and hissed at it. I got the message. She hated Wellness. I'll never buy it again.

review/summary: Good Quality Food at a Reasonable Price
review/text: My puppies were on Nutri Source which is also a nice food but I wanted something I could get more easily. The first pup I transitioned over to Iams but he tired of it quickly. The positive reviews on Wellness prompted me to try it and I'm very glad I did. He gobbled it down, first bowl. The second pup had a bout of diarrhea, even with me mixing the old and new food together to get her used to it. I'm not sure if the food was the cause as my other dog also had the runs at the same time, but they're doing well now and enjoying their Wellness diet. I love that Amazon has this on prime delivery. I've also switched my cat over to Wellness but he never tells me anything so I'll assume it's acceptable for him.  :)

review/text: Previously, I fed my collie puppy with Purina Pro Plan, but after suggestions from friends who also own dogs, I decided to try out Wellness. The most distinct difference is that this food doesn't smell, the texture and the size is more suitable for a puppy to thoroughly chew before swallowing, and my dog likes it better than Purina. Also, the puppy's feces no longer smell and it makes much less of a chore to clean up her mess. It's been 2 months since the change, and my puppy is doing very well.

review/summary: Will Not Feed My Puppy Anything Else
review/text: After adopting our lab/boxer mix, Nero, we quickly found out that he was very particular about what he ate.  We tried everything, but still he wouldn't eat.  We went for a couple of weeks like this.  We started worrying and even took him to the shelter/vet and asked what we should do.  They only said, "don't worry, he will ear eventually."  We tried everything from Eukanuba, to Science diet, you name it we probably tried it.  We ended up with a cupboard full of bags that had less than a cup of food taken out of each.  He eventually started eating a little, I guess just enough to have something in his stomach, but not nearly the amount he should be eating.  It was pretty stressfull, as this was our first time actually owning a dog.  It got to the point where we'd walk him, and people would comment about how skinny he was.  Sad, I know.<br /><br />Finally someone recommended we try Wellness.  Now, I will say that we were a little hesitant at first, because it was a bit on the pricey side.  And we really didn't know that much about pet food.  We figured, you know, he's a dog, so long as he's not eating table scraps, it shouldn't matter that much (read: we were very ignorant).  Boy were we wrong, and since then, we've come a long way.  After checking out the Wellness site and really doing some research, we decided that it was worth it.  So we bought a little bag to, you know, try it out.  Just in case Nero didn't like it.  To our surprise, he loved the stuff!  Scarfed it down like I've never seen him do before.  My boyfriend and I both stood there silently while we watched him eat a whole bowl of food for the first time.<br /><br />Needless to say, after that we went online and bought a whole 30-pound bag.  I love that my dog loves this stuff, and I love that it's also good for him.  I mean, this stuff is human-grade.  HUMAN GRADE!<br /><br />People are also always commenting on how good our dog looks, how shiny his coat is.  It's definitely noticeable that he's eating well.  We saw his sibling who, sadly, is still in the shelter, and you can tell the difference between the two dogs, just by looking at their coat, and I know it's because of Wellness.<br /><br />And because of that, I will NEVER feed my dog anything else. Ever!

review/text: I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands. After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made. My little bully's stool was never firm. It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day. I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy. The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life. Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food. I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case. I started the "at home remedy" of pepto bismol and a bland diet. The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well. BJ fasted for 24 hours. After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!! This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!

I was impressed by the "7 rows of stitching" and "4 layers of material" and thought it would be worth a try. My 60 lb. border collie mix was through all of it in less than 5 minutes and pulling the stuffing out. The toy I got at the dollar store lasted longer. If you are looking for a durable toy, I suggest looking elsewhere.

review/text: This bone was reviewed as the "best dog toy available" by Tufts Vet School newsletter. My dog had absolutely no interest in it although she is interested in just about everything else. This just points out that the best way to pick a dog toy is to take your dog to a store and let your dog pick out the toy!

review/summary: Not at all Tuff
review/text: We bought this toy for our little labradoodle.  Within an hour he had torn the cover to shreds, the stuffing was all over the floor and the thing was absolutely destroyed.  :-(

review/summary: best dog toy we've found
review/text: Bought one of these 3 years ago for our 2 dogs, one a Labrador and the other a 40 lb mutt.  It was intact until a few months ago when they finally tore it and killed the last squeaker.  Out of the hundreds of toys we have bought them we have found nothing that remotely compares to the durability of it, except for the hard  solid rubber toys and the dogs don't seem as interested in those. We've look in a variety of stores for a replacement and have had no luck.  I'm buying 2.

review/summary: Disappointing...
review/text: The toy is well constructed; however, only one squeaker ever worked, and it has now faded to inaudible in 3 weeks, which has greatly reduced my dog's interest.

review/summary: Baby loves it!
review/text: My 6mo old really enjoys this. I notice the cereal after it's been mixed with breastmilk for about 5mins or so. Nice to know that it'll be quickly digested in baby's belly and that they won't have a problem swallowing it!

review/summary: Great product, horrible price!
review/text: After five months of exclusively nursing, this was the first food that I bought for my baby. I usually trust Amazon to offer a good price, and I hadn't done any comparison shopping for this rice cereal. Bad idea!  I paid more than $12 here for my first box, and just today purchased a box at the grocery store for $3.19 -- and that was NOT on sale, just regular price. I think the seller is taking advantage of the fact that many moms will be buying this as their first food for baby, and aren't aware of how these things are priced. It's a disgrace--buy this product, but buy it elsewhere!

review/text: FYI read the ingredient list on the product. It contains quite a few ingredients, including soy. Earth's Best is a better choice.

review/summary: Considered harmful by veterinarian
review/text: I noticed the jagged edges on this bone after my dog, a chow-huskie mix, had chewed on it for about 1 hour.  I brought the bone into my veterinarian, who said, "I wouldn't feed this to my OWN dogs!"<br /><br />End of story.

review/summary: Jakemans, what a relief!
review/text: I bought these b/c I felt a sinus infection creeping up on me...spring allergies are wreaking havoc once again. I love drinking anise tea so I saw these "Jakemans Throat and Chest" lozenges, anise flavored, and wanted to give them a try. They are deliciously smooth and have helped soothe my sore throat and another great side effect, they have really helped clear my sinus passages too. Great little lozenges, I will keep these in my medicine cabinet for sure.

review/text: I have used a different brand if vidalia onion dressing for years. Everyone in my family was dissapointed when I was unable to purchase the dressing from my usual store.  I found this brand on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It is excellent and tastes equally as good as the brand I had used before.  I am very satisfied and intend to order more!
