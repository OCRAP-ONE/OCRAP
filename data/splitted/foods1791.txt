review/summary: What a Great Product!
review/text: When my vet prescribed Prednisone for my cat's allergies, she gave me a few Chicken flavor Pill Pockets to try on my once-feral cat.  She suggested the treats be hidden in the cat's canned food. I was skeptical, having suffered through decades of cats spitting pills out, trying to bite me while I held them down, finding and eating around pills hidden in food, and foaming at the mouth while being pilled.  Pill poppers helped a lot, but they traumatized the poor kitty.<br />After two days of "tough love" hold-the-cat-down-and-force-the-pill-in, she was becoming afraid of me.  So I tried the Pill Pocket sample, figuring it couldn't hurt.  I hid it in her canned food breakfast bowl, and she inhaled every bite of food.  Pill and pocket gone!  She has taken all her pills since I began using the Pill Pockets, and her allergies are 90% better.<br />As the Predisone pills are very small, I am able to cover them comletely with the Pill Pocket.  And I think it helps a lot to put the pill/treat in wet food.

review/summary: Great product, works like a charm!
review/text: These treats are a great little invention! Our very energetic 1 year old kitty named Harley Quinn was absolutely not allowing us to give her liquid medicine, and forget pills! We did some research and came across these pill pockets, and boy do they do the trick! She actually comes and waits expectantly for her little pill treat twice a day. I never thought I'd see the day a cat would want medicine!<br /><br />I love this product and whole-heartedly recommend!<br /><br />NOTE: I use needle-nosed pliers to insert the pill into the pill pocket, then seal it nice and tight. I never let the pill touch my hands nor the outside of the treat, so no pill scent is left behind.

review/text: Our 15 year old cat has to take thyroid medication twice a day.  The thought of having to give a cat pills was frustrating, but then we ran across these wonderful treats.  95% of the time he gobbles it down without a problem, which is a pretty high success rate when you are talking about a cat.  He likes the salmon flavor too.

review/summary: Worth their weight in gold
review/text: Imagine my horror on learning that each of two my cats would need a tablet every day for 21 days! Luckily, our vet suggested these pill pockets. I was skeptical, but the darn things work.<br /><br />The pockets come in a bag very similar to their regular cat treats, and apparently the flavor is appealing too. Both cats beg for them and gobble them up, totally unaware they just ate medicine. It's only day three, so I hope I'm not jinxing myself, but that's six times so far that we haven't had to force a cat to swallow medicine--well worth the cost already. My hands, arms and nerves are grateful!<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD: The 21-day regimen is over and neither cat balked ONCE at eating their "special treats." I am SO GLAD we bought them! I will buy these again any time I have to give a pill to a cat.

review/summary: These things miraculous!
review/text: This relatively simple innovation has absolutely saved the tender relationship I have with my cat.  As she was recently diagnosed asthmatic, I am now forced to administer up to 2 prednisone pills to my incredibly finicky, active and resistant 7yo Bombay mix.  Before I found these I was struggling with the "pill popper"; even when that gadget successfully hit the target, I was forced to watch her foam vehemently at the mouth when the easily-dissolved and extremely bitter pill it launched hit any part of her tongue or back of her mouth, forcing her to choke - not to mention battling the scratches from the pour soul who thought her mom was poisoning her with this awful medicine.  Amazingly she liked both flavors of these pockets, and now gobbles them down - pills safely tucked inside - without so much as a shake of her head.  I'm forever grateful to Greenies for coming up with this great product - they have saved me years more of struggles with a cat forced to take daily pills!

review/summary: Cat loves them!
review/text: Our cat is currently on medication twice a day.  In the past we had tried giving her pills manually but it was a two person job and very unpleasant for us and for the cat.  Our vet recommended this produt and using the pill pockets has made medicating her a breeze!  She comes running when she hears us getting out the package and gobbles the pill pocket and pill right up!  For her they just seem to be delicious cat treats.  One caution, a few times we have handled the pill pockets too much (once I tried rolling it in a ball) and it seems to make it too compact/sticky.  Those times she had a hard time chewing the pill pocket, it seemed to stick in her month (sort of like peanut butter can stick in a human mouth).  She did eventually get it eaten.  If we put in the pill and pinch it closed (as the instructions say), she can eat them very easily.  We don't know what we would do without these and buying them through Amazon is cheaper than through the vet.

review/summary: Easiest Way to Give Cat a Pill
review/text: This product was recommended to me by my cat's veterinarian.  The product really works with my cat.  It's not obvious when you order, but there are two sizes of pill pockets, and this is the smaller size (size of the pocket, not just quantity).  It works for what I need to give my cat, but may not work for some pills, so I advise buyers to pay attention to this.

review/summary: one of the best things ever!
review/text: At the vet's office, I saw these on the shelf when I picked up medication for my cat.  I wasn't sure, but on a whim decided to get them and am so happy I did.  My cat loves the treat, sniffs the air when the bag is opened and gobbles it all up.  The vet said that if the cat gets sneaky and can separate out the pill, you should crush up the pill and pour into the pocket.  I only wish these were invented years earlier, I can't even fathom all the scratches and hisses I would have avoided from previous cats.<br />Also, how great for a cat sitter or someone less interested (err, willing) to stick their hands in an angry cats jaws!<br />A fantastic fantastic product that anyone with a cat who needs meds should have!

review/text: I have a bengal striped cat who especially loves greenies. Recently, he got sinus trouble, so I got the Sinu-rite here at Amazon.  I needed something to get that free shipping, so I got the pill pockets.<br /><br />The pill pockets were made perfectly for those little pills: Just slip it in, mash the little doughy thing shut, and Barney Bengal swallows it up like he's never eaten in weeks. (That's how I first found him; he hadn't eaten in weeks.)<br /><br />They might be expensive, but they sure make giving pills to cats hassle free.

review/text: Our puppy (80lbs) is epileptic. He can pick his pill out of anything we try to hide it in - canned food, cheese, even tuna. Then to make it worse, his 2 siblings would try to quickly gobble up the heavy dose of phenobarbital that he spit out. These wonderful little things has made the 2x day doses something that is happy for everyone, rather than stressful for the household.  The cat pill pockets are much more affordable (45 instead of 30) and they work just as well.

review/summary: Life saver - so far
review/text: So far we love this product. Some of the reviews have me a little worried that it won't last forever but it has literally been a lifesaver for our cat.  She has always been very territorial to the point of always staying in the room when anyone is around and hissing and swatting at people who try to touch her or get too close.  Our basement door was left open just a crack and a neighbor's cat came in.  Our cat would not go downstairs, she just looked through her pet door and they screeched and yowled at each other but our cat was totally over the edge after that.  We couldn't get near her; she growled and hissed all the time.  We have grandchildren and we really were considering having her put down.  My husband loves her so much and she is only two and a half years old so we didn't want to do that.  The vet put her on Prozac but we couldn't get it down her.  It was hard enough anyway but with her in the agressive mode, it was impossible.  The Pill Pockets made all the difference.  She swallowed it down in a second and wanted more. She is just upset that she doesn't get more than one treat a day.  She has always loved chicken but we will try another flavor if she gets tired of this one. She has had a habit of getting bored with different types of treats after a few months so we hope this doesn't happen with this one. The last two days it has taken two treats to get it down her. I'm not sure if my husband isn't putting them in right or if she has figured out that if the pill pops out she will get another treat.  We've only been doing this a week and we just hope this keeps on working because if we are not able to continue giving her the medication, she has to find another home or be put down.  By the way, the medication works great in case anyone has a cat or dog that has problems of some sort. Considering the other treatments and prices of raising animals, I was happy to find the price on these. I would not call them pricey considering they only eat one a day and it gets the pill down the cat.

review/summary: SO much easier to pill my cat with these!!
review/text: I bought this brand from Amazon (salmon flavor) and they are absolutely wonderful for me and for my kitty who gets daily pills.  I pinch off a bit of a pill pocket and mould it around the pill (use just enough to coat the pill completely), pop it in the back of her throat and it's gone.  Pill Pockets are about the consistency of children's modeling clay, stick to the pill but not to your fingers, and slide nicely down kitty's throat.  I won't try to tell you my cat enjoys me prying her little jaws open but she doesn't struggle anymore, she doesn't have to endure that bitterness, and I don't feel like a horrible meowmie.

review/summary: Mixed results, and some tips
review/text: I have three older cats who take arthritis pills.  One also takes a thyroid pill.  I decided to try the pill pockets.  For the first month or so, they all loved them, and they made it easy to give the pills.  However, after three months:<br /><br />One cat still loves them.  I have to watch her carefully or she will steal the pills from the others.<br /><br />One cat has figured out how to eat around the pill.<br /><br />One cat sometimes takes them, but at other times just sniffs the pocket and skips it.<br /><br />I have figured out a few tricks that help:<br /><br />There are two types of pockets for cats:  chicken and salmon.  The chicken is slightly larger and more pliable and works better with larger pills.  However, I think that the cats find the salmon tastier.<br /><br />Get another cat treat and stick it to the side of the pill pocket.  Then place the pocket so the treat faces down.  My finicky cat is much more likely to eat the whole thing that way.<br /><br />The pill pocket still helps with the cat who eats around it.  After she eats the pill pocket, it is easier to shove the pill down her throat.  She is more likely to swallow it instead of spitting it out if it tastes of pill pocket.<br /><br />If you have two pills, try to fit them both in one pocket.  Giving the cat fewer pockets will make it seem more of a treat.

review/summary: Great Idea That Works Well Until Your Cat Outsmarts You
review/text: I have two cats, one is mine and the other is my girlfriends. My cat, although he isn't thrilled with getting the occasional "tummy pill," does do pretty well with them and doesn't usually throw too bad of a fit. My girlfriend's cat on the other hand, is quite the opposite. That little bugger will throw one of the biggest fits you ever seen when you attempt to give him a pill. You would think that we are trying to give him a bath he throws such a fit, which is another story all together!<br /><br />Anyhow, we bought some of these "pill hiding treats" in an attempt to get him to take his medicine without the daily fight that is usually attached to the act of pill taking. The very first time we tried them we were both a bit apprehensive wondering if we had just wasted some money on treats instead of the normal band-aids which come in quite handy at pill time. Needless to say, these "pill pockets" worked!<br /><br />We were literally amazed the first time that we gave him one with a pill in it and he actually gulped it down without even tasting it. Oh, what joy swept through our household. Little did we know that it was only going to last about 2 weeks. Just enough time for use to become complacent as far as the daily pill act was concerned.<br /><br />Sure enough, we were once again outsmarted by the cat. Approximately two weeks into the "pill hiding treat" debacle, we started finding his pill on the floor but no sign of the pill pocket. We soon discovered that the little bugger was chewing the pill pocket off from around the pill and eating it without eating the pill.<br /><br />Now we give him several "pill hiding treats" throughout the day, and only one of them has the pill in it, but he never knows which one it is. Although we never put it in the very first one, or the very last one. This has been working now for about a month, but I figure were running out of time on this one and had better start thinking up a new plan of attack before we are once again outsmarted by the cat.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover

review/text: So glad I got these. My cat is on a motility agent and I dreaded giving him the pills remembering the nightmare it was last year when I had to give him antibiotics for a month. With these it's no sweat. He gobbles it up. So much so that he begs for them. Today I got home and he'd managed to get the whole bag off the shelf he normally doesn't reach and tore up the bag and ate them all (more than 30 of them were left). I cringed at the thought of what would have happened if I'd decided to prefill the pockets with the meds. It would have been a tragedy - he would have overdosed and died. Thank goodness I had the instinct not to do that. So word of advice is do never prefill the treats in bulk. No matter how safe you think your storage place is.

review/text: ...and I did.  My cat was diagnosed with asthma and it was then that it became necessary to pill him daily.  He was feral his first year of life so pilling has always been impossible, especially since I have no one to help me with the whole process.  Thanks to pill pockets, I have kept him alive and his asthma under control by myself, without adding to his condition due to stress (a common asthma trigger) from forced pilling.  I've heard that some cats don't go for these treats, but my two boys gobble them up, pill and all.  I'm not sure what I would have tried next if these hadn't worked.  If you've had trouble pilling and you've run out of ideas, they are definitely worth a shot.  Of course, if your cat is super smart and knows how to spit out pills, the treats, in and of themselves, are still great snacks!

review/summary: A great way to fool the cats (sometimes)
review/text: I bought these about a month ago because we have a few cats that we occasionally have to give pills.  It worked for 2 of the cats but the other seemed to sense that something was "fishy" about these things and wouldn't touch them.  But for the other two cats they worked great.<br /><br />They are like a semi-moist cat food, but more moist and pliable.  There's a little indentation in the middle and you just push the pill inside and squeeze it together.  The cats seem to pretty much swallow it whole, or if they do chew it, don't notice the pill inside.  If it were a very  bitter pill I probably wouldn't use these since they'd probably be able to taste it.  Anything that gets medication down even 2 of the cats without a struggle is a success as far as I'm concerned.

review/text: Pill pockets worked twice with my cat.  On the third night my cat bit into a piece of an antibiotic and wouldn't touch them after that. I tried cutting the pill into smaller pieces. I tried smashing one of his regular treats into the pill pocket.  I tried the chicken flavor of pill pocket.  No go. I'm having much better luck with a "pill gun." It looks something like a hypodermic. I can get the pill to the back of his throat so he has to swallow it. I usually get it on the first try. If your cat licks his nose, that's a sign that he's swallowed the pill.  My vet taught me that.

review/text: Every so often you try a product and wonder, "why did it take forever for someone to invent these?" Well, this is that product!  If you've ever had the joy of having fangs come down on your hand while giving medication to a cat, well, try these!  These things are one of "those" products that everyone should know about.  My cat has to be on medication for the rest of his life and these things are a true God send.  He LOVES them and never knows there's a pill inside of them.  They have a hole in the center, you place your pill in there, then seal it up, feed it to your cat.  They just think they are getting a treat, not a pill.  It's the consistency of cookie dough so it's like putting a pill in cookie dough and squishing it together.  I just LOVE these things and so does my cat. He already loved the regular Greenies treats and well, this was an obvious solution.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Great price here too on amazon with the buy 4 get one free thing. Made it cheaper than my local store and WAY cheaper that the vet!

review/summary: The worst part of my cat's day is now the best!
review/text: I have struggled for over a year and a half in giving my cat a daily pill.  She foams and vomits easily and she and I both dread this daily torture. I have tried to bury the pill in every treat and delicious food I could think of, including raw liver, but as soon as she smelled the pill (which has a disgusting bitter taste, the vet says), she wouldn't try anything.  But this week I tried the chicken-flavored pill pocket, and my cat just about stood on my head to get it out of my hand so she could eat it.  She goes absolutely nuts for it and doesn't detect her pill at all.  The worst part of my cat's day (the worst part of my day, too) is now great! I recommend this stuff highly.<br /><br />Note: After a few weeks, my cat decided she no longer liked the chicken flavor, but continues to eat the salmon flavor one. But sometimes she won't eat it unless I wrap some small cat treats on it like a sandwich. You don't need to use the entire pill pocket for small pills - I pinch off what I need, and so the bag lasts a long longer than usual.

review/summary: Pill Pockets - some tricks
review/text: I used these when my cat had to take antibiotic pills for an upper respiratory infection.  They worked well, but I learned a couple of things:<br /><br />1. Feed him the pill pockets alone a couple of times.<br /><br />2. VERY IMPORTANT - Use one hand for the pill and the other for the pocket, and never let them touch.  I accidentally let the pill hand touch the pocket and he wouldn't eat it because he smelled the pill.<br /><br />The pill pockets were much easier than trying to pill and then squirt water into the cat.

review/summary: Veterinary approved for dogs. Still mixed about cats...
review/text: As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those "duh" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of "treat."  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it "makes pills a treat to give!"<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger "capsule" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />For dogs, 5 stars. For cats, I'm only giving 3 stars, as only one of my two cats will eat them!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of "It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet" and "It's a Cat's World...

review/text: Kelsey is 18 years old just developed hyperthroidism and has to have a pill every day for the rest of her life.  Well she is extremely closed mouth and it is very hard to even get her mouth open.<br /><br />So I heard about the pill pockets read your reviews on here picked up her medication at the vets yesterday and stopped at PetsMart and purchased the pocket, chicken flavor.<br /><br />First I gave her one without the pill... she loved it and thought it was a treat and looked at me for more.  I then took another and put in the pill and pinched it close and she gobbled it up.  YEA!!!!!!<br /><br />Kelsy only has 2 teeth and eats only soft food.  This pocket is soft enough and she has no problems getting it down.<br /><br />Another up side is when we go on vacation my sons comes and feeds her.  He could have never have gotten a pill down her.  He watched me give her her pill and he said Wow, I can do that!<br /><br />Also since Kelsey is old, as much as I love her I could not afford the operation or the radioactive pill.  So this works great.<br /><br />Thank you for your reviews.<br /><br />A+++++++++<br /><br />Next I will try the salmon.<br /><br />Oh there is one bad thing... and that us she wants more than one... lol<br /><br />Maryanne & Kelsey

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I actually haven't used these on my very finicky cat, but they worked marvelously with two of my other cats and my Border Collie.  My Border Collie was prescribed antibiotics twice a day for ten days as well as another very large pill for four days.  We've tried treats (they crumble), peanut butter, wet food, and anything else we could think of when trying to give her heartworm medication.  Nothing worked!  She would lick all the good stuff off and then spit the pill back out.  I had just ordered these pill pockets for my cats when the meds were prescribed for my Border Collie and thought I'd try them out.  She took her medicine every day with no problem! I was amazed!  I used one pill pocket for the smaller pill and two for the larger one, molding them around the pills.  She gobbled them up every time.  I will absolutely be ordering more when these are used up.

review/summary: They are begging for their pills now!
review/text: I'm pretty good at shoving pills down cats' throats, but it really isn't fun for anyone involved, so I was happy to try the pill pockets. I was even more happy with the results.<br /><br />It's easy to put the pills into the putty-like cups and close them up. They accommodate even fairly big pills, and the cats will eat them right up. I haven't had any of the problem of them licking the treat off the pill that I'd had when trying other things like meat or peanut butter.<br /><br />The best thing? My cats come running as soon as they hear my open the pill bottle!<br /><br />They keep for quite a while, so even if you're only giving a short course of antibiotics or something I totally recommend them.

review/summary: These worked for a while
review/text: My sister recommended that I try these.  She has been giving her cat thyroid pills for years and swears by the pill pockets.  When my cat was in a bad cat fight, and required surgery, I had to give him antibiotics.  So my sister gave me some of her pill pockets to try on my cat.  They worked great. The vet then told me that I would need to start my cat on thyroid meds as well, so I went ahead and ordered more of the pill pockets.  Well the day after I ordered 4 bags of them, my cat figured out that he could eat the treat from the outside of the pill, and leave the pill. I tried a few more times, and he always ate the treat and left the pill.  So the 4 packs of pill pockets that I bought will be given to my sister now.<br /><br />So yes they are great unless your pet figures out that there is a pill inside.  My sister has been using them for a very long time and has no problem with them.

review/summary: Amazing Pill Pockets
review/text: I have to give my almost seventeen year old cat a half a pill three times a day. For several months when I first started giving her the pills, I put the pills in the pocket and put it on top her wet food. She ate it right up. The quality of her fur improved dramatically. Eventually she figured out the pocket was hiding something and stopped eating them on her own. I now have to shove them down her throat, and technically I don't need to use the pill pockets anymore, but I continue to use them because they cover up the bad pill taste, and the enzymes and nutrients noticeably improve her health. If I no longer had to give her pills, I would probably still give her the pill pockets.

review/summary: Pilling a cat is made easy by Pill Pockets
review/text: After years of hiding flavored liquid heart meds in my cat's treat food, the dreaded day arrived: the only way I could be sure of his swallowing all the meds was to pill him. My cat threatened to take me to divorce court; my savvy neighbor gave me some Pill Pockets to try, and from that day on, the living was easy! I enclosed up to five different pill pieces in one yummy chicken Pill Pocket, wet it to slide easier, and in one second pushed the entire treat down his throat. No bitter taste, no pills spit out later under the table, not even any resentful looks from my baby. And no guilt for me, as I knew the Pockets are made up of only healthy, fresh ingredients. The best part was that our relationship stayed great, while I knew all of his meds were properly ingested. I can't recomend this product highly enough; and buying it from Amazon rather than my vet saved me 2/3 of the cost.

review/summary: Makes giving pills easy
review/text: The treats are shaped like little meat cylinders.  There's an open center where you slip in the pill, then you squash the soft treat into a ball that has your pill in the center.  My cats barely notice that the pill exists.<br /><br />My cats like both the Chicken and the Salmon flavors.  While I don't think it's the healthiest treat (it would need more meat and fewer fillers for that), it's a whole lot less annoying than trying to shove a pill down a cat's throat.  The only time my cat wouldn't eat it was when he was very very sick and refusing everything.  In fact, the only thing I don't like about this product is the price... and this is a whole lot better than paying $8 a bag to get it from my vet's office!!

review/text: I have an elderly cat who must have medications on a fairly regular basis.  He is a horror to try and pill. My vet gave me some of these to try him on and they are fantastic!  Normally the cat refuses anything with a pill in it and it turns into a wrestling match. But with these he takes his pill quite happily.<br /><br />The person who suggested using different hands for the pill and the treat is on the right track. My cat instinctively knows if I hand him something and hang around that it might be medicine, but with the pill pockets I can put the pill downin front of him like a treat and walk away.  He hasn't caught on yet!

review/text: As the title suggested, my cat would not eat these.  They are rather large (about two times the size of an ordinary cat treat) and rubbery in texture.  I cannot attest to the flavour and how palatable it may or may not be to felines.  If your cat is used to "normal" treats, these may not go over well.  My cat is extremely difficult to pill, and we have tried basically every last idea known to man on how to get his daily meds into him.  We still have almost a whole package of these in the fridge.<br /><br />All I can say is, good luck.  I guess it all depends on the cat.

review/summary: 5 strikes and you are out
review/text: I really wish these pill pockets would work. Instead, I have tried every flavor (including the dog ones just in case) and I have followed every tip I could find online religiously.<br /><br />For instance, I take great care at handling the pills with the opposite hand as the one handling the pockets. I tried giving it to them alone, without pill just to see if they liked them. I have tried mixing them with treats they do like. Invariably all my 5 cats refuse to eat these pill pockets snacks. It makes me wonder if the manufacturer even ever tried giving them to a cat.<br /><br />It's really too bad because I have one kitty, one I am incredibly attached to, that is dying of hearth disease. I have to give him numerous pills every day. I have tried everything and I really hoped these treats would do the trick. Instead, what I am doing now is to take my Dremel tool and hollow out the cat treats he likes so I can put the medicine inside. It's painstaking work. The sad thing is that if I use this product even just as "mortar" to keep the other cat treat together, he is able to sniff it and won't eat it. I tried skipping the meds and it's not that. It's the pillpocket that doesn't work.<br /><br />Considering that 5 out of 5 cats do not like this pillpocket in my experience, I cannot really recommend them.

review/summary: I was leary, but..........they work!!!
review/text: My cat is extremely picky when it comes to treats, so I was leery about whether she would eat these or not.  I fed her a couple of her regular treats, then one of these, then a couple of hers, then one of these in order to trick her into trying them.  She likes them!<br /><br />After doing this for several different days, I put a pill in one of them.  She is little, so when I put the pill in one treat she chewed it, which is not what I wanted her to do, since she also chewed the pill.  She takes Prednisolone, which apparently has an awful, bitter taste.  So the next time I put the pill in the pocket, closed it and squeezed off all the excess Greenie treat until I got a little ball.  I fed her a couple of her regular treats, then snuck the pill treat in.  When she started to chew I put another treat in front of her quickly which made her swallow the pill treat whole so that she could eat the next treat.<br /><br />These work great for me!  No more having to sit on top of her, holding her down as she fights me, prying open her mouth and shoving the little pill to the back of her throat, just to have her spit it out so that I have to start the whole process all over again.  I'm sold, and I will be using these from now on.

review/summary: Finally... one battle conquered...
review/text: I had been struggling to find a way to give my cat with hyperthyroidism her medication twice daily.  I had tried all sorts of other things (american cheese, cream cheese, bread, etc) to wrap her pills in, but she always managed to spit them out.  This product has been a godsend!  Prior to finding this product, my cat had started to become anti-social, probably due to the fact that every time I managed to track her down she was being traumatized by being pinned down and having a pill shoved down her throat... now, if I am not right on time when it comes to giving her a pill, she is the one who lets me know now by meowing and making noise until she gets her pill.<br /><br />One suggestion... if your cat is not accustomed to receiving treats, I would introduce them to treats for about a week or two before introducing these.  My cat was skeptical of treats, because she never got them, so I started giving her Temptations cat treats about two weeks before starting the pill pockets.  It got her used to the idea of receiving treats daily, and after a short amount of time she was gobbling the treats without even chewing.  Made it much easier when I introduced her to the pill pockets - she ended up just gobbling those down too without chewing, so she doesn't even notice there is a pill buried inside.  Without this product, giving my cat her medication would be a daily battle - instead this product has made it a pleasure to give my cat her medication!

review/summary: Sometimes works
review/text: If you have a cat who is prone to gobbling treats whole, these will likely work. My cat, however, chews treats, so she breaks the pocket open and then tastes the pill and spits it all out. It would likely work best with small pills and then you could use part of the pocket and maybe the cat would swallow it without chewing. You need to be extremely careful if the pill is bitter; if you handle the pill and get residue on your hand and then use those fingers to pinch the pocket shut, it will get residue on the outside, which makes the cat less likely to take it. It might help to just feed a few as treats without pills in the beginning to get them used to the idea that they are treats?

review/summary: I wish I had discovered these sooner
review/text: These are awesome.  Not knowing that this product existed, I've been trying to make my own ad-hoc pill pockets with wet cat food.  When the food is too soft, my cat licks it right off the pill.  When the food is too firm, my cat has figured out how to crumble it apart to leave the pill in the bowl.  But this product is perfect.  The material is pliable (almost like chicken flavored Play-Doh) but won't allow cats to lick it away or crumble it apart.  In fact, while he eats it, I've been listening for the "crunch" that indicates that he bit into the bitter pill, but so far he's been swallowing it silently and whole, so it seems like the softness makes him believe he doesn't have to chew it - this is great, since he has no idea what's inside.  Now my cat begs me for his "treat" each day, even though he's a really picky eater and has turned down other new cat treats numerous times in the past.  I was a bit shocked at the price, but I was at my wits end trying to pill my cat, so I am willing to pay for the peace of mind.

review/summary: Be Careful if using these long term
review/text: I had been using these with much success for my cat for the last 8 months.  He has to have seizure medication twice a day, and he loves the pill pockets.  About 3 months ago, he started having chronic diarrhea that got worse and worse.  The vet tested him for everything and did x-rays and tried multiple medications, but he still didn't get better.  Than as a last thought, we decided to try to stop using the pill pockets completely and just giving him his medication in his food.  Within 5 days, our cat was back to normal, and within a few weeks he wasn't dehydrated anymore and gained some weight back.  I was very pleased with this product until I realized it was what was making my cat sick.  I thought it might just be him, but I found other sites online where people had cited the same problem.  I think this is a great product for help administering short-term medications, but I would make sure to monitor your cat if you are using them long-term.  If your cat starts getting chronic diarrhea, these may be the cause.

review/summary: Never thought my cat would buy it... I was wrong!
review/text: My older cat recently spent time in the animal hospital due to a blocked bladder. When he came home and the vet gave me pills to give him, she warned me that the pills stink and they had a hard time getting him to take them. I spent the first three days crushing them up and mixing them with tuna, then had to sit there and make sure he ate it - and that my other cat didn't!<br /><br />I found the Pill Pockets review when I googled "how to get a cat to take a pill." The idea was amazing, and the first few reviews were promising. I went to PetsMart and bought it the same day, and wow! My kitty ate that treat-covered pill like he was starving, and after he was done sat there and meowed at me for another. He even crunched right into the pill and never thought twice about finishing it.<br /><br />I would recommend this to every cat owner - salmon or chicken, doesn't matter, but these things work!!

review/text: I tried the chicken flavor, hoping I could disguise the nasty flavor of pills and/or vitamin supplements. Unfortunately, my 17-year-old cat doesn't just swallow it, he chews and reveals any stuff inside. Of course, he now refuses to eat them, even empty. They're simply too large for my cat (who is no tiny thing - he has weighed between ten and 13 pounds) to swallow easily. I'm switching to gelcaps instead.

review/text: After reading all of the positive reviews here I thought I'd give this a shot when one of my cats needed a course of antibiotic pills.  She would not touch the pockets even without a pill in them.  It may be because my cat routinely eats wet cat food so moist pellets like this are not so much a treat for her as they may be for cats that eat a dry diet.  I had high hopes but this did not work for us - our dogs do like them though!

review/summary: Life Saver for our CRF Cat
review/text: Our cat of 15 years was just recently diagnosed with Kidney Failure.<br /><br />Among the other things the vet prescribed to help her is a daily dose of Pepcid and an appetite stimulant which she takes every 3 days. She's not allowed to have a lot of protein (part of kidney failure), but the vet advised a little would be OK to disguise her pills in a small bit of food. We tried everything to get her to take the pills - tuna, cream cheese, regular cheese, cream, whipped cream, ham, turkey, baby food, etc. Although she usually loves all of these things (she comes running when we shake the whipped cream can!), she would not touch them when the pill was mixed in. We tried adding the pills whole as well as crushing and mixing them. No go.<br /><br />The vet suggested force-feeding her the pills. This includes wrapping her up in a towel while my husband forces her to open her jaw and throws the pill in while. I shoot a syringe full of water in forcing her to swallow the pill. Sounds pretty straight forward, but its not. Not to mention its stressful on us all. When we were finally able to get the pill in her mouth it actually started foaming!<br /><br />Needless to say, we were very frustrated and didn't know what to do. Then we found these. She loves them and hasn't even noticed the pill. We purchased both the Chicken and Salmon in case she gets bored of one flavor. We're crossing our fingers that she doesn't wise up. But they have literally been a life-saver!  Thank you Greenies!

Our other cat won't eat them either, even as a treat, so it was a total waste of money.<br /><br />I'm not saying these don't work for any cats, but my rating reflects the fact that we have had zero success with two different cats.

review/summary: Great for most cats (and dogs) but not all!
review/text: My in-laws have a very food-driven feline who takes meds daily and LOVES these so we bought the dog versions of these for our poms. I was skeptical, because these are a bit pricy (especially if you buy them from the vet). However, they were so easy to use and our dogs loved them so much, we decided to get both cat versions (chicken and salmon) to try on our cat who takes daily heart meds.<br /><br />We tested them on all three of our cats (sans pills). Everyone LOVES Pill Pockets--except the one cat who actually needs them (typical). Oh, well. That's the way it can be with kitties sometimes, and our one cat doesn't generally like treats to begin with (unless it's fat-free cream cheese--spoiled fink).<br /><br />They are still worth a try--even if you have a finicky pet (one of our other cats is also finicky and LOVES them). If you have a very food-driven dog/cat you will probably be fine, but don't buy in bulk until you are sure they work for you. :)<br /><br />One last bit of adivce - if you have a mult-pet family and have to medicate one with strong pills, make sure you do it in a separate room with the door closed. Make sure he/she actually eats both the pill pocket and meds. Pill Pockets smell/taste soooo good, it is easy to run the risk of the wrong pet getting the medicated.

review/summary: With Pill Pockets my cat eagerly waits for his vitamins every morning!
review/text: Before I found Pill Pockets I had to trick, entice or coerce my cat by methods of whateverworks to take his vitamin supplement capsule for his skin & hair coat.  He would lick off the "likeable" vitamin I had to crush and roll the capsule in to entice him to eat, and sometimes spit the darn capsule out, now punctured and leaking all over.  Now with Pill Pockets (chicken flavor), I don't have to worry, as he readily waits for me every morning in the kitchen to get to his wrapped capsule.  The formula of Pill Pockets allows you to mold it around the pill or capsule, as it is more pliable with the heat from your hands.  These really are TERRIFIC!  They have made a tedious, high stressed duty become an easy, daily ritual that is only stressed by the imploring eyes of my cat who now pesters me to give him his vitamin before I can get my morning coffee.  I am also trying the Salmon flavor and will let you know how that is accepted.<br /><br />Only complaint:  Are there really 45 pcs. in each package?  It seems only like 2 weeks ago I started using these with the lack of hassle.  They are double the price from the local pet supply than online.

review/summary: My cats love it, it saves their life and is worth every penny!
review/text: Giving your pets meds, no matter what form, can be an awful experience for you and your pet. Two of my cats were diagnosed with thyroid issues which means they need pills, twice a day, forever. My vet told me about pill pockets during my visit so I picked them up. They are amazing!<br /><br />My cats treat their medicine time just like a regular treat time and are so happy when they get the pockets. They are worth every single penny I spend on them. I do have one tip, instead of using a whole pill pocket on one pill, break off a piece and wrap it around the pill. The pill pocket gets really gummy in contact with saliva and my cats were scared when they tried to eat a whole one because it stuck to their teeth. This way they get the pill in the first piece of the pocket and enjoy an extra piece as an added treat. Works much better this way.<br /><br />As cat owners we know all cats have different personalities so some cats may like it, some won't. If they don't I suggest putting the pill in a piece of chicken or tuna and it works the same way. But I'm fine with spending the extra money on a treat my cats love!

review/text: I had used Pill Pockets years ago when my feral tomcat was sick, but the old guy was so savvy and stubborn, he wouldn't eat them when he figured out I was sneaking stuff into them. So I wasn't sure they were such a great product and I forgot about them.<br /><br />But my other feral tomcat, the young one, needs medication now - and so I tried the Pill Pockets again and this time they are a real lifesaver. Dickens doesn't care if there's something inside it, he wants MORE. And my inside Persian cat, who also needs pills, loves the Pill Pockets as well. I'm able to give pills to my persian by popping them down his throat - but Pill Pockets are SO much nicer for my cat and for me. The Persian also begs for more of them!<br /><br />So I do give all my cats a Pill Pocket as a treat when the meds are handed out. My cats absolutely love these things.

My only complaint is that they are a bit on the smallish side; sometimes the pill pokes out the other end and you have to stretch it a bit to make sure none of the pill shows before giving it to the cat. Otherwise, a great find! And waaaaay cheaper on Amazon than buying it at a pet store.

review/summary: Excellent Product, Bit Expensive and with Cats ...
review/text: Have now tried this product on 5 different cats.  Two gobbled them down with tablet inside.  One would only eat if tablet was crushed, but did so readily after crushed and bits/powder hidden in pocket.  One cat just sniffed around it and walked off, but next day tried BEFORE feeding her anything all day - IT worked.  One cat sniffed and ran regardless of what I tried.<br /><br />CATS ... what can you say other than that?<br /><br />At least they worked (with some additional trickery) on 4 out of 5.  And not having to brave the claws and sharp teeth when trying to stuff a tablet or capsule in mouth of 4 out of 5 is EXCELLENT !!<br /><br />Very easy to use, but a bit "greasy".  So much easier than trying to force pill down their mouth or chopping up and carefully slicing center of hotdog to hide pill in it, and probably a lot healthier for them  (and me!).  Think I may try the salmon flavor on other cat, can't hurt to try, if she doesn't like, the other cats may and at ~$6.00 no big investment.

review/text: Our elderly cat will need 2x daily pills for the rest ot his days.  I honestly believe he would not be with us still if it were not for pill pockets. He is frail and the trauma of being picked up and pilled would seriously negatively impact his quality of life.  We make sure to push the pill into the pocket so it sticks and doesn't fall out when he chews.  Also, we rotate through all three flavors so it stays 'treat-y' and he doesn't get bored with them.  Happy Kitty, happy owners!  You do have to be careful when you reseal the bag so they don't dry out prematurely. Once they dry out they crack and the pill doesn't stick as well.  The price here is excellent compared to our local pet chain stores where I've paid upwards of $7.

I usually use 1/2 to 1/3 of a pocket because they are gooey and he gets it stuck in his teeth (he looks like one of the Stooges eating a sandwich full of glue). Sometimes I glue a little pill he's been taking to the back of another kind of treat, using pocket material as putty. Also a small amount of pocket rolled around a vitamin tablet works well to convince him that what's good for him can also taste good!

review/summary: Veterinary approved for dogs. Still mixed about cats...
review/text: As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those "duh" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of "treat."  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it "makes pills a treat to give!"<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger "capsule" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />For dogs, 5 stars. For cats, I'm only giving 3 stars, as only one of my two cats will eat them!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of "It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet" and "It's a Cat's World...

review/text: What a super answer to a troubling task! I've had to give meds to my cats in the past, and it is SUCH a challenge. When the vet recommended these, I had serious doubts. However, they are PERFECT and by far the BEST invention EVER! I've also had a challenge of getting my elderly cat to eat more food, so when I mix these in with his food, he devours it! Amazon has the best price, by far ... but they work so well, I'd pay anything to get them!

review/text: My cat likes both salmon and chicken flavor. At first she would just eat the pill pocket (with pill inside) but then she stopped. So I started hiding the pill pocket in some wet food and now she eats it again. What a huge relief! I did not like trying to shove pills down my cat's throat and either did she!

review/text: When our vet said I would have to give our "GUMBO" a pill TWICE a day I almost had a panic attack.  I would rather take a bath with jellyfish.<br />Someone recommended this products ( While we were at a funeral no less )<br />Bouight a package tried it.  THANK YOU GOD!!!  Gumbo eat it, pill and all!<br />You must be sure it is well sealed...after a few seconds of chewing ( it looks like he's chewing gum) out popped the pill.  Also you all know how cats are right, get another flavor and mix it up every now and then.<br />A little pricey,but worth it's price in diamonds! Buy at Amazon  best price I found.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I have one cat with severe anxiety issues. He requires daily medication to keep him from stressing out and urine spraying. My oldest kitty has a mild heart condition and requires heart meds twice daily. Pill Pockets are a life saver! I don't have to scoop them up and use a pill dispenser to jab the meds down their throats. I simply place the tablets into the pocket, seal it and they happily gobble them up. My Dusty knows he's supposed to get his treatums twice a day and now doesn't even wait to be served. He comes right to the kitchen while they're being prepared.<br /><br />You may wonder why I only give it four stars if I think it's so great. No product is perfect and there are some things to be aware of especially if it's the first time trying these. If the tablet is large, it won't fit well and may need to be cut in half. Luckily one kitty gets 1/4 of a tablet twice a day and the other gets 1/2. If the cat chews the pocket it can come apart leaving a bad taste in their mouth or worse yet medication on the floor and no desire for another "treat". My Kali accidentally did this a few times when we first started and then refused to eat the pockets . What I did was went back to using the pill dispenser for the meds but giving him the empty pocket as a treat right after. I did this for about two weeks then tried again. Most of the time no problems any more. If you experience this problem don't give up. Stop using the pockets for meds right away to prevent negative association but treat with the pockets immediately after dosing. Try them again in a few weeks. At the very least, this stopped my cat from running when he saw the dispenser in my hand. I'd call him, let him smell the treat (at which point he'd start to drool)administer the pill, then reward. Either way much better than the stressful alternative.

review/text: ...that we didn't know about this product about 2 years ago.  It took both of us, one to hold and pry open our sweet cat's mouth and another to deposit pill(s) and squirt in the water, twice a day.  We had both gotten bitten before, but the most recent bite on my left thumb was pretty serious and got infected. Fun! Anyway, a client told us about Pill Pockets and price be d**ned, I'd pay 4 times as much just to not get bitten again.  These things are heaven sent. Thanks, Pill Pockets! :)

review/text: Our little cat needs to have her teeth cleaned and a tooth extracted, which means going on antibiotics for several days.  I had no luck getting the liquid in her mouth, and my efforts were causing her considerable stress.  The vet told us about pill pockets. I was skeptical because she is notoriously picky, but I didn't have any other options.  My husband got some, along with antibiotics in pill form.  We cut one in half and let her try it without a pill in it.  She LOVED it and asked for more!  We gave her the other half, and then the one with the pill in it.  SUCCESS!!  I wish I would have tried this method first, and skipped the whole fiasco with the liquid.  Wonderful product, I highly recommend it.

review/summary: When they work...they are great!
review/text: I've had years of experience pilling my various cats. I always swore by a combination pill gun and fill-em-yourself #3 gelcaps. Never had a problem. It turns out that this was not due to my technique as much as my dear departed cats were very good patients.<br /><br />Last month I was fostering a cat from the ASPCA who needed thyroid meds twice a day. Well, this poor thing would barely let me pat her without hissing, much less allow her jaw to be pryed open to put a pill down her throat. I bought a bag of Pill Pockets. They worked for exactly 3 doses. I could actually hear her growling as she hit the part that had the pill...and Tapizole is not known to be a terrible tasting med. As someone suggested, I gave her an empty one right before the 'loaded' pocket. But after the first few successes, she just refused to eat them. Unfortunately, I had to give her back to the ASPCA.<br /><br />I took another cat...a totally gentle sweetheart. She has some intestinal issues that require for a twice daily dose of Flagyl which is a notoriously vile tasting antibiotic. For this reason, I didn't even consider using the Pill Pockets I had left from the first cat. I went back to my old method of cutting up the pills and putting them into the gelcaps. As sweet as my new cat is, she proved very difficult to pill...she's not nasty, but she's a wriggler. I can manage it(sometimes it takes a few attempts), but there is no way that a cat-sitter or my husband could.<br /><br />Now it seems that my vet wants her to continue with the meds for an extended period...a problem if I have to be out of town. Just for the heck of it I decided to put a dose of Flagyl into a Pill Pocket to see what would happen. 'Odey' went right for the treat and started chewing...I waited for her to hit the pill and start foaming at the mouth...but she just swallowed everything and looked up at me to see if there was any more on the way!  I've given her three doses so far. Now she just scarfs them right down without a lot of chewing. Now when she hears the bag being opened, she runs right over and practically begs for her 'meds'.<br /><br />I hope that she doesn't discover my little secret...if she does, I'll go back to the pillgun. But in the meantime, It's wonderful not to have to forcibly wrestle down my sweet little pal twice a day, and to know that if I have to be away, someone else can easily medicate her.<br /><br />I give Pill Pockets 4 stars instead of 5 because of my initial unsuccessful experience and also because they are a little on the expensive side. Not really a problem once or twice twice a day, but I was giving my late cat, who had CRF 6 different meds stuffed into gelcaps 3 times a day...which could get a little price-y with PillPockets because you just can't fit as much into them.<br />LF

review/text: I got a prescription for Cosequin capsules for my cat's arthritis from my vet today. He said to sprinkle them on her food, i knew that wouldn't work and the capsules were too big to pop them in her mouth. My vet told me to try the Pill Pockets (he charged me $8!!). So I took them home and opened the capsule and sprinkled the powder into the pill pocket, and my cat gobbled them up like crazy, some of the powder was even overflowing from the pill pocket onto the plate and my cat licked it all up. I could not believe it!! My problem is that one capsule's powder required 5 pill-pockets to take all the medication which could be expensive. My cat likes treatsin general, so she enjoyed this product very much!

review/summary: Change Not Always Good
review/text: I have been using Pill Pockets for years and am VERY disappointed that Greenies changed the ingredients. Not only are they not as moist, but they removed the probiotic which aids in digestion. They say only the packaging has changed, but I had an old package and compared the ingredients and they are DEFINITELY different. It is still a Good way to give a pill, but not as healthy or tasty. I have even found unknown pieces of hard stuff in some, (I use to break them up and roll into balls and give as treats. I have tried to track down any of the originals, but unfortunately, they seem to be all gone. So, if you need to give your cat a pill, buy them, I just don't give them as treats anymore. Sad that such a great product has gone from a 10 to a 4, in my opinion. And what's sadder, I wrote to Greenies about the ingredients  about 3 months ago and I have yet to hear a thing from them... Not very good customer relations.

review/text: Although this product accomplished the mission of getting my cat to take his pill, the side effect of the horrible diarrhea he got from these was definitely not worth it.

review/text: Pilling my cat used to be awful. She hated being restrained and having something put in her mouth. She would struggle and often times spit it out, than run and hide. I would end up feeling so mean, dragging her out of her hiding place and trying again.<br /><br />I wasn't confident these pill pockets would work. My cat normally doesn't like treats. So, I put her medicine inside the salmon flavored pill pocket, then put it in a dish with a tablespoon of Fancy Feast salmon appetizer, which she loves, and spooned some of the juices over the pill pocket. She ate all of it very happily. Hooray!

review/text: Our oldest cat has problems with urinary tract blockages.  After the 3rd time to the vet in the past few years, they suggested giving coenzyme supplements for healthy bladder function.  Well he HATES pills.  It takes two people to give him his pills and he is not a happy camper.  These little puppies came in handy for prednisone, and now with coenzyme supplements.  Unfortunately these cannot hold a whole coenzyme supplement (even emptying the pill contents in the pill pocket), so I tried mushing 2 pill pockets and mixing the coenzyme powder with it.  Works like a charm!

review/summary: ABSOLUTE LIFESAVERS!!!
review/text: Recently one of my elderly cats was diagnosed with an ulcerated cornea that had both bacterial and fungal activity in it; wow. So I have to somehow get this fully clawed cat to swallow a pill twice a day, and also squirt antibiotic gel into her eyes. And somehow do this without losing a limb? Yeah right. This cat is FIERCE! Our vet recommended the Pill Pockets....WHAT A LIFESAVER!<br /><br />I have to squirt gel into my cat's eye 3 times a day and get her pilled up twice a day. So in the morning and at night, she gets a 'treat' afterwards: her antifungal pill wrapped in a pill pocket!! We laugh that she's being 'rewarded' with her pill. But she's looking for that pill as soon as we squirt in the eye gel, like a crack addict looking for their next high! She starts sniffing for her treat immediately. SHE LOVES these pill pockets! Which amazes me, as she is normally not the kind of cat to be fooled by medication wrapped up in treats. Nothing else we have ever tried, has worked like these.<br /><br />TOTAL recommendation to anyone and everyone from now on! I will also give these to my friends who have cats constantly on medication. These are a miracle product for us!

review/text: We have four cats. At various times, they've all needed to take pills, which can be a nightmare by normal methods. But the cats love the flavor of the chicken pill pockets, and will actually beg for them if they see us taking out the bag. We used to drop the filled pocket in their food, but have found it works better to just feed them by hand - they just gulp the thing down. Two things to note: for larger pills, might need to split the pill and use two pockets, or mold two pockets together around a capsule, and the second thing is that at least one of our cats won't touch the salmon version.<br /><br />At the moment, one cat is very happy - he's sick and needs three pills, which means he gets hand-fed three pill pockets every evening and two every morning!

review/text: My cat was recently diagnosed an epileptic, and will be on phenobarbital pills for probably the rest of her life. My cat loves to eat, especially table food, so I thought getting her to take her meds would be easy, crush the pill up, mix it in milk or sour cream or any of her favorite foods, and viola! But I quickly found out it was not so easy! I would be up at 6am chasing her around the house trying to get her to eat it, or force-feeding it to her, which me and the cat both hate to do! I discovered these pill pockets while doing research online and decided to order it. Let me tell you, medicine time is a piece of cake now! I dont even have to crush the pill up. You just stick the pill in the predesigned pocket, pinch the top together and my cat eagerly chomps it down! She loves both the chicken and salmon flavor, medicine time takes less than a minute to accomplish, and both me and the cat are happy! She has been enjoying these "treats" for a few weeks now, twice she ended up biting into the pill, yet the flavor of the treat was so appealing to her that she didn't pay any attention to the pill and kept chomping it down! We love these things, they really were the answer to our prayers, especially for my boyfriend who had been responsible for medicine time in the evenings while I am at work. My cat has always been more hesitant to take her meds when he is giving them to her, but since trying these pill pockets it has been absolutely no problem. We are all very thrilled with this product--mom, dad, and kitty!

review/text: We have a Bengal. They are known to be smarter, feistier and more opinionated than the average cat. When ours was struck with a sudden mystery illness that caused acute life threatening anemia - after a week in the hospital he came home with a strict and huge pill routine.<br /><br />For two weeks we fought, got bit, scratched, foamed on, etc. we tried liquids. Pills. Hiding them in food. Hiding them in other treats. Everything. He wasn't getting his meds - he'd throw them up. Foam them all out. Eat around them, etc.<br /><br />As a last hope we tried the pill pockets. I figured he was WAY too smart for this trick. The pills he takes are huge and foul smelling - I couldn't imagine he'd not smell them or not bite into them whole eating it.<br /><br />But - they worked!! And not just once - every time. He's going to be on steroids for probably a year, and into month 3 he still takes his 3 pills daily with pleasure! Talk about a literal life saver, we wouldn't have made it without them.

review/summary: Okay for some cats
review/text: The concept behind the product is wonderful, so I tried it with my cat. He's normally a loving, docile kitty but turns into Cat-Kong when we try to administer medication. It worked the first time, even though he had difficulty chewing it up because of the pocket's soft consistency. The second time we met with less success. It ended up slipping out of his mouth, and I had to offer it to him several times before he ate it. Thinking it was too soft for him to grasp with his teeth, I left one out on the counter to let it harden up a bit. The slightly hardened pocket worked the first time but failed to work after that. I think this product meets with more success with cats who enjoy wet cat food. My cat eats only dry food, so he lost interest in it quickly when he couldn't grasp it with his teeth. You may want to keep this in mind if your cat has only enjoyed the dry food. Even though it didn't work for my cat, it might be worth a try!

review/text: Our 12 year old Siamese has always been finicky about any type of cat treats.  We tried them first without a pill.  She instantly turned up her nose, wouldn't even give them a second thought.  Kept offering them for a week and she never changed her mind.  It's very disappointing.  But our 10 month old tiger cat loved them!

review/text: It was a fight every day to give my cat a pill for her stomach problems.  Now she comes running to take the pill.  She loves these things I would recommend them to everyone.

review/summary: The greatest thing EVER
review/text: So my cat is very skittish and even though she is comfortable with me holding her head, I simply could not get her to take her pills. It was very upsetting for both of us: she'd start foaming from the pill residue after she spit it out and then run under the bed; and I was sad because she was now afraid of me! I waited anxiously for the pill pockets to arrive, tracked them closely (thanks Amazon), popped a pill into one as soon as they got here and she at it whole! Afterwards she came looking for more! What a brilliant solution to a very stressful situation.
