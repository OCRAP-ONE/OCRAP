review/summary: Food for my picky puppy
review/text: I am feeding her this currently while mixing it with the Innova (which is very expensive and hard to find) that her breeder is feeding her. I love that the price is slightly less than other premium, holistic foods and I can get it shipped to me on Prime 2 day shipping.  It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily. It is hard enough for me to pick up a 35 pound bag of dog food while I'm putting it in a plastic bin (let alone carrying home from the store as I live in a metropolitan area where I take public transit).  Great service and good product.

review/summary: Our dog loves it!
review/text: Our older dog has developed allergies and it's been hard to find a dog food that works for him. We were using Diamond Naturals, but I suspect they must have changed the formula because suddenly his allergies flared up and he ended up with an ear infection. We switched to this dog food and he LOVES it. Not only does he love it, but his ear infection is now gone and he's itching/scratching/chewing MUCH less.. We're grateful to have found it and hope they do not change the formula!

review/summary: Dog developed GI problems
review/text: Our 6-year old Vizsla has been eating Canidae for 3 years. A month ago we switched flavors from Bison to Sea Salmon.  We gradually transitioned the change even though it was the same company.  Within four weeks on the new flavor he developed a set of distressing systems including soft, mucus covered stools, horrible gas,low energy, staggering walk, excessive drooling, licking and constant neck extending (difficulty swallowing).  A vet visit confirmed these as diet related.  We put him on a chicken/rice diet and his symptoms stopped after just two days.  Doing research to decide whether to switch back to bison or go with another company, I found a great deal of  information about other pet owners having issues with all flavors of food from Canidae. Consumer Affairs reports a pending class action suit.  We have decided to switch to another company.

review/summary: three empty dishes can't be wrong
review/text: My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one Labrador Retriever are no pushovers.<br /><br />Even other varieties of highly regarded Canidae food have left them looking up at me over lightly rearranged bowls of food with that 'Why have you turned against us again?' look.<br /><br />But whenever I bring home the thirty-pound bags of Canidae Chicken Meal and Rice, the dogsters nose hungrily around the car before I can even get the stuff out of the trunk. I've long since settled on Canidae (for its reputation as nutritious and high-quality) and on the Chicken Meal and Rice (for the predictability factor with my threesome).<br /><br />Things just got better, however, when I realized that my Amazon Prime membership allows me to order a thirty-bound bag for second-day delivery at no cost (in fact, it usually arrives the next day) at a price lower than what I was paying locally.<br /><br />This has allowed me to move to a just-in-time delivery service, which cuts down on the storage needs and may be attractive for other owners of multiple and/or large dogs.

review/summary: Dog loves it; no tummy problems, but I've eased the transition
review/text: I've been feeding my dog (75 pound Golden mix, about 5 years old) Canidae for 3-4 days now, and she absolutely loves it! She's always been a picky eater, often ignoring food in her bowl, but she laps this up as soon as I put it in.  I've been mixing it with her old food to ease her into the transition.  For the first two days I did 75% old food, 25% Canidae.  Today I've done half and half.  No tummy problems.  If anything she seems to have more energy.  The only thing is that now I have to really police how much food I give her, whereas with her old food I knew she would only eat it if she were hungry. But I'm happy she's happy! I'm also happy to have found a food that seems to be much better quality, and for a price that's within my tight budget.

review/summary: Great Quality Dog Food
review/text: My Boxer have tried various dog foods. He started with Nutro as a puppy but after a year, he started not liking his food so we switched to Science Diet. After much research, found that Science Diet did not use the quality products... so we switched to Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Adult Dog food. My dog loved the food but realized he had allergies to one of the ingredients. So we changed to Canidae and he loves this and has no allergies.<br /><br />When My husband and I researched good quality dog food, we found a lot of great quality dog food and most of them were pretty pricy but we found Canidae and Chicken Soup to be the best quality for a good price. I would recommend Canidae Lamb Meal and Brown Rice to any dog owners. My dog has been on it for about 6 months now and its been great!

review/summary: Excellent for large breed dogs
review/text: Our Rhodesian Ridgebacks were on this food some years back and we moved, thus losing access to it at the new location. I am very glad to see Amazon carrying Canidae and that it's available using the Prime Membership! We have fed many, many dogs the Canidae when we we were fostering rescue dogs (an average of 3 new dogs a month for years) and it was the only food NONE of them ever had any trouble eating & digesting. Our own pack has a couple of members with soy allergies, so I'm careful about what we feed. They have been back on the Canidae for a few months now with no drama at all. The switch from their old food back to the Canidae was easy and stress free and all 6 dogs scarf it down like it was prime rib. (or you know...a squirrel) Even my father's Chihuahua likes it and that little diva used to think she could only eat human food! I have been able to cut back by a half cup on the daily ration for our largest dog as he was putting extra weight on with his previous amount from the old food. Everyone's coat is soft and shiny, they all have loads of energy and are generally in excellent overall health - that doesn't happen with the grocery store bargain foods. Again, I am VERY VERY glad to see the big bags of Canidae available from Amazon!!

review/text: Our dog loves this brand. We used their Chicken & Rice formula for about a year & decided to switch to the Lamb & rice one after our dogs interest-level started going down. How did we find out?  We realized that over time we have been mixing more treats in her food to get her to eat it  (This with only 2 meals a day!)<br /><br />Our dog definitely preferred lamb over the chicken, no more treat mix-in's, only pure dog-food!<br /><br />We = Canidae fans for life!

review/text: I should've done more research before buying this product. My dog seemed to have very little appetite when she was on this food. She had skin problems. She had loose stools. Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food. I finally decided to look into it after months of trying to get her to eat it more regularly and found that my problems weren't uncommon with this food. I've since switched her to Blue Buffalo food and her skin problems have gotten better, she has become more energetic, her stools are no longer loose and she happily eats.

Canidae seemed to fit the criteria and was available at my local pet store (whereas, the brand I was feeding, Evo, had to be ordered), so I wanted to try it.  I've been feeding my dog three and a half cups of Canidae dry dog food daily (divided between two feedings) for about five weeks, and she has lost a significant amount of weight on this diet.  She is a very active dog that has always been lean, but she is now too skinny. I will be switching back to Evo and would not recommend Canidae.

review/text: I've purchased a couple of cases of 20 ounce cokes in the past year.  At that time, Amazon was selling them so when they would have a sale, they were a great buy.  Unfortunately, Amazon is no longer carrying them and, as you can see, the shipping cost from the vendor is more than what the cokes cost.  As a result, instead of costing less than a dollar each (great price!), the shipping cost added in makes them cost about $2.00 each.  Outrageous!  The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of one is because I love the taste of the product...

My dogs love it, I no longer have to mix my own ingredients together, and I have peace of mind knowing my beloved pets are being fed high-quality food.  They devour every last particle!

review/text: This is one food that when mixed with their dry food, my dogs will eat every last drop. They love this. Our older dog (just turned 2) needs to be on a grain free diet, so that is what our puppy gets too. I love that this is 95% Turkey and that the dogs really like it.

review/summary: My Yorkie Likes It, So I Like It
review/text: My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: This is the ONLY food my dog will eat
review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/summary: Great for hiding medication.
review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

review/text: I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

review/summary: Good value and fast shipping
review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Great food topper for my dogs
review/text: I have been feeding this to my 1 year old maltese and 4 month old chihuahua. I mix this in with their dry food and they both enjoy it a lot. It's a great deal buying from amazon compared to buying it at a pet store.<br /><br />The only down side is this food does dry up after leaving it out for 5-10 minutes.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

Our family really believes that high quality food is important for a long and healthy life; we try to avoid all fillers and by-products. Our dog loves this formula, which we use one spoon of along with his dry food at each meal.<br /><br />For his size and diet I find that the small cans are more convenient since they last him so long.

review/text: This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!

I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.

review/summary: Root beer? It could use some reformulation.
review/text: I've tried the original Splenda version of this syrup, and it did taste like root beer, even if it did have an odd aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, I can't say the same of the finished product with the Sparkling Natural root beer syrup. I've made multiple batches using filtered water, using syrup to the fill line of the cap and beyond - and it still ends up tasting like tea.<br /><br />Yes, you can taste a hint of root beer in all of that tea flavor, but on the whole it is a weak one. I can't say if it's the carmelized sugar that's throwing off the taste, or if they just didn't get the proportions right for the flavoring, but this is a syrup I'll have to pass on in the future.<br /><br />But who knows, SodaStream could have a new winner on its hands - carbonated herbal tea.

review/summary: Natural soda, no-artifical taste and no aftertaste!
review/text: I love my Sodastream and primarily use it to create sparkly water or flavored water with the unsweetened, all-natural essences. But sometimes a girl wants a bit more flavor.<br /><br />Enter Root Beer Natural.<br /><br />To start, it's made from cane sugar; which I prefer to corn syrup or Splenda and it doesn't have any additional artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners. As previously mentioned, the root beer taste is not knock-you-over intense, but with the Sodastream, I can adjust it to the exact water/flavor mix I want! If you're looking for a very strong root beer taste, I'd recommend Virgil or Boylan. They're sold in bottles and are both VERY strong!<br /><br />Second, each 750ml bottle will make 6 liters (approximately 25 8-oz servings) of all-natural soda. At $15, this is far cheaper than the other natural sodas you find at the store (Blue Sky, Thomas Kemper, Hansen, etc).<br /><br />I prefer this natural root beer to the other soda flavors I've tried from Sodastream and will buy it again!

review/summary: Terrible Root Beer
review/text: I was pretty excited to see this product recently at a local store, because I like root beer quite a bit.  My wife and I greatly enjoy our Soda Stream machine, and have been fairly satisfied with most of the syrups that we have purchased, but we do prefer sugar sweetened drinks to ones that include Sucralose, which all of the standard soda stream flavors have.<br /><br />Having said all of that, I regret buying this flavor.<br /><br />This syrup has a weak taste.  Even adding more syrup does not help.  Additionally I can't taste any of the hints of nutmeg, allspice, or other spicy flavors that a good root beer should have.  I happened to look at the label and see that the product was developed in Israel.  Maybe they should have had some Americans help them develop the flavor since apparently the nice folks in Israel don't know what root beer is supposed to taste like.  I have sampled literally dozens of different root beers over the years, including many of the boutique ones that are sweetened with cane sugar.  This one ranks on the bottom as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />They should reformulate it.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the dispenser cap is of a particular awful design for pouring the large amount of syrup needed into the Soda Stream carbonator bottle.  Would it kill soda stream to develop a bottle that had a built in spout on the cap for easier dispensing of the product?<br /><br />Also, considering that you get only the equivalent of about 18 12 ounce "cans" worth of product in this $10 bottle it is questionable if you are really saving anything over buying decent quality product at your local grocer.  Whole Foods for example has a really good quality root beer that is sweetened with cane sugar, tastes 100X better than this one and costs about $3.99 for a six pack.

review/summary: Great to me..
review/text: I tried this rootbeer flavor not expecting much.  I was surprised to taste that it was much better than I thought.  It was foamy and pleasant tasting and to me is much better than the common stuff you buy in cans, which mostly comes kind of flat.  I will never buy cans of rootbeer anymore.<br /><br />Is it as good as the "gourmet" craft types you find in the glass bottles etc? No, but it is a great alternative to the mainstream cans you get filled with crappy HFCS, and you can fizz it up more than those (I am kind of a fizz fiend!)for a foamy fizzy treat.<br /><br />I do have to disclose that I am using the "crystal" Sodastream version which has smaller, glass bottles.  This results in the flavor being plenty strong enough.  With the larger plastic bottle versions the flavor may be weak as some said, I don't know. I suggest to try it at least once, and try to make as strong as possible if you have the larger bottle Sodastream unit.

I like tea, and have drank mostly brewed teas, and this taste nothing like a brewed tea.  Maybe one of the canned teas.<br />But to me Its not bad, better then the splenda version.  if I got the same yield per bottle I would consider getting it again, even though it would be 2x the cost.<br />And yes its a pain to keep it in the fridge, fill the big cap to full and try to pour it into the soda stream bottle without spilling it, and trying to pour slowly so it wont fizz over.  So cost and convenience are not gonna cut it for this product.<br />But the taste isnt too bad.

review/summary: Decent Root Beer (Add More Syrup!)
review/text: I agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that you must add more syrup than recommended to achieve a good root beer taste. At first, I thought this syrup was disgusting. There seemed to be a watered down "tea" taste to the product as another reviewer had stated. I decided to add more syrup as recommended and surprisingly the taste improved. Not the best root beer I have ever had, but certainly as good as some of the popular brands at the grocery store. And much much much better than the normal sodastream root beer flavor that had that awful splenda aftertaste.

review/text: Been waiting for this product to come along. The previous versions with all of the artificial sweeteners did not interest me at all. We have the SodaStream with the glass bottles, which hold less fluid, and so I think we get more intense flavor than other reviewers because we are adding more syrup per ounce of water when we add a full cup of the syrup. I actually think it tastes very much like root beer, and will purchase this product again.

So my new idea is to put a little honey on a tablespoon. Then you pour some sesame seeds on the honey and eat. Sesame seeds are high in phytosterols which can help you lower your LDL cholesterol. I also use these toasted sesame seeds in a granola recipe which is quite good. I've also used these sprinkled over meats or you might like them in salads.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Just tried this item and found it lacking in flavor and oil. The best flavor I have found is buying the sesame in the store as a 2-3 oz plastic package and toast them in my toaster oven.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YGSFA">Sun Luck - Toasted Sesame Seeds 3.75 Oz.</a>

review/summary: Very Versatile Molecular Gastronomy Sampler Kit
review/text: This kit includes a great selection of popular agents in molecular gastronomy that are sure to please the trendy chef looking to take his/her cooking or pastry skills to the next level. As the enclosed phamplet states, this kit is for the "art of molecular cuisine" and it is most definitely an art worthy of exploration. It's kind of an science kit that lets you create incredibly creative food for artistic presentation. Very cool.<br /><br />Each agent comes in a nice 50 gram size so you have plenty of opportunity to try different techniques before deciding which agents you want to buy in larger sizes. The agents allow you to experiment with transformation (transforming high-fat liquids into powders), spherification (such as making fruit caviar), thickening, emulsification (dispursing liquids into fats, mostly) and gelification (creation of both soft and hard gels). It also comes with a small kit for storing the samples.<br /><br />I am impressed with the quality of the agents in this kit as well as quantity provided for experimenting. I'm even more impressed with the incredibly quick shipping by Artistre. I'm looking forward to further experimentation with the included agents, as well as trying a few items not in the kit - like the carbonating and foaming/aerating agents.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this kit for anyone looking to try the art of molecular gastronomy. It's definitely worth it.

review/summary: A great, comprehensive starter kit
review/text: This kit comes with pretty much everything you need to get started in the molecular gastronomy world.  You get 50g of each additive, which is just about perfect.  Since most solutions are 1-2% by weight, this gives you plenty to help you get over a learning curve, create some dishes, and become familiar with each component.  It's much easier to gauge what you need to reorder (and how much) once you have this basic understanding.  Each additive is labeled for easy identification, and a guide that provides a brief overview is included for reference.<br /><br />The packaging is great as well -- each ingredient comes in a resealable pouch, and all of your pouches come in a small little cooler for storage (about 12"x12"x12").  Be sure to purchase some scales if you are already not equipped with them to go with your kit as well.  You will absolutely need a scale accurate to at least 0.1g.  You will also need a kitchen scale to measure the larger solutes (such as water) as almost all scales accurate to 0.1g cannot handle heavy loads.<br /><br />In all, this is a great buy.  I am very pleased with it and the quality of the additives.

review/summary: Awesome Products, Great Deal
review/text: This is a great deal. They give enough of each product to try multiple things with each chemical.  They give you the chemicals to make foams, airs, gels, to do spherification, transformations, emulsification and thickening.  Fun to experiment with, but also has very practical uses, especially for gourmet food.  Chef Ferran Adr&iacute;a uses molecular gastronomy in his food, so does Wiley DuFresne.

review/summary: Super fun, great packaging
review/text: I wanted to post a review because this product is such a great kit. I was very surprised when it arrived and it was packaged in an insulated lunchbox/cooler bag. This is in the picture on the right side but it is way nicer in person and I didn't even realize it would be included. The chemicals in the kit are varied and decent amounts to try all sorts of molecular gastronomy experiments. I won't say much for the recipe book since it reads more like a catalog than a recipe book. If you're buying this kit, you're not buying it for a how-to, there are other kits out there for that. This is for people already past the beginner kit and are interested in more intermediate stuff. It also contains no tools, so either find your own or buy a different kit if you want tools.<br /><br />I haven't yet used the chemicals, but they are packaged well in reclosable bags and have more than enough to do a wide range of experiments. I will post an update if I find anything to be subpar or with more information after I play with it some more.<br /><br />Side note: I am giving this as a gift and am very pleased with the lunchbox/cooler thing because it makes for a much nicer gift than if it were a box of bags of chemicals as I had originally expected. I know the gift recipient is going to love it and be impressed with it. It looks more expensive than it is.

review/summary: Perfect starter for a budding molecular gastronomist.
review/text: Has various reagents that are useful. I have made caviar from various fruit juices (and even Gatorade) with the spherification chemicals, and I have done other unusual things such as making Nutella powder with the maltodextrin. Very fun to experiment with, and the results are quite impressive when made for friends. I would suggest buying a small scale and a set of basic laboratory glassware to go along with this.

review/summary: The perfect molecular gastronomy starter kit!
review/text: This experimental kit is the perfect option if you already have a lot of kitchen tools and only need the powders and substances to start experimenting with molecular gastronomy.  The other leading starter kits in this realm include tools you might not need, like an eye dropper or a scooping spoon.<br />The Experimental Kit Artistre comes with a good supply of every basic ingredient you would need in a molecular gastronomy recipe.  There's plenty to try numerous experiments, and the products are all of good quality.  My first attempt at any experimenting, making balsamic vinegar spheres, was a huge, delicious success.<br />Great starter kit for beginners!

review/summary: Good Buy
review/text: I examined all the starter kits, and I found this one the most interesting<br />although it does not bring equipment in itself for the making of spheres<br />and what not, it does bring what you need to make them.<br /><br />Would have loved to have a booklet with instructions, and just take off from there,<br />but that was not the case. I received a convinient bag, with a booklet that gives brief<br />explinations of the products Artistre has to offer, even if they are not inside the kit.<br />If you want to make something youre gonna have to do research else where, but that was fine<br />with me, considering I'm a culinary student doing her own experiments at home. A little<br />research did no harm.<br /><br />I really like this product, the amount is good to start with, and it has about 12 powders to<br />use. I have yet to be able to make spheres, since there are no instructions it has given me a hard<br />time. But my foams have turned out great!<br /><br />I do recommend this product. Even without the gear, you can make up your own quite easily without<br />the need of having complicated appliances.
