review/summary: Too fine for loose tea
review/text: I was very disappointed when this tea arrived.  It is too fine to use in most of my tea making devices, and that is disappointing.  It seeped through 3 different infusers, making the tea not-drinkable.  I was able to make it using some paper t-sacs, and it tasted pretty good.  I just prefer my loose tea to be in leaf form, like the Twinnings Earl Grey is.  Because I prefer using infusers and I hate using t-sacs, and I didn't pay much for it, I'm sadly considering dumping it out and using the tin to store other tea.

review/text: I used this tea for the first time today and it is like a fine powder.  I have an infuser that has very very fine holes and it still went right through them and into my cup.  I love the Twinings tea but this is not useable and I will have to throw it out.

review/summary: Really small packets
review/text: The taste is coffee-like but these packets are very small . Each packet is good for 150ml water or around a 5oz drink . For comparison , the Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee packet makes a 500ml drink . One box of 6 Mazel Iced coffee=900ml total , one box of 6 Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee=3000ml total . If you buy the Mazel , make sure that you are not paying more than you would for premium brands of instant iced coffee .

review/summary: Black and White Cookies
review/text: The best cookies ever! I ordered them directly from the cookie company Joey's in New Jersey the second time, and saved a bundle of money. Cookies are of a cake-like consistency with chocolate icing on one half, vanilla on the other. Eat more than three of these large cookies at one sitting, and you might feel sick from the sugary rich ingredients! Far better tasting than Entenmann's you find at the grocery store! Highly recommend these cookies as gifts!

review/summary: MUMMMM MUMMM GOOD
review/text: On my first trip to New York, my clients purchased a table full of black and white cookies for me.  I never had a black and white cookie.  My first time seeing one was on Seinfeld.  I ate one and was hooked.  I searched high and low for a local bakery that sold them outside of New York.  I was very disappointed when I could not find one bakery that sold them.  I finally decided that I would just order some from New York.  We ordered some from Angle's Bakery.  I took one bite and was still deeply disappointed.  It was thick, very dry and so stale that I didn't even finish it.  YUCK!<br /><br />I talked so much about how much I wanted a black and white like the first one I had that my brother-in-law decided that he would find one for me.  He ordered me a dozen directly from Joey's.  Upon opening the package, I noticed the stark difference between the first order and the ones from Joey's immediately.  They were thinner, the icing and cookie part of it looked fresher.  The first bite quickly took me back.  I loved them.  They were moist and pretty tasty.  I've only tried two places so I cannot say Joey's are the best one's online but I'm sure they are very competitive.  I will certainly be re-ordering these in the near future.  If you are itching for a black and white cookie outside of New York you will find that these will hit the spot.  Like some of the other reviews, I would order them directly from Joey's as you get more bang for your buck.  You get a dozen from Joey's directly for the same price as a few on Amazon.<br /><br />To make a long story short, these are YUMMY!

review/summary: AWESOME new concept!
review/text: Loved the idea of pairing cookies with wine as soon as I saw this new concept and line of products from Cookies and Corks.  I am not a sweets fan at all, but the Sea Salt Chocolate Oatmeal cookies are the best cookie I have ever eaten!  The crispy cookie with just a hint of sea salt is amazing.  Pair them with a little bubbly and you have a party!  The Zesty Lemon is my husbands favorite, and the Parmesan Thyme are perfectly savory.  Lucky for me that they don't sell them in bulk or I'd weigh 400lbs!  A great new product...try some!  And too bad Oprah's going off the air this year, I can see her choosing this as one of her Favorite Things!

review/summary: Snickerdoodle Cookies
review/text: I have to say that I was not very impressed with the cookie mix. I'm not a baker, and I freely admit that I could have goofed in the preparation somewhere along the line, but it seemed to me that I was following the instructions to the letter and still ended up with these little half dollar size hockey pucks. The dough was in the same size as when I scooped it out to put on the baking pan, without expanding at all. They tasted okay, but I wouldn't say they were good. I still have some of the mix, and I will try again. If it's successful next time I'll come back and re-review the product, but as it stands now I wouldn't recommend the mix.

review/text: I bought this zucchini to take on a hike-which is the only reason I would ever pay so much for just one oz of zucchini.  The problem, is that at least a third of it was powder!!  It had been crushed in delivery.  Maybe others will get lucky, but the only way I can see this not being a problem is if they put it in a box for delivery.  Bubble wrap only protects against scratches-not crushing.

review/summary: Convenient & tasty
review/text: I recently bought an 8 ounce home popper and had read favorable reviews about the pre-packaged kernels, coconut oil, and salt packets.  After scouring Amazon and reading the reviews, I finally settled on Great Northern.<br /><br />The packaged shipped immediately within a day of purchase and arrived on schedule.  Be warned that based on the climate in your area, the oil portion in the packets may be solidified or liquid.  Regardless, it melts instantly in a hot kettle if you receive it solid.<br /><br />As for the taste, I was not disappointed one bit.  Some reviews have mentioned that it is too salty, but I found it just right.  I do prefer salty foods, though.  Based on the look of it, I thought it would turn the popcorn a ridiculous yellow hue, but it didn't.  The taste was exactly like you'd get at the theater or ballpark and it was not too greasy.  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to make theater style popcorn at home.

review/summary: Great results --movie theater popcorn at home!
review/text: After reading reviews I purchased the 2.5 oz. pkgs. of Great Northern Popcorn. It popped up nicely.  Very few "old maids". I did notice that a lot of moisture gathered on the sides of our popper (the Waring WPM25 model) during the popping process so I pulled the tray of popcorn out promptly. I could see if you left it in the machine, even for a few minutes, that the popcorn could absorb the moisture and lose its crunchy texture.<br />I will definitely buy this product again.

review/summary: Better than theater popcorn
review/text: I think the Wabash Valley Farms portion packs taste the most like the popcorn I get in my local theaters, but the Great Northern Popcorn Company's Portion Packs taste the best.  Using the full portion of flavored salt does make it too salty for my taste so I use just 3/4 of the portion amount (the 4-Oz. portion pack contains exactly 1 teaspoon of flavored salt).  I've also found that the 6-Oz. portion packs work just fine in my 4-Oz. Maxi-Matic Table-Top Popper, better suited to movie night party quantities.

review/summary: Nothing like real carnival style popcorn
review/text: With all the rave reviews, coupled with the fact that these pre-packs include all the right ingredients, I assumed the  result would be at least 75% authentic carnival style popcorn for my popcorn maker. After all, I have used packs like this for over 10 years (at a previous employers Ag Equipment business), of which was amazing!  This product is not. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it about a 2. It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself. So if you're used to buying cheap jiffy-pop, over the stove style popcorn, this would be better. I Would not recommend.

review/text: I like that these packages are just the right size for 1-2 people and that there are very few unpopped kernels.  This does taste a lot like the popcorn at the movies.  If you like your popcorn very salty, this is the product for you!  However, I don't!  I like more butter flavor and only a little salt.  It's simple enough to snip off a small corner of the popcorn side of the packet and pour out most of the salt.  Unfortunately, out of the 20 packets I bought, six of them were not separated properly and the salt and kernels mixed with the oil, so I am stuck with the six overly salty bowls of popcorn.  I really wish this company made a low salt or unsalted version of these packs.  I'd definitely buy more if I didn't have to taste all that salt!

I've purchased other brands and they all have an expiration date printed on back each pack.  These had no expiration dates printed, therefore there was no way of knowing how old these were or how long they have been in their stock. I popped the jolly time brand and it popped perfectly.  I also find that this is on the list of things that can't be returned per Amazon.com policy.  I'm going to purchase the Jolly time popcorn at Smart & Finals. Cheaper and there fresh!!!

review/text: My family loves the taste of the popcorn and our guest love the fact that I have a popcorn machine that I proudly display in our bar area of our home. When I say it taste better than movie popcorn is that when you couple our popcorn machine with a high quality popcorn product like Great Northern, you get a complete balanced salt, butter and movie popcorn flavor. Don't go cheap on the popcorn and you will never buy microwave popcorn again. Great Northerns 6 oz popcorn bag comes premeasured and you will never have to add salt or additional butter to get the movie taste that we are all after. Plus the upside, unlike movie popcorn where you go to that giant butter machine,squirt that liquid death over the top part of yor popcorn only to find that it never reaches the bottom of the bag. This has the same great taste without making you feel like a short order cook at McDonalds and each kernal taste just like the first. I am a part time chef (fulltime banker:)), I will never buy any other popcorn product again after eating this.  Kuddo's to Great Northern for a fantastic and consistantly GREAT product!

review/summary: Updated Review
review/text: Had to rescind my previous review, I finally figured out why the popcorn was not working properly.  I got the Paramount Entertainment popcorn maker with the 6 oz kettle.<br /><br />Here's the right way to pop this corn in the 6 oz version, take exactly half of the three ingredients and put them in and THEN when they are done do the other half.  No more 60% old maids anymore, thing is the bag seems sized to the 8 0z hopper and its just too much for the 6oz at once so alot wasnt popping.  Doing half at a time changed everything, very good popcorn!

review/summary: Ok in a pinch, but found better alternative
review/text: Got this to go along with the Maxi-Matic 4oz machine.  It gets the 3 stars just because of everything being pre-packaged.  I didn't care for the flavor of the popcorn and found it not buttery and overly salty.  Will try to not dump all of the salt in next time.<br /><br />I found a better alternative was using a product called Butter-it which I purchased a gallon of through a local restaurant since it is sold by Sysco. It is a soybean oil base so it's liquid. Use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 heaping cup of kernals and if you want add a splash of salt and it is the best popcorn I have ever had....well, it is the same as in the pub I got the oil from, but still the best.

review/summary: Stale Popcorn
review/text: We are disappointed with the Great Northern popcorn for our new machine.<br />It seems stale.....and 'chewy'.<br />We have a popcorn machine up north and it pops beautifully and tastes like theater popcorn.<br />However, the popcorn we have just received seems old.  We're very disappointed....and wind up not making popcorn very often.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was very excited to try this popcorn given all the rave reviews.  Like another reviewer, however, I am disappointed by the amount of unpopped corn.  I did three batches in my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCPXBG">Maxi-Matic EPM-450 Elite Tabletop Old-Fashioned 4-Ounce Kettle Popcorn Popper Machine</a>.<br /><br />There was over a third of the popcorn left unpopped in each of those batches.  I was afraid it was my new popper so decided to try it in my old Stir Crazy popper.  This time there was about 1/4 of unpopped kernels but at least a full cup of poorly popped corn (tiny, tough pieces).<br /><br />So I tried some old Orville Redenbacher's I had in the pantry in the new popper.  Almost all of it popped with only about a tablespoon of unpopped kernels.<br /><br />The flavor of the Great Northern was wonderful and what DID pop was crunchy and not at all soggy.  I don't know if I was sent old product (I couldn't find an expiration date anywhere) but I won't be ordering it again.

review/summary: Popcorn
review/text: We have purchased this popcorn twice. It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this.

review/summary: Perfect movie theater popcorn!
review/text: These packets are all you need to achieve the perfect movie theater popcorn experience!  If you love popcorn like we do look no further!  It's not to greasy and is a little on the salty side but it only makes you want to eat more!  To make, just follow the instruction on the packet by pre-heating the pot then dumping the contents in.<br /><br />The packets are divided into a solid oil side and a kernel/salt side.  If you want to reduce the salt content, Just pinch the bottom of the packet where the salt is, holding some of the salt back from going into the pot.  Although, our family loves it just the way it is!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product as I will be buying more soon through Amazon.com!

review/summary: Great for the price
review/text: I've been buying this popcorn on the subscription program for the last 1.5 years. Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of "Old Maid" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern brand in a Great Northern popcorn machine.<br /><br />If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels, you may want to avoid this brand, unless of course, it costs 25% more $.

review/summary: I love this product
review/text: I have used about 5 or 6 boxes (24 count) of this brand and have really liked the flavor and the the freshness in every order that I received. I have only tried one other brand and thought it was stale and did not like the flavor. For me it is not to salty in fact I add a little salt before I pop it. I use one or two a day and always have a bowl of popped corn out for my grand kids. When ever they come over they always head to the snack shack (a little stand alone cupboard)for a treat. We try to have healthy treats but I think the pop corn is probably more healthy than the granola bars,crackers,cookies or dried fruit snacks and they seem to like the pop corn best. The only problem or maybe a benefit is that I have to floss a lot more.

review/text: Purchased this to use with a popcorn machine and while the machine had to be returned the popcorn itself is good. My kids loved it and thought the house smelled like the local movie theatre. Its easy to prepare and the taste is great. No extra butter or salt was needed it was perfect for our family. We just have to find a decent machine to use it with...until then we'll just use the stove.

review/summary: not movie theater popcorn
review/text: This popcorn is not the same as movie theater popcorn. If you have ever been to target and tried the popcorn that they sell at the little target snack bar it the same as that but ten times saltier. I recommend only outing half of the packet of salt. I am the tips of guy that eats super salty popcorn but this was way to much. Instead of buying this you should buy coconut oil, and kernals from the store, it ends up to be cheaper and tast allot more like movie theater popcorn

Decided to try this for a party and it made a world of difference.  Tasted just like fresh popped corn at the theater.  The packs were easy to use.  Just cut across the top and dump all 3 packets into the heated popper.  I will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Great popcorn.  My family and I love watching movies and eating popcorn.  We consume more popcorn during the fall and winter months.  We received this popcorn and quickly made our first batch.  Wow.......It was great.  We made the mistake of not mixing everything together (oil, popcorn, and buttery salt).  That was our fault because we didn't read the instructions due to excitement.  But our first batch was still very good (a little salty because we added the salt mix last).  We made another batch two days later and it was awesome.  This is as close to theater popcorn made in our house ever.  It was really, really good.  Every kernell popped and it was a perfect balance.  We will NEVER, and I mean NEVER buy microwave or store popcorn again....We will be placing another order very soon.  I almost forgot to mention that we bought the 8oz bags.  That was enough for a large bowl which will feed 2-3 of us.  Can't wait to order another batch.....Enjoy

review/summary: Pretty Good Flavor
review/text: This stuff is great. I use it in my whirley pop and it makes perfect popcorn. Flavor is pretty darn close to movie theater. Everyone in my family loves this stuff. I do like a bit more salt on my popcorn but this can be a bit too salty even for me. I cut the salt pack open before the rest and take out the salt. I would say I use about half to 3/4 what comes in the pack. Then I cut the rest of the pack open and dump it all in. This is about the right amount of salt for me. The only problem is the salt is butter flavored so you loose a bit of flavor doing this. I'd say make a batch like normal first and then adjust the salt to taste if needed. That's an easy fix. I save the salt and then I use it for future popcorn making without the kit.<br /><br />If I can find some smaller sample packs to try of other brands, I may look into that in the future when it's time to order more. But if I don't ever find anything else, this stuff is pretty good.

review/summary: closest to theatre style popcorn
review/text: Really good tasting popcorn, best I have tasted yet. A bit salty in my opinion. Just a hint, when making popcorn in theatre style poppers, always pre heat the kettle, it avoids soggy corn which sticks together. Fact is, the only thing that makes theatre corn better, is what's used in the preperation, meaning your oil and seasoned salt. You can make just as good as popcorn on a cheap popcorn maker with the proper ingredients.

review/summary: For grandkids,,,, easy really great healthy snack
review/text: We just got the Great Northern Princeton popper a few weeks ago and also sent a 24 count prepackaged case of the Great Northern 8oz pop corn. The kids (11 and 6) really love it... They actually do the popping themselves. I have just ordered the auto buy/shipping option for having them delivered every 3 months. Got a 15% discount to do it and makes it really convenient and saved a bit also. The kids have raved about the popcorn and the popper also,,,so its been a rally good deal for us. This popcorn is very healthy for the kids (Check out the actual info about the product with Coconut oil). If there are any problems in the future I will amend this rating. Hears hoping that this works out well.

review/summary: Poppin' Good Northern Popcorn!
review/text: I have a commercial type popcorn popper in my man cave garage. I entertain a lot. I have tried to measure out my own popcorn but tired of that, so started buying Northern Popcorn packs a number of years ago. It always pops perfect and tastes great. Its always a hit. I highly recommend. OH, And if you want less salt, just cut back on that portion. I tried other brands of packets and they were way too salty. I personally like the recipe Great Northern uses. Keep poppin' my friends.

review/summary: Ballpark Popcorn in my Kitchen! Woo-hoo!
review/text: I enjoyed the popcorn at our minor league ballpark so much that I was craving it even when we weren't heading to the games! Then we moved, and I admit I panicked a little bit - great addictive popcorn is 'few and far between'. I sent email to the ballpark, and the concessions manager gave me all the information about the brand of popcorn they were using. It was very exciting to find out I could order the same all-n-one packs from Amazon!<br />I have been thrilled with the 2.5-ounce size... it's the perfect size for a popcorn loving snacker. More than one snacker? Open 2 or 3 packs! Easy to make on the stovetop or microwave. I'm back to order more!!

review/summary: Dan's Perfect Popcorn
review/text: Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.

review/summary: Movie theatre popcorn from the microwave at home!
review/text: I looked at the old fashioned pop corn poppers (you know, the red cart and metal popper), but those looked like they would be a lot of work to keep clean as well as take up counter space I don't have. However, I still really wanted "movie theater" or "carnival/fair" popcorn. So I got the Presto popcorn popper that goes in the microwave and works either with or without oil. If you get the 2.5oz size pack of Northern popcorn, you can easily split it in half and make 2 batches. (The Presto popper is too small for a 2.5oz pkg all at once.) This stuff tastes great. Yeah, I know palm oil is horrible for your heart etc. etc., but THAT is what makes all that fake buttery taste so yummy. Like another reviewer said, the salt packet is a quite salty so I only used half (maybe even less) the salt for all of the popcorn in each packet. After looking at several online distributors, at $18.95 (subscription price) Amazon has the best price. 4 1/2 stars

review/summary: Perfect movie night popcorn
review/text: WOW.  This popcorn is delicious.  We purchased a large 4oz popcorn machine for our game room family movie nights.  When it first arrived, I wanted to try it immediately.  So, I bought some Orville's at the store and I was disappointed with both the number of popped kernels and the taste.  After the Great Northern popcorn arrived, I was immediately hooked on the flavor and ease of use.  The packages are easy to use and the product tastes great.  Our family only uses about half of the salt flavoring and can not tell a difference in quality of the taste.  My son says it tastes better than at the movies.  Now when we go out to see a movie, we keep the popcorn bag and replicate the experience at home!

No worries about whether you have too much oil, too little popcorn, etc.  It includes the buttered flavoring in powdered form.  But you can also not use the flavoring if you prefer....and use your own if you want to change it up.  I highly recommend this product and am ready to purchase my next 24 pack!

When we first purchased our Lincoln Popper from Discount Tommy, I thought I would just make my own blend of salt, butter and other spices.  But I could never get it just right.  After trying Great Northern's theater popcorn, I thought, "Why?"  Not only is the flavor perfect, but the price is right!<br /><br />I love the subscription program with Amazon.  Not only do you receive a discount, but they will automatically send you your popcorn at intervals that you choose.  I'll NEVER run out of popcorn again!!!  Thanks Discount Tommy and Amazon.com.

review/summary: Popcorn Lovers Take Notice
review/text: When I read about Great Northern Popcorn packs, I was skeptical.  I thought it was just another gimmick to get me to buy everything prepackaged at a premium price.  After all, popcorn is all the same, right?  My wife insisted that we try it and I am glad we did.  If you love movie theater popcorn, this will be the closest you will get to making it at home.  I tried others and they just do not compare.  I am not sure if it is the type of oil they use, the type of salt, or the popcorn itself, but this popcorn is second to none.  Also, everything is conveniently measured out for you, so this makes the task of making popcorn so much simpler.  If you try it, you may be surprised how much more popcorn you start to eat!

review/text: I had just finished a Theater room in my house and decided the only thing missing was the popcorn! I searched and bought what I thought was the perfect machine and added the gourmet oil and popcorn, turned on the movie and sat back for the movie.  To my surprise, it just wasn't the same, no flavor, not even the smell was the same.  So I searched the web and discovered Great Northern Popcorn in pre-measured portion packs.  It was easy, and the result was just like I had dreamed, fresh great tasting popcorn, with the smell of a movie theater.  I highly recommend Great northern Popcorn for any event and any machine, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: THE popcorn for movie theater popcorn lovers
review/text: I am one of those people who MUST have popcorn when I go to a movie. Many times, its my favorite part of the movie.<br /><br />So, I finally bought a movie style popcorn popper because I didnt like the taste of microwave popcorn.<br /><br />When I first got my popcorn popper, I just went to the grocery store, picked up a bag of popcorn, some of that powered popcorn butter flavoring and some vegetable oil. It did the job but, like microwave popcorn, just didnt replicate the taste of movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I searched and read tons of reviews on Amazon and finally decided to order this brand.<br /><br />MY GOD! This IS it! With my first batch, I was blown away by the taste. This tastes exactly like the movie theater popcorn. If not better because you KNOW its fresh.<br /><br />First: The 2.5 ounce packet is enough of a serving for a person. I popped 2 of packets the first time and it was the equivalent of one of those huge buckets you'd get at the theater. I had to share. haha.<br /><br />Second: When I received the box of packets, I thought the oil was going to be a liquid. Its actually a solid. I had first thought I received a old batch but no, thats how its supposed to be.<br /><br />Third: Like the packets tell you... let your popper heat for about 5 minutes, then slide the "solid" oil contents into the popper as well as the corn/salt mix. All at the same time.<br /><br />It takes about 2-3 minutes before the popping starts but it'll pop up a TON of popcorn. And again, the taste. WOW! This is the popcorn I've been looking for.

review/summary: Delicious, Quality Popcorn
review/text: I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!
