review/summary: Awesome - Everyone in the Family Loves These
review/text: My wife is the health nut in the family and for years she has been trying to get us to eat more healthy. Usually that meant chewing on health bars made out of 'wood chips' or some other tasteless matter. Needless to say, they didn't move off the shelf too quickly unless my kids were REALLY STARVING. Anyway, since we purchased these items, everyone in the family has been eating 2 - 3 a day and our teenage daughters are actually taking them to school for lunch / snack - something they never did before.

review/summary: Delicious and very filling
review/text: These bars are delicious! They have a green filling in the center and dark chocolate coating.  (The green center can be disconcerting if it's unexpected.)  The filling is soft and tastes faintly of honey.  The chocolate coating is firmer than the filling, which gives a nice contrast in texture.<br /><br />The total calorie count is on par with most energy bars yet I find this bar stays with me longer than others. Perhaps it's due to the low-glycemic carbohydrates.  The bar's zone-friendly with a 40/30/30 calorie balance.<br /><br />I love these bars and highly recommend them.

review/summary: Such a shame they changed the formula!!!!!
review/text: I was such a fan of the old formula and would stock up and buy boxes at a time.  I have a heavy work and travel schedule and this was the perfect bar for eating "healthy on the go."  Now the calorie and fat content is much higher and the taste has changed for the worse!  I wish the company would go back to the original formula....I am on the hunt for another bar!  Such a shame...it was the best bar on the market!

review/text: These are some of the very best tasting energy bars I've ever had, and they have some of the very best ingredients I've come across so far. I find the chocolate coated bars to be tastier than the natural (because I love chocolate); however, the natural bars are really quite good, too. These bars are soft, easy to chew, have a nice texture, and the chocolate coating is great. Here is a list of all the ingredients for the chocolate bars:<br /><br />Organic medjool dates, organic almond butter, organic quinoa sprout powder, non-gmo soy protein isolate, original GREENS+� powder (non-gmo soy lecithin, organic Hawaiian spirulina, organic apple fiber, barley grass powder, wheat grass powder, Japanese chlorella, hydroponic soy sprouts, organic brown rice bran, sprouted barley malt, alfalfa grass powder, dairy-free probiotics, royal jelly, Montana bee pollen, acerola berry juice, natural vitamin E, licorice root powder, milk thistle extract, echinacea root extract, Siberian Eleuthero root extract, astragalus root extract, licorice root extract, organic red beet juice, dunaliella salina algae, organic Nova Scotia Dulse, organic ginkgo biloba leaf extract, organic Japanese green tea extract, grape seed and skin extract, organic Swedish bilberry extract), organic rice crisps, wildflower honey, mixed tocopherols (natural vitamin E). Chocolate Coating Ingredients: Cocoa butter, barley malt sweetened chocolate, cocoa bean extract.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these bars!!!!

review/text: It's amazing something so healthy can taste so great!  I've been eating Greens Plus Energy Bars (Chocolate covered) for a couple of years - they give you that mid-afternoon boost without the highs and lows of sugar and caffeine while giving you enough nutrition you could skip a meal if you wanted to.  I highly recommend them to health-conscious consumers that need snacks to make it through the day!

review/text: I love these bars!  They have a sweet, full flavor that keeps me satiated for hours - and without much fluctuation in blood sugar (i.e. the slow down associated with digestion or the sugar low a few hours after eating something too sweet).  I enjoy them as both meal replacements (especially when traveling) and as snacks.  These have a mild crunch which adds a welcome bit of texture.

review/text: I'm always on the lookout for food bars like this due to the sake of convenience (fast food that beats Macdonnalds), and this one has it all: good nutrition, great taste, and a reasonable price. If there's a better green food bar out there I'd love to know about it! Thanks for this product...But I'm still hoping that they will make a variation of this bar that contains hemp seed protein rather than soy protein. That would really be a winner.

review/summary: the best organic food bar on the market
review/text: The Greens Plus Chocolate is the best food bar I have tried to date, surpassing even the Organic Food Bar Brand in my opinion.  The main constituents are dates and almond butter, but I feel that this product's effectiveness comes in the herbal supplements that aren't included in most other bars, such as bee pollen, milk thistle and echinacea. PLUS, who can resist the delicious chocolate coating? Whoever formulated this recipe was thinking about pleasing the palette AND improving the immune system, among other things.  It's a real treat and now is more affordable than ever.  I would recommend this to most people who are looking to improve health and increase energy.

review/summary: Further Changes to Formula
review/text: Since ARA posted the great review in 2007 outlining the new changes, there have been additional changes.  The following information is for the Greens+ Chocolate Energy Bar, purchased in May 2011.  I will update as ADA did.  Unless otherwise noted, changes made in 2007 are still in effect in 2011.<br /><br />Old: 162 Cals (45 fat), 5g fat--4 Monounsaturated & 1 polyunsaturated, 32mg Sodium, 18g Carbs--4g Fiber & 12g Sugar, 12g Protein.<br /><br />2007: 240 Cals (80 fat), 8g fat--1 Saturated, 6 Monounsaturated, 75mg Sodium, 32g Carbs--5g Fiber & 23g Sugar, 10g Protein.<br /><br />2011:  250 cals (100 fat), 11g fat--3.5 saturated, 4 monounsaturated (advertises 2g "good fat"), 45mg sodium, 34g carbs--5g fiber & 22g sugar, 10g protein<br /><br />Ingredient list & 2007/2011 changes in parentheses:<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic medjool dates (Organic Dates--CHANGED 2007), organic almond butter, (CHANGED 2011 - 3rd ingredient now organic honey), organic quinoa sprout powder (CHANGED 2011--organic quinoa sprout powder is now listed further down, as noted), non-gmo soy protein isolate, original GREENS+� powder (non-gmo soy lecithin, organic Hawaiian spirulina (Hawaiian Spirulina--CHANGED 2007), organic apple fiber (AppleBoost peel and fiber--CHANGED 2011), barley grass powder (barley grass CHANGED 2007; organic barley grass CHANGED 2011), wheat grass powder (wheat grass--CHANGED 2007; organic wheat grass--CHANGED 2011), Japanese chlorella, hydroponic soy sprouts, organic brown rice bran (brown rice bran--CHANGED 2011), sprouted barley malt, alfalfa grass powder (alfalfa grass--CHANGED 2007; organic alfalfa grass--CHANGED 2011), dairy-free probiotics (REMOVED 2007), royal jelly, Montana bee pollen, acerola berry juice, natural vitamin E, licorice root powder (licorice root--CHANGED 2011), milk thistle extract (milk thistle seed extract--CHANGED 2007), echinacea root extract, Siberian Eleuthero root extract, astragalus root extract, licorice root extract (licorice root powder--CHANGED 2011), organic red beet juice, dunaliella salina algae, organic Nova Scotia Dulse (Nova Scotia Dulse--CHANGED 2011), organic ginkgo biloba leaf extract (ginkgo biloba leaf extract--CHANGED 2011), organic Japanese green tea extract (Japanese green tea extract--CHANGED 2011), grape seed and skin extract, organic Swedish bilberry extract (European bilberry extract--CHANGED 2011), organic rice crisps (organic brown rice crisps with subset of ingredients organic grown rice, organic brown rice syrup, and sea salt--CHANGED 2011), (As of 2011, organic quinoa sprout powder now listed here), wildflower honey (organic honey--CHANGED 2007; 3rd ingredient as of 2011 as noted above), mixed tocopherols (natural vitamin E) (natural mixed tocopherols (vitamin E) - CHANGED 2007). (2011 addition:  Chocolate Coating Ingredients:  Barley malt-sweetened chocolate, cocoa butter, GMO-free soy lecithin, vanilla extract).<br /><br />2011 allergy information:  This product contains almonds, soy and wheat, and is manufactured in a facility that processes peanuts, tree nuts, milk and eggs.<br /><br />I hope you find this information helpful.<br /><br />This is the first time I've tried these bars, but I think I'd prefer the old 162 calorie bars, with half the fat (and no saturated fat) added probiotics and 2 g additional protein, that everyone seemed to think were quite tasty.  These new bars are really good, granted, but at 250 calories each, they can be a dangerous indulgence for my waistline.  I also would love to see a gluten-free product.  Seems do-able if they could just find a substitute for the barley.

review/summary: Higher priced energy/diet bar
review/text: I have been trying various types of energy bars.  Some I recommend, and some I do not recommend.  I added this one to my Listmania list of recommended products, not at the top because the price is significantly higher than other products.  This bar seems to have two features: it fills you up; and it has herbal ingredients that seem to help metabolism.  I can only say that I lost a couple pounds when I tried these.  I would recommend them for maintaining weight, or possibly losing a little, but not for gaining weight.  The Atkins Advantage bars seem to have better protein and fiber content, and no sugar, but are not as filling (and lack the herbal content).  The NuGo Chocolate Blast has relatively high protein and low fat.  Clif Bars have a good mix of essential vitamins and minerals along with protein and fiber.  All of the bars taste good.  So, you have to decide exactly what you want in your diet.

review/summary: excellent nutrition bars
review/text: Unlike other nutrition bars full of sugar and starch, this is the MOST Fantastic bars I've ever had.  I'm diabetic, so I have to be careful of what I eat.  The balance of proteins to carbs is very good, plus the fact that the main carbs in this bar is greens and sea vegetables and some dates, plus soy protein, and some almond butter for fat.<br /><br />The best thing is it is NOT supersweet, but a natural sweetness. I am supersensitive to foods that are man-made and processed, and this is a natural food.  There are no chemicals or processes in it.<br /><br />It is also alkaline based food, so those of you watching your acid/alkaline in your diet and your blood, this is a great thing.<br /><br />It doesn't promote up and down spikes of your blood sugars, but keeps your blood sugar at an even keel.  Less spikes in blood sugar means less insulin means you don't gain weight.<br /><br />This bar has real nutition in it.  This is the only energy bar I will eat now.

review/text: I'm very picky about what I eat. That being said, I could LIVE OFF THESE THINGS !  There are no bad ingredients in these bars and they're delicious !  When people see me eating them they get grossed out because of the green color and they think it might taste horrible.  You taste the almond butter and dates, and all the good stuff in it, and really very little of the greens (but I love the taste of veggies and I wouldn't mind if it did anyway).  I absolutely love them and buy them by the box.  If you love health food, wheatgrass, barley etc., and love the way that stuff makes you feel alive, try these (and the chocolate coating tastes just like the coating on a Ring Ding - mmmmmmm) nice and smooth.  Delish.

review/text: OH MY WORD are you SERIOUS... these were the BEST bars...i take the green drink packets on trips with me...and I eat these bars once or twice sometimes a DAY. IMAGINE MY SURPRISE when i happened to look at the calorie contents... 240!!! for the natural?????? it USED to be 162 have another bar right her to prove it. and the chocolate...used to be 175. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED!!!!<br /><br />That said...if you see this as a meal bar, then great...250 calories for a snack after working out is a little much for a woman like me...but they are amazing taste and no hunger afterwards and you don't crash, really really great.  I just am really disappointed they had the calorie change and no response on their website or to the consumers as to why. I have loyally bought these for a long time....<br /><br />Take the calories into account, but without that context they are the best bars I have ever found, and I feel like I have tried everything!!

review/summary: Hard to find a product that fits you exactly
review/text: Taste:<br />Desirable: creamy texture; slight warmth on tongue, nuttiness; slightly green and filling aftertastes. Might appreciate a little sweetness, but<br />not desirable: overpowering sweetness (kind of like eating honey), drab gooey-sticky texture of each bite with random rice crisp crunch (gooey-down-your-throat chocolate coating). Inside and coating have a slight sweet/sour difference.<br /><br />Reaction: Can't get enough of the desirable because the undesirable are so strong- first sweetness, then gooeyness- 3/4 bar hit that tolerance.<br /><br />Judgement: Replacing a little junk food with a bar of extracts and old processed honey: Great idea, but spending a little time to make snacks yourself instead of fitting individual needs into made products seems better. (they do sell greens+ powder)<br /><br />Same on all other flavors, yogurt more sour and berry burn, chia a little crunchier, chocolate chia and plain green slightly more powdery and sour flavor.<br /><br />Comparisons: W/ Odwalla similar, but odwalla more chewiness, texture, more powdery taste, lighter sweetness. Both kind of taste dead<br />Lara bars: much more sour (a little aggravating) and smooth (some with whole nuts or dried berry chunks), sweetness more pure, also lacks liveliness food should have.<br />gnu bar: similar fiber taste as greens- less chunkiness than odwalla bar, better flavor (less powdery taste) - not craved for nutritional kick.<br />greens bar are densest.<br /><br />Ordered on amazon 10/19 recieved 10/26 from NY-CA. So-far cheapest site/store for greens+.

review/summary: Pretty Darn Good
review/text: I have been put on some medicine that instead of gaining weight like the main side effects suggest, I have been losing weight.  I know, I know - I am soooo lucky.  Right.  I know what it is like to have to exercise to reduce my weight and tone up.  Anyway, I went to my health food store looking for some bars to help me maintain my weight.  I could eat more, but I dont feel like spending all day munching away on stuff and the temptation for junk food is silly.  I had bought about 6 different kinds of bars and each day had one.  This one was the best tasting one (chocolate).  It took care of the chocolate tooth and the nutrition part.  I really like the ingredient list on the ReBar nutrition bars, but I like GP better.  I now eat a rebar for the extra servings of veggies/fruit but I always have a GP bar for breakfast.  I have noticed a better feeling regarding my health and my weight has stabilized.  I read the other negative reviews about the taste.  My son doesn't like them (he's 5) and says they taste like cat food, but he also doesnt like dates, which make up the bulk of the flavor.  So, yes, I can see why one would not like them.  However, like anything else, if you don't like it, at least you tried it and don't eat it again.  It does not have a medicine-y or forest floor/backyard taste, the texture is soft so you don't have to chew it like a cow chews cud, and the chocolate coating is yummy.  I'd go and buy one at a health food store first and see if you like it before ordering a box.  This way, you only spend a couple of bucks versus $20 - $30 for a box.  No harm, no foul.  For those that love it...  YUMMY!

review/summary: Maybe the best bar out there, but not perfect for athletes!
review/text: I have tried enough natural type bars to fill a health food store and without a doubt this is one of the best all around bars, but it is far from perfect. Great taste, but they melt easily during a hot spell or while travelling. But here's the real problem: First the bar uses non-GMO soy isolate (!!!!) as a protein source which many experts believe will alter your hormones profile by lowering testosterone and raising estrogen . . . exactly what a fitness enthusiast or person seeking longevity would not want. It also contains licorice which is on the possible list of supplements that can lower T. Even though the bar has an alkaline ph you might experience heartburn due to the soy isolate. Is it possible the licorice was added to combat the GERD/heartburn as well as enhance the taste? Perhaps, but at what cost?<br /><br />On the positive side I'm not sure I could name a better bar or better tasting bar overall, and again I've tried them all. Most taste terrible or are loaded up with fake sugars like Stevia (billed as being healthy) which a lot of people just can't digest very well.

review/text: These bars are dense with nutrition.  The plethora of organic ingredients reads like a "what to eat" health guide.  And yet, they are still delicious.  Chewy and sweet, covered in chocolate, it's easy to grab one of these when you're on the go as a quick snack or a light meal.  They are also filling.  I will often eat one for breakfast when I'm running out the door.

review/summary: Almost 5 stars but...
review/text: as delicious as these bars are (a little reminiscent of peanut butter cups!), I don't like where they are heading. They are changing the formula somewhat. Tampering with perfection!!! The chcolate coating is getting thinner and thinner so its almost paper thin and sometimes the consistency is a little off.<br />They were perfect about 4 months ago when I thought I would eat these forevever. Now I am starting to look for my next favorite thing! Seems like someone is finding ways to shave costs and the product is starting to suffer.<br /><br />Still - this is by far the best tasting and healthiest guilty pleasure for a fit lifestyle so try it - you are probably not as picky as me!

It is almost impossible to find great tasting and healthy snack bar that has only 162 cal., but my last order was a big surprise! Jump from 162 to 240, much more fat and carbs- WHY? The company should really think twice before such a drastic change without warning!<br /><br />I am truly hoping they will go back to the original version and if you have the same opinion please call the number on the package and let them know!<br /><br />Thank you

review/summary: Agave Nectar = Deadly
review/text: I've enjoyed these Greens + Bars in the past, so I went into the Vitamin Shoppe today, and saw all of the Greens + bars NOW contain Agave Nectar!  Big red flag.  I refuse to put that stuff in my body.  Have you read the latest in nutrition?  Agave Nectar is as unhealthy as High Fructose Corn Syrup.  It might even be worse!  It can cause inflammatory and fatty conditions in the liver, almost as fast as alcohol can.<br /><br />I really think they need to take Agave out of their products immediately.  The old formulation used honey as the main sweetener.  I suppose they wanted to make it vegan friendly, but why not substitute it with Yacon Root Syrup, also known as Tapioca Syrup?  Dr. Mercola uses that in his nutrition bars.  It's low glycemic, has prebiotics, and also contains minerals.  I'd honestly rather see them put SUGAR in their bars than Agave Nectar.  Agave Nectar is a very destructive substance.  It has no place in anyone's diet, or in anyone's bodies.<br /><br />Until they take Agave Nectar out of these bars, I'm never eating another one.

Unfortunately, they neglected to state that the Chocolate covering is sweetened with Raw Cane Syrup, i.e. sugar. I am very careful to avoid cane sugar and so, was disappointed that the ingredient list was incomplete. I rated it one star, because it was not as advertised.

review/summary: texture of glue, strange aftertaste- save your money
review/text: I was compelled to write a review to steer people away from these overpriced and lousy tasting bars.  I am someone who loves the taste of green foods, and takes Green Vibrance and wheatgrass every morning.  But these Green+ bars have a rather vile taste, with a complete lack of texture that disintegrates into glue in the mouth.  Sure, the ingredients list is impressive, but the taste makes them a chore to eat.<br /><br />Steer clear and try the Larabars or Pure Bars, which actually taste wonderful, have less calories, and maintain a vibrant texture from start to finish.<br /><br />These bars are bad....And I like healthy green foods.  Take my word for it.

review/text: I purchased this dog treat from the breeder where I bought my puppy and I'll be the first to say it is amazing.  Not only is it healthy but delcious (well, my puppy seems to think so) Using these as treats I was able to teach her to sit, shake paw, etc in 2 days.  She absolutely loves them and will do anything for them.  She knows exactly where I keep them in the cabinet.  I cut them into small pieces so I can work with her on training and give her a big one when I want to keep her busy.  I recommend these to anyone and everyone!

review/summary: No Need to Duck This Treat
review/text: In the four ounce package are fourteen wraps, chunks of dried sweet potato wrapped in what looks like duck jerky. Inside the package is a small package of moisture absorber, a desiccant, not the kind of addition one normally finds in a food product, pet food or otherwise. The wraps aren't visually appealing to a human, but dogs will only be concerned with the scent and the taste. On the top of the pouch is a tear off strip to open it. A resealable plastic zipper seals the pouch tightly to keep the wraps fresh.<br /><br />Our three girls wear their emotions on their paws and their faces. Thus when each was presented with a duck sweet potato wrap their interest and their excitement were unmistakable. There were no sniffy-sniffy hesitations, no circle walkings, no signs of disinterest and definitely no looks of can't youdobetterthan this. Evie immediately grabbed her wrap between her jaws and began chewing, oblivious to the world. Piper and Bella, the two shih tzus, grabbed their wraps eagerly and slunk off to their respective corners for some private feasting. Piper in particular had a primal transformation, guarding her prize with laid-back ears and a low, stay away growl, hovering over her wrap like a miniature wolf guarding its kill. All three dogs were in a state of ravenous "wrapture" with their treats.<br /><br />I like that these wraps are too chewy for the dogs to finish off quickly, though Evie the vac nonterrier finished hers in half the time as her two little sisters. The duck jerky was eaten first, followed by the sweet potato piece with no lessening of interest or enjoyment. Of all the many treats and chews offered to this canine triumvirate, few have elicited such intense enthusiasm and prehistoric passion.<br /><br />We noticed no ill side effects in any of the pooches from these treats. There were no upset tummies, and no bouts of diarrhea. The verdict of this jury was unanimous and definitively pawsitive.

It is made in China, which people worry about, I recommend checking out dogfoodadvisor.com for some information on that; apparently almost all dog food sold in the US still sources some ingredients from China. Poodle is 16 lbs and has had no trouble with them. This is also a much better deal than the package I bought in my local pet store, FYI.

review/summary: My dogs follow me everywhere
review/text: I started buying these treats years ago thinking they looked cute with the little bone and chicken piece wrapped around them.  I did not realize I would be buying them constantly as my two golden's just love these.  I keep them in a ceramic treat jar on the counter and as soon as the lid is lifted and a slight noise made; they are both sitting there waiting looking at me.  I can go thru a jar of these in two weeks if I don't ration them out.  The dogs love them, they are probably healthier for them than grocery store biscuits and every once in awhile they are on sale.  Thanks Amazon.

review/text: I've been drinking Lipton Cold Brew for several years now, and honestly, it's one of my favorite drinks. All you have to do is soak a tea bag in a pitcher of cold water for a few minutes, add a little sugar according to your tastes (although, really, you could drink it without any) and you're good to go!<br /><br />Although Lipton also offers Cold Brew bags for individual glasses, I find that's kind of a pain, if you drink any real amount. It's much easier to brew an entire pitcher and put it in your fridge, instead of bothering with individual glasses.

review/summary: Great Tea ... Bags Suck!
review/text: I really like this tea and have gone through 5 boxes.  Unfortunately, they have problems with their tea bags.  With boxes 1 and 2, each had about 4 tea bags that were unsealed, leaving loose tea in the pitcher and the bottom of the glasses. I overlooked that and had no problems with boxes 3, 4 and 5 (22 bags each).<br /><br />Today, I opened up box #6 and found an undamaged box full of loose tea, all the tea bags were unsealed.  Understand, the paper wrapper around the bag was fine, it's the bags themselves that are NOT sealed.  I can literally pour the tea out on the counter once removed from the paper wrapper.  The box was completely useless.<br /><br />As I said before, I really like this tea ... I just hope Lipton gets their act together regarding their tea bags.

review/text: Great concept.  However, problem is with the bags - are they using "thinner" paper?  I tried "ice tea" bags first, that you brew briefly.  I don't know if I am squeezing the bags too hard (when I remove from pitcher) but they broke, causing loose tea in pitcher.  Tried "cold brew" - same thing!  Bags appear fine in box; box was sealed in cellophane, undamaged.  I would rather go back to the original tea bags and brew!  At least they didn't break!

review/summary: How to stop drinking from the pop machine at work...
review/text: I love tea, but I drink so much of it that it's not practical to bring a gallon of tea to work with me every night.<br />I also like it with a LOT of ice, and if iced tea doesn't have any ice in it, I just won't drink it. What's the point?<br />I bring a 32oz wide mouth bottle to work with me.<br />I fill it full of ice at home, and top it off with water, throw a cold brew bag on top and seal it up.<br />When I drink it, I just fill it with water from the drinking fountain, and put a fresh cold brew tea bag on top.<br />If I fill it with water from the fridge at home, (And keep it in the fridge at work.) there is ice left in it after I finish it a 3rd time.<br />If I'm still thirsty after drinking 3 quarts of ice cold iced tea, I generally buy a bottle of fruit juice out of the machine, and drink half of it, then refill the little bottle up with water and add emergen-c to replace the lost electrolytes.<br />Yes, I work at a very physical job, and lose a lot of water due to sweat every night.<br /><br />Without cold brew bags, I just can't have iced tea at work unless I bring a huge wide mouth gallon drink cooler to work.<br />Fresh tea, made just before you drink it, is best.<br />How is this not perfect for me?

review/summary: Saves me thousands of dollars every year
review/text: In the 90's I got hooked on the Lipton glass bottled iced tea, their unsweetened, no lemon.  But it was expensive, and my stores didn't stock it very well.  I'd go in there and buy twenty 6 packs at a time when I could.  And at anywhere from $5.50 to $7 per six pack, that added up since I'd drink more than one six pack in a day.<br /><br />I tried other home brewed teas, but none were close in flavor to those lipton glass bottles i loved so much.<br /><br />Then a client of mine made a comment last winter about these cold brew bags, and I decided to try it.<br /><br />I was in LOVE.  They taste almost identical to the glass bottles, but at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />I use a two liter pitcher, put three bags in it, and it's perfect.  The cost savings alone are even better than when I quit smoking. :)<br /><br />A month or so ago I took it to the next level, and got a nice big two liter filtration unit, and so filter my tap water through there, and then into my pitcher with the iced tea.  And once I started filtering the city water, it was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />Price is slightly cheaper at the brick and mortars by me, but I like the convenience of getting 12 boxes at a time without having to get them myself at the store.

review/summary: Real tea and real convenience
review/text: I love tea, and I prefer brewing my tea with loose leaf tea leaves if I have the time, but I must confess for ease and convenience this tea can't be beat....three minutes max. No cooling period necessary, and no melted ice cubes to immediately dilute your tea when you need to serve it right away. I grew up on the powdered stuff they call instant tea which really has very little resemblance to the taste of real tea, and it's full of chemicals. I prefer real tea, and the choice of whether to sweeten it or not. Thanks Lipton.<br /><br />The only tip I will offer is to compress the bags well when time is up to get all the tea from the bags, otherwise, it may end up being too weak for you. I also use Blue Agave to sweeten my tea. All natural and good ice tea within a matter of minutes.

review/text: You can turn water into a pitcher of refreshing, really brewed-tasting iced tea in a few minutes. Just put the pitcher in the refrigerator and by the time you have lunch or dinner on the table your beverage is ready.<br /><br />Because it's unsweetened, you can add your own sweetener to taste. But, it's really so darn good that you might want to savor the tea's natural taste.<br /><br />Lipton Cold Brew Tea Bags are economical and GOOD!

review/summary: Love the Cold Brew!
review/text: We are quite the tea drinkers in our household. In the past we have purchased dedicated tea makers, used dedicated coffee makers for brewing and even placed containers in the windows to make sun tea throughout the year. While the flavor of a good brewed tea is tough to beat, we are very happy with the cold brew. The easy brewing format is quite possibly the best part. I think our older dedicated hot water based brewing devices are feeling lonely.<br /><br />Looking in the cabinet we are getting close to our next bulk purchase of tea. We highly recommend the cold brew products in both pitcher and individual cup sizes. Amazon makes the purchase smooth and easy too.

review/summary: Good tea that's easy to make
review/text: Everyone who witnessed this purchase's arrival insists that 12 boxes is more than anyone would use, but I've already gone through an entire box, in the month since I purchased them, so it's "only" about a year's supply for me. I expect to go through it faster once it warms up, but I'll probably also go through it more slowly if winter weather rolls around again before I've used it all up. Also, I imagine I'd go through it more quickly if I were sharing this tea with someone else. (So far I've been "hogging" it all to myself.)<br /><br />The sheer volume of the 12-pack aside, this tea is bitter enough to wake me up, but sweetens nicely with honey or Sugar in the Raw (for later in the day, when I want it tamed down a little). It's also really easy to make. I just fill my 1-gallon pitcher about half- to two-thirds full with cold water from the tap (the water where I live actually tastes good, I just need a little boost of caffeine), put two to three teabags in it (with the strings anchored on the pour-spout of the lid, so I can pull them out later), and stick it in the fridge overnight. I find that I generally make a pitcher each night on weekdays, which would be much more time-consuming if I had to boil the tea, find something heat-safe to put it in overnight, etc.<br /><br />If you drink a lot of tea (I bring a liter of it with me to school & work each day), then this is a great deal. Otherwise, you may want to consider going in on a 12-pack with a friend, or buying the "by the glass" cold-brew teabags so you can brew it on the go (much harder to do by the quart).

review/text: Lipton Cold Brew Ice Tea Bags  are great!  I've used them since they came out and I can't say enough about them.  I drink this iced tea year round (I'm not a coffee drinker) and<br />I love it.  It taste's great!  It's fast and easy.  I use the pitcher size tea bags (22-Count Boxes), with a gallon size pitcher, 2 tea bags, fill with water, refrigerate 10-15 minutes<br />and it's ready to drink.  You can't get much easier than that!  They also sell tea bags for individual cups of ice tea.  I've never priced them because they wouldn't be cost efficient for me.  Amazon has great sale price's on this product, but pay attention!  I purchased LIPTON BLACK TEA, COLD BREW, PITCHER SIZE, TEA BAGS, 22-COUNT BOXES<br />(PACK OF 12) for less than they were selling the exact same product (PACK OF 6) three items above the one I chose. The Pack of 6 was $4.00 more than the pack Pack of 12<br />that I purchased. So beware.  But I do highly recommend this product and Amazon has the best price around!

review/summary: A lot of goodness.
review/text: Iced tea is one of my favorite drinks and this Lipton Cold Brew pack makes it easy to make. Now, ordering from Amazon has made it even cheaper to make.<br /><br />Boxes of 22 Pitcher bags have been going for around 5+ dollars at my local supermarket and drop to around 4 dollars on sale. It hasn't been cheap but since these bags make it so easy to make the tea and taste pretty good I have continued to buy it. Until I saw Amazon was selling the same tea at a cheaper price. To purchase a box of 12 (which I realistically couldn't do before since the market rarely had that many to begin with) would have run me around 60+ dollars. Amazon is much cheaper (about half the price) and I now have the convenience of not having to go out to get a couple new boxes every few weeks. This 12 pack of boxes should last my family around 4-5 months.<br /><br />This stuff tastes like tea and isn't sweetened or has flavors or anything like that. If that is what you want though you can definitely add whatever your heart desires to make it taste as you want, but this just the Tea without any of the stuff - it is great. It is pretty quick, you can just throw a couple bags into a large pitcher and then just wait for it to act. A few minutes later you add some ice and you have a iced tea, it really is that simple.<br /><br />If you haven't had it before, 12 boxes of it is quite a large commitment and it is probably worth going to the local store and picking up a box to try out first before taking the plunge, especially if you're not that big on tea or you are a big tea snob and are particular about how it tastes.<br /><br />Each box is individually sealed, so you don't have to worry that when you open the pack you'll open all of them and they come in a large box for easy storage.

review/text: I've been drinking iced tea daily for 45 years, and this is the best tasting, easiest method I have ever found. I like strong tea, and I like lots of ice.  This tea will brew strong, and since's it's cold already, the ice does not dilute it too much.  It has a good, clean, slight mineral taste, and I love it!

review/summary: Makes great tea in minutes!
review/text: I love this tea! It is refreshing, and quick and easy to make. I have trouble finding it in the supermarket so I liked that I was able to purchase it in bulk. I make it by the pitcher, so I bought the larger bags, but it is also available in bags that you can use to make tea by the glass.

review/summary: Available in all seasons
review/text: Lipton Cold Brew tea bags are available only during the summer months locally.  For those who enjoy a quality iced tea at other times of the year, Amazon offers the opportunity to indulge your tastes.  As refreshing in winter as in summer, iced tea is a healthful beverage not limited to the dictates of local availability

review/summary: Cold Brew Rocks
review/text: We have tried it all in our househod.  Iced Tea makers.  Brewing it on the stove.  Sun Tea.<br />But at the end of them all they are a bit of pain except for sun tea and where we live you can't do that year round.<br />Which cold brew you just put water in the pitcher and then add suger and the put the tea bags in.  You let it go for a little while and then blamo the cold brew is done.

review/summary: Best fast iced  tea making
review/text: Here in the UK it is near impossible to get iced tea, especially in a Pub or restaurant.  I drink iced tea year round and so I like having in my fridge.  Can't make too much as the refrigerators are rather small, so e cold tea bags are a perfect amount to be able to make when I nee to every other day at least.  Flavor is no special, but it is as good as tea bag iced tea can be.

review/summary: Love cold brew tea!
review/text: We have used cold brew tea for the last few years.  It is quick, easy and is not instant.  We love the flavor and ease of preparation and at Amazon it was a good price with free shipping.  We brew a pitcher almost daily.  I love the convenience of having it available without running to the store.

review/summary: Convenient~ Good Price
review/text: Love these cold brew tea bags~ Work great in cold water, no boiling necessary.  For some reason they are hard to find in supermarkets in my area~ these were reasonably priced (especially w/the super saver shipping & Lipton coupon discount) & I even rec'd before the estimated dly date.

review/summary: Great tea - way too much money
review/text: This tea used to be a little more expensive than WalMart or Sam's Club.  Now it is outrageous.  Will not order again.  $8.43 increase per case in two months.

review/summary: Tough beans
review/text: Maybe I don't know what these are supposed to be like, so I won't give them a one star, but these were tough - the skin was tough no matter how long I cooked them.  I used them in a cassoulet, and the next time I will go for plain white beans and not bother with white kidney beans.

review/summary: Above average
review/text: This is a nice smooth & mild blend with subtle notes of citrus. It seems to taste best with a little milk and sugar. If you're a black drinker, you may look somewhere else as it lacks complexity. Overall though, a very good coffee.

review/text: I purchased two bags of this product and for me, it wasn't any better than the $6.oo store brands at the supermarket.  Also, I bet that there isn't a real Nell.

review/summary: Boylan's Diet Cane Cola
review/text: Boylan's Diet Cane Cola is one of the best Diet drinks I've ever had. They capture a "circa-1940" cola feel, when all sorts of people manufactured regional cola brands. They've done a fine job.
