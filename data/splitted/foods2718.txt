review/summary: BEWARE: Hidden Ingredients Include Soybean Oil and MSG
review/text: I took a chance on this mayonnaise, hoping that it would not contain soy oil --- because the ingredients are not listed in the description of this product.  So much to my dismay, I found out after the mayonnaise arrived that it does indeed contain soy oil  --- and worse, it contains MSG.<br /><br />The product may, in fact, be wonderful for some people.  But you should be aware that this product contains soybean oil and MSG --- which some people, cannot tolerate for medical reasons.<br /><br />Downgraded to three stars for hiding the ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients only show up on the cello wrapper and do not appear on the plastic container itself.  So here is a the list of the ingredients so thoughtful buyers can make an intelligent decision without guessing or having to take a chance:<br /><br />  ***** Ingredients: Vegetable Oil (Canola Oil, Soybean Oil), Egg Yolk, Vinegar, Salt, Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), Spice, Natural Flavor, Contains Egg. *****

review/text: I don't typically drink flavored coffee.  One of the few flavored coffees I do enjoy is Santa's White Christmas, from Barnie's.  It's delicious, but since Starbuck's bought out most of the Barnie's locations, it's not as easy to find.<br /><br />I tried Highlander Grogg after seeing Berres Brothers coffee highlighted on "Unwrapped" on The Food Network.  It sounded good so I ordered some.  I have to say, it is every bit as delicious as Santa's White Christmas.  This is Berres Brothers' top seller, and I can see why!  A delicious blend of caramel, butterscotch and hazelnut... It's perfect!<br /><br />I'm now on my second three-pack, and I definitely will be ordering more!

The bag is resealable to keep it fresh.

This went in the garbage.  It wasn't worth returning, so I just dumped it.  I'm really glad I didn't spring for a larger size.  "And Yes, my bag also had rough sticks in it too"

review/summary: Bold, rich coffee but not as advertised
review/text: The coffee itself was great, and at less then $15 for over 3lb's it is a incredible bargain. The main thing you should know if you buy it though is that although it is categorized under whole bean coffee, it is ground. It is also ground extremely finely to the point that a good amount of the grounds pass straight through my Bodum Classic french press' filter. It's more suitable to be drip brewed then made in a press.<br /><br />Edit: Apparently is categorized properly under ground now.

My friends would beg for coffee whenever they came over.  Usually I buy it at the DECA Commissaries but they were out this time and I cannot drink another brand at home.  Now I live in the coffee capital, Seattle, and they don't have anything that can compare to Kronung.  If you are curious, give it a try and you will be hooked.

review/summary: Smooth and Flavoricious
review/text: Really like this coffee. At this price point, it might be the best coffee you can get on Amazon or almost anywhere. I mean, look at the price per ounce...so cheap. If you love a good cup o' joe, and it's so much a part of your life that you realize you need to save a few bucks, because you're drinking up too much money and your love for coffee is such that you're OK with something less than the very best, then this coffee is my go-to recommendation for you. If you're made of cash, there's a very famous local roaster who will knock your socks off starting at $1.70/oz. There are local roasters everywhere who will give you an awesome bag of beans for about $1/oz. But for less than 30 cents/oz, you can get some perfectly good Kronung and be satisfied each morning, while also saving some figurative beans.<br /><br />I think the flavor is that Northern European mellow coffee taste (think Ikea coffee), but stronger and more flavorful, while still maintaining a low level of acidity. If you like your coffee with a bit of bite or sting, then this is not for you. My other cheap coffee alternatives are the 8 O'Clock Columbian and the Yuban dark, but this Kronung, at least right now, beats both. I use an Aeropress, a Delonghi espresso machine, and a Bunn or Cuisinart drip. Honestly, I say skip those occasional sales on big name brands. If you're cost-conscious enough to perk up to a sale, then know that even after the discount, they're still not better tasting nor cheaper than this Kronung.

review/text: A package of coffee that's LARGER than 1 pound, imagine that! And you get 3 of those nice large bags in your order.  Plus the price is extremely reasonable especially for an import.<br /><br />The first thing I noted about this coffee is that it is very tightly vacuum sealed - no air in the bag.<br />When you open the bag you get a lovely waft of fresh ground coffee.<br /><br />The coffee itself is ground extra fine to what is very much like a powder, quite dark in color and even though ground to that gauge is nice and moist with an acceptable amount of oiliness.<br /><br />The extra fine grind makes using a paper filter a necessity - you can use a gold tone filter but it will clog with grounds so must be scrubbed after use and you will, most likely, find grounds in the bottom of your pot.<br /><br />No matter what coffee we brew in our auto drip pot we start the brewing process and then pause it for a short time allowing the grounds to 'bloom' and then restart the brewing until completion.<br /><br />We have found that this coffee as most of the Made in Germany coffees we've tried has a slight acidity and an earthy undertone in the flavor. Not a negative if that appeals to you. We enjoy it after dinner but prefer a lighter roasted bean for our morning cups.<br /><br />As with any coffee, liking this coffee very much or disliking it comes down to personal taste.<br /><br />At the price it's certainly worth trying.

review/summary: Jacobs Kronung- great coffee
review/text: We have tried many coffees over the years, but none have the remarkable aroma, balanced taste and eye-opening qualities of Jacobs Kronung. We first fell in love with it in the mid-eighties, while living in Germany, and in the course of time, have found it to be consistently great. Does not get bitter if you make it strong...only gets richer in taste. Flavor also stands up to cream, and makes great ice coffee  Fine grind which can take a very light tamping (or not) for added richness. Honestly one of the very few coffees that tastes as delicious as it smells.  (Note:  Always use spring water or other non-chlorinated water- you won't be disappointed!)  The cost savings of the subscription service from Amazon provides it to my door at an amazing price...and times out perfectly for us (3 bricks/month).

review/summary: Simply awesome coffee
review/text: We discovered this coffee while living in Germany. We tried all of the local brands - Dallmayr, Tchibo, and more I can't recall, and Jacobs turned out to be the smoothest, least bitter brew available.  We now drink this exclusively, and go into withdrawal when we run out before the next subsciption shipment.  I was purchasing this from an online German grocery store, but the subscription price was lower than anything the other store could do except when it was on sale for $6.99 a bag.  A tip: use the gold-tone permanent filters, and use 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup marking on your carafe - our weekday morning brew is 6 cups in the carafe, and we use 6 tablespoons of the ground coffee.  Absolutely perfect!

review/summary: Not strong enough for me.
review/text: I like my coffee strong, but not dark and bitter. I started using German coffee a few months ago because it's easier on those of us with acid reflux. This coffee was very good when I first opened the bag, but within a few days, I could not get it to brew strong enough for my taste. It was always weak, even after adding more coffee, and/or percolating it for a longer period of time. Perhaps beans would not be so weak, but I haven't been able to find those here. I ended up purchasing the whole bean Dallmayr and am very happy with my choice.

Considering the falling Euro (from $1.35 down to $1.22 today),I wonder why the "Subscribe & Save" price for the 17.6-Ounce Vacuum Pack of 3 was raised from December 30, 2011 to July 2012 by nearly 80%, from $13.12 to $23.54!

review/summary: Too Acidic For My Taste
review/text: I took a chance and bought Jacobs Kronung Coffee (ground) because of the positive remarks left by other reviewers and because of the price (coffee was on sale at the time).  I was very disappointed.  I like bold coffee (dark roast) because I find that the lighter blend tend to be acidic and not as flavorful. For point of reference, I like Peets and a few Starbucks blend(i.e. Sumatra). That being said,I have come across some medium roast that I've enjoyed but this was not one of them.  Jacobs Kronung is a light/medium roast and the taste reminds me of the typical grocery store coffee-Folgers/Maxwell House. Too acidic for my taste.

review/text: When I was working for AAFES I came across this in the Base Exchange. Later I joined the reserves and lived on this stuff. I had withdrawal symptoms when my reserve time came to an end. There is just no substitution.  It does not taste burnt like Starbucks.  The vacuum pack seems to last forever. When you open the pack you have to restrain you self from sniffing it up your nose. I keep the open pack in the frig; not like I have to as the family plows through a pack a week. For store bought coffee this rivals some of the more exotic sourced coffee.

review/text: Jacobs Kronung Coffee (the green package with the picture of a steaming hot cup of joe on the front) is smooth and rich.  It's hard to find in any stores where we live, so I always order from Amazon.  I'm a coffee snob when it comes to Espresso or regular coffee, and I've always found German coffee to be some of the best.  This coffee has been ground extremely fine, so you may need to use less coffee than the usual coarser coffee.

I have ordered from Amazon where one of the packages was soft, as it had somehow become unsealed, but so far so good with these shipments.  It's also good to have them on auto-ship so we don't have to worry about running out.  This is also a great value.  In the grocery store, I pay the same amount for half the coffee.

review/summary: Mellow option for Moka pot
review/text: After shelling out for Illy and Lavazza Gold for a few years, the deal on Jacobs Kronung here made it tempting to try.  The grind is perfect for a Moka pot (and for those who haven't tried one yet, you will be glad when you do!).  The flavor is a bit rounder and milder than Lavazza Gold or Lavazza Crema, and the aroma really is nice.  The Germans certainly know their craft as to smooth coffee, and this is perfect for the morning wake up.  At Amazon's incredible price, it's easily worth it.<br /><br />As to folks concerned with dealing with vacuum packs, my solution was to use one of my old cans of Lavazza and pour the opened vacuum pack into the can.  The vacuum packs are a pain, but the cheaper cost is worth it.

review/text: I am a true coffee lover.  Nothing added - just coffee and water - but it has to<br />TASTE like coffee - no colored water, weak brew for me - and this fits the bill<br />completely.  I was reluctant to try this but am glad I did.  I have been subscribing<br />to coffee delivery from that company that begins with a G and paying about $36<br />including shipping for TWO pounds!!  After receiving this coffee, I have cancelled<br />that subscription.  I use a Braun machine and unbleached filters and have had no<br />problems.  I like the fine grind because you get more of the coffee's flavor w/o<br />having to use an enormous amount of the product.  I'm so glad I took a chance and<br />tried this and even more glad that I put it on Subscribe and Save - I know I will<br />have delicious coffee every morning from now on with no more effort on my part.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon, for having this product available.

review/summary: Disappointed in THIS batch for DRIP brew
review/text: DEC. 21, 2010<br />Since the "coffee revolution" spread from Seattle and captured almost every county in the U.S., there is no shortage of well-roasted coffee beans in regular and decaf for nearly every taste, provided by the larger roasters as well as by small operators. I hang out at a Starbucks with a terrific view and with the "Cheers" effect, and I currently like their Sumatra blend for decaf and Komodo Dragon Bold blend for regular.<br />Any coffee connoisseur will buy whole beans and grind just enough, in a BURR grinder, to brew. I use a (Braun) drip grinder with unbleached filters.<br />I "grew up" with low-acid, aero-therm roasted Heimbs coffee in North Germany and still like it when I am over there visiting. I also enjoyed the Jacobs blend that I discovered on ICE trains, in many restaurants or on the airplane(s) on trips in recent years.<br /><br />I ordered a batch of Jacobs Kr&ouml;nung recently for sentimental reasons and in order to get a large enough combined order that qualifies for free shipping. I was aware of the "ground" label.<br /><br />What I received was close to a powdered consistency, definitely NOT SUITABLE for DRIP brewing nor for French Press. I actually had particles penetrating the filter paper and ending up in my cup. Ridiculous. I was not excited about the TASTE either but realize that could be tweaked by varying the quantity and perhaps by using different water. I am not planning to do so and will probably give the remaining three packages away.<br /><br />Unless amazon.com offers whole-bean Jacobs, I will not order this product again nor will I recommend it to anybody.<br />Amazon should label this product as "not suitable for drip brewing".

review/summary: Very Good Coffee, Only One Problem
review/text: I have used the whole bean Jacobs Kronung coffee and liked it a lot, but have been unable to find it lately, so I decided to try the ground from Amazon. When I got it and opened it up, I discovered that it is a very fine grind, almost like a powder in consistency. The coffee still has very good flavor, but it has taken a lot of experimentation to find the right amount to use.<br />Maybe there was some mention of how fine the grind was somewhere in the description, but I don't remember seeing it. There are some comments about it in some of the reviews, but this is still a much finer grind than any other fine grind I've tried. The lack of information about how fine the grind is was the only reason for the 3 star review and has nothing to do with the quality and flavor of the coffee. I wish I could find the whole bean.

review/summary: This is not great coffee.
review/text: I've recently been spoiled by fresh roasted coffee from a local roaster and was intrigued by all of the positive reviews.  Anyway, this stuff was no better than what sits on grocery shelves for months and months, waiting and waiting and going stale with every passing day.  Do yourself a favor and buy FRESH whole bean coffee like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWMD2I">Dark Brazilian Santos, Whole Bean Coffee, 5 Pound Bag</a>.  Grind it with a burr grinder, brew it with any of the manual methods, and you will be in coffee nirvana.  And you will never buy this stuff again.

review/summary: OBSESSED
review/text: I have seriously developed an obsession for Melba toast!  I really enjoy this Sesame version even more than original Melba toast.  Melba toast can sometimes have a bitter after taste and this particular one has absolutely NONE of that, the sesame really adds to the experience, if you enjoy Melba toast!  I eat this for breakfast every morning with one wedge of Chipotle laughing cow cheese and a cup of coffee and every morning I enjoy it even more than the last time.  I also highly recommend the Tomato and Herb Melba toast from this same brand!!  Melba Toast Lovers, you will LOVE!!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: This bag was a real disappointment.  It was tiny.  Not just small, but tiny.  It did not have a whole lot of candy in it and that seems ridiculous considering the price.  I paid $15.83 for both the candy and shipping together (8.49+7.34S).  At the local store I could have gotten the same bag for $2.75 (at Vons) and at another store (Albertsons) I could have gotten TWO 48 oz bags (5 times the 18oz size) for the price available here.  Do yourself a favor and get something else.  This is just not worth the price Candy Corner is asking.<br /><br />As for the candy itself, this particular mix was disappointing.  No Nerds, which is the favorite among all the kids.  No Pixie Stix, no Fun Dip, no Runts.  It did have a couple of nice ones, but also a couple that no one wanted.  And the bottle caps did not taste right and certainly not how they usually taste.  If they haven't changed the way they make them, then it is possible they were stale.<br /><br />I hope this helps you avoid overpriced candy.

review/text: I have bought two orders of these cookies and here's my experience.<br /><br />The first order: The cookies were awesome, very good and very few broken pieces.<br />The second order: The cookies tasted a bit stale and had many broken cookies.<br /><br />I guess it's the luck of the draw, but overall, I still really like these cookies compared to other ones that have much more saturated fats like keeblers (those are good too, but too much fat)<br /><br />But these should not be seen as a healthy snack, as they still do have a good amount of fats in them and nothing that's really good for you.

I prefer the softer, more crumbly feel of their fudge striped and mint cookies.)<br /><br />These cookies are just about as good as Famous Amos and Chips Deluxe chocolate chip cookies, but they use safflower oil which gives them half the saturated fat.<br /><br />They have a great crunch, good texture and good all-around taste.<br /><br />These are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had when considering taste AND healthfulness.

review/summary: Crunchy, tasty cookies
review/text: These are indeed very crunchy so if you prefer the soft, chewy type you won't like these. But since I like crunchy, I like these a lot. Generous amounts of large chocolate chips! Very tasty and not as sweet as most chocolate chip cookies found in supermarkets. If you believe the print, they're healthier too. I will definitely be ordering more of these.<br /><br />Added on Oct 26th, 2012:<br /><br />I had my gallbladder removed 4 weeks ago. I was in despair that I won't be able to eat chocolate chip cookies since they're too fatty. Since these have a lot less fat than a typical CC cookie I can still have 3 or 4 for desert without any nasty consequences! But check with your doctor, as they say: your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Best cookies next to pepperidge farm verona cookies
review/text: I love these cookies and they always make it into my grocery cart. They are not soft and gooey, but aren't kibble. They are slightly bigger than the the rim of the paper towel cardboard lining. The key to these cookies are storage. If they are not stored properly you he will end up with stale, dry, cookies that appear like the chocolate chunks are burnt b/c they darken w/ improper storage. I've been eating these cookies for almost a year and my experiences were not consistent. When I got a good fresh box I was in love with the semi sweet taste of cocoa. But, when I got a box that wasn't I ended up with a kibble like texture that had a bland taste with chocolate chunks so hard and dark they looked like rat poop. If they are fresh the chocolate chunks "should" melt slightly to your hand/fingers when you're eating them. I love the rich taste and I am not usually a chocolate fan since my love is gummy snacks. But, this is fresh and the antioxidants one gets from cocoa makes this a great buy. I also like that it's fair trade so no slum dog millionaire stuff w/ over worked, mistreated people living in slums for the sake of my snack. They are very rich and filling I believe one cookie is considered one serving. No grittyness or aftertaste. I of course will buy again. I am trying out amazon and ordered the 6 pack of the 9.5 oz box so hopefully amazon has their stored right!.

If you eat 4 cookies like i do somtimes its still not that bad calorie wise (260 cals.)<br /><br />Buying them in bulk from Amazon really helps. Somtimes there is a little breakage but for the most part the cookies arrive intact and ready to eat! Dollar for Dollar its the best deal you are going to find.

The three varieties are: Mr. Exclusive 100% Arabica; Exquisit, a 90/10 arabica robusto blend; and Blucaffe, an arabica blend that my wife and I found to be far and away the best of the three. That's not to say the other two are bad; all three are very nice, but the Blucaffe is something special.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of if you're unfamiliar with Lucaffe is the artwork on the package labels, which features subtle and not-so-subtle racial caricatures reminiscent of Black Americana. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, so to speak.

I am allergic to soy and wheat, so my choices in protein bars are very limited.  I also prefer raw and organic foods to processed.<br /><br />These bars are a good source of protein without soy, wheat, or gluten which I am deeply grateful for.  As far as protein bars go, they are healthier than most I've found with many organic ingredients.<br /><br />I've given Dr. Smoothie 4 out of 5 stars because in my humble opinion, the sugar content is a bit excessive - 9gms for a 2 oz bar.  It also includes maltodextrin which is a highly processed food additive derived from corn.  And, it contains natural vanilla and carmel flavors, which are not natural foods.<br /><br />I would love to see Dr. Smoothie clean up the bars a bit more to make them raw and organic with less sugar. However, even with these ingredients, they are by far a better bar.
