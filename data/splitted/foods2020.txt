review/summary: Tuna like you've never had before
review/text: Spanish tuna is so different than what we are used to buying.  The fish is in chunks, not decimated and packed in wonderful olive oil which really compliments the fish.  If you've never tried it, you must, it's the most accessible and delicious gourmet food.

review/summary: It's still canned tuna
review/text: I ordered this tuna ready to be blown away and and quite frankly I wasn't (except by the cost!). As far as canned tuna goes this is really good, but it is also really expensive. I was expecting something with perhaps a better texture than 'regular' canned, but while it is very good it's still canned tuna. At this price per pound I had higher expectations. Again, this is good canned tuna and I would rate it higher but I don't think the cost is justified. One thing to keep in mind when comparing this tuna to other store bought brands: make sure to buy canned tuna packed in olive oil. Tuna in water tends to be 'mushy' and not as 'flaky' as oil packed tuna.<br /><br />I would suggest trying out the canned tuna from Fishing Vessel St. Jude. They are a Seattle based company and they test their tuna for mercury and post the results on their website. Whole Foods carries it in the Seattle area.

review/text: On the plus side, this tuna is amazing--rich, delicious, with lovely olive oil to drizzle on the salad, pasta, beans, bread, or whatever you are eating the tuna with.  On the minus side, it is hard to go back.  I used to think Cento and Progresso were all that canned tuna could be, and they are much more budget-friendly than Ortiz.  It's a special treat.

review/text: This was a xmas present for hubby (lol). He is the only person I know who was delighted to find cans of tuna in his stocking(lol). Anyway we have purchased this tuna before and really enjoy it. It is reasonably priced (we have compared). I would consider us moderate foodies and this is probably one of the best (reasonably priced) tunas we have purchased. Good shipping, happy every time with vendor. Keeps us coming back and for how much it costs, it is truly the Poseidon of the Sea. You can keep your chicken...

review/text: I love, love, love this product.  I used to buy it at Whole Foods but they do not carry it any longer. Whole Foods sold it at a much better price so paying so much more for it plus shippping is not too cool.  I did it anyway as there is no other tuna that I have eaten that is near as good as this one.<br />Here is a nice yummy canape recipe for your tummy. 2 small cans ortiz tuna, 1TB lemon juice, 1TB capers, 2tsp red onion minced, 1TB piquillo pepper chopped, salt and pepper to taste. mix it all up in a small bowl and let sit for a few hours or overnight to meld the flavors. serve atop sliced baguettes toasted or not. I grant you that letting it sit for awhile is the hardest part there are many times that I am so thrilled with this concotion that I consume it on the spot.  sometimes I find myself standing up and eating it all, well most of it.  Of course you can do what you want afterall it's your tuna, but you could put it on salad greens as well or share it with someone.  that's the nice part, they will love it, or you, or both,  thats for sure.

review/text: Just like the 3-star reviewer, I was prepared to be blown away after looking at the reviews, but my tastebuds are certain that this is the same or maybe just slightly better than the BumbleBee tuna in the gold cans - usually around $2.50 at Walmart.  Same size chunks, same color, same mellow taste.  The olive oil used might be a bit better but I drain it out anyway.<br /><br />I'd say if you like this, then go check out the BumbleBee in the gold can and save a few bucks a can.

review/summary: This is not your usual canned tuna!
review/text: The Spanish produce some of the most exquisite and delicious canned seafood in the world- some of which sells for $25, $50 or even more per can. This particular tuna is a bit under $6/can, which might sound terribly expensive if you're used to paying $2.37/can at the local Quickee Mart, but be assured that this is no ordinary canned tuna. Ortiz Bonito Del Norte is to Starkist as Filet Mignon is to a Big Mac. This is a smooth, sweet, buttery flavored tuna packed in really good olive oil. I'd no sooner mix this tuna with a big dollop of mayonnaise than I'd put ketchup on a piece of filet. All you need to enjoy this tuna are some good quality crackers or some dense rye bread. Maybe a very thin slice of  shallot or red onion. (Okay, maybe a little good home made mayo)<br /><br />Now if you happen to like bland water-packed white tuna in Miracle Whip, you won't like this tuna. The Ortiz product uses dark, flavorful tuna. No, it doesn't taste "fishy." But it has a real fish flavor, something missing from most canned albacore. If you prefer natural foods to processed foods, fresh to frozen, and the taste of simple, unadulterated, raw foods, you'll love this tuna. But be forewarned: Once you try this tuna,  before you know it you'll be ordering treats like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EER0PK">Ortiz Yellowfin Tuna in Olive Oil, 220-Grams</a> or even the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00494OQY4">Conservas de Cambados Almejas con Setas - Galician Clams with Mushrooms (4 oz/111 g Tin)</a> and before you know it, you have a $100/day Spanish Tinned Seafood habit....

Far more flavorful and robust than any tuna in U.S. supermarkets, I eat this tuna directly out of the can without condiments!  Yes, it's pricey, but if it goes into the stomach and it's nutritious, it's worth it!

review/summary: How can all other tuna taste so bad?
review/text: Try this at your own risk.  You will no longer be able to ingest any other brand.  I did some investigation and discovered that the people at Ortiz do a lot before they gently pluck these tasty creatures from the sea.  They hire a team of thousands of deep sea divers to visit the schools of tuna and feed them all sorts of delicious foods (foie gras, flan, various fondue dishes). They also massage the fish daily in a similar manner to Kobe beef. They even provide full medical for each fish and its family (providing the fish has committed to being canned at a later date).  You will taste the love in every bite.

review/text: it will ruin all other canned tuna for you.  So be forewarned, once you become accustomed to THIS canned tuna, you will not be satisfied by any others.  It should also be mentioned:  I read that Ortiz catches their tuna individually, by line (i.e. sustainable).  Bonito del Norte is Spanish for Albacore Tuna, by the way -- the species is listed as 'Near Threatened', so buying from sustainable fishers DOES matter.

review/text: This tuna is a premium product, too bad its at a premium price or I would use it routinely. Very firm meat with delicious taste. not overcooked and just enough saltiness, not at all fishy. The oil adds depth and moisture and is a nice change back to past days before almost all USA tuna was mostly packed in water. Pull top can is a nice extra feature. I intend to keep this on hand but cannot consider it a daily item because of price.

review/summary: Super Tuna
review/text: I should start by saying I've never been an enthusiastic fan of tinned tuna and have, for that reason, always chosen a pricy brand in favour of a more economical one in the hope of finding the most appealing choice of the lot. I've favoured Progresso (in olive oil) for years but after tasting Ortiz, I've changed my mind and can now wholeheartedly recommend their tuna over Progresso. That said, it does contain bones. Call me a lightweight fish eater but I find it off putting and have renewed my search for the perfect tinned tuna.

review/text: I don't get it. For nearly five dollars a can you can buy tuna that tastes just like the can you get for less than a buck at any U.S. super market. Look, there is nothing WRONG with this tuna...but the people turning cartwheels over it have apparently never just opened a can of plain old Chicken Of The Sea tuna for lunch.<br />Ya got me once, buy ya won't get me again.  Trust me folks; while I have nothing agaist the fine people in Spain, you can buy a whole lotta pure old USA tuna for what you are paying for FOUR small cans of this product.<br />Save your money.<br /><br />UPDATE IN MAY 2012<br /><br />Wait!  I was wrong!<br />This IS the best tuna you can buy today. I went back and tasted some of the stuff I USED to think was so good and found that I was totally in error to compare it to the Ortiz stuff.  The Ortiz tuna really is wonderful stuff....to just eat from a can with crackers, turn into sandwiches or appetizers etc. It is simply excellent product.<br />You're never to old to learn!  Buy it. Hang the expense!

review/summary: Unhealthy ingredients
review/text: Chicken By-Products, Wheat Gluten, Meat By-Products. NOT FOR MY DOG. The problems with meat by-products are that they may include indigestible or poorly digested parts of the animal (think hair, beaks, hooves, teeth, etc.) and it may include outdated meats from markets. Dogs can handle the outdated meat fine, but the problem is in the packaging. One report I read said that some Styrofoam from meat trays gets inadvertently included with the meat at the dog food factory. It is then very finely ground with the meat, with unknown effects on your pet.<br /><br />Finally, dogs don't digest wheat gluten (a thickening agent). Wheat gluten from China has, in the past, included highly toxic melamine. The source for ingredients isn't on IAMS pet food cans.<br /><br />Sometimes you get far LESS than you pay for. DogFoodAdviser rates canned Iams at 2 out of 5, "Below Average for Canned Dog Food"  at [...]. The price certainly is above average for canned dog food.

review/summary: My dogs love Iam's chunks.
review/text: Ever since the vet said we were over feeding our dogs, we began reading the instructions for serving size on our Iam's Weight Control kibbles packaging.  Usually they ate at night while we slept and nibbled rarely while we watched. We had no idea who ate what or how much. We stopped full bowls of kibbles 24/7 and began to feed them once a day. Because the Border Collie (like the dog on the can)is larger than the Jack Russel mixed breed, we need to regulate how much each ate.  So, we added 1/4 can of ProActive Health chunks to about a 1 cup of dry, a little less for the mutt and more for the BC, to encourage them to eat while we watched.  They cry with anticipation and eat like starving wolves.  The chunks come in a thick gravy that coat all the kibbles enough to ensure 100% consumption at feeding time.  Plus, the chunks' size and texture must be appealing to the dogs.  At first Amazon wanted $2.00 a can, but now sells for about $1.40.  With free delivery, it's a bargain. Delivered to my door by the post office. That beats Wall-Mart.  Plus Iam's reputation for quality makes my purchase a no-brainer.  We think they are eating under control now and look a little fitter.

review/text: This is by far one of the best k-cups I've tried.  It smells and tastes like coconut with no weird after taste.  I use hazelnut creamer with it and it's my absolute favorite coffee drink.  I'm not sure how long it's available since it's seasonal so i'm definitely stocking up!

review/summary: Coconutty!
review/text: My daughter and I have decided that Green Mountain is one of our favourite brands of Keurig coffee: strong aroma and not bitter. I love anything coconut and have been enjoying the coconutty taste of this coffee. It is the one flavour I have re-ordered. It's not all that strong, which I like, but the flavour is unmistakably coconut. Tastes great with milk and a bit of honey.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I am not a frequent coffee drinker because I always found it too strong; my sister finally convinced me to buy a Keurig because they offered so many light roast flavors. Island Coconut is BY FAR my favorite! It smells amazing as it brews and the flavor is heavenly. I hope that Green Mountain Coffee considers making this one of their regular flavors instead of a Limited Edition. I highly recommend this flavor!

review/text: Wow...this is a delightful, fresh coffee from Green Mountain. I did not know what to expect it to taste like as I am not real fond of fruit type flavored coffee, but I like coconut allot. The taste was fresh, clean with just the right amount of coconut flavor. I highly recommend this coffee to anyone who adores coconut or for those that want something different. It is a seasonal type coffee, so get it while it is available. Thumbs up Green Mountain!

review/summary: That's some weak coffee!
review/text: My roommate and I tried this one because she really likes the Kona Island blend from Coffee People. The first time we tried it was this morning and we brewed the largest size (travel mug sized). It was extremely weak and the coconut flavor was really strong.<br /><br />We brewed another generic kcup in the smallest cup size and mixed it then split it into two cups for each of us. It was a great cup of coffee, but it was a DYI process.<br /><br />Brew in the small size and then brace yourself for the taste of a melted coconut snowcone in your coffee.<br /><br />I will be honest that I do like it and I am glad we have it, but if you are in great need of coffee and you like something strong, go with something else.

review/text: This is an excellent after-dinner coffee.  It's smooth and mild, with a hint of coconut flavor and a nutty coconut smell.

The coconut smell and taste is amazing, and there is something else that seems to add just a little sweetness to the after taste. We also like that it's fair trade certified. With as much as we drink this flavor, we just wish it were sold by the pound to make a whole pot of it at one time :). Thank you, Amazon, for offering it at a great price as well.

review/summary: LIGHT ROAST, NICE COCONUT FLAVOR
review/text: First let me start by saying I'm not into very strong coffee.  I'm a one to two cup a day coffee drinker and found this to be a perfectly light roast with a nice smooth coconut flavor.  Great for a second cup without getting the jitters.  I am also a fan of coconut and flavored coffees.  I can have a cup of Island coconut in the afternoon for a little pick me up or to curb my appetite without worrying about being up until all hours of the night,  It tastes a bit like you had a coconut candy 5 minutes earlier and the taste is still swirling in your mouth.  It has a nice aroma.  I can't see drinking it everyday but with a little fat free half and half and some truvia, it feels like a little desert.  I'm sure it would be delicious over ice in the summer.  Get it while you can, from my understanding it is a seasonal product and very hard to get other than the internet.  Can't beat the $12 +/- price tag for a pack of 24.  Look for sales and free shipping.

review/text: We have been buying the flavored cffees for the Keurig machine for over a year. So we have tried many.  I first picked up the Island Coconut in a famous kitchen/bath store. I loved it from day one. It has a slight not too over powering coconut taste.  Slightly sweet without any added sugar.  Although i do put a little splenda in with mine when I make it. ONe thing that i don't like is that we were told this is a seasonal flavor.  Summer.  WEll when we went to buy more it was no longer available and it was the first week in June.  I was so excited to find it on Amazon. Ordered several boxes.  So when you see it, buy it. You will love it.

review/text: My wife and I never dreamed we would like coconut flavored coffee, but after one taste of this it has become our favorite flavored joe. It is extremely smooth, with just enough coconut to accent the coffee but not overwhelm it. We occasionally like to add a chocolate flavored creamer to it make a pseudo Almond Joy flavor. It is a shame (and incomprehensible to us) that this is a seasonal offering, so we try to stock up/hoard this whenever it is available. Perhaps GMCR will come to their senses and make this a year-round offering soon.

The only place I have found Coconut flavored coffee at was a coffee and tea shop on Christopher St in NYC and I hate using the filter for bulk coffee for the K cup brewer, so just used my regular coffee brewer when in the mood for cocounut coffee, so I was very excited when it came out in K-Cups.<br /><br />Coffee has a really good coconut flavoring and it is great iced.  I had some coconut flavor sugar free torani syrup I used to flavor regular coffee with, and that is really good mixed in with this coffee in place of sweetner and makes a delicious iced treat.

review/summary: Surprisingly weak!
review/text: I love coconut coffee and I was extremely excited to give this coffee a go on my new Keurig B60. All of the rave reviews made me even more eager to try this seemingly great flavor. Unfortunately this coffee fails to deliver. There is hardly any aroma when it brews and the coffee itself on the smallest cup setting looks and tastes like dirty water with a hint of coconut flavor. Since this coffee was the first coffee I ever brewed in my Keurig I thought the machine was faulty. But then I tried out other flavors and it turns out that the coffee itself is to blame. I usually have my coffee with a generous amount of flavored creamer so for ME to think certain coffees are weak means that it is EXTREMELY weak. I even tried the coffee without any creamer or sugar and it was STILL without much flavor. I will NOT be purchasing this coffee EVER again.

This is a wonderful coffee that I add just a splash of "sweet cream" creamer to, and reminds me of dipping a coconut macaroon cookie into a cup of coffee.<br />For anyone complaining it isn't very strong, keep in mind it is not meant to be an intense or stronger brew. Expect a nice lightweight, easy to drink coffee. If you prefer the more intense brews, this one is probably not for you.

review/text: I was a little hesitant at first to purchase these K-Cups as coconut and coffee never seemed like a good pairing. But alas! It was. I really enjoy this coffee, especially the aroma when it brews! I say if you are hesitant to give it a shot!

review/summary: Amazing coconut flavor
review/text: My sister bought a box of this flavor, and I was pretty skeptical.  Coconut and coffee didn't seem like a natural mix for me.  However, she gleefully described it as "liquid Samoas" and let me try a sip.  Amazing!  The aroma is tantalizing.  I love coconut flavor and it really comes through in this coffee.<br /><br />I immediately bought a box for brewing at the office, and she bought several more boxes as well.  It's quickly become the favorite flavor of everyone in my family.  It's sad that it's a limited edition, and we're hoping it becomes a normal flavor for year-round purchasing.

review/summary: A favorite at our house!
review/text: My husband and I have tried more than a dozen k-cup flavors since getting our keurig for Christmas.  Island Coconut, so far, is our favorite!  We use flavored coffee creamer in the weaker flavors of k-cups, but there is none needed in this one.  The flavor is strong and it smells fabulous when brewed.

review/text: If you like slightly flavored water or very light coffee, then you might like this. I like my coffee to actually taste like coffee - this does not. Even made at the 6oz setting, it's still very weak. It does have a nice mild Coconut scent and slight flavor, but the coffee is almost non existent. Of all the k-cups I've tried, this one is most disappointing.

review/text: I mostly drink regular non flavored coffees....but since buying the Keurig I have grown fond of flavored coffees as a dessert or afternoon pick me up. This Island Coconut is by far one of my favorite coffees to indulge in. The coconut taste is very realistic and fresh, and it makes a wonderful iced coffee treat.The only thing I wish was a little different is that it is a mild coffee and I believe the coconut could stand up to a bolder blend.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious. One of my all-time favorite Green Mountain flavors.
review/text: I have been a big flavored coffee fan ever since I first tasted hazelnut coffee about 20 years ago. My wife orders the K-cups for our Breville coffee maker and likes to rotate the flavors so that we don't get bored. Green Mountain certainly makes a wide variety of flavors- Perfect Peach, Wild Mountain Blueberry, Golden French Toast, etc. and I like them all, but when I tasted the Island Coconut for the first time I was blown away by how coconutty it tasted. This is not a strong coffee, it is more like a medium strength (probably on the weaker side of medium) but anyone who enjoys coconut should try this flavor. This is definitely one that I will be asking my wife not to rotate out in the near future. (My second favorite flavor right now is the Van Houtte Candy Cane which is peppermint flavored, but only available over Christmas, so we will be running out soon).

review/text: If you like mild-roast coconut-flavored coffee, then this is a great choice.  If you prefer a stronger brew, then consider the "Jamaican Me Crazy" coffee from Wolfgang Puck (coconut infused, but medium roast).  The Island Coconut coffee definitely has coconut flavor and people will definitely smell it in the room (it's not subtle).<br /><br />I love it!<br /><br />NOTICE:  This is a "seasonal" coffee, only available from April - October (or something like that).  I wasn't aware and ran out over the winter, and couldn't get more until April!  So, if you like it, stock up before the winter.

The coconut flavor balances well of that - it's not too heavy, but you can definitely taste it with each sip, and the aroma is pure coconut coffee heaven.<br /><br />This is a "seasonal blend" that is not currently available directly from Green Mountain, but I'm delighted that you can still get it here.  Well worth a try.

It's smooth, scenty, and quite flavorful, but definitely not overpowering. My husband and I LOVE Coconut anything and we will always keep this Island Coconut on hand. I tried making lattes once with coconut pieces in it and it was ok, but if I ever did it again, I would strain out the coconut pieces, but it still wasn't half as good as this coffee. I will buy this coffee until I can't find it anymore because THIS Island Coconut coffee was better than I ever imagined; and I hope they keep this flavor Forever and it's not really just a limited edition!!!

review/text: While I've had bad experiences with other coconut or tropical flavored coffees, this one hits the spot dead on. It doesn't taste artificial or overwhelmingly pina colada-y - instead being plain good coffee with a decent amount of coconut flavor. It is a little on the sweet side, but unless you take your coffee black, cutting back on your sweetener by a bit will make it just right.

It isn't the worst flavored coffee I've ever had, but it ain't a "contenda" for a regular spot on my shelf.<br /><br />I love (and drink) many flavored coffees but I can't see going out of my way for this one again...maybe if I find it on clearance or something.<br /><br />Green Mountain's Pumpkin Spice.. now THERE is a flavored coffee (another limited edition) that is superb (and I stock up with half a dozen or so boxes when its available).  This one?  Meh at best.

review/text: I love coconut.  I love coffee. SO, this coffee should have been a match made in heaven. It smelled absolutely sinful while it brewed.  But, it smelled way better than it tasted.  I guess i should have somehow noticed it was a light roast, instead of my customary medium roast.  The smell of coconut was stronger than the flavor. I will finish them, but i am not likely to order them again.  I think it could be improved with Almond Joy creamer though.
