review/summary: Absolutely incredible! Far better than canned!
review/text: I cannot even describe how amazing this stuff is. I honestly wasn't expecting much for the price, but it is indescribably good. It's far, far better than any canned coconut milk or coconut cream I have ever tried, and it tastes almost exactly like fresh! If you mix it with milk and a little sugar in the blender, it turns into a rich, frothy drink. And it doesn't take much powder to make a cup of coconut cream, so this box really lasts.<br /><br />I will NEVER buy canned coconut milk or cream again!<br /><br />And don't listen to that 2 star review. The reviewer admitted the product is great. They are complaining about the shipping cost, which has NOTHING to do with the quality of the product.

Spend a little more and get a lot more.  Drink a cup or two less coffee in a day and drink this instead.  It tasts rich, smooth, and authentic.  Go green!

review/text: I wish I had read the description a little more carefully, though I'm still not sure I would have gotten it--I received a bunch of packs in the mail, but the picture makes it seem like there will be variety. No, I got a bunch of packs of the same food--maybe one for kittens, but the rest were the same flavor. Well, I have one cat. I don't need seven "trial" packs. I need one. I was hoping for seven different flavors or types. It was disappointing. Maybe the description could be a little clearer; I'm just not sure why anyone would need seven bags of a trial! In any case, I ended up just taking all of them to an animal shelter, and they were happy to have 'em.

review/summary: Great Food
review/text: After searching for the right dog food, I think I have finally found it.  The standard over processed stuff you find in the stores, even the higher end "natural" brands don't even come close to this.  This food is nothing but the real deal.  When you put the water into it, it actually smells like the items in it.  There is no need for extra oils etc.  I have four dogs who start barking as soon as the water goes into it and it soaks.  They can't wait to eat now!  I am going to try all the various flavors.  It took about three weeks for their systems to adjust but now they seem totally fine and have no issues.  If you get worried about their stools, just wait.  You need to introduce this food gradually and you will be rewarded with dogs that seem to have a lot more energy.

review/summary: Best dog food EVER!  Read this!
review/text: I have never written a review for dog food before. But, this product commands some attention! I've been searching for a grain-free food for my two Brussels Griffons for over a year.  They were fed Royal Canin as puppies with the breeder in Wisconsin.  We moved them to Texas and the allergens caused constant ear infections among other things (chewing on feet, licking legs, etc.). We decided to remove food allergies from their diet rather than keep them on steroids and Benedryl. It was bad for them!)  All of the grain-free kibble we introduced gave them loose stools- some required several midnight visits outside! We went high-end with the food (We didn't mind spending top dollar for the prior bagged kibble grain-free foods. tThey were all very expensive), but those processed foods were just too rich for them.  No problems with loose stools with Force because we moved them into it slowly with the Royal Canin (2 weeks). The moment I let them taste the food, they went crazy! They loved it!I was apprehensive about the preparation, but it's actually very easy. I mix up the food and water and require the dogs to lie down and stay while it hydrates.  They have to earn it and they are happy to wait it out!So cool to see these little ones drop to the floor by just asking, "Are you hungry?" 5-10 minutes later, they are LOVING LIFE!!!<br /><br />They LOVE this food. No stomach upset at all.  They both lost the pudginess we struggled with, they are more active, their eyes actually sparkle and the their coats are super shiny! Unbelievable bonus results! Our new puppy will be moved to this food in about a month. I'm eagerly anticipating the results..<br /><br />UPDATE:  Months later: my dogs look like a million bucks! Highly energetic and full of spunk. Latley I add different veggies and fruits to give them new tastes. Nothing I am adding causes stomach upset( cooked carrots, peas, green beans, broccoli, raw apples, bananas, berries, and natural yogurt)I add all of this in small quantities since they are at the perfect and happy weight of 8.5 lbs (male) and 16 lbs (female- she's a big girl!) They know the exact time dinner time should start! I LOVE this food and what it does for our precious animals.<br /><br />Give this food a try. You won't be sorry! Feel free to contact me if you like. I will be happy to give you details about how this food changed my little one's life! Mine too. Still can't believe it!<br /><br />I want to make it clear that Roayal Canin is an upstanding dog food. I beleive that the problems I had with that food in relation to my dogs was the change in environment. I trust the breeders and both have told me that their dogs don't suffer from the nasty allergens that Dallas dogs have! I beleive this to be true. (My Bostoms lived to a very old age but lived on Benedryl- all in Dallas) Since we adopted these beloved Brussels Griffons, we have lived in Dallas and Mexico usisng both dog foods. Symptoms are all consistent with the change of food. Thank you, Honest Kitchen for producing such a fabulous alternative to natural foods that may be too rich for sensitive tummies!

review/summary: Great idea - I just wish my dogs would eat it
review/text: I love the idea of this product, as I really want to feed my dogs "people quality" and natural food. After trying to get them to eat it over the past few weeks, I have given up - they will either taste it and then leave, or smell it and leave. I've tried mixing Stella & Chewy's, real chicken, and crumbled treats into it. I've tried preparing it with a half-water/half-reduced-sodium-chicken-broth mixture. I always used filtered water to prepare it. Nothing I've tried yields a product that my dogs will eat. There's something about the odor and I guess the base taste that they just don't like. I'll give the rest to a friend with dogs and hope her dogs like it.

review/summary: A snack in the right direction...
review/text: I'm very impressed with these little snacks.  I was kind of expecting a `barely there' flavor and yet what I got was anything but that.  The banana vanilla cr&egrave;me is delicious.  It isn't too rich and yet it isn't so subtle that you can barely register the banana.  It comes through loud and clear.  The graham cracker is crisp and serves as the perfect canvas for the cr&egrave;me and it is thick enough to be a nice component all on its own.  For a small yet satisfying snack to help you through those midday cravings, look no further.  At just over 100 calories, these little guys will fill you up without weighing you down.

review/summary: EXCELLENT NEW SNACK!!
review/text: I am very impressed with the new Peanut Butter Grahamfuls by Honey Maid, which I just tried for the first time this week. They are fantastic! The portion is quite generous - enough to tame that hunger that gets you between breakfast and lunch. The graham cracker is very crunchy but does not fall apart when you bite into it. The peanut butter filling is thick and satisfying. The overall flavor is very favorable - a tad sweet but not cloying (like so many prepackaged snack bars are). They are very convenient and tidy to eat, and they really help fill the mid-morning hunger void and carry you through to lunch. I'm an adult but these would make a great snack for kids, too - especially after school to carry a kid through until dinner. Pair one with a few apple slices on the side and you've got it made! I really hope these make it on the market and are not discontinued like so many awesome new products tend to be. I'll be buying them every week! Nice work, Honey Maid!!!

review/text: I had to write this review because it is not fair that there is only one review for these cookies and it is 1 star (I mean, this person is entitled to their review, but it makes these cookies look bad to shoppers on the site bc they rate at one star). Look, I don't even like cookies that much (weird, I know) but I LOVE these. These are thin, chewy, rich chocolate-caramel goodness. Somewhere between toffee and a cookie, really. They go beautifully with coffee, black or oolong tea, or a good book and a rainy day. Plus, how pretty is the name "Florentine Lace"? Are they named that because the recipe comes from Florence? Or because the lace in Florence looks like a melted gob of brown and darker brown? I hope the latter isn't true, for the sake of Florence. But it makes for a delicious cookie. I mean, I'm writing this review and thinking I will buy a tin for the holidays because my family really enjoys them. I just wish they weren't so expensive. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to raid my candy stash for something chocolaty because now I'm craving this stuff, and don't have any around. Thank you, David. Your cookies are awesome.

review/summary: Allow me to add to the OMGSOGOOD  ;)
review/text: These aren't just pretty, they're pretty freakin' awesome...  I saw these at a local store (in a long box [12oz], not a tin), & after seeing the picture on the box that showed what the cookies look like, I found it impossible to leave that store without a box of these -- given that they looked to be (& are) a marriage of some ooooooooooh so interesting layers, & in what looked like (& is) a wonderful 'texture', I just *had* to try these...<br /><br />These not only taste phenomenal, but the fascinating mix of crunch-suddenly-tempered-by-the-next-layer-&-then-chocolate-making-its-way-past-the-yumtastic-top-layer-that-has-softened-in-the-mouth-to-a-more-tack-like-texture-&-tastes-incredible-doing-a-tango-with-the-chocolate results in an experience that had me thinking a combination of, "are you kidding me?!" -and- "where have you been all my life?!" -- how on earth these layers do the magical traversal of textures that they do is perhaps the 8th Wonder of the World -- & all while facilitating a decadent mingling of chocolate & the omg-what-is-it-that-is-combining-to-make-this-magic-happen ingredients (if I didn't know better, I'd think that the manufacturer was 'showing off' ;) ).<br /><br />Well, I wonder no more (though I remain very impressed) -- fascinatingly, & per the ingredient list, part of the 'magic' contributing to the end product's unique form of 'wow' are (crushed, obviously, though possibly ~pulverized into a powder, prior to incorporating into the mix) *CASHEWS* -- the 3rd ingredient listed, after sugar & wheat flour.  Additionally, there is some vanilla, honey, & cinnamon (though I don't specifically taste cinnamon, I wouldn't be surprised if that's part of the can't-put-a-finger-on-it-something that is contributing to the interesting taste of the florentine aspect covering the chocolate.<br /><br />A great quality associated with these cookies is that they hold up after being dunked in a hot liquid (as versus many other cookies, which would crumble or otherwise break apart [& additionally, many cookies would absorb so much of the liquid that the original taste of the cookie would be 'lost' -- which doesn't happen when dunking these Chocolate Florentine Lace cookies in a hot liquid (I tried them with some hot chocolate, & it felt like a luxury to be able to not only dunk them for as long as I did, but to dip them in almost all the way, & not have them either fall apart or melt away from the non-dunked portion)]).<br /><br />Lastly, I happened to have learned that it is possible to alter the original crunch factor, such that it becomes a rather interesting (& frankly, even better, for my taste) 'compressive-crunch' (a kind of tempered crunch, & one that takes on a more 'tack-like' aspect, out of the gate) -- after a late night drive back from visiting family, & accidentally leaving an unopened box of these in the car overnight -- & then during the nearly 90 degree next day -- well, after bringing them back inside, & giving them time to acclimate to ambient indoor temperature (& re-solidify whatever had been a bit melted) -- voila! -- Chocolate Florentine Lace 'Redux' (or, as I now think of it, 'Chocolate Florentine Lace Stackers' -- the heat-&-then-melt-a-little-&-then-cool cycle resulted in the individual stacks of cookies annealing to one another slightly, which was interesting to see, but which I remedied quickly, prior to tasting them, & then finding them to be even *more* appealing than their original form -- somehow, the slight melt & then re-solidification rendered the perfect bit of 'compressive-crunch' that ended up making these downright addictive to me).<br /><br />These are gorgeous cookies, with a terrific taste, a fascinating 'crunch factor', & the ability to withstand being dunked in hot liquid -- plus, to boot, they still taste great after being accidentally left in a car while a nearly 90-degree day ends up melting aspects a bit (& yes, they still *looked* like the beautiful florentine confectionary magic that they looked like prior to their 'heat assault' [thereby earning the title 'Bionic Cookie' ;) ]).  So, without having intended to do so, I seem to have done a form of inadvertent 'extreme temperature trial', which tested (albeit unintentionally) the 'viability' of these cookies in a high temperature environment -- & if they could speak, they would seem to have said, ~'eh, whatever...' (along with a shrug of their shoulders [if cookies had shoulders, that is ;) ]).<br /><br />They're fantastic!<br /><br />(It would seem to be a given that these would hold up if exposed to an extremely cold environment, but if someone out there would like to send a tin to one of the research stations in Antarctica, & report back, that'd be great... ;) )

review/text: After trying lots of different blends in K-Cups over the past couple of years, I've settled on a mix of Tully's French Roast and Newman's Extra Bold as my go-to choices for morning wake up coffees.  Both have a strong, deep flavor that pairs well with weekend waffles and other "sweet" goodies.  It's a shame that the price has gone up so much, but it's not the fault of the coffee.  I'll keep drinking this one -- it's one of my simple pleasures and still much more affordable than picking up a cup at the local espresso stand.

review/summary: LUV This Coffee!
review/text: I'm a big time coffee drinker and I tend to like my coffee strong and Tully's French Roast blend delivers! I'm not going to go into all the details about how it taste like "this or that" because everybody's taste are different. But if you like a strong, not bitter, cup of coffee that will get you going in the morning, then this is for you.

review/text: We normally get Deidrich's French Roast but it is no longer carried in "Subscribe and Save" so I thought a good alternative would be Tully's French Roast.  It's a wee bit stronger than the wife would ideally like, but it's O.K.  Personally, I like it!  (My real favourite is Tully's Italian Roast.)

review/text: I've recently purchased Tully's French Roast K-Cups from Amazon. Well this is the best coffee no bitter after taste, wonderful smell of coffee brewing, very  easy to make.The French roast is a darker coffee for those who like stronger blends.I'd recommend this to all who purchase K-cups .Only bad thing about this product is it goes to fast ,in other words I drink to much of it. LOL  Buy some and enjoy your cup of coffee today.

review/text: I need to say I absolutely love my Kuerig brewing system. French Roast is one my favorite types of roast. I don't want to sound biased, but anyone who loves a strong aromatic coffee would love this kind. I would recommend it to the coffee enthusiast, but that's just me. This won't be so good for those who don't like a very strong, extra bold coffee. If you are one of those who doesn't like a coffee this strong...this isn't for you unfortunately.

review/summary: Great Tasting and affordable
review/text: Addicted to this brand and found this coffee fresh, bold and unbitter.<br />The delivery was super fast and my only complaint is it came in an unmarked box meaning I felt I had to count. But the count was right on & for the savings I'm not complaining so will order again. This coffee being bold but with no aftertaste is one I never tire of it. Everyone who tries this loves it. I find if I brew a small cup makes excellent iced coffee or warm latte. My coffee maker does have size options so considering cost of lattes my homemade version using liquid stevia/almond milk is money saving plus healthy. I have used both plain/flavored stevia and my coffee flavor stays true. All in all addicted and loving every cup.<br /><br />I am adding to review ordered a few days ago and a super charged delivery this was in original package this time and I am a very satisfied customer. Fresh cup in hand while I write this!

When I purchased a small box of this  extra bold coffee, he said it was the best coffee he has ever had...home or in a restaurant!  I purchased this larger box, and he said, "Why don't we put the Keurig in the kitchen, and put our 12 cup coffee maker away"!  He is now having less cups of coffee...enjoying it much more...and absolutely no waste!

review/summary: Dogs Love It, but....  (AVP)
review/text: I ordered this dog food, unaware that our local supermarket sells it cheaper. I tried to cancel right away, but was informed that despite the fact that it hadn't shipped yet, I would not be allowed to cancel. Grandson and I learned that the cans at our Stater Brothers Supermarket are twice the size of these and way more inexpensive. However, the dogs love the Amazon Iams dog food, energetically cleaning their plates, licking every molecule off. It is good dog food, no doubt about that. It smells good and I'm assuming that means it is very good quality. I usually buy Amazon Prime Canadae Dry Dog Food, because it's excellent dog food, but needed to get wet dog food this time, because it disguises the taste of their prescription meds. I have 4 hungry dogs, so quantity does matter. I always appreciate the 2 day free Amazon (Prime) shipping.

review/summary: Dogs love this stuff.
review/text: My two dogs recently switched from iam's lamb and rice dry dog food to this canned food. They love it. As soon as they hear the can open, they run to the kitchen for it. They're at the point now where they simply sit and wag their tails while I put the food in their bowls. After three weeks of this food, compared to the dry food, they scratch less. They poop less. Given their weight, it maps out to two cans a day exactly; which is great. I read through lots of the alternatives, and it would end up being 2.5-3.25 cans of food a day per dog. At that price, plus the fact everything is doubled (remember the two dogs), the cheaper brands end up costing 50% more per month. If you look at it on a price per ounce cost, this is cheaper than the chunked or non-iam's brands.<br /><br />Or to put this into dog speak..................omfg foooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood nom nom nom.

review/text: I purchased this product at our local commissary at the request of the resident BBQ Master, who wanted to replace his usual brand of cumin in his carne asada marinade.  I am glad to report that it was an excellent addition to the recipe, as it added a depth and smokiness to the flavor of the meat that had us all complimenting his BBQ Mastery.  One wouldn't think that a single ingredient could change the flavor of a well-tested and loved recipe so drastically, but this one can and did, and we couldn't be happier!  It is pretty strong, though, so I'd advise others to start out with less and add more as you go, if you need to.<br /><br />We have since used it in various other Mexican and Spanish dishes, and would recommend the McCormick roasted cumin to everyone.

review/text: Our dogs liked them, but be careful of giving them to your dog(s) indoors. The coating gets everywhere. We spent a good amount of time trying to get the color out of our carpets. All flavored rawhides can leave marks here or there, but these are the worst I have every seen.

review/text: I fell in love with the chocolate version of these candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany. A perfect combination of chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer. I thought I might prefer the hazelnut version since I'm not a chocolate lover, but in this case, the chocolate version is better because it offers a better balance of flavors.  The hazelnut cream and milk cream are too uniform, where the chocolate offers a better combination.  These aren't bad; I just prefer the chocolate in this case!

review/text: I ordered these casings, and when they arrived it was NOT the product pictured on this page. I emailed the seller with a question about the shipping and they never returned the email, but the casings arrived a few days later. However, they are LEM casings. I am not sure if they have always been this way and they just re-packaged them, but I could have bought the LEM casings locally for less money. I believed that I was buying a better product, based on the reviews here, but now only time will tell if what they sent me will work as well.

review/summary: imported from China
review/text: Amazon should list the country of origin.  Why can't I have a choice of what country I buy any products from?  Surely there is someone in the USA producing hog casings. The manufacturer of this product assures its casing safety and has a impressive protocol.  I don't mean to deride this company, but they are operating out of a country that has a third world mindset about the cleanliness of processing meat.  It must be a continual up hill battle for them.  Did you know that 90% of all casings are imported from China?  The FDA doesn't recognize imported hog casings as food and has no oversight powers.  You really have to depend on the processor's integrity.  This company may live up to its claims but consider it's sourcing do I want to take the chance?

review/summary: Perfect Casings!
review/text: These came quickly in a rather small package. Being a newbie to sausage making, I thought at first they were sort of small. After following the SIMPLE directions, I cut off about 10-12 inches for a 5 pound pork tenderloin I had ground and seasoned for Italian sausage. Within minutes, I had about a 30 inch or so link of sausage from the short piece of casing AND had much left over! I cooked the sausage that night and it was perfect. The casing holds together perfectly and has the perfect "SNAP" when bitten into or cut. I will keep buying this due to the great quality, quantity and price. If you love sausage like me, nothing tastes better than your own homemade links and these casings help make it the best.

review/summary: Casings
review/text: The company that shipped me these is out of Florida and I live in California. The first time I ordered them it took 4 days (not bad for USPS), the second time 3 days (great). I have used apx 1/2 the product for my first ever sausage making experience. You must soak & rinse prior to use (does not take long, do while prepping other stuff). They are not the easiest to get on the stuffing tube (but I assume that is typical for any casing). I and a friend spent about 4 hours making 3 types of sausage, this product worked well. The only drawback is that if you overstuff & try to twist the sausage rope into links it may burst (this is no fault of the product though). When cooking, this product holds up well & is nice visually (unless you burn them, again no fault of the product). The most important however is that when you bite into the cooked product there is the anticipated snap when you bit through the casing, the casing is not tough and the flavor was only of the sausage stuffed inside.<br />All in all a great product that I will continue to use. I am also trying the sheep casings they sell.

Quiet easy with this casing. I don't have professional tools, i just used a plastic water bottle, cut from the neck. It just works perfectly. I placed another order yesterday. But after that one of my friend offered me some casing from her leftovers. I contact the seller to see whether i can cancel it or not. It is late to cancel it through Amazon site. Seller replied me promptly and canceled my order. I appreciate this great product and seller's consideration.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I just purchased these for my 3 year old daughter and as soon as we got them she wanted to try them. She likes dried fruit, freeze dried fruit, and 100% fruit snacks as well as the "fruit snacks" that don't really have any fruit in them. She tried these and LOVED them. She was begging for more for the rest of the night. I tried one as well and it was very flavorful, I enjoyed it too!<br /><br />There is not a ton in each package (about the same as a bag from the regular boxed "fruit snacks") but I thought it was a good amount for a snack. The package has a re-sealable zipper at the top. It also says it is 1 serving of fruit and that 16 raspberries and 7 slices of apple are used to make it. They are definitely more expensive per package than fruit snacks at the store but the fact that they are one full serving of fruit and all natural made them worth it to me!

review/text: Not big on making food reviews because I almost feel they are waste of time considering people's taste buds can be so different but my gf and I love these Buddy Fruits. She's big on fruit snacks (worse than a 5 yr old) and she has tried probably every single type out there. Raspberry Buddy Fruits are her fav. To me they taste like real fruit not that chemical taste I get from most fruit snacks, they're not like gummy bears a bit harder which I like, and best of all they're very healthy compared to other fruit snacks at your grocery store. Don't feed your kids crap, give these a try.

review/text: I orignally purchased the apple Buddy Fruits bites and they were great--my kids loved them. I decided to try something different and purchased the raspberry and I found them rather unappetizing. First, they are very dark in color, they're actually black, and the taste is really strong. To me they tasted just like very concentrated raisins. The odd thing is, while I found them loathesome, my kids thought they were pretty good (ages 3 and 1). So if your kids aren't too picky they might like them, but if you dislike brushing black goo out of their teeth go for the apple ones.

The chips are fresh, crisp and great tasting; perfect for putting a bag lunch for work or school.<br /><br />NOTE: Bags are made extra thick paper with a plastic lining for freshness and very difficult to open by hand.
