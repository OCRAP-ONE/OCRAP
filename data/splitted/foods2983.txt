review/summary: They work in Keurig machines...
review/text: I freaked out when I saw the strange design of this coffee pod - definitely not your wasteful, landfill-clogging- feeling- guilty- about-  drinking- it K-cup.  However it works just fine in the Keurig machine and produces a rather nice, bold, cup of decaf.  I would rate it beneath the Tully's French Roast and above any other decaf I have had.  I would recommend it and would like to try the regular blends.

review/summary: Great Coffee - Worry about Freshness
review/text: We ordered this product after reading positive reviews about the coffees taste, as we've had trouble finding good tasting decaf k-cups. This product met our high hopes and is our favorite k-cup decaf coffee (surpassing the donut shop decaf).<br /><br />With that said, the only thing from keeping this from a five star rating is the packaging. As others have pointed out, the cups are sealed in 12 packs. So when you open one 12 pack, the others are exposed to air. We are storing the opened cups in a zip lock bag, but only time will tell how the coffee holds up when we get to cup number 11 and 12.<br /><br />Overall, a great product.

review/summary: Great tasting Coffee
review/text: I was really surprised of how 'good' this coffee tasted. It is smooth, rich (not strong/bitter), full flavor great tasting coffee and reasonably priced. I've tried many/various coffees and this-San Francisco Bay Coffee Decaf <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA9S">San Francisco Bay Coffee Decaf One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count</a> is my favorite. My husband likes it too. In fact, he rarely uses the other kinds/brands.  Oh, this may sound terrible, but some of the other brands/coffees when brewing smells like (I hate to say this and I am not being mean or vindictive)...but urine, cat urine. We have a cat thus I associate that smell-aroma to the cat. Although their coffee tastes alright.<br /><br />San Francisco Bay French Roast coffee is our favorite; it has a full rich even sweet flavor, no funky smell-aroma and the best part is the bottom of the "CUP" (K-cup) is paper mesh, NOT plastic...how's that for innovation, ecology and just plain cool? I am not into plastics if possible, I am world/ecology aware and happy that SFB (San Francisco Bay) has it available, Thanks! Try it, you'll love it!

review/summary: Delicious coffee at a great price
review/text: As the k-cup monopoly continues to increase the price for Keurig owners, it is natural that we start looking for alternatives.  With retail prices exceeding $.60 a cup for the Keurig branded k-cups, I was definitely happy to see an alternative!<br /><br />These cups look quite different- more like mini filters than the self enclosed plastic cups that we are used to.  They also are not individually sealed.  However,  I believe the plastic kcup is a patented product, so we can't expect the same thing at a much lower price.<br /><br />I have been using this product for a couple of months and have only good things to say about it.  I keep them in a Ziploc bag after opening the initial package (which is vacuum sealed).  The french roast is a very dark, rich roast an one of the few that I have been happy to brew on the larger cup size.<br /><br />This is the best cup of coffee I have had from my Keurig!  If you prefer milder roasts ("house" or "breakfast" roasts) this french roast might not be for you.  If you need to keep your kcups out in the open, this brand might not be for you.  However, if you love a dark roast and are flexible with storage, this is a great economical product!

Not a greenie-fanatic, but as an interested steward of our planet's resources, I appreciate this company's reduction of plastic use with their innovative cup housing, which also shrinks the package size. Works perfectly in our brewer! Happy to subscribe-and-save to this coffee and we look forward to trying their other offerings.

review/text: Later in the day when watching my caffeine intake, this coffee hits the spot.  All the cups I have made have been delicious.  I also like that the pod is not made out of all that plastic like the K cup.  I prefer my coffee less all the chemicals heated up plastics cast off.  Perfect coffee for decaf drinkers.  I will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Fantastic coffee
review/text: Since kcups are becoming more and more expensive, we've tried some alternative coffees for our Keurig.  These "soft bottom cups" allow easier brewing and I think they make a stronger coffee.  I like the decaf brew, and my husband loves the Fog Chaser.  The only down side is they are not sealed, they have a soft filter bottom and they need to be stored in an airtight container, but who cares if it's cheaper and tastes good?  We will continue to buy from San Francisco.

review/text: Taste is good but very mild.<br /><br />PROS: Economical and contain very little plastic, likely better for the environment for those who do not recycle. Taste is decent but quite weak.<br /><br />CONS: Lack of plastic cup around bottom means the Keurig cannot extract the coffee, so it drips. Coffee, to me, is weak.... but I prefer mine stout. I'm not a fan of the plastic bag you need to keep these in.

review/summary: Fabulous Decaf
review/text: Many decaf coffees are flat and low on taste.  This San Francisco Bay is fantastic--tastes as good as the "high octane."  I also like their non-plastic k-cups--more coffee in each (or so it seems) and better than filtering through plastic like typical k-cups.  A real winner.  We just had guests who are coffee-fanciers--couldn't tell the difference between the regular and decaf (we have both).

You will need to keep these in a sealed container instead of hanging them in one of those countertop holders so the coffee stays fresh and fragrant! This is really good coffee;it compares with coffee brewed in a french press! I buy the French Roast. Have tried others but that French Roast just can't be beat! I drink mostly decaf and I think there is a big difference in decaf coffees. San Francisco Bay French Roast Decaf is as good as it gets!

review/text: When I first received the product, it looked like I bought the wrong thing.  I was looking for K-cup which come in little plastic containers.  These looked almost the right size, but they had a rounded bottom and were made from some form of "filter" material versus the plastic that I had expected.<br /><br />I eventually decided to put one into the machine before tossing the whole thing as having bought the wrong stuff.  Really glad I did.  They are for K-cup.  The coffee has a nice strong, French roast flavor.  The packaging is minimalistic and doesn't look like what I'm used to for K-cups.  I don't know if the added flavor is based on the packaging or the coffee.  Either way, I'm happy with it.

review/text: Good rich decaf. This is how all kcups should be packaged, space saving and stays fresh in a thick foil bag. Use a strong chip-clip to seal the bag, squeeze out the air and the scent is like a fresh bag of coffee beans.

review/summary: Very rich coffee flavor in a DeCaf.
review/text: This coffee has a very rich flavor and excellent taste without the caffeine. For those that like their coffee but find it keeps them awake this could be your answer. I make a pot of coffee in the morning and in the afternoon change to DeCaf to prevent loss of sleep but still enjoy a rich full bodied coffee. One of the only DeCaf coffees I have liked. You have to try San Francisco French Roast DeCaf to truly understand.

review/text: I signed up for monthly shipments of this coffee.  I am so glad I did.  It has the full-bodied flavor that ALL other Keurig coffees do, and the new, non-plastic, filter is more environmentally freindly.  The 36-count is just the perfect amount for me each month, and the price cannot be beat - ANYWHERE !!  Thanks for making this coffee available.

review/summary: Great value - excellent, stronger cup of coffee than most Keurig pods!
review/text: You can't beat the value for these pods - though, because they are packaged in filter-type pods rather than plastic pods, I recommend keeping them in an air-tight container or zip-lock bag once the individual bag is opened to keep them at their maximum freshness.<br /><br />We originally purchased these because of the price, but have recently purchased another (caffeinated) flavor because we loved the taste.  These make an excellent - STRONG - cup of coffee.  Usually we need to use two Keurig pods to brew a larger cup of coffee, but it is not necessary to do so with these.

review/summary: Really pleased with these!
review/text: Once I switched to decaf, I struggled with finding a K-cup that was strong enough. I will admit to brewing at a smaller size (on the more advanced machine) or shutting it off early (on an older model), but I am so pleased with the flavor of this decaf. I love that it has less environmental impact, but my priority for K-cups was definitely the taste. I do recommend keeping them in a sealed container since the filter bottom doesn't protect them from getting stale or absorbing oils in your hands on or in the air.

It is not like any other in that it is not all plastic, it is essentially a "filter" cup, so much more Eco-friendly.<br />Because I drink a large cup of coffee, I often combine this with their Fogcutter regular blend.

review/summary: Easy to Recycle Grounds
review/text: The best thing about these cups is that I can just peel off the lid and invert the "net" filter to recycle my grounds as plant fertilizer.  With traditional K-cups, I have to scrape the sides to get all the coffee ground out--what a pain.  The taste of the French roast is good too, or I wouldn't be wasting my money.  Costco doesn't have decaf K-cups so this SFB is perfect all the way around--taste, cost, decaf, ease of use.  I store each cello bag in an air-tight canister made for sugar/flour.  After I have about 6-8 used cups, I "flip" the coffee out into a carton and dump the grounds immediately in the garden.  So simple.

review/summary: Amazing taste in a funny package
review/text: I'm very particular about the taste of my decaf coffee.  I want it bold and strong and without the decaf aftertaste.  I'm also looking for a great deal on K-cups.<br /><br />I'm sitting here with my very first cup of this coffee, and it is amazing.  The coffee is robust and bold and tastes wonderful.  I just popped the funny-looking container into my Keurig and everything worked just fine.<br /><br />I also love the Subscribe and Save benefits, which result in my coffee costing only .41 per cup.  But being the dollar-stretcher that I am, I also use each K-cup twice:  first brew a large cup, second brew a smaller cup.  This coffee tasted great in both rounds.  So that means I'm down to around .20/cup!  Love that.<br /><br />Great deal.  Great taste.  Highly recommend.

review/text: If you are in search of a light roast coffee that doesn't leave that bitter stank on the back of your tongue, this is definitely one I'd suggest.<br /><br />When I first got it, I hadn't noticed it was pre-ground.  I generally like to grind my own.  It turns out this ground coffee makes a decent cup.<br /><br />It heads a little toward a medium roast flavor, but still is light enough that it doesn't taste burnt like medium and dark roasts tend to.<br /><br />Plus, it leaves a tiny footprint which is nice.

I was so excited to find Maxwell House Blend, Ground Coffee, 31.5-Ounce Container (Pack of 2)for such a good price available for subscription on Amazon.

When it came time for my 2nd shipment to go out, I got an email saying it was delayed, due to lack of inventory. Shortly after that, I received another email saying my subscription was canceled altogether. This has happened 3 times. It is annoying to have this happen, but the pricing is so good, I'm willing to continue to re-subscribe to get my favorite coffee at such a low price.

review/text: I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.  As a tonic for health and energy, I now find myself drinking it daily instead of my usual afternoon coffee. It perks up the body and brain without the jittery effects of caffeine. I find I get a delightful pick-me-up later in the day--when I need it--without the negative affects of keeping me up at night.  While a tad expensive, I will continue to buy SPORtea and enjoy its delicious brew.  It is now a part of my every day routine.

We used to buy apricot preserves from an Amish farming couple  in upstate New York, but they retired last year. A crisis, my husband tried 9 different jams. There was an lovely artisanal one from France but it was nearly twenty dollars a jar! Smuckers was a bargain and it is a decent honest product but a little too sweet for his taste.<br /><br />And then we found Harvest Song on Amazon! Although not cheap with a price halfway between the French jam and Smuckers. It is worth it, with its just right natural flavor, consistency and sunny color.

review/summary: Fiesta Fria tastes great, packaging sucks!
review/text: The product itself is tastes great, but I was extremely disappointed when a little box showed up and "brown stuff" was falling out of it! As I was opening the box lots of "dirt" like material kept falling out of the box and was getting everywhere.  Inside the box all of the plastic bags of loose tea where just crammed in there and where leaking the loose tea leaves all over the place. I can only imagine all of the tea that spilled out as it was shipped before it finally arrived at my house.

review/summary: Want To Pay $31.51 Lb For Loose Tea That's Mediocre At Best?  Then Look No Further
review/text: Holy cow, when I placed my order for 24 individual packets I assumed each packet would yield 1 gallon.  Wrong.  3 Quarts.  Apparently China Mist has taken a different course and screwed the customer out of that extra quart even though all the other brands that offer family size or filter pack tea bags the yield is always 1 gallon.<br />And now for the math...1 box 24 ct China Mist shipped = $35.45.  18 gallon yield = $1.96 per gallon.  Price per pound loose tea = $31.51.  NEVER AGAIN.  First and last purchase I make with China Mist of Arizona.  Especially when their product is mediocre at best anyway.  Give WALTERS BAY & COMPANY a try people.  They make 4 flavors of iced tea and their price which includes shipping and is prime eligible is $30.75 and that buys you 96 1.o oz filter packs...NINETY SIX GALLONS OF TEA.<br /><br />Enough said.  China Mist good riddance.

review/text: I use lots and lots of Italian seasoning in my general cooking.<br /><br />When I ran out of my last supply of dried Italian seasoning, I started looking around and found the prices to be totally ridiculous - that's even if I could find the stuff to begin with. After looking around various stores including the big-box stores and warehouse stores, I settled on buying this. There's a nice mix of the usual Italian flavored seasonings: oregano, marjoram, thyme, basil, rosemary and sage,  No MSG, no salt, no sugar and no stems/no seeds that we don't need.<br /><br />The product was fresh smelling, had a really nice aroma to it and has a pleasant taste that adds to the flavor of all types of foods.  It was exactly what I was looking for and at a reasonable price. It's on my amazon shopping list for next time I need it.

review/text: I use this very frequently in small quantities.  I add it to practically all my soups.  It isn't quite the gourmet quality some prefer, but I don't really care.  For me, the slight improvement is simply not worth the extra cost.  It has more oregano than some of it's competitors (e.g. McCormicks) which I really like.<br /><br />As they note, it really helps to crush the blend before using it (I use a small mortar and pestle) and it takes 15 - 20 minutes of cooking to get the full flavor.

They are crunchy, flavorful and not oversalted (though probably they are?) but like I said they are nice to have around the house. I like to ground these peanuts to almost powder and mix them on some dishes and they never disappoint. Well deserved 4 Stars!

review/summary: BEST NUTS AROUND
review/text: I have always enjoyed Planters nuts.<br />Like John, I live in a wooded area,<br />the hills of WV.<br /><br />I also feed animals: squirrels, birds,<br />rabbits, foxes, coons, ground squirrels,<br />stray cats & dogs, deer, occasionally, a<br />neighbors horse gets loose, & only God knows<br />what else is lurking in those woods.<br /><br />I teach my children to take care of animals.<br />They have a purpose just as humans do.<br />I also teach them that if a stray cat or dog<br />comes around, it is our responsibility to take<br />care of it.<br /><br />We are the only ones on this hill that will.<br />Everyone else runs them off, throws things at them,<br />shoots BB's or bullets at them. Besides, I live at the top.<br />By the time they get here, they are in bad shape, sometimes wounded.<br /><br />I could never sit in my house & eat knowing a<br />starving animal was right outside.<br />I have given the squirrels nuts before.<br /><br />Deer bring their little ones around to show<br />them where the food is. They of course hide<br />in the woods nearby. One time, a baby deer was<br />alone at the usual food spot, there wasn't any corn.<br />He kept looking up at the house.<br />I searched for something to give him. I found something.<br />However, I came too close to him & he ran away. Later, I<br />realized that was stupid since I knew the mother was close.<br />I was surprised she didn't come after me.<br /><br />A fox family was living here when I moved in.<br />The fox was very brave, walking around my yard<br />in daylight. I figured there was a pregnant fox.<br />I was right. They left after the babies were big<br />enough to walk a distance. However, the babies came<br />back about a year later. I taught them that<br />humans could see them in the dark with a flashlight.<br /><br />I knew they were going up higher in the mountains &<br />I knew hunters would be there. I also know that fox<br />are not used for food, but as a trophy. I didn't think<br />they should give their life to hang on a wall.<br /><br />So, if John is crazy, so am I. Maybe even more so.

review/summary: ideal product - tastes great & feels very beneficial + healthy ingredients
review/text: I was scared to try this given many negative comments about various mangosteen juice options, but was pleasantly surprised to find it tastes great.  It's not too sweet which can be a drawback with some juices, and it has the added benefit of a slight tang to the taste (similar to  pineapple type fruits) which makes it more interesting than just plain sweet.<br /><br />Also, I liked that it has no added sweeteners & that it is a good blend of various health-supportive organic juices.  BEST OF ALL THOUGH, I've found over the years that when something is very beneficial, there's a way that my body responds immediately.  This is hard to describe but it's like my body can't wait to take it in & I can feel an immediate beneficial impact regardless of my personal thoughts or biases or taste preferences.  FYI I TRIED & DID NOT LIKE THE <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EKKDHI">Dynamic Health Organic Certified Maqui Juice Blend with Pomegranate, Acai & Mangosteen, 33.8-Ounce</a> - both the taste & the feel of it made me not want to drink it (like my body actually recoils from it) unlike this Now blend where I can't wait to drink more.  I'm not sure why the difference, but I did notice that the Dynamic Health juices were mostly from reconstituted powder so it could be something to do with the processing involved.<br /><br />As I take & have been trying out various products, it's hard to tell what specific improvements this juice resulted in, but overall I've been feeling great & with good energy & better able to handle some detoxification challenges & I think this has contributed to all that.  The other item I tried recently that I've found is making a big difference despite my having noticed no difference from many previously tried forms of B12 including methylcobalamin is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFHP2U">Source Naturals Advanced B-12 Complex, 60 Tablets</a>.  It is more expensive than basic B12 but this specially formulated combination truly seems to make a huge difference so it's another product I'm very glad I tried.  As a lacto-vegetarian (i.e. I eat dairy but no other animal products of any kind including no eggs), good B12 supplementation might be more important in my case but I did hear on the Dr. Oz show that a scarily large % of the population is being found to be deficient in B12.  As this is such a key nutrient, I'm extra glad the Dr. Oz information prompted me to try this B12 out as it clearly makes a huge difference whenever I take it despite thinking I'd already more than covered my bases by supplementing with good multi-vitamins & extra B complex for many years now & so should be getting more than enough B12.<br /><br />So, based on my experience, if budget is an issue, I'd first prioritize making sure your key nutrients are first well covered as that's likely to be more important.  However, if you can also try this juice, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do as it always feels like the ultimate treat thanks to bringing health benefits in a very enjoyable & easily accessible way.  But before I take it, I drink 1 teaspoon of psyllium seed husk in some water as a quick way of adding some fiber to slow down the blood sugar impact of the fruit juices, which is also why I at the time eat 3 teaspoons of sunflower seeds + some Greek yogurt (both also recommended by Dr. Oz), which I further supplement with some protein powder when I have time (again more important because of my vegetarian diet).  I find this combination works ideally as a quick & easy way to start my day with some good all-around nutrition so as to give me time to later put together a healthy meal without excessive hunger skewing my food preferences.  Note that until I found this juice, I rarely drank juices as I figured fresh fruit was usually healthier than juices that can't be immediately consumed upon juicing.  So it's only because this juice combination feels & tastes so good while making a powerful set of rarer fruits easily available to us in an organic & healthy form that I found it worth adding despite the relatively high cost.

review/summary: A perfect sweet snack with coffee or tea
review/text: I consider these bars to be in the same category as store bought packaged cakes as they taste fresh baked, but without the typical trans fat and unappealing artificial ingredients.  They taste great with plenty of cinnamon flavor and a soft and creamy texture.  Much better than a crunchy granola bar or hard sandwich cookie.  I can't find this flavor of Health Valley bar in stores and it is definitely the best, though the vanilla creme-filled chocolate ones are tasty too.  So I ordered a case through Amazon and sent them to my office address so I can enjoy them in the morning with a cup of coffee or tea.  They are a light and healthy alternative to the tempting snacks at my local bakery or coffee shop (which I purchase from time to time) and keep for months so you can store a box at your desk and enjoy them when you have a sugar craving.  I hope Health Valley doesn't stop making them as I only can find them for sale here online.

review/text: These are fine, but I didn't find them wonderful. They made a nice snack mid-day with coffee, but were way too sweet on their own. They also had a slight chemical aftertaste, though I did get used to that by the end (not sure if that's a good thing or not).<br /><br />I wound up giving away most of the boxes to friends who felt about the same--they're not *awful*, but they're not something that I'd repurchase. The texture's a bit grainy, and the bars themselves didn't have much flavor (it was the frosting middle that was so sweet).<br /><br />Instead of picking them up in quantity, I'd start buying just one box to see if you like them first--they're a great price here, but it's a lot of bars to have to eat if you decide they're not for you!<br /><br />Also, I did find they tasted much better if I popped them in the toaster oven for a bit--I wouldn't microwave them. I still wouldn't repurchase, but they were better warm.
