review/summary: nice sun tea
review/text: I discovered the Twinings English Classic Cold Brewed Tea in tea bags last summer and liked it for making sun tea.  I could not find it in my grocery stores this year, so ordered it through Amazon.  My order was delivered promptly, and my only complaint is that I could only get it in a 6 box bundle - in other words 120 tea bags. I won't need to be recordering for a few years, lol!<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained that it isn't completely "natural" tea, and that the Twinings brand has deteriorated from "the good old days" but I guess I am not that much of a tea snob.  It has the English Breakfast tea taste I like and brews up nice and dark as sun tea.  It tastes a lot better than Lipton or any of the store brands.  I let it sit in the sun all day (gets quite hot actually), and then put it in the refrigerator to drink cold, no sugar.

review/summary: The taste keeps changing
review/text: It arrived quickly, nicely packaged, each tea bag is individually wrapped in a sealed wrapper that appears it would protect it in a work bag or purse, probably even against moisture. Nicer packaging than Lipton Cold Brew. It has a tea bag on a string with a tag like many tea bags.<br /><br />Making the tea was easy. In three minutes I had fairly dark tea. I added Splenda and ice. I could not taste it at first, then I noticed a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Initially I was going to order Lipton Cold Brew but this was a spur of the moment purchase. I regret the purchase. I do not like the tea but I don't hate it. I find it interesting that no other review mentions this bitter aftertaste. To me, it really doesn't have much of a tea taste at all.<br /><br />I may donate this to some lady friends that prefer things in pretty packages. I will order the Lipton Cold Brew.<br /><br />========================<br />Second review 3 days<br />========================<br />I took a couple boxes of the tea and donated them to a community breakroom I sometimes frequent at work. The first day, everyone kept asking me where I got the "good tea." I decided to try it again since I was out of Cold Brew.<br /><br />After drinking this tea for three days, I have grown to like it... a lot. No more aftertaste. It has a pleasant tea flavor. One big plus over the Lipton, no yukky brown sediment in the bottom of the glass. Now, I do not regret the purchase.<br /><br />========================<br />Third review one week<br />========================<br />Both of the reviews above are accurate. Does that sound bipolar?<br /><br />At one week, three of the boxes have been used. I donated most of the first three boxes to friends at work, community breakroom, because I did not like the tea. I tried some of the donated tea at work and liked it. At home, I rarely drink cold brew because I prefer to brew tea on the stove.<br /><br />The last two days, I have tried tea from two different boxes at home and every packet has a bitter aftertaste. When I make the tea at work, I notice no aftertaste and it tastes great. I am not sure why the tea made at home tastes so different than the tea made at work. At home, I have tried it with tap water, filtered water from the fridge, water boiled in a pot and bottled water and results are the same....yukky tea. At work, I use the hot water spout from the coffee maker. I use the same type tea mug at work as at home.<br /><br />There is a very significant difference in the taste depending on where I make it. I am not sure why.<br /><br />===========<br />8/14/2012<br />==========<br />I am on my third case of this tea. I really like it, most of the time. The taste keeps changing. On my third order, box #4, I started running into tea bags with that weird taste. It is very citrus-like and strong. I asked a lady friend that also ordered some of the tea after tasting mine and she stated she also ran into a few bags that had the same odd taste. I think Twinings is mixing up some of the tea at the factory and that is why the taste varies sometimes. The citrus tasting tea is so pungent I cannot drink it.

review/text: Fantastic product, that I love to use every day!  In my area, I only found it in the summer, which is too bad, I like iced tea all year long.<br /><br />Unlike  better known brand, this is NEVER bitter, and truly tastes like fresh brewed (which is is).  I would NOT be without this-- great for travel, or at the office as well.<br /><br />Also-- consider the savings over bottled tea!<br /><br />Enjoy!

I cant cook and I dont want anything hot when its 90 something degrees at midnight. This stuff smells good too and isnt too strong. I have a water bottle that holds two normal water bottles. If that makes sense. I just throw two tea bags in there and keep adding water my whole 12 hour shift. I like unsweetened but im sure it would be great sweet too.

review/summary: Flavor additives -- not just tea!
review/text: I was really excited to get this tea, as I'm totally addicted to cold-brewed iced tea and was looking forward to cutting out an overnight steeping of teabags and saving time.  However, when the tea arrived I discovered the ingredients weren't just "tea" -- they also had "natural tea flavor" and "natural flavoring" in each bag. I personally try to avoid additives and flavoring, so I ended up donating all my boxes to my work kitchen.  Bummer.  I'm just going back to using regular tea and steeping overnight now! No weird chemical additives for me, no thank you.

There are clearly leaves in the bag and I've never had any issues with any residues in the box or the tea bags (other reviewer) and I've been drinking this tea for more than 4 year, ordering in bulk.

review/text: This is a wonderful tea. Smooth flavor and ALWAYS consistent quality. I've been drinking this tea every day for the past 4 years and am totally addicted! After years of drinking coffee all day long and being told by my Doctor that I needed to cut back, this is the tea that helped me cut back on my coffee. I still love coffee- but the wonderful, mild flavor of this choice organic oolong tea is so pleasant that I do not need sugar, lemon or anything else to go along with it. I just drink it hot and I enjoy every sip. And, it tastes just as great as a cold tea too! I have recommended this product to everyone I know and it has never disappointed any of us! HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL!

review/summary: Powdery tea
review/text: The pro is that it's marketed as organic. I like that and prefer organic teas. I also saw that it appeared to be a top selling organic oolong item on Amazon, so I was more eager to try it. However, upon receiving it, I realized (through leakage of the tea bags themselves, into the inside and outside of the box) that it appears as mostly a finely milled brown powder with some visible small chopped (?) tea leaves (?). I don't think this is the fault of Amazon (who shipped it very promptly, excellent customer service), but rather just the design of the tea bags. After steeping the tea, it turned a very cloudy color (due to all the finely milled tea particles) which I have never experienced with other oolong teas (I have tried ~5 different brands). I do not want to be drinking such particulate-heavy matter for concern of potential kidney stones! I do not plan to buy this again at all.

review/summary: Nice Bold Earthy Flavor!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this tea! From the minute I first smelled its earthy, nutty scents (with hints of tobacco and leather), I knew it would be a delightful morning tea. I couldn't have been more right. For those who love boldly flavored and earthy teas, this is a must try.<br /><br />As one who has recently given up coffee (got tired of the jitters and crash), I have been searching for teas with bold and robust flavors, like in coffee. I do not exaggerate when I say that this tea has the boldest and most interesting and  complex flavor I've experienced (without the bitterness of many "bold" black teas).<br /><br />Coincidentally, this tea also has nearly as much caffeine as coffee. As with all teas, though, the caffeine absorbs into the bloodstream at a much slower rate, leaving the drinker jitter- and crash-free. (For the curious, this seems due to the fact that the caffeine in tea bonds with the tannins, making it much harder to metabolize.)<br /><br />Thus, this morning mate is not only absolutely delicious for its nutty and earthy, yet smooth, flavor, but is great for concentration and energy. I cannot reccomend it enough, particularly for those looking for boldness from their tea!

It does not taste like coffee but mate has a very distinct taste.  Although the ingredient list is extensive, I think it mostly tastes nutty.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it is not my favorite mate tea-it is a little bitter to be 5 stars.

review/text: I'm a die-hard fan of liquid sucralose (liquid Splenda like EZ-Sweetz), but I heard that erythritol is a much better sweetener for chocolate recipes.  I've used Truvia in three different recipes with cocoa, unsweetened chocolate, and apples, and it improved the flavor dramatically.  I will be using Truvia in recipes where granular sweetener is required and to counteract the aftertaste when using lots of suralose.  A 1:2 or 1:1 ratio of Truvia to liquid sucralose works really well.  It also saves money since Truvia is more expensive.

The individual packets make it easy for me to toss a few in my bag so I'm always ready for a coffee run and are helpful when traveling. I've found that Truvia is much sweeter than Splenda or other sweetener packets, so I would recommend tasting as you add so you don't oversweeten. (I use about 1/2 a pack for a cup of coffee and find that it's about the equivalent of one Splenda packet.

I think it even tastes better than sugar, and definitely tastes better than splenda.<br /><br />I cannot comment as to the health aspects related to artificial sweeteners, but I'm sure that there is plenty of information available on the Internet related to that.<br /><br />As a casual coffee drinker, I highly recommend Truvia!

I reported this to Amazon and they told me they were giving me a full refund for the purchase amount (instead of prorating the original amount) and then told me that since they couldn't accept a return on a grocery item that I should repurchase the item at the new link (this one).  I wish I was making this up.  When I arrived at this new listed item I saw that the total cost was much higher than my original purchase price and wrote Amazon back and told them so.  They then emailed me and told me to repurchase the item and they would refund me the difference. I am obviously very upset at this point, but I go ahead and do as they suggest. Well, lo and behold, after I purchase the item they tell me that they can't refund any difference at all. So I am not only absent the original product, but have been charged more for it. The company has also changed their DBA name from Lakewood Candies LLC to Carbsmart. If anyone wants more info I have screen captures and all emails.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.

review/summary: Better than most - but not great
review/text: I bought some of this and tried several packets. I wanted to like it, I really did. But like all of the aspartame-based sweeteners like Equal and Nutra-sweet, stevia is bitter.  Truvia gets 2 stars because it is markedly less bitter than the others but still not sweet like sugar. The rest of the fake sugars get no stars and some are so bad as to owe stars back, like negative stars.<br /><br />I am probably very sensitive to it but so are many others. So if you find artificial sweeteners bitter, then Truvia will be bitter as well. But splitting it with sugar helps somewhat. The only thing that tastes like cane sugar is cane sugar - or beet sugar or whatever but a non-artificial sweetener.

review/summary: good food but arrived crushed
review/text: I bought this food based on a suggestion from the friendly staff at Petco, and was pleased that my picky pooch absolutely loves this food. The only complaint that I have is that the already very small kibbles (made for small breeds) were mostly pulverized into a powder during delivery, which makes me hesitant to reorder this product from Amazon again. Bummer!

review/summary: Waxy
review/text: Goldenberg's Peanut Chews now boast "Partially Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Oil." This candy, of beloved memory, does not taste the same. Palm kernel oil is not only unhealthy, even worse, it has altered the flavor and texture of the "Chew-ets." In the past, Goldenberg's chews had a great dark chocolate coating, worthy of savoring. The new Peanut Chews have a waxy, overly sweet chocolatish coating. The candy inside is not as satisfyingly tough, richly molasses flavored, or chewy as before. Goldenberg's Peanut Chews remain better than most candies, I'm not going to give them away. These Goldenberg's Peanut Chews do not evoke former, memorable deliciousness like Proust's madelaines.

I've never liked candy bars because they taste like chemicals, but these have no preservatives or artificial flavors and the flavor is outstanding! dark chocolate, caramel and peanuts - and they are vegan too, at least they were. Since they don't have them here in Georgia I have to order them online now, but it is worth it!

review/summary: Best Stevia on the market BY FAR!
review/text: I have to also disagree with the negative review.  I will say that I also experienced one box of this product where some of the packets were half-full... or even empty!  And I also had one or two packets that were clumpy as the other reviewer mentioned... so it's true... this company has a packaging issue.... hopefully they will resolve that soon!<br /><br />Having said that.... this is BY FAR AND AWAY the best tasting Stevia on the market... and trust me... I've tried them all. The other nice thing is that it's bound to Agave Inulin... not dextrose as in some other Stevia extract products (e.g. Stevia in the Raw... probably the worst stevia product I've ever had!).<br /><br />Pyure is a Stevia extract... not the pure powdered form.  Before this product, I had never been able to find a Stevia extract that had the same intense sweetness as the pure white powdered form of Stevia (e.g. SweetLeaf)... but this is it!  And the advantage Pyure offers is no bitter aftertaste... absolutely none!<br /><br />I made hot cocoa with this last night.... 1 tablespoon cocoa powder, 2 packets Pyure, 1 teaspoon of raw coconut nectar (for a caramely flavor), a dash of vanilla, and 8oz milk.... AMAZING! The best hot cocoa I've ever had... sugared or otherwise.<br /><br />Apparently this company is coming out with a Stevia syrup... so I'm anxious to try that.  I noticed one of the ingredients in the Pyure powder is "Natural Flavor"... not sure what that is... but whatever it is... it tastes great!<br /><br />Anyway... I never write reviews, but I am so stoked to find something that tastes every bit as good as sugar... if not better..... I just want this product to survive!

review/summary: No nasty aftertaste(so far)
review/text: I must say that I like this one better than the other similar products I've tried so far. Better for diabetics than most others because it doesn't have dextrose or fructose added(which can still affect blood sugar, since they are sugars).  I made some orange-aid type drink with tangerines, water, and pyure, and it was quite nice and light, with no bitterness.  I'm going to acquire more(a local store has some) and try it more extensively, and if that goes well, it will definitely be added to my regular assortment of Amazon items.

review/summary: Tried a Stevia product before, just put Pyure in my cereal..I'm smilin'!
review/text: I tried a stevia product years ago, it was expensive and MY GOODNESS was it disgusting! Bitter with the most terrible taste. The box is still lurking around somewhere in the pantry. It made me wonder for so long why people are raving about stevia when it is so unbearable. I stuck to liquid Splenda after that. So I was at the grocery store recently and decided I will give stevia another shot.... Pyure got it right. :) is all I have to say! It's sweet and that's it...no bitterness, no strange flavor, no gargling with mouthwash.

review/summary: PYURE ORGANIC STEVIA
review/text: I have tried other Stevia products but have found that the Pyure Organic Stevia Sweetner tastes the best of all I have tried.  All the others tasted bitter or had a significant unpleasant aftertaste.  I have been using Pyure Organic in tea and oatmeal and find it to add just the right amount of sweetness with 1-2 packets.  Since I knew that the product was exactly what I wanted, I ordered the 3,000 count food service size since it was the most economical.  I actually bought the 3,000 count Pyure Organic from Amazon/PYURE BRANDS&lt; LLC, but it seems that the 3,000 count is no longer available through Amazon, so I am posting a review here since it essentially is the same product.<br /><br />Some of the packets had some problems like previous reviewers mentioned-contents caked together, some packets with little or no product inside.  I contacted Pyure Brands and told them of the situation.  Chelsey, the Customer Service rep who answered my email, apologized for the inconvenience, and IMMEDIATELY SHIPPED OUT A REPLACEMENT ORDER.  She also sent me a prepaid label so that I could send back the Pyure I had, inspect it, and resolve why some of the problems mentioned above were happening.  There was absolutely complete trust in what I said, immediate concern, and prompt corrective action taken to fix the problem.  I am convinced that because Pyure Brands is a relatively small American company, they are trying to a better job than their mega-corporation competitors.<br /><br />Where there a few problems?  Yes.  But since I gave them a chance, Pyure Brands came through in flying colors.  I have never written a review before.  The reason I am, is because I firmly believe American companies can provide the best products with the best Customer Service to back them up.  I would without hesitation by Pyure Organic Stevia from Pyure Brands again.

review/summary: If you want a caked-up mess, then this is the sweetener for you.
review/text: I have been on the hunt for the best stevia product that I can use in my coffee, tea, etc., and I was hoping to find something organic that tasted great. I found this product at my local grocery store for a bit less than the price posted here. I bought it and hoped that it would be better than Truvia and Stevita (Stevita is my fave, and it's the least expensive of all the ones I've tried). Unfortunately, the very first packet I opened was horrible. The stevia powder was clumped together in these hard pieces, and even in hot tea, those hard clumps took a  while to dissolve. As if that weren't bad enough, it never completely dissolved in the iced tea I put it in next. The taste is average, and some packets weren't full of clumped product, but I'd say about 70% of the ones I've opened have been clumpy and hard, like sugar that's gotten moist and then dried. Yuk.  When I put it in my coffee, it sits on the top of the coffee like a white film until I stir. And stir. And stir. And stir. Oy. I shall stick with Stevita, which is never clumpy and which costs a lot less than anything else I've tried.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that this type of packaging makes feeding my 9 mo. old simple. When we're out and about, he can suck the food easily out himself.<br /><br />I admit there was some problems when we first tried it-- he would squeeze too much out, etc. But after getting used to sucking (just like a straw), he can do it easily.<br /><br />The food pairings seem odd or gross, but if you taste a bit of it, it's really quite tasty. My boy seems to really like it. I only wish a pack of 6 were a bit cheaper. I can buy 1 unit much cheaper at the local grocers. I would think buying in packs of 6 would allow Amazon to offer it at a better price. Guess not. 3/5 stars due to pricing, product alone, I would give a 5.

review/text: I keep buying this cereal, and then wondering if I should buy it again, only because I absolutely HATE the design of the box.  If only they could change the box to something like Happy Bellies (a nice box with a tight lid that's easy to open and then keep hermetically closed). Earth's Best: please re-think your packaging and you'll have a superior product. I have twin boys and they like the cereal still, but I've just about had enough of 'fighting' with the box to open it ... and then end up ripping it so badly that it doesn't stay tightly closed. Maybe I'll simply change to the Happy Bellies cereal after all ... a few more bucks but hassle free and simply yummy.

review/text: I really love Earths Best, and have used only EB to feed my little one.  This cereal is great, except I would switch back to plain flavor after this box is done.  The banana flavor had a weird smell to it when mixed with the formula (similac alimentum), and also if you're giving it in every bottle, then it can constipate your baby.  So as for EB regular cereal we LOVE it, but the banana flavor not so much.

review/text: The actual cereal is fine, but why on Earth do I need individual packets of it?  I thought I was buying the large box (like the one I bought at Whole Foods).  Instead it was 12 boxes containing individual packets of cereal.  Obviously I should have read the description more closely, but I'm sleep deprived.  The carbon footprint on this is just insane!

review/summary: Sell By Date UNACCEPTABLE!
review/text: First off, these pita chips are the best I've had. This particular flavor is my favorite, and the Stacey's brand is solid across the board. Now, onto my review & update...<br /><br />I ordered the 12-pack of Stacy's Pita Chips on June 18, 2012 and received them two days later. Coincidentally, I had bought another bag at my local grocery store over the weekend. When I received my shipment from Amazon, I was astonished and very upset that all 12 bags' "Sell By" date was Aug 14, 2012, which is less than two months away. Compare that to the bag I bought at the grocery store over the weekend, which had a Dec 02, 2012 "Sell By" date.<br /><br />This would be an great deal if not for the "Sell By" date being so close, but there is NO WAY that I will consume 12 bags in that short time frame. At the very least, these chips should give the consumer three months of freshness. I feel somewhat ripped off.<br /><br />EDIT: Amazon has given me a full refund of my purchase and allowed me to re-order at the same price with free one-day shipping. This is why I'm a loyal Amazon Prime user. Thank you Amazon!

review/text: this is one of our favorite snack foods. It is delicious, tasty, and satisfying. In the grocery stores around here, it sells for $3.99/bag. On Amazon, when buying this product in bulk, it saves us a lot more and we go through it like there's no tomorrow. The Garlic and Parmesan is one of our favorite pita chips. It can get a bit heavy for some if one was to have a party. We'd go with the regular flavor Pita Chips and serve different dips.<br /><br />But for us, the garlic and parm do not need any help from any dips (thus saving us from those double/triple/quadriple dippers and finger lickers!!). Great on its own, great as a compliment to Italian soups

review/summary: Great Kitten Food!
review/text: After experimenting a bit to find dry food all three of my felines would eat, and after reviewing and researching ingredients and labels, I landed on Blue Buffalo's kitten food.  My oldest cat, KatKat, age 3, will sneak eat the kitten's portions.  I don't think it hurts her. All three are healthy, trim, with shiny coats, abundant energy.  I free-feed this food and supplement with wet food in the a.m. and p.m. (amazingly, the best wet food I've found so far Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food, Flaked Fish & Shrimp Feast; it has good ingredients and seems a good value for the price; I am currently waiting on a delivery of Best Feline Friend Canned Cat Food, Tuna Too Cool Recipe--will post a review when the furry ones had a chance to taste-test it).

review/summary: Unfortunately, count me in for "stinky poops"
review/text: I had high hopes for Blue Buffalo Kitten food. I feed all my animals high quality food, my 3 dogs are on Nutro Ultra Holistic (small breed), and unfortunately there is no equivalent for cats. I narrowed my food choices down to Blue, Innova, and Wellness. You get the most Blue Buffalo for the money so that is what I decided to go with. Within days of bringing my 4 month old kitten home from the humane society he developed diarrhea. I chalked it up to stress and switching foods. Imagine my surprise when the diarrhea never went away. I wanted to see if anyone else was having the same problem. Google "Blue Buffalo kitten diarrhea" and you will see others having the same issue. If it's not diarrhea it's smelly poops in general. I wish I knew what was causing this, if it's an ingredient he's allergic to or something else. I just started him on Innova and will update if the diarrhea subsides.<br /><br />My kitten seemed to enjoy the food though, he would gobble it up no problem, life source bits and all. The small kibbles make it easier for a mess to be made if you have a messy eater. If you are going to try this food, just monitor their feces for changes in consistency and smell, as this food has been shown to cause issues in some cats. If my kitten wasn't having issues on this food I would probably give it 5 stars for value, flavor, and ingredients.<br /><br />Edit: After a few weeks on Inova the diarrhea has completely cleared up and not returned! It was definitely Blue Buffalo that caused his issues. I guess this food really isn't for all cats.

review/summary: Allergic? Food gone bad? I don't know, had to go back to Merrick.
review/text: I was excited to use Blue Diamond again because of the reported quality of the ingredients. My old kitty wouldn't touch it- we tried with "trial bags" - so I was excited when the new kitten was home and it was time to get her some food that wasn't Purina cr+p.<br /><br />WHOOO BOY - do I resonate with the reviewer who's poor kitty had stinky poo. As you know, kitties are very clean, and they don't like to stink anywhere. Poor little Sky kitten had the worst farts I've smelled, and that means a human too - and loose stool, she stopped having healthy bowel movements and often cried when she was in her litter box. It was either the treats or the food - and since the food smelled icky, we took a few days and transitioned her to the Merrick Before Grain Chicken. (we kept feeding her the treats so we could find out in a singular fashion what product was causing her distress). As soon as she was on the Merrick for four days - no more stinky kitty, stinky poo or loose stool.<br /><br />Sorry Blue Diamond, I tried!<br />Now I have this huge bag of food, and no idea what to do with it. Sigh. It's like tossing money down the toilet.

We tried for 6 months and I thought we had just gotten a foul smelling kitten the entire time.

review/summary: Thank you Blue!!
review/text: Our kitty is 5 months old, and we got him when he was 11 weeks old. Since day one, he's had terrible gas! We were using the cheaper dry cat food because i was convinced cat food was cat food, but after trying Purina Kitten chow, Meow Mix, Purina Kit and Kibooble, Whiskers, I've realized they're not all the same and that it really is worth spending a little more for a good quality dry cat food. After researching all kinds of dry food online, and being desperate for this cat to stop with the terrible, smelly gas, I decided upon Blue dry kitten food because of its high quality, all natural, no junk added ingredients, and after about a week of him eating this consistently, NO MORE GAS!!!! It's a miracle! His coat is beautiful and shiny, he's lively, energetic, and just a very healthy, non smelly cat! Fabulous product!! Highly recommended by our cat, Tom, and his owners who are no longer afraid to have him sit on their laps or even be in the same room as him :)

review/summary: Three 14-week-old kitties
review/text: Firstly, this is WAY too expensive here on Amazon. My local mom-and-pop pet store has this for $17 for the 7 lb. bag.  I regret getting this here, as I feel a bit ripped off. Two of my kittens are doing fine, but the third is having some major diarrhea, and after doing some research, I suspect it is this food. I am in the process of figuring it out what exactly is the issue. Besides from the Amazon price, and my one sick cat, this food is great. High quality ingredients, and kitties seem to like it!<br /><br />UPDATE 8/18/2012: I believe it was this food that was causing my little kitty to slide into first, where she then proceeded to feel a'something burst. She stopped having issues once we switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X49XC">Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul Dry Food, Chicken Formula, 15 Pound Bag</a>. Also, I gave her a squirt of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8WOC">Nutri-Vet Probiotics with Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil for Cats, 4-Ounce</a> down her throat, and sprinkled it on her new food. Using the probiotics was probably part of why she got better, but I also really think getting her off the Blue Buffalo helped. Kitty is now slid'n into home WITHOUT feelin' something foam!<br /><br />I am still keeping this review at 4 stars because I know this is a great product, and my little one was just overly sensitive.

review/summary: Great kitten food
review/text: When I first received my kitten, we started her on Science Diet. Noticing her stool was not solid(and that it was not a product of changing her diet), we brought her to the vet and discussed possible options.  One thing we considered was slowly transitioning her diet to Blue Buffalo Dry Kitten food.  After we switched her food, the loose stool issue was resolved and she was a happy, healthy little kitten again. We consistently used Blue Buffalo Kitten on our two cats until they reached a year old and did not have any problems whatsoever. Not only did they not have any issues, but they also loved it! I would recommend this product to anyone who has a kitten and desires to give them a balanced diet.  It is a bit more pricey than some of the other brands, but it balances out by giving them the nutrients they need to be healthy and, in turn, minimizing vet bills.

review/summary: Great food!
review/text: We have two five-month-old kittens that we brought home when they were 12 weeks old. We had no trouble transitioning them from their shelter food to Blue Buffalo. Our boys love Blue Buffalo, and it is made of ingredients that I for the most part would be willing to eat. It is about the same price range as some of the fancier brands, but take a look at the ingredient list sometime - there is no "[animal] byproduct meal" in this food - ew! Look at most other brands' ingredient list for comparison - scary stuff!<br /><br />The 7-lb bag lasts us a month - my understanding is that since there's less filler, they actually don't need to eat as much food to get what they need. Our kittens have grown like weeds and are full of energy. They have amazingly shiny coats even though they are only 5 months old. They don't shed as much as I would have expected (granted, this could be partially because of age). One of our kittens does get some smelly farts occasionally, but they, um, don't linger, so we don't mind and neither does he.<br /><br />We supplement with a can of wet a day - Blue canned food is just waaaay too expensive ($1.40 for a small can!), so we use Authority (sold by Petsmart) which has decent ingredients and you can get a big can for $.70 when it's on sale.

review/summary: The winner!
review/text: Transitioned my kittens from Purina One Kitten formula to this brand after researching ingredients of at least a dozen natural kitten dry foods and after reading the (somewhat frightening ) book: " Not Fit For A Dog", which exposes the down side of the pet food industry. I put out a small bowl of Blue Buffalo and the usual amount I had been feeding them of Purina One Kitten.  When I went to fetch the dish, I expected a few nibbles  to be taken of the Blue Buffalo...instead, the dish was completely cleaned up and the Purina left untouched.  After three weeks on a combo wet/dry Blue Buffalo kitten food diet, my kittens look the picture of health, shiny luxurious fur, bright alert eyes, and abundant energy. I realize that this small company sold out to Proctor and Gamble to avoid bankruptcy, but the product continues to be produced in its own facility under the highest quality standards. (Ben and Jerry's did the same thing... and,still wonderful ice cream!).  I highly recommend this (and the price is right on Amazon as well.)

review/text: I am loving this food so far. Or, my cats are. Which means so am I. :) They were on a diet of Purina dry food + Iams canned food before I made the switch. My vet had always said that Purina was up there with all the top name brand foods, so I just took her word for it. After doing my own research, I found that was definitely NOT the case. I switched both of my cats to a Buffalo Blue diet (one eats kitten, the other eats weight control) and they are both happy, healthy kitties. Of course it's more expensive than what you can buy in your local grocery store, but for the health benefits, it's worth it to me. Amazon sells it for exactly the same price as the stores in my area, so I choose to get it shipped--saves me time and gas!

review/summary: The best Kitten food!
review/text: I have been feeding this food to my Ragdoll kittens/cats for years. The Blue Buffalo Spa Selects are the best food I have found for my kitties. I have one that has a sensitive stomach and will not keep any grain foods down. With Blue Buffalo Kitten, she has never gotten sick and loves it! I have Tom that was frequently getting urinary crystals. He hated the Hills Prescription Diet A/D food the vet wanted him to eat, canned or dry, but this stuff he loves. Kittens have grown strong and healthy with beautiful coats!<br />I have noticed also, for anyone considering switching to this food versus most others, because this food is very digestible, they eat less of it, process more of it, and actually seem to use the catbox less! With other grainy foods, they have trouble processing the cornmeal and it just passes through the system, creating more bowel movements, and eating more food. You can even SEE, if you look, the grains in my cats' stool with other brands compared to grain-free brands.<br />This at least is the case with my cats.

review/text: My mom feeds her 5 year old cat, 6 year old Viszla and 6 year old German Shorthair Blue food. Naturally when I moved out and got my own kitten I started him on Blue. He loves both the Healthy Growth as well as the Wilderness Kitten. He is growing like a weed (10 lean pounds at 7 months old) and has so much energy. His coat is soft and shiny and his eyes are bright and clear.<br /><br />This product can be a little more expensive, but it often goes on sale at the pet store. Plus since it is higher in protein you have to feed your animal less than you would with cheaper brands. Make sure you read the serving instructions if you have not tried this food before so you don't overfeed your pet.<br /><br />In short this product is quality food that keeps my little buddy healthy, and when it comes to his health I am glad to pay the little extra $$.

review/summary: Our Finicky Girl Loves Blue!!
review/text: After my husband and I rescued our little girl from the humane society, we found out we had a VERY picky eater on our hands.  Since I am a picky parent, I wanted her to have only the best food.  I wasted money on other top brands that were grain free or minimal grain, all natural, and/or organic.  She hated them all.  Then I found Blue at the Tractor Supply in my county and was a little hesitant to buy due to the price.  Since Blue is all natural AND loaded with the good stuff, cats eat less of it that they do the grain laden cheaper stuff.  So I did some mental math and chose Blue.  She LOVES it!!  She will finish her bowl and meow for more.  All I can say is THANK YOU!  Her picky nature was driving me nuts (and costing me money in uneaten food).  Blue is awesome.  Just ask our little girl.

review/text: I tried this one because it had a cowboy hat on the lid, figuring if I didn't like the sauce the lid would fit one of my favorites.  But I loved the sauce and immediately ordered more bottles.  It has that classic habanero flavor combined with the flavor of jalapeno chipotle.  From the name I thought maybe this sauce was something new like a chiptole made from habanero instead of jalapeno, but it's not.  It's just the combination of the two, and man, what a combo!  This is a great sauce if you like it hot but not so hot that it burns your taste buds.  On a scale of hot where Texas Pete is a 1 and Dave's Insanity sauce is a 10, I'd give this one a 6 or 7.  But if were talking flavor this one is a 10.  Put about a tsp in some chili and it was tasty and spicy, and according to my wife, too hot!

review/summary: Rave reviews
review/text: I didn't get a chance to sample these organic cookies myself, but I sent a box to my sister in law as an advance Easter pick-me-up surprise and they have been a phenomenal hit. The cookies are delicious and look great, and  Beautiful Sweets has a whole variety of themes for year-round occasions.<br />One very minor issue, I wish the product page had specific information about shipping times. It took Beautiful Sweets about a week to ship my order; there's nothing wrong with that, but it would just be nice to know, especially when you're used to Amazon shipping everything so quickly.<br />On the positive side, they emailed with tracking number as soon as the package shipped.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more from Beautiful Sweets in the future. Sister In Law doesn't know it yet, but she's getting the Halloween special!

review/summary: The best wine vinegar
review/text: From the first time I tried this vinegar, more than 10 years ago, I have found it to be the best, am so happy to be able to buy it on line, since none of the stores in my area are carrying it anymore.As far as I am concerned there is no substitute.

review/summary: just okay, that's all
review/text: The photos made me think I would get more product, but it is probably only good for a pot or so.  Makes a great gift, if money is no object.  Will look for more quantity on my next purchase, which will probably be a "hands on" affair.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: We've always just gone with the regular pimiento stuffed olives and tried this on a whim.  We like olives and we like chorizo.  Combined, it was be good and it definitely was!  Granted, you can't really discern the chorizo taste on its own but something about the combination of the two just makes it delicious.  We eat it on its own or sliced up to top a salad or in recipes that calls for olives.  Either way, it's good!

review/summary: NOT AS ADVERTISED
review/text: Product was advertised as a 1.4Lb. package. I received a package that contained 6.2ozs. at a cost of $23.84, making the cost $3.84 per oz.,I could purchase a fresh Beef Steak for less than the price I was charged. What happened to the missing 1.38Lbs. that I ordered and paid for?

review/summary: Like a drug!
review/text: Several in each pack.<br />Amazing taste.<br />Amazing supply.<br />Pure bliss.<br /><br />These are actually rare in my neighborhood and my father and I LOVE them. I bought a box for his birthday and they quickly disappeared. I believe there's three sticks per pack, but man- they go quick. You can easily chomp down one after another, they don't fill you and the flavor- OH the flavor.<br /><br />Seriously... these things are amazing. The packaging is nothing to complain about, neither is the display. A perfect product, one might say.

review/summary: Better than the rest.
review/text: Kazoozles are my absoute favorite candy! the cented is this thick blue paste which is sweet and tart and the same time. But they dont taste like any wonka sweetart candy flavor! the outside is a red gummy tube that is also sweet and gummy.  The chewy outside and the pastey inside together is heaven in your mouth! Shipping was alson great! it arrived three days early! That made the enjoyment sooooo much better.
