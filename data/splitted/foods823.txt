review/summary: Affordable, deep rich flavor, and organic
review/text: I've ordered dozens of dark coffees and tried them all in both a Cuisinart 12-cup machine and a glass vacuum pot. The flavors, the oil content, and the bitterness differ dramatically based on how dark coffees are brewed. In the Cuisinart, you get a darn good cup of coffee for a autobrew system... but it will never taste the same as the same coffee brewed in a vacuum pot. This Peruvian Dark, done in the Cuisinart, has some light bitterness (as others have complained about...), a moderate oil content on the top of each cup, and the flavor is good-to-great. In the glass vacuum pot with water run through a Brita, it's the greatest coffee I've ordered and our favorite for winter mornings! No bitterness, a complexity that makes you savor the flavor, and a smell that fills the house. Use a coffee mug with a thin lip - Starbucks sells several. Like wine, you want it to spread across your tongue and open up all the flavor you can get out of it. I recommend this coffee, especially if you're going to brew it in a way that optimizes it's flavors!

review/text: I have been drinking this coffee for at least a couple of years.  It's a strong-tasting coffee, which is just what I like.  It's not the BEST coffee I've ever tasted (I'm a major coffee snob), but it's good, everyday coffee, and the price is right for an organic coffee (especially with Subscribe & Save).

review/summary: Super Coffee!
review/text: I wanted an organic coffee to try so I thought, based on the reviews, I would try this!  To my surprise, the reviews were right!  It has to be the best coffee I have ever tried.  My husband has been buying roasted coffee from someone locally that everyone raves about.  He tried this coffee and he says it is way better than the locally fresh roasted coffee he has been getting.  Every time he has a cup, he says "this is excellent coffee".  We've been buying it for a year now and I'm getting pretty tired of him saying that, but, he is right!  We can't use the 2 lbs up very fast so we freeze most of it in glass jars and just take it out and grind it each time we make it.  It stays tasting great to the last bean!

review/summary: Just right for your everyday bean
review/text: Sense memories evocative of one's childhood are just too strong to fight against. Such is the strength of the delicious aroma that greeted me when I ground my first sample of this bean. It took me back to my six-year-old self waiting in line with mother at the A & P, smelling the grind of the eight o'clock beans that were being pulverized in that giant red machine.  Have I had better coffee in my life? yes. Did I pay much more for it? also yes.  However, this is the best I can find for this price point. For me I like a dark aromatic roast, a healthy long shelf life, and a coffee that will stand lingering in the pot for over an hour, in case I forget about it, and not turn into bitter motor oil sludge. For these my three critical desires in a coffee; this coffee is the perfect "everyday" bean.

review/summary: I see all the rave reviews, but I have to bash it...
review/text: Dark roast is its own league...the amino profiles of the beans change considerably.  But with that said, I've had high altitude dark roasts that were much better.  In fact, this coffee STINKS when you open the bag and sniff the beans.  I ground it coarsely and used a french press...poured in about 20 seconds...and guess what...it still doesn't smell good.  Drinking it black, it's smooth, not bitter, but flat on the palette.  I don't understand all the rave reviews...this coffee sucks.  I'd rather drink pre-ground maxwell house that's been sitting around for 30 minutes (yuck).  Maybe you can cook with it (in caramel since its not bitter, maybe) but I wouldn't bother drinking it...it sucks.  There is considerable crema and oil...but the taste is flat.  I also ordered Lavazza (Tierra) for moka "espresso" but it brews up better than almost every other bean I've tried.  Also Cameron's Organic "toasted southern pecan" coffee really surprised me (I don't like flavored coffees)...I love it.  Save your $$ and avoid these beans...get a brazilian dark roast instead...

review/summary: The BEST balsamic reduction ever!
review/text: I picked up a large bottle of this stuf at Costco for a killer deal a couple of months ago.  It is FANTASTIC!  Layer sliced tomatos with basil and mozzarella and drizzle this on top...utterly amazing.  I looked on Amazon and found several types of Balsamic reduction/galze, and unfortunately the Blaze is only in small bottles.  I ordered 2 small bottles and I also ordered a different brand from Italy.  Blaze is much much better.  The other one doesn't taste bad, its just not as good.<br />I think this stuff tastes just like a very good bottle of aged balsamic, with a touch more sweetness and a gooey consistency (not honey gooey, more like watered down syrup gooey)...just enough to stick where you drizzle it.<br /><br />FANTASTIC flavor...cant' say this enough.<br /><br />The other brand (although highly spouted on Amazon reviews) tasted a bit yeasty for balsamic, and also contained other things like red wine vinegar in the listed ingredients...Blaze does not.

review/summary: Winner in my taste off
review/text: After 60-some years, I qualify myself to attest to the nature of peanut butter. I love peanut butter. Smooth or crunchy?  ... either is fine. I've made my own peanut butter in the blender. I've sampled peanut butters from Africa, Europe, Australia and Asia. They are all interesting and every country seems to have its national favorite. I picked up a hankering for peanut butter sauced spaghetti in China. The g-kids love it, the wife and kids ... not so much ... it's the concept of peanut butter that I appreciate.<br /><br />In the US we have the giants of peanut butter ...  Jif, Skippy and Peter Pan (JSPP). Some stores carry a designer peanut butter brand at a premium price. In the end, the consistently barely discernible difference among JSPP is marginally irrelevant. Does anyone say `I hate Jif but love Skippy?'  No. JSPP at the lowest price delivers the commodity equivalently. I would doubt that a blind taste test could discriminate among JSPP.<br /><br />In the US market dominated by JSPP, Planters just seems to appear as a butter out of peanut land. I don't think I have ever seen Mr. Peanut on a peanut butter jar before (or, I could just not remember). Was this new? Was it `different? Well, here's what the Planters web site says:<br /><br />"Peanut butter had some growing up to do. And as the reigning peanut experts, who better to make it happen than Planters? After all, isn't it about time for a more sophisticated peanut butter?"<br /><br />Taste test result:<br />1. Planters is smoother. It rolls of the butter knife without tearing a hole in the bread.<br />2. I taste and smell more concentrated peanut flavor.<br />3. Planters doesn't tend to clump and hang off the uvula requiring milk to resolve (although milk is certainly my recommended choice for beverage pairing).<br />4. In my 'blind taste test', Planters wins. It is a noticeably better taste and less mouth desiccating.<br /><br />Decision:<br />Planters has something different to add to the grocery landscape of JSPP. 5-star good peanut butter and my new first choice (if the price is right).<br /><br />p.s. My wife, out of the blue, said "Hey, that peanut butter you got is the best peanut butter I've ever tasted!" ... that's a "wow!" vote.

review/summary: Rich, smooth roasted peanut flavor
review/text: I tend to gravitate towards "natural" or "homestyle" peanut butter, free of sugars and other additives, but I could not pass up the opportunity to try Planters Creamy Peanut Butter. I was shocked to discover a bold, super smooth, fresh roasted peanut taste, more robust and subtle than sweet. I had to exercise some self-control, in an effort to avoid eating an entire jar in one sitting.<br /><br />Here is a complete breakdown of nutritional value and ingredients:<br /><br />Serving Size: (32g) 2 tbsps<br />Calories: 180<br />Fat Calories: 140<br />Total Fat: 15g (23%)<br />Saturated Fat: 2.5g (13%)<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Polyunsat Fat: 4.5g<br />Monounsat Fat: 7g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg (0%)<br />Sodium: 150mg (6%)<br />Total Carb: 8g (3%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 2g (8%)<br />Sugars: 3g<br />Protein: 8g<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Roasted peanuts, sugar, *hydrogenated vegetable oils (rapeseed, cottonseed, and soybean oils), salt<br /><br />*One note: the label does not indicate whether the oils are "fully-" or "parially-" hydrogenated, which does make a difference -- "partially-" being the dreaded trans fats.<br /><br />Overall, a super tasty peanut butter that will compete with any other brand out there. My only deduction is for the added hydrogenated oils and sugar, which, although a nominal amount, is still unnecessary. As I mentioned above, I prefer the unadulterated peanut butters out there. But Planters Creamy will definitely satisfy even the most finicky of eaters, and make the perfect compliment to any jelly.

review/summary: Now that's some TASTY peanut butter!
review/text: Since peanut butter preference is in the mouth of the beholder, I'll sum up what I liked about this Planters brand:<br /><br />(1) There was no oily aftertaste. In some variations, the oil separates from the peanut butter and makes it taste strange or look "sweaty" but I didn't notice that here.<br /><br />(2) Planters has a very smooth consistency. Some peanut butters rip up the bread you're using or require a dental pick to remove it from your teeth because they stick like glue...Planters didn't do this.<br /><br />(3) While trying other peanut butter brands, there were some that added ingredients such as molasses...I was glad to see Planters had no additional flavorings.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this peanut butter very much. It made several delicious PB&J sandwiches, and it's the perfect companion for a lonely Hershey bar.<br /><br />Recommended!

review/text: I caught a whiff of real peanutty flavor as soon as I pulled the protective seal off of the jar the first time.  Ah!!!<br /><br />This peanut butter is smooth, very smooth.  That is, it's not at all likely to tear up a piece of bread you are trying to spread it onto, even lightweight white bread.  And it tastes great!  This product may have made me a Planters Peanut butter fan!  I liked the flavor so much that I found myself dipping a table knife into the jar, spreading it the peanut butter onto some bread, and then sticking the knife back into the jar for an extra dollop that I plopped into my mouth.<br /><br />Oh, mentioned something about the smooth consistency of this peanut butter earlier, but what I really like is that there is no oil seeping out of the mix like I have seen in some other brands.  It looks, spreads, and tastes like Planters really got the recipe right!<br /><br />Here's to Mr. Peanut!<br /><br />5 stars for this tasty, spreadable peanut butter!

It's certainly a good, tasty peanut butter brand, I was just hoping for something a little different from everything else out there.<br /><br />I'd still give it 3.5 out of 5 if half-stars were permitted.

review/text: PLANTERS PEANUT BUTTER -- CREAMY<br /><br />Peanut butter rocks no matter how you enjoy it.  There is nothing in the world like a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich on soft bread, washed down with a tall cold glass of milk.  Another favorite is celery sticks loaded with peanut butter.  How about an apple cut into crisp slices and dipped into peanut butter?  Or homemade peanut butter cookies?  And the best ever -- a toasted English muffin, slathered in peanut butter and topped with honey?  The list goes on and on -<br /><br />Planters Peanut Butter is simply the best I have ever had -- and I mean the best and creamiest peanut butter.  JIF is good, Peter Pan is good, Skippy is good, but Planters is THE BEST.  Undeniably the best peanut butter I have ever had.  The consistency of the peanut butter is so smooth and creamy.  Your bread will not tear while you are spreading it on thickly.  The taste is so full of peanut goodness and flavor.  The smell?  Divine!<br /><br />The packaging is bright and eye-catching, with good old Mr. Peanut tipping his hat to you.  By the way, Mr. Peanut was created by a grade school boy, Antonio Gentile, in 1916.  He has been changed and updated over the years, but is still the same and easy to recognize peanut he has been for all these years.  Planters was established in the early 1900's by an Italian immigrant, Amedeo Obici, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  The company and their products have been around all this time due to their excellent and quality products.<br /><br />I had my 30 year old daughter blind taste test for me today.  I put a dab of Planters on a cracker, a dab of my former peanut butter on another cracker.  Hands down, Planters won.  She loved it.  She wanted to take my jar home, but no way, honey, no way.  Mommy isn't sharing this stuff!!!!  Wellll -- maybe I will share since VINE was kind enough to send six 16.3 ounce jars instead of the one promised. Wow, what a great surprise!<br /><br />This peanut butter is excellent and should be in your pantry as a staple.  If you are a peanut butter lover - and who isn't? -- this is the stuff for you!<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pam

review/summary: Everyone has a favorite peanut butter, and this one might be a contender for yours.
review/text: Like most of the people selecting this product for review, I have a long history with peanut butter and a definite preference in brands. But in recent years I've been stepping out on Jif because it is so processed and sweet, so I was delighted to review Planters creamy.<br /><br />My mom was the real peanut butter lover in the family. She believed that it was its own food group, one that needed eating each and every day. She also believed that peanut butter toast was a viable choice for breakfast, lunch OR dinner. In fact, as a kid I saw and heard so much peanut butter consumed that for most of my childhood years, I refused to touch the stuff. But a high school boyfriend wooing me with impromptu pb&j picnics got me to eat it, and I have it probably once a week, now.<br /><br />I think the taste quality of this is very high; very peanutty and not as sugary as most standard creamy brands. It tastes great with jam on toast, but isn't quite as strong in a sandwich, probably because of that lack of sugar to amp up the flavor. It's a more grown-up taste than Skippy or Jif, but still much more processed than the naturals that require stirring and tear up your bread (I like those too, don't get me wrong).<br /><br />As I said, I've been buying all kinds of brands for at least five years, so I am no longer a brand loyalist who is going to make a big switch. Price will probably be a big factor my buying decision. But this is a quality product that is very delicious to eat.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: Almost without noticing, I'd stopped eating peanut butter in recent years. Perhaps because I'd often combined it with some delicious but rather unhealthy jelly.<br /><br />I tried this product and it's won me back. The Planters peanut butter truly is creamy--not pasty and dry--and tastes great even by itself. Great for a quick, healthy pick-me-up, easy to have just a spoonful... or two....<br /><br />Altogether: excellent. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Better than most other brands
review/text: The taste of Planters Peanut Butter reminds me of the taste of "Peter Pan" from 20 years ago. The Creamy is simply that, creamy. There is a good, but not overpowering peanut taste, also it is not too sweet tasing either.  Its interesting the copy said that Vine members would be sent one 16.3oz. jar to try, I was sent a case of 6(six) jars which will be enough to last me quite a while. Kraft has done a good job with this product and it will be interesting to see if it can compete with the other brands on the market.

review/summary: Bitter taste and oily
review/text: I bought Planter's creamy PB since I'm a big fan of their packaged roasted nuts.  I was hoping to find a tasty peanut butter from Planter's as well, but this product just tastes bad.  First, it looks really shiny in the package.  It does spread well, but it's so oily--and I'm not talking about the natural variety either--that it slides off the sides of the bread.  I suppose this might be related to the fact that hydrogenated vegetable oil is the third ingredient on the list.<br /><br />Second, this peanut butter leaves a bitter aftertaste.  It doesn't really taste right.  I had to take a drink of water after every single bite to get the piece of cinnamon raisin toast I experimented with down.  It wasn't the cinnamon raisin bread I used either because I have bought the same brand--Sunmaid--for years.<br /><br />I do believe I will be sticking with my usual brand of peanut butter from here out.  I've never had an issue with Jif, the brand I typically buy, tasting bad. It's too bad because the price was really good on the Planter's brand.

review/summary: A Decent, Everyday Peanut Butter
review/text: I've  been a Skippy Creamy peanut butter consumer for many decades, and I decided to give Planters Creamy Peanut Butter a try to see whether it might be preferable. Here are my observations:<br />1. I was unable to differentiate the taste of the two products in admittedly unscientific taste comparisions. Both  are a pinch  too sweet.<br /><br />2. Ingredients:  Exactly the same (though the proportions are not specified).<br /><br />3. Health: I'm not a nutritionist, so I'll just quote a comparison per serving (2 Tablespoons) from the two  products in the following categories: Total Fat: Skippy: 16 grams, Planters: 15 grams. Sodium: Both 150mg. Saturated Fat: Skippy 3 grams, Planters: 2.5 grams.<br /><br />4. Price: I was unable to make a reliable comparison on amazon.com. Had hoped there would be two competing offers for six  16.3 oz jars, but no such luck.  I'm going to check at my local (NYC) supermarket and see if there's a difference.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'll probably be guided by price, since in the other categories the differences were too minimal to be much of a consideration.

review/text: After Planters released this peanut butter, I wanted to try it. As a fan of Jif peanut butter for years I was eager to try this. Peanut butter doesn't last long in our house.<br />Planters peanut butter delivers taste and consistency.  The smooth and creamy spread is full of roasted peanut taste. It is not too sweet and not too salty, just right. As a cheap source of protein and a go to lunch staple, Planters will be in our pantry from now on.

review/summary: Tasty, Unnatural Sustenance
review/text: I'm an active guy and I have a ridiculous requirement for calories and protein. The Planters Creamy peanut butter provides just this in bulk. Of course, like most other modern peanut butters, the Planters variety is an unnaturally ultra smooth spread with unnaturally ingredients (partially hydrogenated oils). If it was natural, there would be some texture and I'd have to mix up the oils and peanut goodness every time I wanted to make a PB&J. As is, I can just plop a clump of this beige yumminess right down on my homemade bread, add some unnaturally sweet jam, and voila! I have a quick meal, and most importantly, calories. If you're on a budget and can't afford the real stuff, this will do, but don't expect ideal health after consistent consumption.

review/summary: PB is PB, so let's talk about something else
review/text: For me, peanut butter is peanut butter. I put it on wheat toast every morning and that keeps me from being hungry until lunchtime.<br /><br />So... let's talk about the packaging. I hate the packaging! I'm so tired of trying to hack my way into products like mayonnaise, cereal, cream cheese and now, peanut butter. I speared the protective foil cover with a knife and then tried to tear it off. The adhesive is so strong that I just can't get that last rim of it off the jar. So, the PB makes a mess every time I draw the knife out of the jar.<br /><br />Sounds petty, I know, but I don't need another morning hassle. My house brand is just fine with me, thank you very much.

Very glad I tried it.<br /><br />Since I was only supposed to get one jar (Vine Program Reviewer) and ended up getting six jars, I made my monster cookie recipe. The cookies contain peanut butter, chocolate chips, oatmeal and M&M's. Planters peanut butter flavor came through. Better than the previous brand I used. Will buy Planters from now on.

Looking at other peanut butters, most of the popular ones do seem to have a lot of sugar. But this one tastes sweeter than the others I have tried recently in comparison. And that, to me, is not a good thing.

review/summary: Good Product, but a Me-Too
review/text: My household has now eaten a jar of Planters creamy peanut butter and deemed it to be slightly lighter/smoother (i.e. a less-dense paste) and slightly more peanut-y than our current favorite, Jif. When it came time to open a new jar, we chose another jar of Planters.<br /><br />The ingredients (including hydrogenated oils) and Nutrition Facts for Planters are similar to Jif. The Planters package is a bit smaller (16.3-oz vs. Jif's 18-oz) so watch the price. Also watch the expiration date -- mine arrived in September with a best-by date of November. The bottom line is it's a "me too" product alongside numerous others on the grocery-store shelf.

review/summary: Excellent and very peanuty.
review/text: For many years I've been buying Skippy peanut butter, and found it better than pretty much anything else I tried. Even the natural and organic bands I found lacking in comparison. So when this came up on Vine I was skeptical, but gave it a shot. And I'm glad I did. Both my wife and I like Planters Creamy more than Skippy, and my wife was raised on it. Planters has a deeper peanut flavor, with notes of a somewhat darker roast than either Skppy or Peter Pan (which we don't really like but got for the sake of comparison). The planters isn't quite as smooth as Skippy, but that's not really a detriment to enjoying it. I prefer the somewhat more robust texture of Planters. The flavor, whether on its own or in a sandwich with butter and strawberry jam, is excellent, intensely peanuty, with very good mouthfeel. We haven;t tried it in any recipes yet, but we're looking forward to doing that too. Altogether, Planters is a surprising improvement in a category we thought was a settled matter. It's our new go-to peanut butter, and highly recommended.

review/summary: Spreadable and aromatic, but lacking vitamins
review/text: Compared to popular brandd Peter Pan, Jiff, and Skippy regular creamy, the Planters creamy seems to have very comparable fat content as well as sugar and sodium contents. However, it only shows 4% iron, while the others had other vitamins listed, so compared to the others, this one has the least vitamin value.<br /><br />It is by Kraft foods. I haven't noticed any amount of flowing oil in the container... just very spreadable peanut butter. It has very pleasant aroma, although I enjoy all the others as well.<br /><br />Here is what it says on the label for those more meticulous about nutrition facts:<br />serving size 2 tbsp, servings about 14<br />Calories 180, Fat Cal 140<br />Per serving DV:<br />Total fat 23%<br />Cholest 0%<br />Sodium 5%<br />Total carb 3%<br />Protein 8g<br />Iron 4%<br /><br />Ingredients: roasted peanuts, sugar, hydrogenated vegetable oil (rapeseed, cottonseed, and soybean oils), salt<br /><br />Enjoy this whole pound (per canister) of peanut butter. :)

review/summary: Spreadable, but salty
review/text: This is one of the better peanut butters out there, particularly if you aim is to have a nice, consistent spreadable peanut butter. It is smoother in this regard than Jif.<br /><br />However, Planters is a bit saltier. Since I use little salt on food, it my be my own preference, but compared to my favorite (again, Jif) Planters is a bit more salty. I think this may have something to do with the "robustness" that people report with this particular peanut butter - think salted peanuts. Jif, on the other hand, tends to be sweeter, and thicker. Simply Jif has even less salt, and uses Molasses as one of the sweeteners - which I really like. But these two peanut butters are otherwise worlds apart.<br /><br />It does have a nice, fresh taste that separates it from some other brands on the market. It is definitely a 4-star peanut butter - I would give it a try.

review/summary: Late to the PB party...
review/text: So I hated peanut butter as a kid. Even the smell used to bother me. Somewhere along the way though I started liking nuts in general and then peanuts. Even now I won't chow down on a PB sandwich or anything. But I do like it in homemade cold sesame noodles. I use it other dishes as well. If this seems like a narrow catergory to base a review on, it probably is. That said, since I'm pretty particular about PB and the taste in general, I think this is one of the better ones I've tried. There are some I just can't abide at all.  My kids seem to be far less judgmental in regards to PB and have accepted this without comment either way. When prompted, they said it was fine but didn't really seem to notice the difference. One did say it was saltier than the usual ones, maybe that's why it seems good for cooking for me.

review/text: How wrong can peanut butter go, really?  I'd think a major company would have to work at peanut butter to make it terrible, so you know with the name Planters attached, the hope is that this peanut butter will actually taste like their famous dry roasted peanuts and not "just" peanut butter.  And that's the weird surprise: when you first taste it, that "dry roasted" flavor isn't so strong, but it comes on a little stronger the more you chew your sandwich.  And sure enough, it really, really does taste like those great peanuts we all love.<br /><br />Also of note is how soft and creamy the peanut butter is.  It's supremely spreadable even on the softest bread.  Consider me and my family very impressed after a week with the Planters peanut butter.

review/summary: A solid contender against my family's favorite brand. Good peanut butter.
review/text: We are big peanut butter fans in our household, dedicated to our favorite brand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E4S850">Skippy Peanut Butter, Creamy, 16.3-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)|Skippy Creamy</a>, which we've been eating for years. As a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001651228">Planters Peanuts, Salted, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 144)|Planters Peanuts</a>, though, I was eager to give this a shot. It's quite good.<br /><br />I ran a taste test in my family, having them blind sample peanut butter of each brand. Interesting, my husband and son came up with different answers as to which tasted "more like peanuts", and my son (who is 14) misidentified which sample was from the brand he has been eating for years. Both found both peanut butters quite good and could not pick a favorite.<br /><br />I agree with my husband that Planters has a stronger "peanut" flavor, though I think that Skippy has a stronger flavor overall. I think Skippy has a far more powerful scent. In terms of texture, both were beautifully creamy. There may be a little bit more oil in the Planter's peanut butter, but it did not impact the flavor. The Skippy is higher in fat (and calories).<br /><br />This is definitely a product that I would buy, and my family (who have rejected other brands) have demonstrated that they will consume it happily.<br /><br />***<br />Edited on November 1 to add that it is a major annoyance that the design of the bottom makes it all but impossible to extract all of the product. The texture around the base defies knives. Downgraded from 5 to 4 stars accordingly.

review/text: I was delighted to have the opportunity to review this peanut butter, because I happen to be a bit of a PB addict. I consume a lot of it. Planter's has entered this market with a bang, in my opinion. This is some of the best-tasting PB I have ever had. It has the peanut taste without the bitterness and without the sweetness that some other PBs include. It does not have an overwhelming aftertaste, which I think is a good thing. The texture is extra-creamy, which makes it very spreadable (and spoonable) and easily swallowed. You don't feel like you need to wash it down. This is yummy stuff!<br /><br />I did a label comparison with the PB I have been buying for years, which is a low-fat creamy style. Interestingly, Planters has fewer calories, fewer carbs, and more dietary fiber - more fat, of course, but not a huge amount.<br /><br />Guess what - I have a new peanut butter. Nice job, Planter's!

review/summary: "Makes the best peanut-butter toast ever!"
review/text: said my daughter at breakfast this morning. Normally, we are Skippy fans, but this definitely has that traditional Planters taste, and it's so smooth it spreads very easily. This means little ones can make their own sandwiches---hurrah!<br /><br />A side-by-side comparison with Skippy shows that Planters has all of the same ingredients in the same order: roasted peanuts, sugar, oils, salt. Skippy is slightly higher in total and saturated fats: 25% and 15%, vs. Planters 23% and 13%. Everything else is pretty much equal, although Planters does have an extra gram of protein (8g).<br /><br />Having said all that, I am shopping based on my wallet more than my tastebuds these days. Right now, Amazon has Planters listed  at nearly an extra buck a jar (for a six-pack), so I've knocked off a star.  It's good, but probably not *that* good.  If you see it on sale or have coupons, grab it; otherwise, you're probably just fine with a cheaper brand.

review/summary: Planters enters the peanut butter fray
review/text: To me, Planters creamy peanut butter is not that different from brands like Jif and Peter Pan. It's creamy (as advertised), thick, probably loaded with too much sugar for its own good, and delicious if you like this All-American food. Planters peanut butter may have a slightly more nutty taste than its competitors, but not by much. Also, at 16.3 ounces, this jar of peanut butter is not too big or too small; it's just the right amount in my opinion.<br /><br />As a testament to how good Planters peanut butter is, I purchased it at the grocery store after receiving it via Amazon's Vine program. I suppose Planters didn't necessarily need to flood the peanut butter market even further, but another good brand to choose from doesn't hurt anybody.

review/summary: Tastes Just Like the Peanuts!
review/text: We are pretty particular about our peanut butter brand. We are willing to use store brands for many things, but peanut butter has to be one of the top brands, and we're leery of trying new brands.  But, we have always chosen Planters when it comes to snack peanuts. So, there was no hesitation for us when the opportunity arose to try Planters peanut butter.<br /><br />- Quality - I would definitely equate the Planters quality to the other top brands of peanut butter.<br />- Texture - Planters Creamy is very creamy and smooth.<br />- Taste - I was surprised to taste this and find that, apart from texture, I might as well have been biting into a spoonful of Planters peanuts, probably with a leaning toward the honey roasted flavor (one of my favorites). The "purity" and cleanness of that flavor definitely causes this peanut butter to rank very high in my book.<br /><br />My husband and I actually liked the Planters better than our typical brand. When tasting it by itself, all of my kids preferred our typical brand, but when eating the Planters on sandwiches and crackers, they said it was great and that they couldn't really discern major differences that would cause them to prefer one over the other.<br /><br />I also use peanut butter a great deal for cooking purposes. I made granola bars with the Planters, just to see if there was a difference. The butter, honey, and peanut butter mixture was somewhat creamier during boiling, but there was no real quality or taste difference in the final product.<br /><br />I'm not sure that taste alone would entice us to switch to Planters simply because there is not a significant enough difference. But, if in price comparison we found Planters to be less expensive, even from one shopping trip to the next, we would readily purchase the Planters instead of our current brand.

review/summary: Tastes Good, Wish It Wasn't Hydrogenated
review/text: This peanut butter had a great aroma and very pleasing taste. It has minimal sugar, salt and oil and the creamy texture was perfect.<br /><br />My only disappointment was that the oil used was hydrogenated soybean oil; that means I have to be careful not to share it with my soy-intolerant friends and it mars my otherwise excellent record of staying away from unhealthy hydrogenated oils.

review/summary: Good peanut butter
review/text: I'll start off by admitting that I'm not incredibly picky when it comes to peanut butter.  Tastewise, Planters is very comparable to the major name-brand peanut butters (Skippy, Jif, Peter Pan), and tends toward the less-sweet end of that spectrum (Jif, for example, I find to be somewhat sweeter than the Planters).<br /><br />From a consistency standpoint, I'd say Planters is a bit smoother than most of the major brands, and significantly smoother than store brands (Aldi, Kroger, Walmart, etc....I find the big difference between name brand and store brand peanut butter is the consistency/texture, rather than the flavor).  So it spreads more easily and is easier to eat off a spoon, for example, than the store brands.<br /><br />I don't think the difference is life changing, so I'd probably make my judgment mostly on price, but I do think this is very good peanut butter, so if you are picky with respect to taste, and especially texture, this is good stuff.<br /><br />Finally, my wife made a batch of peanut butter cookies with the Planters, and we could tell absolutely no difference between cookies made with Planters and cookies made with the Aldi store brand.  So for baking, I'd go with whatever is cheapest.

review/text: This peanut butter is what one would expect for the brand: good peanut flavor and nice creamy texture. However, upon reading the ingredients list I noticed it had hydrogenated oils so I don't think in this day and age one should consume that. There are plenty of other peanut butter options out there just as good but without funny ingredients.

review/summary: "Kraft Food With Planters Peanut Butter Will Give The Others A Run For Their Money"
review/text: Distributed by Kraft Foods Global Inc we have "PLANTERS CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER" (16.3oz), packed with six jars, which Amazon sent my way through the Vine Program.<br /><br />* 1st -- This is a very creamy and smooth product, which is on the plus side.<br />* 2nd -- The quality is certainly up there with other brands, maybe a little higher. Just unscrew the lid and take a whiff and smell fresh peanuts.<br />* 3rd -- Most importantly is the taste, with a flavor that will satisfy your taste buds, nuff said.<br /><br />Reminds me of my days growing up with all the good natural foods that Grandma use to serve.<br /><br />My Grandchildren Tommy and Ava live with me and my wife (Judy), we gave it the taste test<br />with our regular brand and Planters passed with flying colors.<br /><br />Each member of my family use this with snacks, on celery, apples and of course Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches,<br />so we gave it the works and Planters came up a Winner!<br /><br />In closing - My Entire Family - Highly recommends.

review/summary: Not sweet enough
review/text: I found this peanut butter very disappointing.  It's *okay*, but I much prefer Jif.  We did a taste comparison.  Jif is significantly sweeter and gives you that yummy sweet and salty peanut butter taste.  This is not sweet like that at all, not even a little.  The planters does have a much stronger taste of peanuts and it is much smoother.  I think it's the molasses in Jif that makes a difference.  This peanut butter does not have any.  This tastes more like Skippy to me.  In the end, it's a question of taste.  Do you like your peanut butter sweet or do you like it to have a stronger peanut taste?  My husband and I did not care for this, and we will be buying Jif instead.  One good thing I did notice is that Planters has 10 less calories than Jif, 1 less gram of fat, and 1 more gram of protein.

review/text: Nice spreadable consistency, good flavor -- though a bit on the sweet side for my taste -- nice basic peanut butter.  I compared the nutrition label to that of a jar of Adams No-Stir creamy that I had and was surprised to find that the Planters peanut butter was lower in calories and sodium than the Adams.  The carbs were a couple of grams higher per serving but this has sugar added to it while the Adams does not.  The added sugar makes this peanut butter sweeter than what I am used to but overall a good-tasting product.

review/text: i would think one of the larger companies that specializes in a variety of nuts would have exceptionally good peanut butter.  the problem i have is one that other reviewers address and that is added sugar, oil and salt.  personally i don't believe peanut butter should have sugar and/or salt in it at all.  with all the variety of peanut butters out there, certainly some taste better than others, but basically peanut butter is peanut butter.  i'll stick to the brands that just have peanuts for ingredients.  but everyone's taste is different and by these reviews, many like this brand.

review/summary: So Creamy and Smooth, Great for Baking as Well as Sandwiches!
review/text: I haven't had Planters for a while but I've always loved their roasted peanuts. I like how subtle the taste of Planters is, not overly sweet and strong the way Jif and Skippy are. I haven't had creamy peanut butter like this in a long time. Even the smooth version of Jif tends to clump, but not the Planters one - it's amazing easy to spread on bread. I also used half a cup of it for a chicken with peanut sauce recipe, and it was ideal. Because it's so smooth, it creates the perfect batter.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon Vine's generosity, I received 6 whole jars. However, my joy turned to disappointment when I saw that the expiration date on all six jars is November 11, 2011. My guess is that Amazon was trying to get rid of back inventory and decided to give it to Vine reviewers. I know peanut butter doesn't spoil easily, but most jars are dated at least two years ahead. So I'm tempted now to use up the butter as fast as possible. Oh well...

review/summary: comparable to Skippy
review/text: Well, this is nothing to write home about, if you are used eating Skippy of Jif or something like that then this is just fine, that's why I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars instead of less, the reason for possibly having gone lower than a 3 is as follows.  There was no nutritional information or ingredients listed on the Amazon page so I had no idea when I ordered this that it contained hydrogenated oil and added sugar, making this a peanut butter that we will not get again as we try to avoid both of those things, there is no reason why peanut butter needs to have anything other than peanuts and salt in it.  I guess I would have hoped the first name in peanuts would have been smarter about making a peanut butter and gone with a natural one instead a sugar laden, transfat containing (less than 1 gram so they don't have to list it) spread.

review/summary: Very good taste, but the heath concious beware
review/text: I taste tested Planters creamy peanut butter against two other brands of PB I have on my shelf. Skippy, Natural-SuperChunk and Smuckers's Natural Chunky. I separated out the peanut chunks from the chunky versions. The Planters was much smoother-almost buttery and slightly sweet. The others were grainy and thick. The Planters seemed to melt in my mouth.<br /><br />On the down side, the Planters contains "hydrogenated vegetable oil".  The label does not indicate "fully" or "partially" hydrogenated vegetable oil. This is an important distinction, as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil will contain trans-fat, but fully will not. Trans-fat has been implicated in heart disease (New York City has banned its use in restaurants). The Planters label says 0 trans- fat, but legally, the manufacturer is allowed to list 0 grams of trans-fat if the total amount in a serving is less than .5 grams. Therefore, until the manufacturer clearly labels the oil as 'fully' hydrogenated oil, eating this peanut butter every day might not be a great thing for your heart.<br /><br />Incidentally, the natural peanut butters I mentioned above do not have hydrogenated vegetable oil listed on their labels (but the Skippy, due to having palm oil in it, has 5 percent more saturated fat then the Planters-not good either!).

review/summary: Very creamy, but also hydrogenated
review/text: There are so many brands to choose from when it comes to peanut butter, but when I see the name Planters, I know it's a brand I can count on. I mean who doesn't associate peanuts and Planters?<br /><br />Overall, Planters Creamy peanut butter is very creamy and I was very impressed at how easily it spreads onto bread. There was no clumping or oil separation and this tastes great on sandwiches or as a spoonful right out of the jar. It's not as sweet as other peanut butters, which many may prefer.<br /><br />I do have to agree with another reviewer who was disappointed that the oil used was hydrogenated soybean oil. This means the oil was treated with hydrogen gas to increase shelf life and change texture, which also elevates your "bad" cholesterol and lowers your "good" cholesterol. Be sure to watch your intake of trans-fats as the American Heart Association recommends consuming less than 2 grams a day.

review/summary: Strange...
review/text: Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say "man I can sure go for some raman", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars.

review/summary: Not Ground Coffee
review/text: I purchased this product thinking it was ground coffee.  Not so.  If you are looking for ground...look elsewhere.  This is instant coffee and not great at that.

review/summary: YUCKY!!
review/text: It is instant coffee in a K-Cup, once the instant is done melting (or whatever instant does) clear water comes thru.  I opened the one I tried and it was an empty cup, not one single grain/ground of coffee.  I have such a hard time finding decent dark roast and was thrilled at this price, I didn't (shame on me) read the customers reviews.  If I had I would not have wasted my money. I am touching 60 and that had to be the worst cup of coffee I have ever had.

review/text: If I could have it would have had no stars. This should never have been called coffee and Amazon should never had listed it as a k-cup I will stick with the keurig site or green mountain from now on for my k-cups.

review/summary: instant coffee in a k cup!
review/text: This is the cheapest k cup coffee in Amazon. It taste & is an instant coffee. Dark Roast does come out dark in color & nothing else in taste, no scent of coffee in the air. Opened the used k cup & has no coffee ground in it.<br />40+ k cups left yet. Using the smallest Keurig cup size & brew 2 k cups for each mug.

review/summary: It breaks the coffee maker
review/text: It is bad enough that it tastes bad, but it seriously affected the Keurig coffee maker. Mine stopped working until I did all kinds of cleaning to try to get it to work again.  Tried it a second time and the same thing happened - that was how I KNOW it is this coffee, not the coffee maker.<br /><br />Don't buy this unless you want to risk having your expensive coffee maker break.

review/text: Grove Square Coffee is not a great product.  I was very unhappy with this coffee.  It did not work well in my Keurig coffee maker.  It often got clogged, and had a poor consistency.  This product, although priced well, is not up to Amazon standards.

review/text: This is instant coffee.. After receiving 4x 24 packs and trying it i realized that the k-cup was empty after the brew.<br /><br />Marketing people at grove Square pulled a good one, they call it "soluble" coffee... clever<br />anyone wants 95 k-cups before i toss them?  (no returns on grocery items)<br /><br />Amazon please add "instant coffee" to your description

review/summary: read the box
review/text: I found Grovers Square at my supermarket this week and decided to try it strictly based on cost. It's not bad at all if all you have is a keurig machine and 8 bucks (for the 18 cup box)!  Plus, my kids and I love, love, love the cappaccino!  By the way, yes, it is instant coffee.... the box even says so! Read before you buy.

review/summary: I threw it all away.
review/text: You get what you pay for.  I couldn't resist the price of this coffee.  It was much less expensive, but how bad can coffee be?  Try this and you will know just how bad it can get.  Just after it started to brew I noticed the "brew" coming from the Keurig was nearly clear water.  Not a good sign.  It tasted terrible, just like the old instant coffee I drank 30 years ago.  I cut open the cup, there was nothing left inside.  It was instant coffee.  Then I cut open an unused cup and, sure enough, it looked just like the instant coffee I drank 30 years ago - coffee crystals not coffee grounds.  I read the packaging more carefully, and, in fact, it does say it is instant coffee.  Well, aren't all k-cups instant?  Don't waste your money.  Horrible stuff.

review/text: Seriously the WORST coffee I have ever tasted.  I am a huge Amazon fan but I learned my lesson with this one... READ the REVIEWS and the product description carefully!  I never would have thought that a k cup could be instant coffee so I didn't really take note of the parenthetical description but I wish I had.  Now we're stuck with 36 of these nasty things.  I even took a box to work because med students will mooch anything but even those world class scavengers won't drink this swill.  DO NOT buy this unless you are a closet Nescafe fan.

review/summary: RIP-OFF!  NOT K-CUPS AT ALL!  INSTANT COFFEE
review/text: The company who owns the K-Cup patent is suing the company behind this item.  While Amazon and many other merchants have listed as "K-Cups" they in fact are instant coffee without a filter.  Yep, shake it, you'll hear that instant coffee sound.<br /><br />According to a CNBC report "Treehouse does not refer to its coffee cartridges, which use a different technology, as a "K-cup," a term used by Green Mountain."  A different technology?  It's instant coffee - and terrible at that.

review/summary: This is Instant coffee!! Misrepresented!!
review/text: I have not been this incensed in a long time about a product's misrepresentation.  The primary advantage of a Keurig is not that it heats water, which can be used to make tea, hot chocolate, etc., it is that it can make real, BREWED coffee by the cup.  This product advertises itself as dark brew coffee, at an attractive price.  It is instant coffee and should be labeled as such!

review/text: If you love the old "Sanka" instant coffee from years ago than this product is for you.  However, if you are like the rest of us who like a good cup of "joe" in morning get us going then STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!  Good coffee usually urges you for more.....this is crying "no more please...I can't bear the pain much longer".  Absolutely disgusting!!
