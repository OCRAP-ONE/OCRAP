review/summary: The best!
review/text: I started drinking this tea after a Doctor of alternative medicine recommended it to cure a Yeast Infection. It worked! I did not had to do to a GYN to cure my yeast infection. Also, it helped me in other way. After I started drinking the tea I stopped craving sugar. Needless to say, I lost like 15 pounds while drinking it. Is amazing and very medicinal. It also helps me with menstrual cramps. I love it! You can find it here online or in any natural health food store near you.

review/summary: IT WORKS  FOR ME
review/text: I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck

review/summary: No more breast milk!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.

review/text: I heard about drinking sage tea on the Dr. Oz show. Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again.

review/summary: Great for colicky acid reflux babies
review/text: We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.

review/summary: Recommended by herbalist--love it.
review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

review/text: I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

If you eat out, you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in, and you do not have to worry about missing a dose.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/text: I have tried several types of matcha and other forms of green tea, all of which were decent but nothing that compares to this! Now, I'm not a specialist on ceremonial grade matcha (I am simply a green tea enthusiast), but I do know what to look for when determining quality. This matcha arrives in a sealed silver bag, labeled with the type of matcha it is. This bag is within the tin, which has a small plastic cap in order to keep the matcha fresh. Then the tin's actual cap fits on snugly. It is exactly like the picture shows, the dimension of the tin are a little difficult to tell from the picture, but it stands at a little over 2 inches tall (approximately 5.5cm) and the diameter of the tin is a little under 2 inches (~5cm).<br /><br />Upon opening the bag containing the matcha, I immediately noticed the difference between this kind and others I have tried. It is a vibrant green with a very pleasant aroma, slightly sweet smelling. After making myself a cup of usucha, I am very impressed. Some types of matcha I have tried tend to have a little bit of a bitter after taste, but this Uji blended matcha is very smooth. If you are unfamiliar with how to prepare usucha, Theanine gives a brief description under "Important Information" on the product page. There are also plenty of videos online if you're confused =)<br /><br />**Update**<br />I've made about 30 cups of tea and I might have enough left to make one or two more cups.

review/summary: My girls loved this
review/text: My girls loved this although it did take getting used to the texture.  The texture is thicker and chunkier than other stage three foods and is perfect for transitioning to solids.  I fed them this until they were 15 months old.  Now they are 19 months old and from time to time somebody still goes in the cabinet and brings me a jar to feed them.  Better than I expected!

review/summary: My kid loves this stuff!
review/text: Who knew that my 1 year old would love broccoli this much???<br />I'm thrilled that he likes this puree of broccoli, zucchini, peas, and couscous. It's a chunkier style than many other purees, so it's definitely something to try once your baby does well with the stage 2 foods. It doesn't have the big chunks like the chicken & stars meal or the carrot & corn one, but it's got a "bumpy" texture because of the broccoli and the couscous, so your baby needs to be OK with that thicker texture.<br />This particular blend is difficult to find, so we buy in bulk whenever it's available.

review/summary: OK product but didn't fit our dietary needs
review/text: My son is unique in that he has an allergy to carrots.  It is extremely difficult to find dinner blends that don't contain them!  I looked over the Earth's Best website to find ingredients and picked this product because carrots were lower down on the list of ingredients.  (Some blended in is okay.)  This still had small carrot chunks throughout!  Pulling them out makes this product much less than 6 oz.  My son still likes this product, even if it doesn't agree with him, and I stand by the quality of Earth's Best.  But is it too much to ask for a product without carrots????

review/text: My baby girl choked on this!!  She had been eating food for sometime and even had food "from the table".  I packed this because we were going to a local festival and was worried there wouldn't be much there she would be able to eat.  She appeared to be chewing the spaghetti and seemed just fine.  All of a sudden she began choking and I had to clear her throat.  The spaghetti had "gummed up" and formed a ball in the back of her throat.  The experience was absolutely horrible.  Please keep a close eye on your little one if you choose to feed this and be sure to feed extra slow!

review/text: This product was disappointing to me because it contained wheat. There were no ingredients on the product details page but I assumed since it was a vegetable dish it would be okay. My son is not specifically allergic but I don't like to give it to him as he spits up more. So, I'll likely not be getting it again. Also, it's extremely bland and not as good as the fresh stuff I make. But in a bind, it's a good meal I guess.

review/text: I use baby food as a supplement to my dog's diet.  I have a 15 yr old lab and 2 year old chihuahua and I feed them both baby food mixed with their dry kibble about 3x a week. I also feed it to them plain as an occasional treat. It's a good source of fiber.  I just make sure it doesn't contain anything I wouldn't feed them from the table.  It's a nice way to help get them more fiber and because the product is organic, I know there are no chemicals inside.  It's good for their diet and they love it as treat and it's healthy for them.  Way better than the processed treats you can by at the store.

review/summary: Grand'aroma Marinata - Excellent for salmon, other seafoods
review/text: Grand'aroma Marinata Flavored Extra Virgin Olive oil is the best you'll find.  I basted it on salmon for a New Year's Eve dinner and it was excellent, the best tasting salmon I ever ate.  It gives wonderful flavor and works great on all type of fish/seafood.  It is very light and tasty and is not salty or bitter.  It has all the great spices already in it.  I purchased it locally and the shop went out of business (I got in a shower gift kitchen basket) and loved it, but was unable to purchase since then.  I held onto the bottle and just typed in the name after I was unable to get anywhere typing name of company on bottle.  This is really great olive oil and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to cook fish.  I put in on the salmon with nothing else, put under broiler and it was done in a very short time and tasted excellent.  I did add a little S&P to my taste also.  It works great to use in a cruet to make your dressings for salads also.  I give it a 5*.  Thank you.  DP

review/summary: honey stinger 1.3oz gels
review/text: I've been road biking and consuming energy gels for almost ten years. I can tell you that they're not all created equally.<br />Some have high amounts of caffeine and sugar(bad sugar) that give you the shakes and an almost hallucinogenic state after<br />really long rides. The Honey Stinger gels are not like this. They keep your energy up, are easy to eat with a little water after.<br />Often, I consume half, and then finish it a while later depending on the effort. The only negative is that they are not cheap!<br />If they were 1/2 the price I would buy twice as much. Too bad they have no deals like this. Also they are great as a work<br />energy booster.
