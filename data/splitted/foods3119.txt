review/summary: Terrible
review/text: Would give 0 stars if I could. I ordered these mangoes on the strength of the other reviews and the fact that I had tried and liked the Barefruit cinnamon apple snacks. Unfortunately, the order I recieved was awful. The fruit isn't crispy--it has a tough, leathery texture that is totally unappealing. Worse, there is a strong, bitter aftertaste that is hard to get out of your mouth. No one in my house will eat these, not even my son who loves all kinds of dried fruit. I am very sorry I wasted my money on this product. I was hoping for something light and crispy like the apples. Can anyone give me any suggestions for something better?

review/summary: No truffles - and maybe not organic either
review/text: I benchmarked many truffle oils before ordering this one.  I ordered it because it is organic, and the only ingredients listed are Olive Oil and Black Truffles.  When my order arrived, I noted that there was no indication on the labeling that the product was organic.  Also, the ingredient was listed on the label as "black truffle aroma".  Black truffle aroma is a manufactured product, not natural, and is chemically induced by bubbling chemical gases in the oil.  There are no truffles used in manufacture.  I am not an expert on what is "organic", but bubbling chemicals into an oil to induce an artificial flavor does not seem "organic" to me.  Buyer beware!

review/summary: fine substitute for the hard to find Senseo
review/text: The Senseo pods are, at the time of this writing, unavailable anywhere.  Not in stores, not from Amazon, not from Senseo.  According to Senseo customer service, they will be available "this summer", but only through Amazon and Senseo.com.  No longer in retail stores in the US market. These Melitta pods work fine in my Senseo machine.  Good froth on top, look just like the senseo pods.  I have a few senseo pods left; might do a side by side taste comparison.  Anyway, at time of writing Amazon is out of stock on these Melitta pods; everyone else must have heard they'd work in their Senseo machines and are buying them up.  If you look in most retail stores you won't find them; currently they are only available in Walmarts. Walmart's website will tell you if the store nearest you has these in stock.  Melitta's website says they will expand into other retail stores soon.  Good news, because I have lost all confidence in Senseo for making their pods online only.  I've always ordered them online but not everyone wants to buy 6 bags/case at a time, especially if they like to have a bag of regular and a bag of decaf going.  Then they'd have 12 bags in the pantry.  How silly.<br /><br />Editd to add: Melitta makes two kinds of pods, this one in a bag like Senseo's, and another in a box.  If you are shopping for Senseo replacements, buy this one (in bag). The boxed variety don't fit.

review/summary: It replaces Senseo coffee pods and is a fine alternative!
review/text: Senseo coffee pods are frequently difficult to find in stock at our local stores and now that Amazon no longer offers subscription service, I decided to try the MELITTA Coffee pods because they fit the Phillips Senseo Coffee Maker Machine.  Guess I should stock up to avoid "out-of-stock" or "discontinued" situations again because we use our Phillips Coffee Pod Maker Machine several times every day.  That said, if the cost of these coffee pods keep rising, we just may switch to another brand of coffee pod machine or depend entirely on our automatic coffee maker for a good hot cup of java.

review/summary: Bitter and not as good as Senseo Dark
review/text: I don't like these near as much as the Senseo dark pods.  I noticed immediately they have a more bitter taste and require half and half to taste decent.  They do make a nice froth and I got used to the taste after a couple packages.  However, I was going in expecting them to taste the same and they definitely do not.  Unfortunately Senseo has pulled out of the US market so these are what we get.  It is better than nothing though, and at least they are available locally.  It looks like the Senseo pods are back in stock but they went up by 33%.

review/summary: Made for Senseo
review/text: The Senseo pods made by Sarah Lee have reportedly been discontinued and are almost impossible to find. Melitta has introduced a new series of pods that are designed to be used in the Senseo and fit perfectly.The packaging and appearance of the pods are very similar to the former Senseo pods. Melitta has also produced a series of pods in the past which are too big for the Senseo machines and do not fit without forcing. Please be sure to order the Melitta pods which are designed to be used in the Senseo. The Keurig machine completely dominates the market for single serve coffee makers and most coffee producers have discontinued making pods for the Senseo. Just when I thought I would have to junk my Senseo machine, Melitta introduced a new line of pods for the Senseo.

review/text: I had the subscription of the senseo dark roast one day Amazon stock went out. So I tried Baronet and Melitta.<br />Melitta is the closest you can get from senseo dark roast, but if you want to go beyond that I recommend Baronet, the coffee flavor is stronger and you can smell the coffee far away.

review/text: After reading the review of others I decided to give these a try.  I was out of Senseo coffee, and it was not available (I see it has since come back into stock).  I either needed to find an alternative or retire my trusty Senseo machine.  This was on sale, so I decided to give it a try.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I thought it had a great rich taste, and it fit my machine perfectly. This is available in Subscribe & Save, making it an even better price.  All-in-all I have been quite pleased.

review/summary: Awesome coffee from Amazon
review/text: Used to use Senseo dark roast and loved it.  When Senseo left us high and dry, I tried several other options, including the coffee duck, it was ok, just a little more work and mess.  Wolfgang puck was good but didn't fit exactly right to get the double cup.  Then I found Melitta, BETTER than Senseo.  I hope Melitta doesn't fade away or jack up the price, Senseo did that before it disappeared. That will send me back to perking a pot.  Try it, it's delicious, full bodied, satisfying, rich dark roast with the creamy foam we love..  Love it.  Also, love having it delivered automatically once a month, another great perk when you shop at Amazon.

Some people might complain that its not that strong and that, like me, have to use 2 coffee pods when they make their coffee, but I actually find that to be a plus. I am the only one in my house who drinks coffee so these are great.  I also feel that when I am making coffee for others, specially my mom, they tend to like their coffee on the weak side, and even one coffee pod is too strong for them when used with 10oz of water. I prefer my coffee strong and 2 coffee pods used with 10oz is just amazing.

Then Walmart quit selling Senseo, and Amazon quit selling it.  And where I could find it, it was Way too Expensive.<br />So I decided to try Melitta Coffee Pods.  Really they are Every Bit as Good or Better than Senseo Coffee Pods.<br />I like the Medium Roast.  It is Very Mellow, and smooth.

review/text: I still have about 8 pods of Senseo Columbian left. Not sure why Columbian packaging since it was the last one left in my Sumatran batch. Never noticed when I placed in storage after purchase. Obviously I like dark roasts, and I usually buy Trader Joe's Dark Roast beans for another residence. I have tried many Senseo pods and ended liking Sumatra best from them. Then the price went up. So...I did order this six-pack of Melitta dark roast to give it a trial run. I brewed my Senseo Columbian and enjoyed. Then I brewed the Melitta Dark Roast to compare in one sitting. At first taste I thought, ugh! Then, after letting it sit a bit I quite enjoyed the Melitta. Good thing, eh, since I have the six pack. It's quite likely I shall order again - unless lured by some deal. this product definitely stands up to comparison, and arrived in perfect order with nothing wrong.

review/summary: Melitta coffee pods
review/text: I used to get Senseo Colombian coffee pods, but once they became unavailable I ordered the Melitta pods.  Perhaps it was just the type of roast, but I prefer a heartier blend so I will most likely not order this blend again.  I may try the dark roast however.

review/summary: Poor Quality Product
review/text: I was excited to try this product as I was missing my Senseo pods and couldn't find them for a decent price.<br /><br />I received my box and when I opened the first package of coffee it was a mess. Grounds fell out all over the counter. About 6 pods were partially sealed and have busted open to leave a mess to clean up. Now I am feeling upset over this purchase as I thought I was getting a good deal. I am scared to see what mess I am going to find in the remaining 5 unopened packages. If 6 pods are bad and a mess in each package...Mama's not gonna be happy at all.<br /><br />As for the taste it is good. It is a bit bitter but still tastes good with my creamer and stevia. Amazon is great as always.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am very dissatisfied with this purchase and will not continue my subscribe and save option. I will be taking this to the manufacturer as well.

review/text: We have a Senseo coffee maker which we love.  For years we bought Senseo coffee pods, Breakfast Blend.  All of a sudden, we were no longer able to find these pods & started our search for a replacement.  We ordered the Melitta pods and after trying them, like them every bit as well as we did the Senseo's!  Problem solved!  Thank you, Melitta - we love your medium roast coffee pods!

review/summary: Great Substitute for Senseo Medium Roast
review/text: The Melitta Coffee Pods are a great substitute for the original Senseo pods, which became so expensive, if and when available. The coffee taste is pretty much the same, maybe a bit milder, which for me is a good thing. The packaging is the same as the Senseo, just with a different brand name. This is my first experience with the Melitta coffee and it is all positive. I will be happy to use these pods from now on, instead of paying almost 50% more for the Senseo. There is no difference in the quality, and the price is much better. The pods fit perfectly in the Senseo coffee maker.

review/summary: Picky Pugslee
review/text: I rescued my little one and didn't have a hard time weening him from kibbles n bits to natural balance but did have a hard time getting him to eat just the dry kibble since he was used to having "morsels" in his bowl.  The turkey food roll worked wonders and while I do not feed it to him daily because I am not sure what the sugar will do to his naturally hyper state of mind I do feed it to him at least three times a week.  I also mix his kibble with wet food just to make sure he's getting the needed amount of protein in his diet.  I order his food because it is cheaper for me to order in bulk rather than go to the store every week but he always knows when the box is for him and he is always very excited when I pull the turkey food rolls out of the box. His immediate reaction is always a quick run and a proper sit.

review/text: My dog goes absolutely nuts for this. She will perform any command I want her to just to get her jaws on this stuff. As soon as I show it to her she sits, then lays down, then rolls over or gives me her paw. She just starts cycling through everything she knows to get it. It's a fantastic tool for training and the 4lb roll lasts quite a while. My trick is to cut it into about 1/4 inch or 1/2 inch slices, then cube those up nice and small. It's definitely a good deal too at $9. I'm not sure how the other flavors fair, my dog is really into chicken so I just tried the turkey for her.

Dark Chocolate was always one of my favorite treats before coming a Type 2 diabetic, so it is great being able to have it again in a sugar free version. There is a little bit of an after taste with these but dark chocolate is usually bitter so it isn't really an issue for me (but my wife says she notices more than I do).<br /><br />I should mention that eating too many of these (more than 3 or 4) does cause me some "gastric distress", so you might want to try them at home before eating a bunch while out in public.<br /><br />Recommended

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: We eat mass quantities of chocolate when the stress rises in our office.  Often, I'm confronted with a conference table full of delicious chocolate miniatures.  I don't feel deprived when I know that I can have a couple of these and get that real Hershey taste, with out the corresponding rise in blood sugar.  Beware that they are full fat and calories, but aren't going to spike your blood sugar, so to a degree they don't reinforce that stress/eat candy response that seems to go around in my office.<br /><br />I was not particulary a dark chocolate fan, but was hoping that the slight bitterness would keep me from eating so many that I would get the stomach issues that almost invariably go with sugar alcohols.  They are really delicious, and even my artificial sweetener-phobic boss ate a couple, but wouldn't really admit she liked them, just that they would "do".<br /><br />Sometimes, I can stop after two of them, and sometimes I go ahead and eat four; much more than that and you will need to be alone in your office with some Febreze, or possibly spend some time in the "facilities". As the reviewer above noted, try some at home (alone) first:)

I can also recommend that you try one bag from a more local source.

review/summary: More chocolate delights!
review/text: I am repeating here what I wrote in another review!  Since I am a diabetic I wanted to order some sugar-free candies by bulk and found these on Amazon's website.  They are so delicious it is almost a sin to eat them.  I have to be careful though because of the "sugar alcohol" content which can be high.  All in all though it was a good buy other than my initial thoughts that all the purchases (4 or 5) would meet the free shipping criteria.  They did not, so I had to pay shipping for each.  Other than that, it was a very good buy.  Note: check with your doctor as far as how much you should consume because of the sugar alcohol.  Also note: that this is not a low-calorie food.  It is my understanding that too much sugar alcohol consumption is not good.  Love the candies!

review/summary: Not the best but a good compomise.
review/text: As I diabetic, I have to be careful of my sugar intake but love dark chocolate. I did a comparison shop at Wally World and picked up the Hershey's and Dove dark sugar free and the high (86%) but sugar-included Ghirardelli's.<br /><br />I eat chocolate by letting it slowly melt in my mouth to make it last longer and get maximum taste. Never chew on it. My conclusions:<br /><br />The Dove is noticeably smoother than the Hershey's and has smaller pieces but is more expensive and melts far too fast. I had to repeatedly check that it was dark chocolate, though because it lacks the required somewhat bitter dark taste.<br /><br />The Hershey's is very good and melts nice and slowly. It does not have as nice a taste as its sugary counterpart but comes VERY close and is worth getting.<br /><br />The Ghirardelli is true dark chocolate with the typical real dark bitter taste as it should have. However, the pieces are bigger so you have to break it up but it does melt nice and slowly.<br /><br />At a little under $2 at Wally World, the Hershey's is the best buy for the amount and taste. Amazon, your price needs to come down a bit. I'd rather buy from you but even 12 packs are higher than Wally's single bag on a per bag basis. Too bad Hershey doesn't want to provide bigger bags of this product.<br /><br />One nice thing - the sugar alcohol has a laxative effect so you tend to not overdo it or you get punished later! Good way to limit your falling off the wagon.

review/summary: Usually great... but occasionally not-so-great
review/text: I have purchased three of these now, and the quality and types of treats in the bag is really all over the place. The first bag I bought had a great variety of really fantastic treats that my dogs went crazy for. Several big chunks of snout, a few bully sticks, TONS of cow tails, two halves of a huge twin hoofer, a little rawhide, and other bits and pieces. I felt that this bag was an incredible value given the wide variety of chews, and the specific chews included (some of which can be expensive when bought on their own), and my dogs loved everything, so I quickly ordered two more. I was much less impressed with the second two. The second bag I got was almost exclusively rawhide, with a few cow ears and a cow tail thrown in. Needless to say, I was not very happy with this bag, and my dogs weren't impressed either. I do realize that you always run the risk of getting disappointing results when you purchase any kind of grab bag, so I guess that's just how it goes. The third bag had a lot of rawhide again, and also included just a few tails, a couple of small bones, and a few pieces of snout. Not great, but not completely terrible.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say these are worth a try, but just be aware that not every bag is a good one. Maybe if you could find these somewhere to buy in person so you could peek inside at the contents to make sure you're getting a good bag (part of the front of the bag is clear so you can see inside), it would be a much better buy, but buying online, it's very possible that you could end up with basically a bag full of rawhide and a few other bits and pieces. Then again, you could also end up with a bag with a great variety of fantastic chews, like I did the first time I ordered this. It's all up to chance.<br /><br />Edit 03/01/11: I recently purchased two more of these, and these two were just like the first bag I got: big variety, all great chews that my dogs love, and a good value, since some of the chews included can expensive when purchased on their own. Because I've been extremely happy with three out of the five bags I've purchased, satisfied with another, and only disappointed by one, I've decided to give this product 4 stars instead of my origonal 3.

I don't get to have these treats too often, only once or twice a week (and no that did not go into my ratings, no really, it didn't). My folks and I really like that these are not your standard rawhide chews, the ones made from that inner skin layer of beef, which can upset my tummy, so we try and stay away from those. These are all natural, mostly beef with some pig, I think, and many different fun varieties like tails, snouts, ears, jerky and tendons which are all easier for me to digest. Oh, and they want to add that these are made in the USA (which means they are the safest) and that they think it is a good value for the money, whatever that means, after all isn't the fact that I like them so much more important. Okay, come on, let's order already!

review/summary: Bargain mix of BIG treats!
review/text: This product is a bag of Merrick's "factory seconds", i.e. ugly dog treats! You'll get rawhide chips and chews with tears or ragged edges, beef tails that are too short or thin, and big, big cow hocks, complete with hooves. Dogs love them, and they're very high-quality treats that are made in Texas. As with all rawhide products, the treats are not suited for dogs who will chew off large pieces and gulp them down. But for methodical chewers of any size, these are an excellent value, and the Merrick brand is very trustworthy, based in the US, and as far as I know never subject to a food recall.<br /><br />For reference, I have a chihuahua and a pomeranian, who are between 7 and 9 pounds. They can barely lift some of the cow hocks and hooves, but it doesn't seem to keep them from chewing them and enjoying them. I also gave a bag as a gift to my parents' 90-pound Lab/shepherd mix, and she enjoyed them as well.<br /><br />Facts and figures: Rawhide pieces have been between 2x2" and 8x4", 1/4" to 1" thick. Beef tails are about 1/2" in diameter and from 2-8" long. Cow hocks are about a 4x4x4" cube.

review/text: I have purchased this product previously in the last 3 years and my dog was always happy to discover various goodies like dried tails and bully sticks, the last 2 bags I got were all rawhide or pigs ears with only 1 bully stick and texas toothpick. They also plan on irradiating this product due to fear of salmonella which is definitely not something I want my dog ingesting.

review/summary: Did not meet expectations, not even close.
review/text: Yes I understand that these aren't perfectly cut, and some of the pieces smell a little.<br />That's not the problem I had with them to rate this bag only 3 stars.<br /><br />Bag consisted of a lot of pig ears, a lot of cow tails, something that looks like a honey bun, a 3 inch GI bone, and a huge hoof of some sort. Most of the pig ears/cow tails are the consistency of pork rinds (human food, very fluffy and crunchy).<br /><br />The pieces other than the hoof and GI bone, are NOT "long lasting" chews AT ALL. The pig ears you buy from walmart that are thin last at least 3 times as long as the ones in this package. I would rather buy those for my dog to chew on.<br /><br />The only pros I could find about this bag is, because the consistency is more fluffy and crumbly, the chews are probably digested easier than the rawhides you buy from walmart. Also, the fact that I got probably 30 pieces, makes it SOUND like a good deal.<br /><br />But overall, Hungry Dog was not worth the money for what I received, and definitely did not meet NEAR my expectations.

review/summary: The Quality Plummeted in Months
review/text: Last spring, I bought a bag at a chi-chi pet store of the pretentious name "Phydeaux," and was thrilled. It came with a few high quality treats, for long chewing and snacking. It had jerky, pig ears, a pork shoulder frame with some chitlins affixed, and even some bully sticks. I bought another bag last week as a special treat since we were moving to assuage my dawgs' nerves. Lo and behold, the bag was filled with only the most pedestrian snacks. No bully stick, no ears, no jerky. Just some puffy rawhide, like the dog version of getting puffed grain as a meager substitute for jasmine grain. The dogs are not interested in anything in the bag, whereas last time they went hizzy as soon as I reached in the general direction of the bag. Oh, well. Market players try to adjust things to where they are just of a high enough quality that we will pay a premium. Sometimes, like in this case, they go too far and lose a customer.

My dog will eat anything that comes from this bag, regardless of the fact it may not be an easily identified body part.  I looked at the label and I think that some of the items in the bag may not necessarily be listed on it.  They kind of smell funny but leave no lasting odor after the dog eats them.  Regardless, these natural treats are easy on his stomach.  And they seem to help his teeth out too.  I feel Merrick provides quality products and I will be purchasing it again.

review/summary: Love it! Love it! Love it!
review/text: I have ordered the Hungry Dog value pack twice over the past month and have been super satisfied...as has my dog!  The first bag had a variety of "flossies", "snozzles", "wishbones", "whizzers" and puffy ears (not sure which type).  The second bag contained "Texas toothpicks", "GI bones", "moozles", "hooves" and some puffy ears (again, not sure what type).  Do many of the items appear mishapen, smaller or larger than usual, darker or lighter in color than expected...yes.  Does my dog care that his pig snout is a crazy shape?  Um...no.  These are a great deal considering I have been getting roughly 15 chewies per bag at less than $1.00 each with comparable items costing anywhere from $2.50-$6.00 each (at least in my area!).  Of course, with a grab bag, you never know what you are going to get, but based on my previous orders, I will absolutely be ordering more of these in future :)

It is definitely a hit or a miss because I got one bag that was full of snouts and knuckle bones, but the bags with the texas toothpicks and flossies are awesome :) I recommend this if you have a big and a small dog because then they both have something to chew on. I usually have to throw out the huge knuckle bones and the snouts because they're too big and plus the snouts are kind of gross. It's worth it if you get a good bag!

review/text: We are huge fans of Merrick treats!  However, this product was disappointing.  The quality was lacking, as well as substance, mainly non descript scraps too small to be a chew treat, or large pieces of fluff.  There was no jerky, flossies, wizzlers, or any pieces/scraps of their quality treats.  Just a large bag of junk these days.  Hope Merrick goes back to the old style of quality and variety in this value pack, otherwise, this isn't a value.

review/summary: Roll the Dice or Russian Roulette on Merrick 2 lb scraps
review/text: As a life-long dog owner and avid natural foodie, I have been quite happy with Merrick's line of products, being USA made and really natural. This looked to be like a great choice for a teething retriever mix who will chew ANYTHING! Needing to keep him busy and teeth off the table legs and electronics, a large bag with a plethora of options from Merrick seemed like the jackpot! So happy were we to get it in the mail. I was a bit saddened to see that we were one of the "unlucky" ones that ended up with a bottom of the barrel bag. There were only about 4 decent things for him to chew on. The rest of the bag consisted of more than 20 or so odd bits of 1-2" type "tail" I guess you would call it. I don't even see how a small dog breed could hold these things with their paws to even get a grip on them to chew! Useless bits of bag filler and choking hazard. A couple of puffy ears were a hit, along with 2 (hip) bones with meaty bits attached were favorites. The white rawhide rectangles that were about 2-3 inches by 3-4 inches long didn't warrant his attention I guess, but imagine other dogs might like them. They are so thin (about less than 1/4") and no smell/flavor  since they are white and bleached out they ended up being bag filler as well. At $11 with free ship, not a bad gamble, but I now see the price has gone up a few dollars since 2 months ago. I decided to try once more, pay the increased and unwarranted inflated price b/c I love Merrick but keeping our fingers crossed that this bag is better than the first and not so many useless/dangerous (choking hazard size) small pieces. Please don't let me down Merrick!! Especially since your prices have really gone up on this product to boot.

review/summary: worth the cost-usually
review/text: I am happy to find a dog treat made in the USA.  My dogs have had issues with raw hides so I avoid those, and this variety beg I can get at a local store for $9.99.  Aside from the strange looking bleached bone that too often weights down the bag (I cant even find a dog to give it to that will even bother tasting it) my dogs gobble up the other treats.  I have 3 different sized dogs, so I can find different sized treats.  I supplement their "treat menu" with items from this bag maybe once a day or every other day.  But, as with everything these days, seems I get less for the money.  Still, I plan to continue buying this.Merrick Hungry Dog 2lb Variety Bag

It may not be pretty packaging, but you can't beat the value, and you're still getting ears, tails, and the occasional knuckle.  Our dog is big on chewing, and this will keep him distracted from the shoes.

Besides rooibos, natural chocolate and strawberry flavors, there are cocoa kernels, carob, sweet blackberry leaves, and bourbon vanilla beans blended in this tea.

She is a very picky eater, so I first sent them three small cans, one of each flavor, and the dog biscuits.  She loved them all, so I ordered them by the case and had them shipped directly to my parents.  She cleans her bowl each time, so I would say that is a good indication she likes it!  It also gives us all peace of mind because the food is all natural ingredients and contained nothing that came from China contaminated.

review/text: I discovered this great pumpkin bread kit in time for the holidays this year.  Each kit makes two large loaves -- I used my largest loaf pans and it filled them up.  The texture is different from any other quick-bread mix I've tried -- it's moist and dense, like you'd make from scratch.  You can put the finished loaves in airtight plastic wrappers and they should stay moist for a long time (provided they last longer for you than they did for me).  The kits come with the dry mix, a can of pumpkin and a packet of icing for the top.  (I also added chopped walnuts to mine for a little crunch.)  Great stuff, and since my grocery store ran out of the kits and I can't find them, I'm going to order a couple from Amazon.

If you even think you might like pumpkin bread you should try this.  YUMMMMM!!!!!  I will be purchasing this again, and again, and again.

review/summary: are they on crack????
review/text: Yeah this bread is good...when you pay $5 for it.  NOT nearly anything worth what they're asking.  Ok so put down the crack pipe and enter reality.

review/summary: Moist and Dense
review/text: This is just what I was looking for, a moist and dense cake with just the right amount of pumpkin and spice flavors.  Pricy on Amazon, but seasonal and not available elsewhere.  I am going to try some of the pumpkin bread recipes at Libbys.com instead.
