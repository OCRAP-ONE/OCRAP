review/summary: Taste is what it's all about!
review/text: I had this sesame oil by accident, as it were, in that I was in an out-of-town store & it was one of the only ones available, so I got it.  I've been using it on my fresh salads with wine vinegar & love it. I tried using other brands after this first experience & was so disappointed, I frantically searched for Kadoya & bought several bottles.  Love it! Taste is so rich & full. In my opinion, the way sesame oil should taste, if it's good stuff.

review/summary: excellent for cooking
review/text: This oil is fantastic for many great tasting recipes and for Asian cooking in general. Also this oil seems to withstand high heat without burning. In my house we use it all the time for many different dishes. Sesame oil contains vitamin E which is an anti-oxidant. This means it helps lower your cholesterol.<br /><br />I like to cut up broccoli, peppers (green and red), brussel sprouts and a chicken breast. Then I add soy sauce, hot sauce, ginger & garlic paste, water and of course sesame oil. You only need a little sesame oil. Less is better here because if you put too much the sesame oil will overpower the other flavors. A teaspoon or a little less is just right. This makes a quick tasty meal when mixed and stirred in a hot pan on high heat. It only takes about 10 minutes and serves at least 2 people. Very simple and quick meal that tastes great with sesame oil.<br /><br />I'm sure there are loads of tasty sesame oil recipes. All you have to do is search the internet and you'll be busy for hours if you like to cook. The main thing is to use it sparingly. This oil is dark, rich and very tasty.

review/text: The Green Mountain Co. has a great assortment of different coffees and teas, and many are my favorites.  This variety box has many good ones, but there were about half that are in the stronger, dark roast category, such as the dark roast and french roast. I find these a bit stronger than I like, so I make a 12 oz. mug using two sixes. Overall a good product, I would just prefer a few more of the light and medium roasts like Donut Shop.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: We'd just bought a new Keurig coffeemaker and wanted to try an assortment to see what we liked.<br /><br />We love Green Mountain blend coffee, but the Breakfast Blend was a big disappointment. It is a light roast, but it tastes as though something was added to make it bitter. Maybe it's chicory. Whatever it is, the aftertaste is unpleasant.<br /><br />Dark Magic was okay for a darker roast, but we have found other dark roasts by Green Mountain that we like better.<br /><br />If you are looking to try different kinds, it is much better to find a local grocer that sells k-cups individually.

review/summary: Fine Tea Experience, With Caveats
review/text: ****<br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to "Weightless" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: "For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming." So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: "Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs."<br />****

review/text: When we moved from NY to AZ, I realized I would never see my beloved Utz Special Dark Pretzels in the supermarket. They are not carried here! Whenever people visited from back east, all I wanted was a few bags of Utz Special Dark Pretzels. They always came through with a few bags of the delicious pretzels in hand. Well, no one came to visit for a while as it is too hot here. I found my favorite snack online and ordered them immediately. They came fast, fresh and in no time I was lounging eating my favorite crunchy snack. If you crave crunch, a little extra kick (from the "over" baking), these are the snacks for you! Low fat, slightly salty - basically guilt free...what could be better?

review/summary: Descent taste, price is manageable
review/text: I am always looking for wild Alaskan or Sockeye canned salmon. I eat a lot of fresh and frozen wild salmon, but sometimes I just don't have time to prepare a meal from scratch, so I depend on healthy canned products to get me through.<br />I have switched brands a few times recently, due to brands changing their "recipe", and due to relocating. I decided to try this, and was excited that the taste is actually pretty okay for the type of fish. The Sockeye of this brand has a stronger flavor, and this wild Alaskan is a little more bland.<br />Overall, I'm happy with this product, and will continue to purchase it until they make it worse, or raise the price to the point that I can't afford it anymore.<br />I gave it four stars because it's not immediately obvious if the can is BPA free, and I gave up contacting producers a long time ago as the answer was always yes. I'm over looking the BPA aspect of it, since it's so hard to find boneless, skinless, Wild Alaskan Salmon that tastes descent.

review/text: This Wild Planet salmon gives me a lot of energy. It feels like the salmon is beefed up with something they feed it. I tried store bought wild salmon and ate as much as 6 ounces, but I did not get the severe energy spike this Wild Planet salmon gave me. For example, at 10pm I ate a whole can and had so much energy I could not fall asleep. EVen when I did fall asleep, I slept litely.

review/summary: Good product, ships satisfactorily
review/text: This is the only type of canned food I've ordered from Amazon that arrived without the cans being bent. This is probably due to the pack only containing six cans and they are small (6-oz.), so are shipped in a smaller box enclosed in bubble wrap. I keep them on Subscribe & Save order.

review/text: But when I opened the can, it smelled like tuna, but it didn't taste like tuna.  I'm not sure if I had unrealistic expectations, but this wasn't what I was expecting. I bought this in order to help meet my weekly intake of Omega 3s.  I'm not a huge fan of cooked salmon, so I have instead opted to buy a high quality cut of salmon sashimi each week from a Japanese market.  If you like baked salmon, I think you would like this product, but it wasn't right for me.

review/text: This is a spice I've only been able to find in Texas, but thanks to Amazon I can have as much as I like whenever I like!  People...this is the one and only spice you'll ever need in the world for BBQ chicken. Throw everything else you have out. I don't even use BBQ sause when I cook with Fiesta Seasonings. They also have a great steak seasoning and you won't want to use anything but that on your BBQ steaks either. Trust me. If you like to BBQ stock up on this stuff.

review/text: When I ran out of Fiesta Chicken Fajita seasoning, I shopped for another container at our local grocery store.  They discontinued it.  During the past year, each time we traveled, I would look for this seasoning in the local grocery stores and, still couldn't find it.  I thought the company had discontinued making this product.  With one last effort, I checked Amazon and was thrilled to find the Fiesta Chicken Fajita seasoning. I had to purchase six containers, however, this was not a problem. All my neighbors bought one or two containers and were equally as excitied to know the product had not been discontinued. Hopefully Amazon will not discontinue this product!<br /><br />Fiesta Chicken Fajita seasoning is a wonderful product for meats, soups and vegetables and even better when used on the grill with everything.

review/text: I love cayenne or other hot chilis in sweets like chocolate, and thought these sounded delicious!  They are!  The mango really does taste like a ripe juicy mango, and the heat adds a nice contrast.  The lime is also perfectly balanced with the hot.  These lollipops are hot enough to be enjoyably spicy, but without making your lips swell like some hot sauces can.  They have become my favorite lollipops!

review/text: These lollipops are amazing - I will probably have to order another 6-pack soon because everyone I share them with falls in love too. They are definitely very spicy, but not in a burn-your-tongue-off novelty way. I prefer the Chili Lime to the Chili Mango but they are both good.<br /><br />The lollipops are small - three to a serving but with the intense flavor punch I've never had more than one in a sitting. If you think these sound tasty, I'd recommend going with the 6-pack as it's a lot more cost-effective than buying individual bags, and as I said you'll end up sharing them far and wide.

review/summary: Too yummy for words - mango or lime with chili - addictive
review/text: These YummyEarth lollipops are terrific. Warm but not too hot. They have either a mango or lime flavor spiked with a healthy dose of chili flavor. The lollies are two flavored - one side the fruit flavor and the other side the chili flavor. You can concentrate on one side or both, your choice. The fruit flavor is very true - mango or lime, and the chili flavor is warm but not too hot. Your tongue will not burn for days after. And these lollies are positively addictive - be forewarned.

I love strong cinnamon flavors, but really strong ones almost numb your tongue which I hate because for the next half hour things taste weird. These are hot like a strong cinnamon flavor, but without the side effect. I'll be definitely ordering more of these as my co-workers like them too and i have a feeling the six pack case will be gone before I know it!

review/text: I was so excited to try these pops based on the rave reviews. And I love the combo of spicy and sweet. And they're organic and natural? Awesome. But sadly I am pretty underwhelmed with these little guys. They taste (to me) just like any ol' sugary lollipop. I was really looking for that burst of fresh fruity taste layered with the spice and I didn't get it. I am pretty sensitive to spicy things and this stuff didn't even tickle my tongue. I wouldn't know they were "chili" unless you told me. If you really want something full of flavor, sweet, salty and spicy try Vero Mango pops. Now THOSE are amazing.

review/text: I go through about a pound of unsweetened cocoa powder per month just eating it by the tablespoon as a snack and I'm so glad I found this.  Even though it's lightly Dutched with a ph of 6.8, this dark reddish brown cocoa is really chocolatey and noticeably acidic. The word "Superior" is actually part of the product name rather than simply a descriptive. Ghirardelli's natural cocoa is called "Merritas" ( ph 5.5 ) and "Sunrise" is more heavily Dutched ( ph 7.5 ).  [...]  I think this cocoa will work nicely in any capacity, from baking to hot cocoa. My order arrived in about one day via FedEx home, originating in Lewisberry, PA. And many thanks Pumpkin King for sharing your product images!

review/summary: This is by far the best Earl Grey in K-Cups and at the right price!
review/text: I brew this Bigelow Earl Grey tea using the 6oz setting on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KJXSHO">Keurig� Platinum B70</a>. It is by far the best Earl Grey for the Keurig systems and I have tried them all. I went through several of the "Tea<br />Packages"; random assortments of various teas packaged together available here on Amazon. Most seemed artificial, bland, or simply didn't compare to their bagged counterparts. This was not only my favorite Earl Grey but also one of my favorite teas in general available in K-cups.<br /><br />For a little more perspective, I am an avid tea drinker. I consume 10-15 cups of tea a day. A majority of the tea I consume is Matcha or Hunmatsu-RyokuCha. I never mix sugar or milk into my tea. As such, I am particularly interested in teas that are robust and flavorful and not bitter. The bagged Bigelow is very good, not my favorite bagged Earl Grey but very good none the less. The K-cup variety is very close to the bagged version. For this I applaud them as few others can say this.<br /><br />That being said, our machines are perfectly capable of providing hot water for bagged teas. So why the K-cups? Convenience. Regardless of how good this and other K-cup varieties may be, nothing compares to a slow steep. Be it a bag, steeper or infuser they will always win over the instant cup varieties. However, nothing I have found beats the convenience of the Keurig system when it comes to guests and a good cup of coffee/tea. The Keurig system is so easy to use it takes little to no effort on the hosts part to provide a guests favorite beverage as our guests can brew a cup themselves! It's for this reason alone that I have gone through so many varieties of both to ensure an adequate selection of what I consider a good cup of joe and a great cup of tea.

review/text: When I first tasted Bigelow's Earl Grey Tea (K-Cups), I couldn't believe how good it was. I'm not a hot tea drinker and this tea has converted me. When I ran out, I decided to try another brand of Earl Grey Tea (Twinings). BIG, BIG difference! The Twinings has a funny smell, taste and aftertaste. I'm trying to figure out what to do with 2 boxes of it. I guess I should have tried a small sample box instead of buying 2 boxes (50 K-Cups). Not all Earl Grey's are created equal.

review/text: These Bigelow "Earl Grey Tea" K-Cups are quite good when made in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>, on both the Small and Large cup settings. While I have had better Earl Grey tea, the speed and convenience more than compensates.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Bold flavor Earl Grey from a K-Cup!
review/text: I have purchased other teas for my Keurig, but none have produced as strong of a flavor as this Bigelow Earl Grey. I have tried all kinds  of brands and blends of tea K-Cups, but none can compare to these. I drink tea rather than coffee, and I like my tea BOLD. I also have found with certain other brands, I ended up with a muddy watter appearance from the K-Cups, but never with Bigelow's. I have never once had a problem with tea leaves in my cup, and never get the "tea dust" at the bottom of my cup like with other brands.<br /><br />I would say if you have been disappointed in the past with other Brands of K-Cup Earl Grey, try these. They are the best out there.

review/summary: Great Tea, Fast Delivery
review/text: I have ordered this tea from Amazon multiple times. I just can't find the Bigelow Earl Grey kcups anywhere local. That's fine though, because they get it delivered so fast! I just got another shipment yesterday and it only took two days. I ordered it late Sunday night and it was on my doorstep by Tuesday at noon. That's 48 k-cups for about $20. Not bad at all!<br />I can find twinings earl grey locally at a store, but it's just not as good as the Bigelow Brand! Love this stuff!

review/summary: Perhaps I am spoiled by loose-leaf tea...
review/text: I received this Earl Grey in my starter variety pack that came with my new Keurig.  I drink a lot of tea, so was excited to taste how the brewer handled teas.  I was disappointed with this blend.  It was very bitter, which is surprising to me, since I usually only get bitter tea when I forget that I have been steeping leaves.  The water is not in contact with the leaves very long, so I don't understand how the tea got so bitter.  I will be sticking with brewing coffee in the Keurig, and just using the hot water when I feel like tea.

review/summary: Way too floral for me
review/text: I love Earl Grey tea and was looking for a good one in a k-cup.  The Bigelow name is a solid one so I thought this would be a good one to try (the Twinings I had tried and liked before wasn't available).  Unfortunately, I really don't like it at all and now have two boxes of them to use.  I enjoy an Earl Grey with a subtle Bergamot and hint of floral but the floral in this is very strong and really overpowers the tea.  I'm still looking for a good substitute for the Twinings but may have to stick to loose tea/steeping until I find one.

review/text: Honestly I love a cup of Earl Grey. But When the SAME brand of tea comes in a box of 120 for 17 dollars, you have to see past the gimmick. Without a K-Cup in the dispenser.. the Keurig machine dispenses hot water.. Just put a tea bag in your cup and press brew and you'll have a cup of earl gray. Don't go out of your way to blow all that money for what? 1 minute?

review/summary: Never again!
review/text: Recently I purchased 96 k-cups of Bigelow Earl Grey Tea.  Subsequently, I went out and bought a box of Bigelow Earl Grey tea BAGS which is what I am currently enjoying.<br />The reason I'm using tea bags instead of the k-cups is that I don't particularly like<br />swallowing tea leaves.  With this batch of k-cups I have had loads of tea leaves in<br />my mug.  I tried using a small strainer which I placed over my mug during the brewing process.  The tea leaves still ended up in the mug.  So, now if I use a k-cup<br />I have to use a strainer with a paper coffee filter inside of it.  This is much too<br />much trouble.  I will NEVER buy tea k-cups again.  I will never buy any k-cups from<br />Amazon again.

review/summary: Not as good a vintage as 2010
review/text: Very good, but lacking compared to the supperior 2010/2011 vintage. Slighlty harsh with an unpleasant bitter finish. Still good, with a nice peppery taste on the back of the tongue, and plenty of grassy flavors, but they're overwhelmed by bitterness. So don't expect a repeat of the previous years superlative effort.<br /><br />All in all, not worth the high price tag of $47. Go with the Pianogrillo.

He used to eat Greenies and still enjoys the ocassional Greenie treat but they don't sit well on his tummy. He and his sister Bessie Mae Mucho have been Bone A Mint consumers for the past year. They are softer than greenies and not quite as expensive.

review/summary: Yummy!!
review/text: I first bought the white dental N Bone for my shiba inu puppy; however, he wasn't greatly interested in it and it took a while before he would chew on it.  So when I found the Bone A Mints at the pet shop, I decided to give these a try.  From the moment I opened the package and my puppy smelled them, his eyes lit up and you can tell he's in heaven from the way he eats these!  However, I make my puppy eat the Bone A Mint while I am holding it as when I allowed him to eat it on his own, he was probably trying to get it down too fast and vomitted everything up a little while later!  These are pretty expensive though so finding them on-line helped a lot.

review/summary: Wonderful treat for my pekingese
review/text: My Pekingese is remarkably picky about what she eats. If it's not up to her tastes, she'll just spit the food back out and walk away. My first week after adopting her was going back and forth between the pet stores trying to find the right food. Even harder, was finding the right treats for her. I wanted to stray away from the popular branded stuff that had "by-product" in the ingredient list, but she also doesn't have a strong bite so I could get the Greenies brand.<br /><br />This is the perfect breath freshener treat that my little dog can actually chew through. She's only 14 pounds, so I break each bone in half, which helps make the bag last alot longer. All in all, a great treat that picky dogs will love and tiny dogs can bite into (if you're dog can bite a carrot, they'll be fine with this.)

review/summary: Delicious stuffed pasta, fresh-tasting, impressive packaging
review/text: La Piana stuffed pasta is delightful! I started with three different varieties of pasta with a variety of fillings; they were so fresh and tasty that I purchased several more. Good thing, too, because when I served them to guests last week, they all asked me about the pasta and I had boxes on hand to give out to interests folks so they could try them out at home.<br /><br />The pastas are delicious with any sauce -- or none at all. Sometimes my grandchildren and I are happy when I toss the cooked pasta with a little butter and some freshly grated parmesan (a little crushed or diced fresh herbs make the dish particularly tasty). The pasta also goes well with my homemade pasta sauce made with fresh veggies and turkey sausage or mini-meatballs.<br /><br />The packaging is truly delightful, so I sometimes include a box or two in a gift basket. Vegetarians on my gift list are always delighted.<br /><br />I'm a particular fan of the mezzaluna stuffed with gorgonzola and the tortellini stuffed with eggplant, peppers, and zucchini. Don't tell anyone, but sometimes I snack on the tortellini dry from the box; delectable because the pasta's so fresh and the filling is terrific.

The result was amazing, it added a little zip to the orange juice flavor, and it's now my favorite.  Of course it costs twice as much as each separate drink, since the diluted barley water costs about as much as the same volume of the OJ.<br /><br />My question is, am I compromising the effects of the barley water?  Will it blow up in the fridge?  Will my gall bladder dissolve?  Comments will be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Taste wise though, I'm really lovin' it.
