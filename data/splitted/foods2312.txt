review/summary: Quite tasty, but not particularly nutritious
review/text: This product is made in Canada. The ingredients listed on the label are: "Sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skim milk, reduced minerals whey (milk), lecithin as emulsifier (soy), vanillin, an artificial flavor."<br /><br />The label also states: "Made with over 50 hazelnuts per jar. Contains no artificial colors. Contains no artificial preservatives. Do not refrigerate or microwave."<br /><br />It contains the same calories as peanut butter, 100 calories per tablespoon. It has 5.5 g. fat, 11 g carbs, and 1.5 g protein per tablespoon.<br /><br />Though this product tastes good, it is not a health food, and it is quite expensive. A 13 oz. jar sells for around $4.00 in a supermarket.<br /><br />In addition, if you are interested in buying sustainable products, palm oil is associated with the slashing and burning of pristine rainforest. Virtually all of the palm oil used in the world is produced in nonsustainable ways in Indonesia and Malaysia.

review/summary: SO GOOD!
review/text: This is a must for those who love chocolate and hazelnut. Hazelnuts are not nearly as popular in the USA as they are in Europe. When I visited my family in Europe, I really loved all the chocolate and hazelnut desserts there and was sad to discover it's hard to find such things in the USA. This spread is delicious but after you have eaten a real chocolate hazelnut torte (a cake-like, layered brownie type thing I had) nothing is quite the same. Either way, this is great on crepes, cake, waffles and as one other reviewer mentioned, graham crackers! Another interesting treat is to have it on fruit or make a peanut butter and chocolate sandwich.

review/summary: Great Sweetener but learn about the product
review/text: I wanted to share that my own experience with finding xylitol was nothing short of a miracle.  I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.  I say moderation, because xylitol can cause soft or even liquid stool if you overdo it.  It's not safe for pets because they get severe hypoglycemia quickly which can kill them, especially puppies and kittens.  What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects.  I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically.  I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag.  It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market.  For some people this is a miracle food.  Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home.  It is not a manufacturers job or governments job to tell you what to eat.  I'm not saying this to be mean, it's just that we've become way too passive about our own responsibility.

review/summary: This is a great product - (Dog owners be careful)
review/text: Great product, great company.  High quality xylitol made from corn, not birch.<br /><br />However, this stuff is very toxic to dogs.  Don't let them have any of it, not even small quantities.  If you want a sweetener like this but without such toxicity to dogs, get Erythritol.  Same sort of thing -- a sugar alcohol, but not dangerous for animals.  Also, it does not have the same digestive effects (gas, bloating, diarrhea) that Xylitol does.  It is maybe a little less sweet than Xylitol, however.<br />This does not mean it is bad for people - for example, chocolate is fine for people but also toxic to dogs.<br /><br />Note:  When I do buy it, I use this company.  I've ordered Xylitol and Erythritol from them and they were VERY high quality.  When I tried it from EmeraldForest, I found some products had a horrible, strange smell and faint aftertaste.  I called to return the items and was treated very badly by their customer service.  EmeraldForest is getting some of their products made in China (not all - their xylitol apparently not), and I wondered why it has that horrible odor.  Kinda scary.  Also, their customer service is very bad.  If you check their terms and conditions, you will see something sort of unusual for an online merchant:  "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone...".  When I tried to return the odd smelling product to them citing their money back guarantee, they went around about it and then finally agreed, but said then they would never sell anything to me ever again (!).  Wow.<br /><br />I'm sticking with NOW Foods at this point.

review/summary: Can't live without it
review/text: Having suffered from Chronic Candida Albicans for over 10 years, I finally came to terms with the idea that I CANNOT have any type of sugars or sweeteners, not even natural sugars from fruits. Being a fruit lover who used to eat lots of fruits on a daily basis, I started looking for a safe way to have sweet stuff without feeding the microorganisms that have been for so long attacking my system. After a lengthy research of more than a year, I found out that though most sweeterners FEED bacteria and Candida Albicans, Xylitol DOES NOT. I started using Xylitol regularly and found out, to my surprise, that my worst Candida symptoms were GONE. The symptoms would recur every time I had fruits (darn!)or something made with refined sugar or other sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia, or even the Aspartame that is used on Diet Drinks. Whether I liked it or not, it became clear to me that I could not eat or drink anything sweet, that I could neither have any fruits and that I could not drink any diet sodas. I have intensely and extensively "tested" Xylitol for over a year and I can AFFIRM without a doubt that it is the ONLY sweetener I can use without getting my symptoms back.<br />I buy chocolates made with Xylitol on a regular basis and I use this brand of Xylitol to make chocolate bread and all kinds of cookies. I also make healthy chocolate ice cream with Xylitol, unsweetened cocoa powder and soy milk. If it were not for Xylitol, I would not be able to put anything sweet in my mouth. One of the most recognizable and annoying Candida Albicans symptoms was that I had to get up every one or two hours every night  to urinate (!!). It was a nightmare, but it helped immensely when it came to "testing" what was good or bad for me. Conclusion: If I stay away from all types of sugars, natural fruits, fruit juices and sweeteners, and only use Xylitol-sweetened stuff, I feel much better in every respect and, very importantly, I can sleep 6 or more hours in a row without waking up to go to the bathroom.

review/text: As described by other reviewers, I just wanted to add in response to an above revie, I have successfully used this with a yeast recipe. All you have to do is proof the yeast in the beginning with a teaspoon of real sugar to make it foam and then you can use xylitol as the sweetener in the recipe. This will add about 4 grams of total sugar to the recipe.

review/summary: Most of the sweet, none of the yuk
review/text: I can taste artificial sweeteners from across the street.  Hate the stuff.  In a restaurant I sent a Coke back three times because they kept bringing me Diet, assuring me it was the real thing.  After the third time I suggested they check their hoses.  Sure enough, they were switched.  Hate the stuff. One sip and my mouth says, "Yuk!" for hours.  This doesn't even get into the fact that aspertame isn't fit for human consumption.<br /><br />Enter Xylitol.  I bought a box of packets to use at the office where I drink coffee.  I find I need two Xylitol packs to replace one sugar.  No matter.  It tastes fine.  I detect no aftertaste.  And it's actually good for my teeth and blood sugar level.  This is something I can like!<br /><br />My only complaint was the shipping packaging.  The box of packets was stuffed into an envelope which, of course, arrived flattened.  Packets were all over the inside.  I reformed the box and reloaded it. No biggie, but putting a rectangular cardboard box in an envelope isn't the best idea.

review/summary: Natural Sweetener
review/text: Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar, this item caught my attention when I read it was an ingredient in "Xylichew" chewing gums.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It is commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. This "NOW" Xylitol is actually made from a corn source.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30 g per day can cause stomach discomfort. To sweeten one cup of tea, you may need as much as 3 teaspoons which is 12 grams. This would equal 30 calories and 12 grams of Carbohydrates.<br /><br />Each teaspoon contains:<br /><br />Total Fat 0g<br />Sugars 0g<br />Sugar Alcohol 4g<br />Sodium 0mg<br />Protein 0g<br /><br />"Now" Xylitol is 100% Pure Xylitol Powder. This product resembles sugar and has a third fewer calories than table sugar. It is a good alternative for diabetics and can be used as a sugar substitute in recipes. Calculate how much each serving will contain to make sure you can use this ingredient in your recipes.<br /><br />When compared to the SoooLite! NoCarbs Blend, this product does have Carbohydrates and more Calories. If you are looking for a No Carbs blend sweetner, NuNaturals SoooLite! Is perfect for tea. It only seems to contain .45 grams of Sugar Alcohol per packet. Both are great sweet alternatives to sugar.<br /><br />If you are tired of the aftertaste of other artificial sweeteners, give these products a try.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: So this stuff taste great. It feels a lot better mentally knowing that it's a natural product and has roughly the same consistency/viscosity as real sugar/sugar crystals. There is one caveat with this product, you will likely have diarrhea until you get used to it. If you use this for coffee like myself and you like to have that coffee before work or something, i would advise you to use it when you won't have issues with that. Supposedly this will stop once you develop some kind of tolerance, but i can't vouch for that since i've used it for the last few days. Other than that i think this is a great alternative to real sugar and the chemicals in other artificial sweeteners.

It looks like sugar, taste like sugar and sweetens like sugar, This xylitol does not leave a funny after taste like most sugar substitutes and the granules are fine like regular sugar.

review/text: I really like xylitol, it doesn't have a bad after taste like other sugar substitutes. I've tried just about all of them, even Stevia - can't stand the taste of it. The only drawback with zylitol is it doesn't mix in cold drinks - but I found a way around that. Put the zylitol in water, heat it up till it dissolves, and then put it in your drink - tried it in tea this way and it worked perfectly. It can give you gas and diarreah if you use too much - just use a small amount till you see how you react to it. This brand seems to be really good - never have had problems with it. As an added benefit it is good for your teeth.

review/summary: Great sugar substitute!
review/text: This is a great sugar substitute that is almost identical to sugar. I am very particular about having sugar in my coffee with no after taste and Xylitol is the only sweetener that I have tried that is identical to sugar. I like stevia better though for quick dissolving e.g. for salad dressings and cooking enhancements because it disolves better in cold cooking and it's aftertaste is covered up, but for hot foods such as putting it in cocoa and coffee there is an aftertaste but not so with Xylitol. Also I like the crunchiness of sugar which Xylitol has, and really have enjoyed eating strawberries dipped in it,  not to mention cinnamon toast. I only wish that they could manufacture the product with a more finer texture like the consisteny of cane sugar. Xylitol makes a great maple syrup when heated with water and mixed with maple flavoring. It dissoves very well with heat, great for syrup for corn fritters,french toast, and pancakes. I do not put a lot of syrup on my fritters since I am a little leary of it being so harmful to dogs(are we all that different?). This is my only worry. I have had no negative reactions though by using this product. I am very happy to discover Xylitol which came from other people's reviews.

I went to a health food store, and this product was recommended.  I finally tried it on some plain cereal.  I expected something like the flavor of Splenda, or maybe Equal.  At first, it was sweet like sugar and it was noticable, but it did have an aftertaste.  It was like the old articifial sweeteners.  I tried using less another time, but the result was the same.  I sweetened some tea with it, and that wasn't bad.  So, overall, it takes some getting used to.  It's not bad for being healthier than regular sugar but don't expect to be "wowed."

review/text: Yeah, don't feed it to dogs. Ok, since I'm human and I don't own dogs and if I did I wouldn't be feeding them sweetened things anyway because dogs are carnivorous, I am very happy with this product.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the plastic bag my Xylitol came in (I bought the 1 lb size) had a very strong chemical odor. I moved the Xylitol to a metal bowl for storage. NOW should use packaging that doesn't have such a strong plastic off-gassing.<br /><br />Work your way into eating Xylitol (gradually increase consumption over a period of weeks) to avoid gastrointestinal issues. Also be careful of eating too much inulin and other products that can cause a laxative/bloating/gas effect.<br /><br />This tastes good unlike NOW Erythritol which tastes rather horrid, except when making bitter chocolate.

review/summary: Value!
review/text: This is a huge bag of xylitol.  We were buying the small bags of birch xylitol, but went looking for something else due to cost. We are a family of three and all of us love yummy, sweet, creamy tea. I was not loving the sugar, though! My husband is diabetic and I was worried about my son having all that sugar. Sometimes I still use honey with my son, but my husband has completely switched to xylitol. After extensive research I think that I am okay using non-GMO corn xylitol. Honestly, I can't tell a flavor difference and the price comparison is huge.<br /><br />Pros:  Very good value for your money!  Great for families or people who do a lot of cooking. Bakes like sugar in the recipes we have done. It isn't quite as sweet as sugar and since we've been used to using it almost exclusively our taste buds have gotten used to it. Now, when I go out and I am offered a treat, or get one at a restaurant, I can't take the sweetness. I've gotten so I never eat dessert or snack on sweet things. I just don't like them anymore. I'm healthier and my husband is healthier. My son, who is seven, also never snacks on sweet things or even asks for them (with the exception of ice cream, sometimes). I think this is because he is used to not having them around. If he wants a snack he usually asks for things like crackers and goat cheese or fruit. I only mention this about my son because I have noticed that his peers are always snacking on really sugary things, things that now make my taste buds shudder.<br /><br />Cons:  The large size is a bit unwieldy and the zip-lock type closure doesn't work very well, at least on ours. Since I am a stickler for not having our food open to the elements we have had to invest in a large container for food storage. The large, good quality, food storage containers are expensive, but it a one time cost. We also have a smaller container for general family use that we re-fill from the larger one.<br /><br />Overall:  I will definitely buy this again!

review/text: I purchased this based solely on the reviews (highly unlike me) and I have to say I have not been disappointed with this product.  I do not recommend using a lot of it at first.  I suggest using a little bit at a time to learn your tolerance and avoid getting an upset stomach.  If you are trying to use less sugar (or no sugar) give this a try.

review/summary: Great for what it is.  Use with caution.
review/text: I think xylitol is great.  But... I gave my daughter a little in solution in the concentration tested and said to be tolerable for toddlers in a New England Journal of Medicine article.  Still, my daughter began vomiting everywhere almost immediately.  She never normally vomits.  I think the intense sweetness triggered a kind of protective response in her body.  Perhaps she thought it was poison.  Anyway, don't be dumb like me and try it on your toddler.  Reserve this product for older children and adults.

review/text: I am not a happy camper. This website says "pure xylitol". What did I get? A box of packets that say "Xylitol Plus" which is Xylitol and Stevia. And, most of the time, I find Stevia to be nasty. So now I likely have to throw this whole box away and I am pissed. This seller is not worth your time. Go to your local health food store where you can hold the box you want in your hands.

review/summary: Better than xylitol gum.
review/text: Highly recommended for table sugar. I purchased xylitol gum for dental protection also.  But I think that putting a quarter teaspoon xylitol into my mouth and holding it there reaches far higher molar/molal (pun intended) concentrations, far higher than using gum as the delivery method.  15 pounds seemed like maybe too much until it arrived, when it seemed like not enough after giving a pickle jar full to grandpa and grandma, a jam jar full to work, several jars full to the kids, and using for most sugar uses. Feels slightly different than sugar in the mouth, seems to get very slightly cold when dissolving, tastes every bit as good as table sugar, to me a little better.

review/text: I've been using this product for a couple years now--one packet each morning in my coffee. I've never experienced any of the digestive issues or tasted any kind of after taste with it. The packets are convenient and easy to carry with you. My only issue is that in the last three boxes I've ordered, I've had several packets that were empty. I'm guessing something's off with their quality control in the filling process. Hopefully, they get this fixed.

I bake with the more unconventional flours (almond, coconut, sometimes soy) in order to maintain my low carb way of eating. I love the flavor of these baked goods, but I found that I do not like the after-taste I get from the splenda. Xylitol, although more costly, seems to be my answer. I find that I do not need to use as much of it as most recipes call for either. This is a great product, worth the price.

review/text: I am not into sugar substitutes because of the potential health risks so when I use sugar it is sugar not a substitute, when I found out that this really was a natural thing I tried it and loved it. It looks like cane sugar, it tastes like cane sugar and it really sweetens twice as much  (or more) as cane sugar. I have been using for a year now and are very happy. A bit pricey but worth every penny. Diabetics will love it.

review/text: I brought some of these packets with me today so that I could sweeten my tea at work and realized that I made too much coffee for the amount of Xylitol that I had originally put into it before I took off for my commute.<br /><br />The packaging has to be 'special' because Xlyitol is pretty 'humid', in that regular paper packaging would not be optimal.<br /><br />I write this because, although it's perfect for on the go, and the packaging is pretty much 'unavoidable' in regards to properly storing and transporting it, it was a pain in the butt to open one to two packets whilst driving (I had to wait for the next stoplight or I would've veered off of the road in my struggle to open the dang things!).<br /><br />All-in-all a great product. Even after having a 'sweetened' cup of coffee, I don't have a 'fuzzy' mouth, like sugar would normally do!

review/summary: My second bag from here.
review/text: It is a proven fact that sugar increases insulin levels which can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, weight gain, premature aging and many more negative side effects.In addition, xylitol does not promote an insulin response by the body. In contrast to sucrose, or table sugar, whose glycemic index is 100, xylitol's glycemic index is just six.The key to xylitol's benefits is that it helps to break down biofilms. Brushing with xylitol , chewing xylitol gum, or sucking on a xylitol pastille several times a day has an anti-biofilm effect, according to researchers. Without the protective biofilm, bacteria just can't adhere to the enamel and release corrosive substances that cause cavities. Additionally, the bacteria that cause periodontal disease have no place to hide in the gum recesses.

review/summary: Xylitol is good but Z Sweet has fewer side effects
review/text: Xylitol was recommended by my doctor to help combat a familial tendency towards diabetes. It is very much like sugar in taste and form - and offered a terrific way to deal with my preference for sweetened tea and coffee. (Several of my doctors specifically recommended that I do not use Splenda or any other artificial sweetners.)There are some gastrointestinal side effects to Xylitol however.<br /><br />A product called "Z Sweet" was introduced to me as an alternative to Xylitol ... Z Sweet uses Erythritol mixed with a bit of Stevia (though there is NO licorice aftertaste at all). Erythritol seems to have all the same advantages as Xylitol, but has fewer side effects. The taste is nearly identical - though I prefer the Z Sweet combo. If memory serves, Z Sweet/Erythritol is not dangerous to dogs.<br /><br />If you find Xylitol useful in your life, as I do, you might want to know about Eryithritol (or Z Sweet) in addition.

review/summary: Hard-Red Spring Wheat is Superb for Artisan Breads
review/text: I purchased this along with a 45lb bucket of Hard White Winter Wheat, and a 25lb bag of Great River Organic Milling's Soft White Wheat. Using my Victorio's grain mill to grind the wheat into a fine flour has produced some of the best bread we've ever baked, or eaten, hands down. To give it a decent shelf life, and to keep it safe from weevils or grain moths, I've packed it in a 6-gallon food-grade plastic storage bucket with a mylar liner, and a dessicant packet inside. This price is great for organic hard red wheat. We're beginning to experiment with cooking our breads in the Global Sun Oven (also purchased here at Amazon), for those times when the power might not be available in an blackout or an storm-driven outage. Since my grain grinder is a hand-grinding model, power outages won't be a problem in baking daily breads.

review/summary: Unbeatable!
review/text: If you make bread and have a machine to grind the wheat berries yourself, this is a great deal!  You get totally fresh flour (after you grind it) and if you make bread once a week, 50 pounds of wheat berries will last a year.  If this is more wheat berries than you'd like to buy, get the 25 lb. bag instead of this size.  (Just be sure you have some secure plastic containers to keep the wheat berries in.)  At this price (and with this quality) it's an unbeatable deal!<br /><br />If you don't yet own a flour grinder, I recommend the KoMo machine made in Germany.  It's costly but it comes in a beautiful wood cabinet.  And if you eat granola, you can grind your oat groats (the whole grain product) on a daily basis - giving you something both cheaper and tastier than rolled oats (which are very processed).<br /><br />Great River is an excellent company!  They sell already-ground flour too - in addition to the "raw materials" on this page.  (But there's nothing like fresh-ground for flavor and nutrition!)  I first tried their whole wheat flour and now I just stick with the wheat berries and grind my own.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon, for free shipping too!  :-)

review/text: I think this was the best purchase decision I made all year. When my kids were little I never let baked goods from the store in the house and every night ground flour to bake with but drifted away from that as they got older and flew the nest. After years of buying fairly adequate bread, crackers whatnot at the store I decided to go back to making my own.  I bought a Wondermill Jr. hand mill and based on previous reveiws here I ordered this Great River Organic Milling Hard Red Spring Wheat.<br /><br />The other reviewers were correct this is absolutely fabulous wheat. It has a very high gluten content and makes a very dark flavorful satisfying loaf.<br /><br />I would especially recommend this to anyone new to bread-making. I don't think you can make a bad load with this some good yeast and a bit of elbow grease.  I used the SAF Instant you can order buy the pound just like the big bakeries do. It's just plain good yeast.<br /><br />The best thing about this wheat is you can make each loaf for less than a dollar =))<br /><br />Oh...this wheat is not good for pie crusts pastry kind of things...the gluten content is too high and will make anything like that tough.  This is to make glorious bread.

review/summary: Variations on Frappe
review/text: Michael's hit the nail on the head!  For an interesting after-hours twist, add Irish Cream to it.  For a low-fat version, don't even bother.  Keep in mind, the "Frappe" currently being marketed by the fast food chain is an inferior product.  Brewing hot coffee and throwing it over ice does not make a "Frappe".  Use Nescafe Classic for Frappe or in a pinch "Nescafe Classico".  Enjoy.

review/text: This pepper is great! I was buying McCormick, but couldn't find it anymore. This pepper has a slightly smoky flavor. Just what I wanted. The grind is perfect, not too fine or chunky. The price is comparable to the McCormick. I use alot of pepper and the bigger jar is better. This company ships FAST. Very satisfied. Will absolutely buy their products again.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

review/summary: Suggested by Dr. Oz
review/text: This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia<br />so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!
