review/summary: AWESOME Coffee!!  The AROMA was wonderful!!
review/text: Hey, coffee prices are going through the roof like everything else so I searched on Amazon and EBay for some decent prices.  I am a whole bean person and grind my beans fresh each morning.  This coffee has Starbucks beat without any doubt.  From the moment I opened the package I knew this was good coffee.  My home smells of fresh coffee beans.  With Amazons free shipping how could I go wrong.  A little over $7.00 per pound?  You can hardly buy Folgers at that price even on sale!  I will be buying from Coffee Bean Direct many more times in the future if they keep these prices down.

review/summary: burnt after taste
review/text: Yes this is a good deal on coffee, but at least for this variety and roast I was kind of let down.<br />I like a dark roast on coffee, French/Full City/Italian. When I opened up this bag I was pleased with the aroma and the oil on the bean. The brew itself was good, but I couldn't shake the burnt after taste, this kinda ruined the next cup for me.

review/summary: coffee snobs
review/text: We've been buying this coffee for over a year on the once a month plan, and still love it !. Never mind the "Five pounds is a lot of coffee, and it will lose it's taste after three or four weeks'" It lasts us about five weeks, and it's still as good as it was at the start; at least to us less sophisticated coffee drinkers. And we also tried buying it direct from the roaster, following one review comment that it was much fresher that way; B.S., Back to Amazon; the price is less, shipping is reliable, and the coffee is just as fresh, and just as good. After years of looking, it's our favorite coffee, from what has become our favorite vendor. It's just the right roast, just between french roast and the weak stuff, and forgiving enough to make a mistake with the brew time or the water and still be acceptable. But as stated earlier, We're not nearly expert enough to make the really critical fine point judgements.<br />Terry and Judy Hedgecock<br />Rural Arizona

review/summary: excellent coffee @ an excellent price
review/text: I've been looking for a great coffee for the last six months.  I've gone throw lbs of numerous brands and finally just finished my 5lb bag of the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWMD2I">Dark Brazilian Santos, Whole Bean Coffee, 5 Pound Bag</a>.  I thought the flavor was good, but it lacked the acidity which I mistakenly believed ruined a good cup of joe.  I thought I try another CBD roast as the value is excellent.  This is a winner.  The flavor is rich, full and well-balanced.  The bite is enough to make satisfying, but not overly harsh.  In short, this is my perfect cup.

review/summary: As good as you'll get for the price
review/text: This is not the best coffee I've had. The best coffee I've had was shade grown and organic and from Cuba. The second best coffee I ever had passed through the digestive system of a rodent. I'm that guy. This coffee is pretty good. Not the best, nothing spectacular but tasty and enjoyable. And at 6 dollars a pound when you pay the same 6 dollars for 12 ounces of 6 o' clock coffee (which this is vastly superior too) at current prices it's an incredible deal.<br /><br />I was a little worried about the roast, some places say french roast but really don't mean it. This is not the darkest french roast ever but the beans do have a nice oily sheen to them.

review/summary: NICE SURPRISE
review/text: This coffee proved to be a really nice treat.  I read the reviews, but gave it modest hope based on pricing. That proved to be a mistake.  The beans are dark and oily and very fragrant.  I used my burr grinder and had to poke at it several times so that the beans did not jam due to their oiliness.  I drink my coffee black with nothing in it, and this made a rich wonderful cup, with no bitterness.  My husband and I went through the 5lbs quickly.  I always have several kinds of coffee from which to choose, and found myself turning to this one more than not.  I'm back for my second bag, and trying more from this brand.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Great customer service
review/text: So I  like really dark roasts but not quite expresso. This particular roast is dark but not their darkest per coffee direct.<br />If you go to their site there are great explanations of each roast. It is cheaper to order thru amazon (especially quick ship if you are a prime member). This one produces very very smooth coffee using my Capresso grind and brew. My wife thinks it makes the best coffee we have ever made at home.<br />I emailed them and got an answer within a half hour. FYI the 2 darkest they have before expresso roast are Dark Sumatra and Dark Celbes which I'm going to try next time.<br />Great coffee,great price. I highly recommend.

review/summary: OK, but will not order again
review/text: After reading other reviews on this coffee, I was conviced I had to try it.  It's o.k., but really tastes much more like the cheaper WalMart brand coffee.  It doesn't even compare to Starbucks, not even close.  I wanted to give it a fair try, and after about a dozen cups I can say, I am disappointed enough to not reorder it.  If Coffee Bean Direct coffee's are all like this, I won't be a return customer at all.  I have a one cup coffee maker, grind the beans fresh for each cup, so it's not a case of making a pot and letting it sit.  I really wanted to LOVE it after reading other reviews, but I just don't, and I doubt I will even after five pounds.  I'm gonna try roasting the beans a little more myself to see if that makes any difference. I've never done that, but at this point, with 4 1/2 pounds of coffee beans left, I have to try something to make them taste better..  If that works out, I'll post again, but I'm not holding out much hope.  If you want really great coffee, you should look elsewhere, Coffee Bean Direct is just not cutting it...Good luck.<br /><br />July 9th,2012:  Update.  Well, I tried "roasting" the beans a little more.  Took a small amount and put them in the toaster oven for 15 min. at 400 degree.  They smelled good, but tasted horrible.  So I'm using the beans as I bought them, and making due.  Still not the great coffee I had hoped for, but drinkable.  Someone wrote a review of these beans talking about how they had a "chocolaty and vanilla" flavor.  Way off base! Or, it was someone at coffeebeandirect.com with a phony review.  Not even close.  When I am finished struggling thru this five pound bag, NO MORE..!

review/summary: Passed with a coffee snob
review/text: We were very pleased with our 5lb bag of french roast. My boyfriend is a coffee snob, but we're on a tight budget these days and even he had to concede we were spending an awful lot on coffee. Buying one bag of this saved us $15.<br /><br />This french roast is not quite as good as my boyfriend's local house-roasted preferred blend, and it is a wee bit more acid than the Whole Food's "Early Morning Buzz" that I drink, but after a few days we stopped noticing. Next time I'll buy two bags and freeze one - the last bag we got was fresh enough to make that an option. I'd like to try some of the other blends from Coffee Bean Direct, too.<br /><br />The bag is laughably large, by the way. You'll open the box and say "Whoa - now that's A LOT of coffee!"

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This is the second bag of coffee I have purchased from Coffee Bean Direct and they get a 100% approval rating from me! The prices really are great, and with the Amazon Prime shipping- the overall price truly can't be beaten. I love french roasted coffee- and this does not disappoint. If you do not like the smokey taste, then simply, do not buy any coffee that has the term "french roast" on the package!<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect from a Papua New Guinean coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a smokey, chocolate-cream taste. If it were a wine, it would be a Pinotage!<br /><br />Coffee Bean Direct roasts their beans fresh to order. When I purchased the first 5-pounder in February ('11) of the Brazilian French Roast, it had a roasting date of a few weeks earlier in January. On this package that I ordered in June, it also had the roasting date of January. So, it appears that Amazon is selling a large shipment they acquired from them months ago- be informed of that possibility.<br /><br />I have seen many people concerned about the five pounds not staying fresh once opened. Whatever you do- DO NOT REFRIGERATE OR FREEZE- that is some sort of urban legend/myth (lol) and actually speeds up the stale taste!  This is an easy fix!- Do what all coffee distributors do: store in a vacuum-sealed foil package. How? For the five pound bag, you will need about 10 gallon-sized VACUUM food storage bags (found in supermarket) and basic aluminum foil (also in supermarket.)<br /><br />1)Rip off one sheet of aluminum foil about 12-16 inches long<br />2)Lay foil flat on counter<br />3)Gently pour, roughly, 1/2 pound of coffee beans into the center of the foil sheet<br />4)Fold both of the width-side edges neatly over the center of the beans<br />5)Fold the length-side edges neatly over the top and towards the center (much like sloppily wrapping a rectangular present)<br />6)Place this foil package in the vacuum food storage bag- making sure that longer portion of the foil package is put in the bag parallel to the seal of the bag, which would leave much empty space between the foil package and the top of the bag.<br />7)Seal the bag, then vacuum-seal the bag by using the hand pump (can be purchased with the vacuum bags)<br />8)Do this with the remaining coffee beans (leave the amount of beans in the bottom of the coffee bag that you will be using within the next few days)<br />9)Check each plastic bag, by using the pump again to make sure they are vacuum packed.<br />10) Place each bag neatly and carefully either in a box, or a canvas bag (or some sort of storage to keep light out)<br />11) Store in a room temperature closet (about 60-75 degrees F)- making sure the bags will not be moved around too much or dropped as the vacuum seal could break.<br />12) Check the vacuum seal periodically and re-pump if necessary<br />13) This coffee will stay fresh for months this way!<br /><br />May seem like a bit of work, and adds to the cost with the price of the vacuum food storage bags- but, it's worth it!

review/summary: Mystery Coffee Tastes Pretty Good
review/text: Many coffee containers, whether they're bags or cans, tell you what you'll be getting inside.  Although there is ample advertising and promotional information printed on the bag, I was left clueless as to where the arabica beans were grown.  That's why I called this "mystery coffee."  My usual brew is made from freshly-ground, all Colombian grown 100% arabica beans from a top-rated coffee supplier.<br /><br />Since I'm a serious coffee drinker, I would not usually buy such small bags of it.  An 11-ounce bag will make about three full 10-cup pots of coffee for me at the strength that I usually brew (1 level tablespoon full of ground coffee per cup brewed which is half-again more than Melitta recommends).  Melitta used such a strong adhesive to seal the bag, I had to nearly destroy the top of the bag to get into it.  Once opened, the bag yielded a hearty, pleasant fragrance of freshly-ground coffee.  I expected that it would brew good-tasting coffee with a bold taste and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Melitta recommends using their brand of filters because they've ground the coffee finely to extract the maximum flavor, but my usual store-brand filters worked just fine.  If your coffee preference is for bold but not bitter over mild you'll probably find this coffee to be satisfying; more like Starbucks than Dunkin' Donuts coffee.<br /><br />Ultimately choosing a favorite brand of coffee, for most people, is a matter of taste and cost.  This collection is certainly worth considering if you like your brew to be potent and to actually taste like coffee instead of like something else or wish to share this tasty coffee experience by giving one of these small bags as a gift.  I enjoyed this coffee but wouldn't buy such small bags of it regularly for my own consumption.  My top-rated bean coffee comes in more convenient packaging and costs me less.

review/summary: Not My Cup Of Coffee
review/text: I don't enjoy this blend much, but as another reviewer mentioned perhaps it needs a Melitta coffee maker for it's full potential.<br /><br />I've made 3 pots:<br /><br />First I followed the instructions (2 level teaspoons per 6 ounces). I got brown colored water.<br /><br />Then I doubled it. Tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned brand.<br /><br />Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasn't thrilled with the flavor.<br /><br />So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn't the issue. I do normally grind my own, but again pre-ground won't cause that big of a difference. My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house brand medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances I've been drinking a dollar store brand called "Eight O'Clock" that's of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you'd like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattle's Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house brand beans are quite good.<br /><br />Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo). The Millstone was much better.

After reading the description of the Melitta Cafe Collection I was excited to brew it.  I was extremely disappointed by how stale the coffee smelled when I opened the bag and was not impressed by the flavor after I brewed it.  It tasted like a pouch of hotel coffee, no flavor, stale and bad aroma.  The packaging looks upscale and is a great price but unfortunately the coffee was not good, I had to throw it away.

review/text: The key points here are probably the vacuum packing (no air!) and the extremely fine grind.  The fine grind results in a stronger cup off coffee with fewer grounds, meaning the bag lasts longer than a regular bag of coarsely ground beans.  I really can't say aenough about how finely ground it is: it's almost like a powder!  The vaccuum packing also means it's just a bit more fresh when you first open the bag.  Overall - no complaints at all: great tasting, strong-as-you-want-it coffee here.

review/text: Most high quality coffees have layers of flavor and nose you want to smell. I brewed this using my French press and was extremely disappointed.  This Melitta Classique Supreme is some of the worst, most bitter, awful-tasting coffee I have ever had.  There is no depth to it, it is not a "good bitter" like espresso, it is flat and harsh to the palate.<br /><br />Perhaps I am spoiled by having excellent local coffee producers, from which I purchase whole bean and grind them fresh before each brew. But I've actually had canned coffee from supermarkets that possessed more personality than this stuff.

So, I guess you could say that my husband and I really like our coffee.  I usually use a combo of The Joe's coffee at TJ's and the decaf Columbian.  I do make it strong--I just realized how strong when I googled it a moment ago.<br /><br />This Coffee:  I used 1 Tbsp per 5-7 oz. cup.  I couldn't find the directions on the package as some people did--it must have been in small print.  It was like mud.  Way too strong.  Even so, I didn't like the flavor of the coffee.  It reminded me a lot of store bought Maxwell House or Diner coffee.  It had a bit of a burnt aftertaste to it for me.<br /><br />So, for me, I'm going to stick with Trader Joe's coffee.

review/summary: Bold Taste Without Bitterness
review/text: Years ago, I used Melitta's coffee, and I'd forgotten how good it is.  When I tasted a cup of this blend, I was reminded how good it can be to drink a cup of coffee that has bold flavor, but NO bitterness.<br /><br />Unlike some "designer" brands that are so bitter they give you the shakes, or some supermarket brands that are weak and lacking aroma, Melitta has hearty, satisfying flavor, and a rich coffee smell. Brew it to your desired strength, sit back and enjoy!

review/summary: Nice Cup O' Joe
review/text: I've been a fan of the Melitta system for years. It's simple, and eliminates the expense of an<br />appliance. For one or two persons, it's a great way to make coffee. I have always used regular<br />grind coffee with a Melitta basket, but the Classique Supreme has changed my mind. Melitta's<br />coffee is ground very finely, almost to a powder consistency, which works better with their<br />drip basket system. I often ran the water through twice with regular grind, but don't need to<br />do so with the Melitta coffee. Whenever I can eliminate a step, I'm happy.<br /><br />This particular Melitta coffee, the Classique Supreme, has a rich flavor compared to the<br />rather ordinary coffees that I've gotten used to. Taken black, it has a smoky, vaguely<br />Espressoesque flavor that I find quite delicious. Adding a little creamer (I use the<br />liquid variety) cuts that flavor considerably. The package directions specify two level<br />teaspoons per six-ounce cup, which I find inadequate; twice that amount is much better.<br />Classique Supreme may be a bit pricey, and there may well be better "gourmet" coffees<br />out there, but it works for me, and I certainly would get it again in the future.<br /><br />My only complaint: the package is difficult to open without spilling some contents.

review/summary: Bold + Smooth - Acid = A Winner
review/text: I am honestly, pleasantly surprised by Melitta's Classique Supreme blend.  I was expecting a grocery-store quality coffee, but it far surpasses anything I've purchased at my local supermarket and, interestingly enough, I like it better than most beans I've purchased at specialty coffee shops.  Here's why:<br /><br />It's got a bold flavor akin to Kenyan beans but has a rich, full, smooth (almost chocolatey) texture like Sumatra.  As if combining the best bits of my favorite coffee regions wasn't enough, it's a very low acidity coffee, almost completely lacking that bitter / burnt aftertaste that plagues so many dark blends.  It's not a "bright" coffee like those grown in Latin America.  I believe this blend of coffee would be absolutely PERFECT FOR DESSERT SERVICE, but shouldn't necessarily be limited there.<br /><br />I've brewed a few pots at work to rave reviews.  Even the barely-colored-water-that-she-calls-coffee gal shrugged and said it was good.  I'm not inclined to drink my coffee black, but this blend is smooth enough to be palatable, even for me.  In fact, I surprised myself by enjoying my first 10oz cup with no creams or sweetener.  Pretty remarkable stuff.<br /><br />At its current price point, it'll end up being a bit more expensive but of far better overall quality than your average grocery store, but may be comparable (or even cheaper) than your local coffee shop.  If you like a smooth, flavorful coffee, Melitta's Classique Supreme blend is a safe bet for a very enjoyable cup o' joe.

review/summary: Decent but wouldn't buy again except for a special occasion
review/text: Before I start, I will openly admit that I love a good cup of coffee and over the years have become a bit of a coffee snob with my tastes.  I don't like any flavored coffees, iced coffees, or even much of the frilly expressos and cappaccinos.  I simply like a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />I liked the Melitta coffee okay but I'm truthfully not convinced it is worth its price.  Don't get me wrong, I consumed the whole bag; I am just unsure it is something I will purchase again.  It had the nice, strong taste of shade-grown coffee beans which I liked but I wouldn't say I loved.  I'm not sure it is any better than some of the specialties you can purchase in your local grocery (I'm not talking Folgers and Maxwell House here, but the other shade-grown coffees).<br /><br />If this product comes up in a good sale, I might be tempted to purchase it for a special occasion but otherwise, I probably won't be buying again.

For those of you who don't know - the Keurig "K-cup" coffee maker uses these little cup-packets of coffee grounds to make individual servings of coffee.<br />~<br />I recently bought the part for my coffee maker that allows you to brew your own ground coffee, such as this. I've used it several times, but the coffee always comes out watery or bitter.  I was hesitant to try this brand but let me tell you - it's AWESOME.<br />~<br />This coffee is now my new favorite one to make at home. I've had it several times now and it's always consistently awesome.  A nice bold flavor without being bitter or watery.  It's the ultimate coffee - a nice solid smooth coffee flavor without any harshness or tart aftertaste.  I highly recommend this one for any Keurig Coffee Maker users out there!!!!

review/summary: Great for cold brew coffee!
review/text: Cold brew coffee is a tradition here in New Orleans and we are always looking for good coffee to use.  This Melitta Classique Supreme Ground produced a rich, delicious cold brew that we really enjoyed.  We will definitely order some more.<br /><br />If you've never tried cold brew coffee you really should.  This is the brewing system we use.  We've had it for over 20 years!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW">Toddy Cold Brew System</a>.  You have to let it sit all night and then you have to deal with a pound of wet grounds (we use them for fertilizer,) but when you're done you have a carafe of cold coffee that lasts (us anyway) about a week.  It's cold and refreshing and not the least bit bitter.<br /><br />Very nice an a hot summer morning.

review/summary: SMOOTH, FOR BETTER AND WORSE
review/text: I learned to drink coffee black and cheap and have never varied much from that.  Strong is fine so long as it isn't bitter.  Complexity is okay if you can find it cheap or if someone else is paying for the cup, but there's no need to get carried away.  It's just coffee.<br /><br />This Melitta brand (Cafe Collection Classique Supreme) is quite smooth and tasty.  If the cost was comparable to the big cans of Chock Full o'Nuts at BJ's I'd happily buy it.  But it just doesn't taste enough better for it to cost much more.

review/summary: On Par With Millstone, But Below Strabucks
review/text: I like coffee a lot.  I drink my coffee black, and I love the varieties from Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Gevalia, Arriba!.  So when I had the opportunity to try this new coffee from Melitta, I was eager to see what they had to offer.<br /><br />My setup is a Gevalia 12 cup coffee maker using Melitta No. 4 unbleached cone filters.  For the trial, I brewed 6 cups of the Melitta the same way that I do my Starbucks - two rounded scoops using the Gevalia coffee scoop.  I was a little surprised at how light it came out, and it did not have a lot of flavor.  It definitely came out lighter than the other coffees that I have used - I have been getting satisfying results from my coffee maker and brands listed above using this method for 5 years.  For the next few pots that I made I used "heaping" scoops to try to get it stronger.  While it came out darker, I was disappointed in the overall flavor.  Since this is listed as a "medium" roast, I was looking for something on par with either either the Starbucks House or Peru Chanchamayo roasts.  This may be unfair since these are both Latin American beans, and I could not find anything about the origins of the Melitta Classique Supreme.  I found the flavor slightly earthy, but there just wasn't a lot that stood out.  I like coffees that are have citrus flavors or rich and nuttier.  Ultimately it is more of a lack of flavor that stuck with me.  It is unoffensive but underwhelming.<br /><br />If you are a current Starbucks or other coffeehouse drinker, you will likely find this somewhat disappointing.  If you are looking for a step up from Folgers you might like what you find.  As I think about a little harder, I would say that this compares favorably with Millstone coffee.  You'll probably like this coffee from Melitta if Millstone is right up your alley.

review/summary: Decent-plus medium-roast coffee
review/text: Melitta does a good job with this medium-roast coffee.  If you need coffee for the office where you can't grind fresh, this is better than supermarket coffee (that often includes cheaper Robusta beans) by a long shot  Brew it a bit stronger than recommended to get a full taste.  You can't get it to taste like dark roast by making it stronger - that just makes coffee bitter.  If you want dark roast, buy dark roast.  Medium roast offers pleasures of its own, and can let the individual qualities of coffee come through nicely.<br /><br />Fine grind coffee is meant to made in a filter cone, and this stuff is pleasant and smooth with some personality when done that way.  So if you're looking for a  convenient ground medium-roast blend for weekday mornings and don't want to go through the hassle of picking out some fancy coffee and grinding it at the store, this is a good reliable solution.  Melitta has a good reputation for a reason.<br /><br />Oh, and it is Kosher, too.

review/summary: Unobjectionable mid-range blend
review/text: In marketing terms, I'm not certain what "classique supreme" is supposed to mean -- if anything. Reviewing coffee is a matter of taste, literally as well as figuratively, and I found this to be a fairly standard, but not at all bad, mid-range roast. On some tastings, it reminded me quite a bit of McDonalds coffee, which isn't necessarily a bad thing though it probably isn't either as "classique" or as "supreme" as the folks at Melitta would like. It was very drinkable across the course of a morning, neither aggressively dark and bitter nor bland and tasteless. Though I might venture out from time to time into other roasts and blends, this would be a perfectly serviceable day-to-day option for coffee fans.

review/summary: A quality supreme coffee
review/text: I must admit that I had never tried any style of Melitta coffee before this Cafe Collection Classique Supreme.  I am an avid coffee drinker and have at leat 6 cups every morning.  It is just part of my regular routine.  I crave the cafeine and the taste just wakes me up and starts any day perfectly.  I always get a medium blend and find that with generic coffee be it Folgers, Maxwell House or any store brand I don't really notice a taste difference.<br /><br />So it was a treat to try a coffee that is considered  a delicacy and not just a power boost.  This coffee is a pleasure from just opening the bag.  The aroma of just the beans is beautiful.  And when you go to make the coffee you will probably do the same as me and go to measure the amount equal to the water amount the same as when you make your standard coffee.  But you may have to toy with the measurement of coffee per ounces of water to be able to fully appreciate this coffee.  It was nice to have this coffee that is part of a specialty collection meet up to my expectations.  The beans are ground extra fine and though still providing a medium blend quality it far surpasses my regular coffee.  It definitely is smoother and the taste is rich and full providing a very satisfying coffee experience.  I found myself slowing down and enjoying each sip with absolute pleasure.<br /><br />As I said I am not one to explore all the supposedly specialty roasts or flavored coffees but am very glad I came across this Melitta blend.  Very satisfying and will definitely become part of my coffee regime when a definite treat is needed.

review/summary: Average Coffee/Better than Most Grocery Brands
review/text: I brewed this coffee with the recommended ratio of water to coffee:  6 oz. water & 2 teaspoons coffee.  It was very weak brewed this way; like coffee-flavored tea.  So I brewed another batch at 3 t coffee to 6 oz. water and it was better.  This is not a bad cup of coffee just not very complex & definitely a medium roast at best.  I brewed some 8 O'Clock Original roast for comparison (I thought that would be a good coffee to compare) & this coffee came in second to that.  This is not a very interesting cup of coffee; serviceable and good for people who don't like a strong brew.  I am not a black, tar coffee lover but I prefer more flavor.<br /><br />If you like a dark roast coffee like Starbucks, you will be underwhelmed.  But if you like Folgers or other grocery store brands, this is definitely a step above.  It is not bitter & it is good with a bit of cream.<br /><br />I brew coffee using the pour-over method, directly in to my stainless carafe.

review/summary: Passable, but not outstanding
review/text: I will admit to being a relatively picky drinker when it comes to coffee.  I don't make coffee very much at home and when I do, I tend to buy whole beans to grind at home from independent coffee shops and stores.  Because of this I will admit to having a biased opinion of ground vs. whole bean coffee.  My experience has always been that that the preground coffee is never quite as full flavored and generally doesn't taste as good as the coffee house experience.<br /><br />This experience carried through here.  The coffee was good, certainly better than what I've had at a lot of restaurants, but it wasn't great.  I could see this being a good everyday drinking coffee if you're looking for something middle of the road for a caffeine fix, but since I drink coffee at home more rarely and more as a treat, I think I'll continue to splurge on whole bean coffees.

review/summary: Really nice, rich, tasty coffee
review/text: I'm no coffee specialist, but I'm pretty demanding when it comes to the qualities that I like in my coffee.  Rich.  Nicely roasted and balanced.  Full flavored.  If you don't like any of those characteristics, then this review won't do much for you.  Anyway, I'm pretty tired of Starbucks.  It's overly roasted, almost to a burnt sensation, and drips a bit too much with bitterness.  I tolerate it because most of the other coffee vendors in the area sell watered down garbage.  A little while back, Melitta was offered on Vine and I figured, why not give it a try.  Boiling water, 4 minutes in a french press, and some milk and sugar, and I'm in business.  Surprisingly, it was a great cup of coffee.  Nice depth, a lovely balanced and almost creamy texture, great roast, and not exceedingly bitter or sludgy.  The real test now is for me to do a head to head against my current favorite go-to: Illy.  I have a feeling that Melitta may hold up pretty well.

It is a good quality coffee at a good price and, as a result, a good value. I'd recommend this and would consider this as an every-day brand.

review/summary: Complex, European, flavorful coffee
review/text: I am a coffee lover and quite picky about my coffees. Every coffee brand claims hand-picked gourmet coffee, so it is hard to find a good bean. As with many things, coffee is a matter of personal taste. I don't like the bitter flavor of Starbucks, for example, which is the result of their trademark roast. I like flavorful coffe that is not bitter. I loved this coffee from Melitta.<br /><br />It is complex and rich, very european in flavor and not bitter at all. It is surely one of my personal favorites. At any given time I have 6 to 8 coffee varieties at home (both whole beans and ground), yet I find myself choosing this Melitta coffee every time and I am not getting tired of it. You should try it.

review/summary: Decent, but not great.
review/text: This is a "non-offensive" middle of the road coffee.  Most coffee drinkers will probably like it, but it's not exactly memorable either.  Better than the grocery store variety, not as good as the high end stuff.  Another reviewer commented that it reminds them of McDonald's coffee, I would agree with that.  McDonald's new coffee isn't bad at all so it's not a complaint.

review/summary: Pretty good coffee
review/text: In our home we prefer coffee that is smooth and not very strong. Dunkin Donuts is preferred to Starbucks. We like this coffee. Not love, but it is pretty good. We have served it to a dozen neighbors.  None commented on its taste, but when we asked they all said it was very good (these were all guys who would have no trouble complaining if they didn't like it). My brother, who prefers strong coffee, also said that he really liked it and that it was smooth.  So, with a dozen tasters reporting, all liked it, but nobody raved about it.  We would buy it again.

review/summary: Good, strong cup of coffee
review/text: This coffee produced a dark and rich cup of coffee that tasted great.  I found this stuff to be ground a bit fine -- more along the lines of espresso than something I would put into my regular coffee maker, and way too fine for my press. I'd give it five stars except for the packaging: I've opened hundreds of bags of coffee in my time, but this is the first one that I pretty much destroyed.  The bag is sealed along each of the corners to make a seam at each edge and those seams don't like to come apart.  Unfortunately, the remaining opening was too small to get my tablespoon inside to get the coffee out, so I had to rip the sides out a bit.

review/summary: Melitta, an also ran Coffee
review/text: I acquired this coffee through the Vine program.  I found the coffee to be just ok, with nothing to either recommend it or to take away from it. The package lists the grind as extra fine, but it is really just barely a fine grind with several larger pieces in it than you would not normally find in a fine grind.  This is not really an issue unless you really needed a fine grind.  It works just fine in a drip coffee maker with a paper filter.<br /><br />As for flavor, the coffee is not bitter, but does not have much of a personality.  I would compare it to MJB or any other mass marketed coffee on the store shelves.  This would probably be a fine coffee to use if you were going to add your own flavorings as there is nothing to get in the way of the flavorings that you would be adding.

review/summary: Solid Flavored Premium Coffee, Packaging is Lacking
review/text: I drink coffee almost every day.  I sip and enjoy it rather than slamming back X number of cups required to get me through the day.  This is a nice pre-ground sipping coffee. It's not an aficionado's coffee, not so much because of flavor rather than that it comes pre-ground.  It kind of fits in a quirky in between niche.  Not for the Folgers crowd but not for the gourmand either.  All in all, not bad.  My biggest complaint was the packaging.  This was sealed so tightly that I pretty much had to destroy the bag to get it open.  I guess this may be symptomatic of premium pre-ground coffee because they are trying to keep in as much flavor as possible.  However, as an average consumer I find it annoying.

review/text: This is incredible smelling and tasting coffee. I'm fortunate to live in a city that's known for it's coffee, so I'm spoiled when it comes to being able to get a good cup of joe. This Melitta Cafe coffee is the best, pre-ground, home brewed coffee I've ever had, hands down. As cheesy as it sounds, I even had one of those television commercial moments when I first opened the bag: I said "Ah!" and inhaled the woody and nutty aroma deeply. I was instantly sold. The coffee is ground very fine, allowing all the flavor to end up in your cup and not in the trash, garden, or food bin. Even when watered down to make an iced drink the flavor stays prominent. This would be a great blend for homemade coffee ice cream or desserts that use non-instant coffee as an ingredient. I would and have recommended this brand to family and friends.

review/summary: Smooth taste, Not much kick
review/text: This is first time I had ever tried or heard of Melitta coffee, though I had used some of their filters (which I like).  I drink coffee everyday (about 3 cups in the morning) and like "between roast"--which is between medium and a dark coffee.  I also like coffee that is not bitter but has a strong kick to it.  I tested a medium roast from Melitta and found it to have a pleasant smooth flavor and was very nice to drink.  It was not bitter at all.  I tried it both black and with sugar and cream and enjoyed it both times.  I generally do not drink black coffee but this brand was pleasant when served black.  I usually drink Community Coffee (a local Louisiana brand) and enjoy that brand's strength. Melitta does not have a strong flavor or "kick" to it.  I very much enjoyed it and would consider buying it if my regular brand was not available.

review/text: I'm accustomed to grinding my own coffee beans and steeping them in a French press.  I've sort of become spoiled by the better flavor of having my morning brew done this way.<br /><br />When I received a bag of Melitta Cafe Collection, I was skeptical that I would get good enough flavor from a pre-ground coffee.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that it does really well in a French press.  The flavor is very good, definitely better than other pre-ground coffees.  The grind is a bit finer than I usually do it for the French press, but it still works great.<br /><br />The French press is a good test of coffee flavor.  If coffee tastes good under this more demanding method, it should definitely do very well in a coffee machine.<br /><br />If you're looking for a pre-ground coffee with good flavor, this one is a good choice.

review/text: Okay, I'll admit it: I'm a coffee addict. Lately my hubby and I have been brewing Starbucks coffee, with varying success (I'm not a big fan of Breakfast Blend), so I looked forward to trying a new and different brand.  We've now drunk our way through most of a bag of the Melitta, and I am happy to report that our impressions are highly favorable. The most important thing to know about this coffee is that it is decidedly on the mild side; although the bag specified "medium roast," it was much milder and smoother than I was used to tasting with a medium roast blend. But that's okay, as I much prefer a milder coffee to anything with bitter overtones, which I often find in other brands of coffee labeled medium or bold.<br /><br />To cap things off, the Melitta coffee is noticeably cheaper than Starbucks.  Hmmm.... I may just switch coffee loyalties.

review/summary: OK, but not great
review/text: I have become somewhat of a coffee snob over the years and consider it one of the few grocery items that I will pay top dollar for if it suits my taste. My preferred coffee is Seattle's Best French Roast, so comparing that to this Melitta Classic Supreme may not be entirely fair.<br /><br />While this coffee has a somewhat pleasant aroma, it tasted a little bitter. I did not follow the recommended preparation of two spoons per 6 oz. because it would end up way too strong for my palate. I used the same measurement that I use with the Seattle's Best, a perfect cup, in my opinion. I also provided this coffee to some house guests, who thought it was just okay.<br /><br />So the bottom line for me is that this coffee is okay, but not excellent. It is cut in a very fine grind, which I like, but the bean is not very dark. The brewed aroma is not something that perks you up either. If you are a coffee connoisseur and do not like a dark roast blend, give this a try.

review/summary: Robust Yet Mild
review/text: If you're a coffee lover like me, then I suggest you try Melitta coffee.  This particular coffee is ground finely enough to be used in an espresso machine, but works just as well in a drip coffee maker.  I really like this coffee because I love the taste of strong, rich, and aromatic coffee, but I do not like when it is so strong and dark that it tastes bitter.  Melitta Cafe Collection Classique fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />My husband, who is also a coffee drinker, but doesn't quite appreciate it the way I do, only drinks coffee from a drip machine and has to make it very light and very sweet.  He is notorious for using the flavored coffee creamers.  When he he drank this coffee, prepared the same way he prepares his regular Folgers brand coffee, he didn't notice a difference and had no idea that I had let him try a new type of coffee.  So with that being said, if you're a regular supermarket brand coffee drinker who has to mask the flavor of coffee with sugar or flavored creamers, then I recommend not spending the extra money on this coffee as you probably won't notice a difference.  On the other hand, if you are like me, and truly appreciate coffee (I don't use sugar and use minimal creamer) then do yourself a favor and try it!

review/text: I truly enjoy a good cup of coffee. I've tried most major brands of coffee, from the makers of specialty coffee such as Starbucks and Peets to makers of commercial-grade coffee such as Folgers, Maxwell House, and Yuban.<br /><br />I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme Ground Coffee. It definitely ranks as one of the best coffee I've ever tasted. It is medium-bodied yet rich, aromatic, and robust. I usually associate a darker gourmet coffee with flavor, but Melitta has changed that perception. It is not bitter and very smooth to the palate.<br /><br />I generally prefer a darker, more full-bodied coffee such as Peet's, so I was surprised that I enjoyed Melitta a fair bit. While it doesn't displace Peet's as my favorite coffee, it offers a very nice departure from a full-bodied coffee without compromising on flavor. Another plus for me is the Melitta packs quite a punch in caffeine!<br /><br />---<br />If you like a coffee with a lighter body, you will enjoy the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme Ground Coffee. If you're accustomed to a darker coffee, the Melitta may or may not be suited to your taste. (You won't know it until you try it!) The bottom line -- The Melitta is without question the best quality coffee I've ever had in this price range.

On subsequent sipping the coffee's taste does linger well afterword with little to no bitterness; again much like a light roast, but with fuller flavor that one expects from more robust roasts.  This coffee has enough flavor to warrant very little sweetener and no cream at all which should make most coffee enthusiasts happy with this selection...Recommended."<br /><br />This one works in tech support - I would be typing this review with one hand if he didn't enjoy this coffee.<br /><br />I even made sure to get an opinion from the usual tea drinker:<br /><br />"Right-o.  So, as a tea-drinking-my-coffee-must-have-creamer-so-I-don't-taste-the-coffee person, here are my impressions:<br />Smell: slightly bitter with an earthy tone<br />Sight: Rather dark, not pitch black, but dark enough for concern.<br />Taste (black): Dirt with a side of mud.

But, it would be a good baking coffee, particularly if you used it for a dark mocha torte or for mocha cookies."<br /><br />So there you have it!<br /><br /> I should also add that I usually don't make the coffee in my office - ever since I served this, I have been asked "Where's that coffee you brought in last week? Are you going to bring more?"<br /><br />If it's good enough for the cubicle crew, it's good enough for you. :-)

I've been grinding fresh beans for about 25 years, instead of grinding them at the store or buying ground coffee. I think it makes the coffee taste a little fresher and with less acid.<br /><br />I served the Melitta Classique Supreme Ground Coffee to guests last Sunday and everyone really liked the rich taste and I didn't have to make it stronger; I measured it properly and got a really rich coffee. It is good but... I can taste a slight hint of acidy after taste that I don't get with my Starbucks beans.<br /><br />I'd say that, if you don't grind your coffee bean before brewing each pot, then this coffee is as good or better than most ground coffees. The convenience of having it delivered and sent by Amazon are real pluses.

It was surprising then, that the resulting coffee didn't have that much aroma. Don't get me wrong - the coffee tasted great, but I wanted a richer experience.<br /><br />Overall, we concurred that it's better than most store brands like Costco's Kirkland Signature or lower-priced brands like San Francisco Bay, but Starbucks own beans or some of the beans available from Peets produced better coffee. In the end, Melitta provides a good value proposition that I can certainly live with.

review/summary: Hey buddy, can you spare a dime for a cuppa coffee?
review/text: Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee is a mid-priced coffee; it's not truly expensive, but it costs more than many coffee drinkers normally pay.  So the major question that arises is, is it worth it?<br /><br />And the answer all depends on what you want.  It's richer. more mellow, and far better tasting than the economy brands, but it's not as full bodied, nuanced, or enjoyable as the premium brands.<br /><br />It is neither Tiffany nor WalMart.<br /><br />But is is good.  And in my opinion (which surely is what taste truly is), it's worth the $$$.<br /><br />Five stars:  good value for the money.

review/summary: Stirs the European Orfactory Memories!
review/text: Having lived in Europe for over 30 years, it was indeed a pleasure to savor a more classical, European style gourmet coffee. This was the first time that I had tried the Melitta brand and I was very pleased with the aroma during brewing, which did remind me of cafes back in Britain and France. You need to make a fairly generous brew to get the full-bodied impact from this blend and it goes very well with cream and also a dab of honey. The taste is quite rich and the aroma during brewing is very much like freshly ground coffee beans.<br /><br />I am sure that I will be back for more as it makes for a delightful brew that is great to wake up to on a Sunday morning, or any morning for that matter.

review/summary: Robust Flavor and Chocolate Undertones
review/text: This coffee has a robust flavor with hints of chocolate undertones and a somewhat earthy nose. It's not bright or winey like Kenya or Columbian coffees, but it's also not as heavy as a Sumatra. Classique is called a medium blend, and it would be a good after-dinner coffee. I drank the coffee by itself, but it would have the body to stand up to a sweet dessert. The mouthfeel was a bit on the heavy side, but the coffee did not leave a bitter taste in my mouth. I think Classique is a little on the heavy side for a breakfast coffee, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. A 5-star coffee would be good to drink at any time.

review/summary: It took a while
review/text: When I first tried this coffee it had a dark, rich, overly strong flavor and color. In fact it was a bit bitter and was definately not a blend I would recommend. I decided to work with the amount used for each pot and ultimately ended up using less than recommended and it turned out to be very good. I like my coffee black but not bitter or unduly strong and usually use Starbuck's or Seattle's Best French Roast. I still prefer them over this brand but would definately buy a bag of this without hesitation. It had a very low acidity content and even after being in a thermos for a number of hours it retained it's flavor and aroma. If you like a strong, rich blend this is the coffee for you. By using the recommended amount you will end up with a strong, rich, flavorful cup of very good coffee. The fine grind is a nice touch and gives one the feeling that all of the ground beans are being used. Definately a vast improvement over the usual store varieties. Give it a try and chance's are it will grow on you.

review/summary: Comparing it to Julius Meinl Coffee
review/text: My wife is Austrian and her favorite coffee is the Julius Meinl coffee. We like this coffee so much that we order it from Vienna (in our opinion it rates 5 stars). In order to test how good this coffee is, I substituted the Julius Meinl coffee with the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme. My wife drank her coffee and did not say anything. When I told her about the substitution she was quite surprised and she asks about how expensive the Melitta is. Ordering coffee from Vienna is very expensive.<br /><br />In my opinion, this coffee is slightly (very subtle difference) inferior to the Julius Meinl which is our gold standard. Given that the Melitta is much cheaper we will be buying this coffee in the future.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: The coffee, when made in accordance to the directions, is bold and flavorful.  If you like your coffee to taste like coffee - this is a good blend for you.  Best left unadulturated - so no creamer or sweetener.  The second batch we made, we made it a little weaker than the directions, and thoroughly enjoyed that as well.  It is a premium coffee, and priced that way - but if you appreciate a fine cup of joe this will fit the bill.

review/text: I took a try on this one through the Vine program.  For a starting poing, I consider Pike Place Roast from Starbucks to be a four star under this system with Jamaican Blue Mountain being the epitome of five star coffee.<br /><br />I tried the Classique at regular strength and thought it to be watery with a long lasting aftertaste - not a good combination.  At double strength, the taste approached a good cup of Folgers, but the aftertaste remained - slightly bitter and pervasive. I am sure there is a chemical explanation for that, but I don't have it... :)<br /><br />In conclusion, not a "horrible" tasting coffee... just on the southern side of ordinary - with a cloying aftertaste that kills the deal.  Not for me, and i would not recommend.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

review/text: I drink coffee everyday but I prefer home-brewed compared to those that you buy at the coffee shop. By doing so, you conform it more to your desired taste and strength and it is healthier, without the calorie packed extras you get from the regular coffee shop. Upon opening the package, the aroma is instantly enticing. You can tell right away just by the scent that it is gourmet coffee. Upon brewing, this is where it gets you salivating. The fine-ground Arabica variety of this coffee instantly gives you a strong craving from the Once you pour smell. it on the cup and have a sip, it gives a satisfying taste, bold and rich, trademarks of a true gourmet coffee.

review/summary: Blandly Does the Job
review/text: I'm not much of a coffee snob. Heck, I'll drink whatever dreck the greasy spoons are serving without complaining. At home, I'll even reheat a cup that's been sitting around all day, as horrid as that sounds. I totally eschew that dark, burnt-tasting, supposedly gourmet Starbucks (jokingly called Charbucks in our home) simply because it's far too strong for my tastes. But when it comes to my fresh cup of coffee in the morning - you know, the one that gets you going, the most important cup of coffee you'll drink all day - I like it to taste robust, hearty, sensual and strong.<br /><br />Coffee made in drip coffee makers always seems to lack this quality. Coffee from those popular machines always has a somewhat "cardboardy" flavor, in my opinion. So it was with some trepidation that I chose to receive Melitta's Cafe Collection Classique. When I actually do make drip coffee or perked coffee (for dinner guests and the like), I grind the beans fresh which helps both styles have that coffee shop flavor you can't seem to get any other way, unless you own an espresso machine or a french press, but I digress.<br /><br />Since this is already ground in the bag, I knew that my best bet would be to make it over-strong to help the situation out. I don't own a french press, an espresso maker or any other fancy coffee gadgetry. Instead, I made a single, large mug with 4 tablespoons of coffee grounds tucked in side a Melita coffee filter (stapled shut) and brewed for about 6 minutes on high in the microwave, much the same way I make coffee from Folger's coffee singles.  And it worked, the coffee smelled great, was a nice dark color and I looked forward to my first warm sip.<br /><br />And that's when I became disappointed. As dark as the color was, as rich as the aroma was, the flavor was...  lackluster. It simply didn't stand up to my cheap, easy Folgers singles. And that's a shame, because now I have almost an entire container of coffee to go through. And about that container...  It was almost impossible to open. The gold wire wrap that is supposed to keep the coffee closed later fell off immediately. It took a pair of scissors to open the bag and even then there was some trouble. Compared to simply tearing open a Folger's single, this put one more hassle in my morning that I didn't need.<br /><br />All in all, it was just OK coffee. For a premium roasted coffee brand, you'd think this would knock me out of my slippers but instead left me pining for something else. Coffee, anyone?

review/text: My life could be a coffee commercial.  I have to be at work by 5AM every day.  I can't say this Melitta Classic coffee makes me want to get out of bed per usual, but it has definitely been a perk over the last couple of days.  I drink a lot of coffee every day--usually a black classic roast of some sort.  And I have no shame in admitting that when I brew at home it is usually a mid priced coffee purchased at the Supermarket.  Its only when I am out that I get to partake in a more premium brand.<br /><br />I was delighted to find that Melitta's Classique is a medium brew ground super fine producing a rich and savory cup of coffee.  The balance of flavor is delicious and lends well to creamers. The only disappointment I encountered was the packaging.  I was very careful and still managed to end up with a floor full of grounds while initially opening the package. It arrived fresh, and I will definitely be making a purchase again.

review/summary: Superior to my usual coffee
review/text: I typically purchase my favorite "grocery store" brands in whole bean form and grind them myself on my burr grinder.  My typical brands are Peet's House Blend or Newman's Organic in a medium roast, as well as the occasional bag of Starbucks or Green Mountain.  Thumbing through Amazon, I was intrigued by the Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee, and its extra fine grind, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised by the Melitta.  The coffee was darker and more opaque than normal, no doubt due to the finer grind.  The aroma was very rich and robust.  The taste is actually much better than I am used to - a rich, refined roast with a smooth mouthfeel.  I find it to be much better than Millstone and equivalents.<br /><br />After trying this coffee, I am placing an order for 3 more bags.  I definitely recommend trying a bag of this coffee!

review/summary: Good mainstream choice for coffee
review/text: I probably had my first cup of Melitta back in college, considering it a more sophisticated option than Yuban. That's due to its branding (which has remained consistent for as long as I can remember) and its promise of a "European" experience which once you get to Europe, you realize is a pretty broad and meaningless term.<br /><br />But no matter. The coffee's good. It's for you if you like mainstream flavor blends and a medium roast but want to step up in quality. $6 for 11 ounces (one bag) is a fair price and it gets more affordable if you do the subscribe-and-save deal which comes with free shipping. The vacuum bag makes for a compact package when you're storing it before use and seals tight after you open it; the quality is a cut above from some other vacuum bags I've tried that leak coffee grounds, making a mess in the pantry.<br /><br />One odd thing, my three-pack came with just one bag coffee in a wasteful big cardboard shipper. I was getting it for review so can't complain, but this is not typical of Amazon.

review/text: I am not a coffee connoisseur by any means. I only know what I like and what my family likes to drink.  Gourmet coffees to me taste pretty much the same as a good ole can of generic coffee.  Until I tried the Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee.  First off I noticed that the flavor was not too strong.  I am not a fan of coffee that tastes like sludge and lean towards the medium to light roasts most of the time.  Secondly, it smells great brewing.  I know I am having a good coffee day when I can smell it.  The taste is delicate but flavorful.  I tried it black, black with equal, and then black with equal and powdered creamer (my favorite flavoring) and each time, the coffee was enjoyable.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this coffee again.  It comes in a pack of three for only eighteen dollars which is comparable to other brands of coffee that taste ten times worse.  The only negative thing I can say is that the bag is 11-ounces and not a full pound.<br /><br />In fact, I think I'll got make a pot now!<br /><br />Natalie S.

review/text: When first unwrapping the 11 oz. Package of Melitta's Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee, the aroma may bring about the anticipation of what to expect from this brand.  And after preparing two or more teaspoons, depending on one's preference, and hearing the coffee maker percolate and finally smelling the freshly made pot of coffee made and taking the first sip, one will experience Melitta as an alternative to other gourmet coffees.  With its mild and not as strong taste as a regular cup of Starbuck's, coffee drinkers familiar with Folgers' Gourmet Selections may find this brand as comparable.  Indeed, a coffee worth trying.

I expected anything from Melitta to be a quality coffee, and I was not disappointed, but neither was I delighted.<br /><br />The good:<br />* Fills the room with a welcoming aroma, one of the better-smelling coffees I have had<br />* Taste is not too bitter, even when made a bit on the strong side (if Starbucks is too strong for you, you will like this)<br />* Package is vacuum-sealed for freshness<br />* Better than your average grocery store coffee<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br />* Not the best coffee I've had by far. I would put it below Seattle's Best and some of the coffees I get some a local organic store.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good coffee and we will definitely use it up without complaint. I replaced our normal office coffee with this and everyone enjoyed it, but they would not necessarily want to pay a premium over the bulk coffee they normally use.

review/summary: Average Medium-Dark Roast Coffee
review/text: My wife is an accountant so we go through a lot of coffee. And she likes her coffee strong. Her favorite, and mine, are the "Colombian" roast coffees. Colombian coffee is not really the roast, its the source. Only coffee from Colombia can be called Colombian and for whatever reason, Colombian coffee from just about everyone is a medium-dark body, hearty coffee. And that is pretty much exactly what this coffee tastes like, the store brand of Colombian coffee from Kroger or Pubix, which btw also tastes close to 8 O'Clock Colombian blend. If you prefer Colombian blends of coffee, at this point, since taste is not really an issue, price should be the only deciding factor. That is pretty much the deciding factor for us since all of these Colombian labeled coffees taste almost the same.

review/summary: Tastes nice, but I've had better...
review/text: I love a good cup of coffee & the scent of it is one of the best parts, from how it smells before brewing to the final product. So when I got the chance to try out the Melitta brand of coffee (something I've seen in some of my local grocery stores) for free, I figured what the heck? What resulted is a cup of coffee that is better than many of the average brands out there, but still not as good as the coffee that I brew at my bookstore job (when I work in the cafe).<br /><br />The scent of this coffee is great, so in that aspect it really didn't disappoint. It's also french press friendly, but then most coffees are. (But I thought I'd mention it since that's how I brewed my coffee.) I like my coffee strong, so I put more than the recommended amount & came out with a cup of coffee that was a little weaker than I generally like it.<br /><br />The taste of this is very good & is better than the Folgers coffee my mother gets (which I can either take or leave), FAR better than the shoddy Aramark coffee that is served at my full-time job (but then anything is better than that stuff), but not as good as the stuff that I make at the bookstore (my part-time job) or the Dunkin-Donuts brand coffee that a coworker makes. (He's got a specific way he makes it.) And compared to the pricey gourmet stuff my dad buys? This is swill in comparison. (But in all fairness, even my precious cafe coffee is swill in comparison. Like I said, my dad buys the good stuff.)<br /><br />Would I buy a bag of this product with my own money? Sure, if it was on sale in my local grocery store. It's a decent cup & I'm curious enough that I'd try some of the other flavors out there. Offhand though, I'd rather spend 8 to 12 dollars on a bag of the stuff at my bookstore job & drink that instead. Before buying bulk amounts of this coffee I'd recommend that any potential buyers purchase a bag at their local stores first. The price for three bags of this is decent (six dollars) since the bags of this go for about seven to eight dollars in my neck of the woods.

review/text: I'm a big coffee drinker so I'm quite picky about the brands and roasts I buy. This Melitta coffee is a medium roast, very smooth and not bitter. The grind is very fine so I was expecting it to be strong or espresso-like, but it turned out to be a nicely balanced medium blend. I prefer this type of coffee to the brands that are overly strong and have a burnt taste. Just make sure to follow the instructions on the bag for the amount of coffee per water. You can adjust more or less coffee based on your preferences. If you're making it as iced, use a little extra coffee. I'm glad I found this brand for a nice everyday coffee.

review/summary: Makes a darn good cup of joe.*
review/text: Classique Supreme is the second of the Melitta Gourmet Coffee Cafe Collection coffees I've tried. (I received free samples for review of the Classique Supreme and the Hazlenut Creme Brulee.) And I am quite pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />My coffee of choice to date, which I've been drinking for around 2 decades, is Peet's (which I get shipped to me as there are no Peet's outlets near me). Peet's sells several varieties which I like, and I always buy whole beans and grind them to make a cup at a time via a cone filter. When making coffee for 2 or 3 people I make each cup separately (using 2 or 3 cone filters at once). Also, I never drink straight coffee but always sweeten it (usually with honey) and add half & half (and sometimes French Vanilla International Delight).<br /><br />Melitta's Classique Supreme, as well as the Hazelnut Creme Brulee in the same line (and I assume all the varieties in their Cafe Collection line) are ground "Extra Fine," and look to me to be finely ground enough to be used in an espresso maker (though I only make espresso - which I use in homemade lattes - with unflavored dark roasted coffees and the Classique Supreme is a medium roast). It looks and feels too finely ground to be used in a French Press (which I occasionally use for preparing coffee made from freshly ground beans, ground relatively coarse).<br /><br />So for testing/sampling purposes, I've been preparing the Classique Supreme (which I've drank several cups of over a couple of days) in a filter cone, using the exact measurements I use when preparing ground Peet's beans. And once I have sweetened and creamed the coffee to my taste, I cannot detect a difference in quality. The only difference I have noticed is that both varieties of Melitta's Cafe Collection that I've sampled leave me with less of an intense caffeine buzz than I typically get from the same size cup of Peet's (whether it's a medium or dark roast variety of Peet's). That's not necessarily a bad thing, for sometimes my second cup of coffee of the day (I usually drink 2 TALL cups a day) leaves me feeling a bit over-caffeinated (e.g., headachey or just off-kilter).<br /><br />The bottom line is that I like this coffee and given the relatively low price (e.g., at Amazon as well as Melitta's website), I'm motivated to try other varieties in Melitta's Cafe Collection line (particularly their darker roasts).<br /><br />I had difficulty opening both 11 oz. sample bags of Melitta Cafe Collection coffee I received - I found it impossible to open either bag without tearing holes in the upper half of each bag - so I called Melitta to comment about this. The customer service representative I spoke with said that Melitta recommends using scissors along the top of the bag.<br /><br />*(The phrase "cup of joe" supposedly came into vogue after Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson, Josephus Daniels, banned alcohol aboard navy vessels in 1914, leaving coffee the strongest drink on navy ships.)

review/summary: taste doesn't live up to my expectations 2.5 stars
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV34E">Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Gourmet Coffee</a> is good coffee. However, Personally, I feel labeling "gourmet" is misleading<br /><br />When I think Gourmet Coffee, I think of something that's gonna taste a lot better than MJB (I prefer to call it Mary J Blige), Maxwell House, Foldgers, Yuban, Millstone, ETC<br /><br />It smells like expensive gourmet coffee, but it doesn't taste gourmet<br /><br />And while this taste good, it really doesn't taste all that different than my usual cup of Maxwell house or MJB. So Paying 18 bucks (Current price) for 33 ounces (3 11 ounce bags) is a bit pricey for some fancy packaged plain-tasting coffee.

review/summary: Good, basic coffee
review/text: I'd say that naming this coffee blend "Classique" is appropriate. I found it a good, solid, "classic" coffee; neither too dark nor too light, bold without being bitter, and without any excessive non-coffee notes to the flavor. You know, the sort of "notes" or "tones" that often get bragged about in descriptions of coffees, such as "floral", "citrus", "nutty", "winy", etc. Perhaps more delicate palates than mine will detect some of those notes, but my point is that they don't stand out excessively. This is a nice, unpretentious coffee that tastes like coffee.

review/summary: I've Had Better Coffee in European Cafes: A Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee Review
review/text: We enjoy our morning coffee and, years ago, bought an espresso machine to stop paying so much money over to Starbucks.  Not only do we like coffee, but we know what we like and this isn't it.<br /><br />Flat bottom drip coffee makers use a medium grind to brew a perfect cup; while cone filtered drip pots can use a fine grind.  However this coffee is ground, according to the package, extra fine.  This type of grind is typically used in espresso machines, not drip coffee makers.  I have to wonder how much the grind affects the flavor of this coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and non-acidic, while at the same time bland and forgetful.  We usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup.  We tried the two teaspoons, as recommended on the package, which resulted in a weak cup of coffee.  Using our norm, the coffee had more flavor, but wasn't good.<br /><br />The only good thing about this coffee is using the used grounds in the garden.  I'm seriously thinking of soaking the remaining grounds so I can toss them in the garden.  If you are looking for a true European coffee, try Lavazza or Illy.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Used grounds can be used in the garden<br />Not bitter or acidic<br /><br />CONS:<br />Bland & forgetful flavor

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I have been eating this cereal for years. It initially had oat bran as well as the current corn, wheat and rice. I never eat "sweet" cerals but this is good with just a very very slight hint of sweetness. Eat it right away and it is very crisp and crunchy or let it stay in the milk a bit and it gets more like oatmeal. Great stuff. Wish I could find it in the grocery but this is another case where Amazon comes through. $9.99 a box...you gotta be kidding!No cereal is worth that much but don't despair because other sellers have it for normal reasonable prices.

review/summary: No competitors from which to choose, but fine for what it is
review/text: First: we are talking about a shaker of actual gold flakes. Anything negative probably falls into the category of, "Seriously? You just bought a shaker of GOLD FLAKES." That being said, the shaker itself could be better; the flakes come out all right and not too clumpy, which is good--I'm using these for a specialty cocktail--but I have a feeling about 30% of the gold I just paid an outrageous sum for is going to end up stuck to the sides of the shaker with no way to extract.<br /><br />Also. I know it's real gold, but this price is just silly. I can't use the candy gold flakes for my purpose so I'm stuck with these guys, and I do appreciate they make a hard to find product, but their margin must be astronomical.
