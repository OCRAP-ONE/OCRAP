review/summary: As good or better than from scratch.
review/text: We were pretty excited to hear about these mixes coming out.  I talked to my local Harmon's grocer and had him order it and call me when they came in.  It was great.  We ate them with some people on a normal diet as well as those of us that are gluten free.  The Wheat-eaters all said that if it were served at a party, they wouldn't have suspected that anything was odd about it.  They said it wasn't the best cake they had ever eaten but it was good.  Translation, It's by far the best gluten free cake mix that we've tried and it is even as good or better than our cake we make from scratch.<br /><br />I'm a 24 year old who's been diagnosed with Celiac disease since I was 4. We've tried a lot of recipes and most everything we make from scratch is better than the mixes we've found. This time, however, we've been defeated and we're thrilled about it.

review/summary: Well, there go all the thin celiacs.
review/text: Ever since discovering that I had Celiac disease, I have become quite thin(which is nice) and quite resigned to my sad, cakeless fate. I have tried a number gluten free cake mixes and have been profoundly disappointed by all of them. Some fall to pieces when you slice them, some are gritty, some have an awful aftertaste from the unfamiliar flours used in making them.<br /><br />I was browsing the shelves at my local Target store when I saw this mix. It was the last box in the back row of the top shelf, and it was on sale. In short, it was calling for me. The employee who had to help me get it down turned out to be gluten intolerant as well and had good things to say about it. She recommended I use only egg whites, as the cake was a bit heavy otherwise.<br /><br />I baked up a batch last night and it made 17 normal sized cupcakes and might have made eighteen if I hadn't spent so much time tasting the batter. Mixing it up was a breeze and the Betty Crocker website has no-butter variations on its website if you're concerned about that sort of thing. If this keeps up, I probably will be in a while.<br /><br />The cupcakes came out moist and not even a little bit grainy or dry. They came out looking and tasting exactly like glutinous cupcakes. My gluten-loving boyfriend ate two and said they were excellent. The next morning they were a little dryer and firmer, but still very good. Microwaving them for a few seconds restores them to their fresh-baked state.<br /><br />I got my first box for just under 4 bucks, about the same as it is here only I had to drive to get it. For 4 bucks I got 17 cupcakes that taste better than the baked goods at the gluten free bakery in town. The bakery charges about as much for one pastry as I paid for this box, so I figure I got a good deal. I don't understand everyone who is complaining about how you don't get as much cake as a conventional Betty Crocker cake mix. Don't you all remember how much cake you get from a similarly priced Bob's Red Mill bag? Or GF pantry? Or how much a flourless chocolate cake costs at the natural foods store? A hell of a lot more.<br /><br />As much as I want to support the smaller specialty companies and their small, ethical companies...I'm going to have to pass and go to Betty Crocker for my cake needs. Sorry folks.

review/summary: To be honest...
review/text: I honestly think this is the best box cake mix I have EVER had. I only went GF about three months ago, so I haven't just forgotten what "real" cake tastes like! I had to change the baking time to a few minutes under the lower end of the range given and the cake was perfect. I topped it with cream cheese frosting and it was SO delicious - moist and really chocolatey. No weird texture. I also didn't have any issues with it not lasting as long as other cakes, I had leftovers for almost a week and it only started to taste a bit stale on the last day or two. It smells a little weird when mixing and baking, but don't worry, it tastes amazing.<br /><br />I have never reviewed anything on amazon before but had to get on for this. After trying so many disappointing GF products - wow! Betty Crocker really did it right. It's not crumbly, dry, grainy, and doesn't have any weird off flavors from the different flours. Its price is very reasonable (especially if you buy it on amazon, the price for six on here is roughly the price of four boxes at my local store), and Betty Crocker almost always has coupons available for cake mixes if you do buy it in-store.<br /><br />This is most definitely going to become my go-to GF dessert. I can't recommend it enough to anyone avoiding gluten. It is so rare for me to eat a baked good now that is even worth the calories because most of them taste so bad. I have heard from some people the other GF mixes by Betty Crocker are not as good, but I have the yellow cake mix in my pantry right now and will try it out now that we've finished this cake!

review/summary: All you could want in a cake mix
review/text: I was skeptical at first that something so convenient as to be sold at our regular grocery stores would be good, even though I have been happy with Betty Crocker mixes in the past. But this made really delicious cake! Very chocolatey and moist, and your cake will stay fresh tasting for several days. Much longer than traditional wheat flour cake. This is definitely one product where you won't feel like you need to make a GF cake and a regular one, because everyone will enjoy it and won't taste the difference. It is very soft and not at all grainy. The best part is you don't have to be the one who is settling for an inferior substitute if you can't eat gluten, while everyone around you is eating something better. Do note that each box only makes a single layer cake, as shown in the picture, unlike the traditional cake mixes that make a two layer cake. And it is a bargain here, I have seen it elsewhere for $5 or more a box.

review/text: This mix is alot more expensive than it is in the grocery store!  I paid $3.17 for this at the grocery store but on Amazon, it's $3.97 each.  Even with the 15% "Subscribe and Save" discount, this is still almost $2.00 more for the 6-pack, then at the grocery.  Not what I expect from Amazon, especially when buying in bulk. :(<br /><br />For the quality, its pretty good, and better than most GF mixes, but I wish they'd be more careful with the soy-contamination since we are Gluten-, casein-(dairy) and soy free, as well as HFCS-free.

review/text: If you're dealing with food allergies as well as celiac disease, be warned: the reformulated Devil's Food Cake Mix now contains soy flour. This is possibly the nastiest thing Betty Crocker Corporation could have done. "Hey! Let's take a product made for the specialty celiac market, and make it unsafe for up to 40% of celiacs, those who react to soy protein!"<br /><br />Bad move, BC.<br /><br />Prior to this recipe change, I would have given it 4 stars, as it is easy and convenient, but not great.

review/summary: Great Instant Treat. Requires practice.
review/text: I can eat wheat, it just makes me feel tired and icky so I avoid it when I can. When I saw this, I had to try it. Great instant mix! Usually gluten free baking is so tedious. You have to buy all sorts of "flours" and the guar and xantham gums...Forget it!<br />This box only required three ingredients: butter (weird to be adding butter into a cake mix), eggs, water. NICE!<br />But my cake came out dry. I'm sure that it's because I don't bake often so I'm constantly out of practice. I was dismayed that my cake did not come out moist like the gluten cake mixes. So, I used a slightly larger pan than what was called for on the box. And I offset that by reducing the baking time from 43-48minutes down to 40 minutes. In hindsight, I should have started checking the "done-ness" earlier with a toothpick so that I wouldn't over bake it. Oh well, I made it for myself as an afternoon snack. No one else has to eat it! It is a bit grittier if you compare it to regular gluten cake. It's not gritty if you compare it to other gluten free fare. I'm going to buy a few more boxes and try again with different times and pans.<br />If you've been searching for a chocolate cake that will hit the spot, this definitely will. Do yourself a favor and get a couple of boxes...for experimentation. Lovely price...great taste...easy. You won't be sorry.

review/summary: This cake made a gluten free 8 year old VERY happy!
review/text: My 8 year-old son was diagnosed with Celiacs last week and this past week has been a flurry of buying, trying and tossing various gluten free products.  My son really loved this Devil's Food cake and it couldn't have been easier to prepare.  The only downfall is that 1 box only makes 1 round cake pan, 1 8 X 8 pan or 12 small cupcakes.  If you want a two layer round cake (like you get out of 1 regular cake box) you have to prepare two boxes ($3.99 ea at Target so $8 for a two layer round cake).  I've also read reviews that say Pamela's Products Chocolate Cake Mix has healthier ingredients but, as any Mom knows, sometimes "healthier" means bland and tasteless when it comes to a child's taste.  I'll have to try Pamela's Chocolate Cake Mix next and write a review from an 8 year-old's perspective BUT for now I'll be making this cake again and again and making a gluten free little guy very happy:)

review/text: I'm no cook so don't make gluten free bakery items, normally. Sure I tried a few over the years. Generally they aren't very good and the good ones I find are super expensive and require a special trip to a health food store. What I can buy commercially already made up is generally pretty poor. Actually it is mostly down right awful and super pricey.<br /><br />So when I saw these Betty Crocker Gluten free bake mixes I decided to give them a try. WOW! This chocolate cake tastes great and was super easy to make. It's probably not as good as super premium homemade chocolate cake from scratch but it is cheap, the ingredient list looks pretty good and it is very easy to make. Exactly what I would look for in a cake mix in a box.<br /><br />I don't like the Betty Crocker Gluten Free frostings because of the hydrogenated fats so made some chocolate frosting from scratch (it was pretty easy also and tasted great). The second one I topped with strawberries and that desert (chocolate cake, chocolate frosting and strawberries) blew me away it was so good! Thanks Betty Crocker!<br /><br />Here's the frosting recipe if anyone is interested.<br />[...]

review/summary: As Good As Made From Scratch
review/text: In general I have found most gluten free mixes to be expensive and not worth eating, so this cake was a delightful surprise. I am so pleased that Betty Crocker has a gluten free line, because I grew up with Betty, and it is nice to have an old friend on hand in my pantry. The taste and texture are really very good, and it is just as good as if I had made it from scratch. I didn't care for the yellow cake mix, so I was apprehensive about this one, but I needn't have worried. This makes a superior product, and the price is excellent.  I love this so much that I have multiple boxes on my pantry shelf for those times when I want something good and I want it fast. This one does very nicely.  I can't thank General Mills enough for this product line; it is easy, fast, good, and so much more affordable than many of the other brands. This tastes so much better than any of those other brands and I will always keep a case on hand.  I still bake a lot of things from scratch, but this mix is for the times when I don't have the time or patience to throw one together, or for last minute occasions that arise, when you need a dessert, and you need it quickly.  Definitely one of the best products there is. Betty is the other woman in my husband's life.  He can eat anything he wants, and has no allergies, but he loves the Bettys to distraction. Try this one, you will too.

review/summary: Too Bad Betty Crocker, You Blew It!
review/text: When BC first released the GF mixes this cake mix was Gluten Free and Soy Free.  They listed possible CC from Soy so I tried it with reservations the first time, but it didn't bother me.  I was thrilled!  I loved the convenience of actually buying a GF cake mix in the store instead of off the internet in bulk.  Those days are gone.  They reformulated and dumped a load of soy flour into this cake mix.  Why?  Who knows, but in doing so they lost this customer and quite a few other Celiacs who also cannot tolerate soy.  Way to win customers and make money.<br /><br />On the up side Amazon is thrilled; they've got this GF cake mix customer back.

review/summary: How to make this mix better
review/text: This mix was ok -- for gluten free.  Which means is still was a bit dense and dry.  But I experimented with it and got a better than real cake result.  Instead of using the directions on the box, combine the mix with 1 package of instant chocolate pudding mix, 4 eggs, 1/2c vegetable oil, and 1 1/4 c cola. Beat for two minutes on medium, pour into greased 9x9 pan (or larger, my cake was very thick), and bake on 350 for 35-45 minutes.  The cake is moist and spongy and you can mix and match the pudding mixes and colas.

review/summary: Cheap ingredients, 15 oz versus Pamela's 21 oz mix, it does taste great BUT I'll stick with Pamela's GF Cake thank you.
review/text: I was surprised to find this in the grocery store.  I was unimpressed when I read the ingredients and looked at the price, $4.79.  None of the ingredients were organic like Pamela's Chocolate Cake.  So why charge this extremely high price if you're using junky, cheap ingredients??  A regular Betty Crocker cake mix is $1.90....what justifies this exorbitant price for a refined SUGAR filled GF version?<br /><br />PAMELA'S Ingredients: Organic Natural Evaporated Cane Sugar, Brown Rice Flour, Organic Cocoa Powder (Processed With Alkali), White Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Chicory Root, Sweet Rice Flour, Grainless and Aluminum Free Baking Powder, Sea Salt, Natural Flavor (Contains Corn Derivative), Xanthan Gum.<br /><br />On Amazon I can order the 6 pack of Pamela's for $4.48 per mix.  EACH Pamela mix is 21oz.<br />Betty Crocker is only 15 oz!!<br /><br />BEST BET -- buy Pamela's GF cake mix and get healthier ingredients plus more cake for your dollar!<br />Pamela's Chocolate Cake Mix still reigns supreme.  I've been eating GF for over 15 yrs now.

review/summary: AWFUL!  there's better out there....
review/text: My family has celiac disease and we were thrilled when a major company came out with a gluten-free version of their cakes.  However, Betty Crocker's GF chocolate cake was not very good.  The best gluten-free chocolate cake we've ever tried is the Gluten-Free Pantry's Decadent Chocolate Cake Mix.  No comparison.  Betty Crocker's had an "off" taste and nobody would finish it.  I can serve the Gluten-Free Pantry's cake to everyone and nobody suspects it's gluten-free.  Very disappointed in Betty Crocker.

review/summary: Couldn't tell it was gluten free, but too pricey
review/text: This is my first try at making and eating a gluten free cake.  I had originally wanted Pamela's gluten free cake but couldn't find the chocolate version at my local grocery store.  So, I tried Betty Crocker for my son's 2nd birthday party.<br /><br />I thought the directions might be a bit complicated, but they were really simple.  I wasn't ecstatic about using an entire stick of butter, and may substitute applesauce next time like others have suggested.  I used Pamela's Vanilla Icing to top it and it was perfect.  Everyone was pleasantly surprised at how it tasted like a regular cake. It also stayed moist for several days afterward.<br /><br />I only give it 3 stars because it's not organic and expensive at over $4 a box.  Like someone else mentioned, if you're going to pay that price, go with Pamela's gluten free organic version.

review/summary: So happy!
review/text: I wanted to make a chocolate "hoho" cake my sister had gone on & on about, and I wanted to take it to craft night where my Celiac friend would be. So I took a chance & made the recipe with this BC G-F Devil's Food mix. The cake was a hit! My Celiac friend said it was delicious. The rest of us can eat gluten & they all said it was really good. My husband almost didn't try it bc to be honest the batter looks sort of gritty & he was turned off by that. But he liked it enough that he ate 2 pieces of cake! So if you're considering trying it do it! Oh, & here's the hoho cake recipe. Try it! Go to the blog cookiesheetsandcakepans, 2011 / 07 / hoho-cake<br />PS I compared the ounces in the box to a regular mix at the store & they were so close, but as it turns out the g-f mix only makes half the amt of cake a regular mix does. Just so you know for the sake of a recipe. For the hoho cake I just adjusted the rest of the recipe & made 1/2 the amt.

review/summary: Best one I have tasted!
review/text: I have tasted many GF mixes and this is the best to date.  It tastes like a "real" cake.  It even holds up to the other substitutions we have to do (egg replacer for eggs and pumpkin for butter) and still turns out "real".  You do have to remember the key to working with any rice flour mix is to let the mix sit a few moments before going into the oven.  The rice must absorb the liquid.  This is not a fault of the company, just the nature of working with rice flour. I would prefer it if the price were more in line with regular mixes.  There is nothing that special or that fancy in the mix to warrant such a high price.

review/summary: Sticky and Gritty
review/text: One of my daughter's closest friends is on a GF diet, so for my daughter's birthday party I purchased this cake mix instead of giving her friend a separate treat. This was only my second time trying a gluten free mix, but I was dissatisfied with the results. We followed the directions exactly and made half (24) as mini-cupcakes and half (12) as regular cupcakes. The batter was evenly divided and all the cups were filled the same. Yet, the batter expanded and spilled out when it was cooking, then while they cooled they flattened out with a concave dip in the center. The next morning I tried to frost them, but they were so sticky that dark, cupcake sludge stuck to the frosting. We're not talking heavy frosting either, a light whip cream frosting. When they were served, no one ate more than a single bite and put them down. Usually the kids (4-8 years old) will eat anything sweet, but they all spit it out on their plates. The adults were polite enough to swallow. The final texture was a slippery sweet sludge on top, firm and springy on the bottom, and a grittiness that may be typical of rice flour, (I had noticed the same grittiness in the otherwise delicious bread mix from another company).

review/text: My wife, who is gluten intolerant, was excited in finding out that Betty Crocker finally made gluten free products. A friend of ours made cupcake versions with chocolate frosting and they were yummy! The Betty Crocker brownies are excellent (even better if you add chocolate chips), but the cookies not so much.<br /><br />For those that think that soy flour is gluten, it is not. When some people think of "soy," immediately thinks of gluten. It's because some soy sauce are derived from wheat, but there are some that are not and are gluten free. Soy flour, however, is made from soybeans which are gluten free. If you have gotten sick from eating this product it must be from something else.

review/summary: I really hope that Betty Crocker doesn't discontinue their GF products.  This is my son's favorite cake mix
review/text: I have a 9 year old son with Celiac disease and I love that companies are coming out with gluten-free alternatives.  I know that going gluten free has become a fad lately, so I do worry that some of the new alternatives will fade away eventually.  I just hope that this cake mix sticks around for a long time!<br /><br />This is seriously the best tasting gluten free chocolate cake mix.  Heck, I even prefer it to the regular chocolate cake mix varieties.  It is so moist and rich, without being sickeningly sweet.  There isn't any odd texture that some other gluten free desert mixes have.  It is also extremely simple to prepare.  There aren't any complicated steps, waiting periods or odd ingredients that need to be added.  I love being able to just bake ONE cake for birthdays without having to hear others make off remarks about it tasting weird.  I don't think anyone would know that it was gluten free unless they were told.

review/summary: Family can't tell the difference
review/text: I've been diagnosed wheat-intolerant for about eleven years now, and though I don't have to avoid all kinds of gluten, the two avoidance diets are easy to package together. I remember what "normal" food tastes like very well and am quick to refuse gluten-free products that don't match up to my standards. This mix is absolutely fantastic. I've only made cupcakes with it, but they come out soft and moist every time. There's no weird gluten-free taste at all with the results of this mix - kiss cardboardy desserts goodbye! I've even given these to other family members who aren't on special diets, and they really can't tell the difference. It's so amazing to actually have a product like this that matches my memories of sweets perfectly. Would gladly recommend to anyone going on a GF diet.

review/text: I JUST used this mix for the first time and I was so excited that I had to review it immediately. We substituted canola oil for the butter and made cupcakes which came out perfectly! Be aware that this mix only makes 12 cupcakes (or a small one layer cake) - so it's not your typical Betty Crocker cake mix in quantity but it is very easy and costs much less than buying gluten free prepared cupcakes (or cakes etc) that we have found.<br /><br />We all LOVED the cupcakes including my husband who is NOT entirely eating gluten free (yet). My sons who are 6 and 4 LOVED them (of course).

review/text: For my son's 11th birthday we had a huge party. I invited some friends over that had gluten free allergies so I decided to give this a try. I decided to buy the Betty Crocker Gluten Free Devil's Food cake. I initially thought I would make the cake and if it didn't taste like a normal cake, I would make a second for my son. After I baked the cake I tasted a small portion of it and it was delicious! I was worried because the mix does not smell very good. I also used a fudge chocolate frosting (I had to make sure it was milk free, due to my friend's allergies). Then I covered the cake in a very thin layer of marshmallow fondant (homemade). EVERYONE at the party even people who don't care for cake raved about this cake! The texture is great if you use fondant on your cakes, it has that thicker pound cake texture which is perfect for covering with fondant. I will be buying this again for sure and would recommend. I honestly like this better then cake recipe I was using before, for my fondant cakes. No one at the party knew it was gluten free until I told them. It was very good!

When I realized that I wouldnt be able to have any birthday cake on my sisters birthday, I was pretty down. But we found this. I made a batch tonight, they are DELICIOUS.  I gave one to each of my family members (all Gluten-eating folks) and everybody loved them. Let me warn you. Licking the beaters tastes alot like licking a dirty chalk-board. But the end result is moist, fluffy and perfectly chocolatey. Topped with Betty Crocker Chocolate Fudge icing, these were a real treat. I'm not even sure that I could tell the difference between this and the real thing if I tried.

review/text: This made a delicious, moist, gluten-free, dairy-free chocolate cake!  I used this mix in a castle-shaped bundt pan as well as cupcakes for a birthday party.  It came out of the castle pan easily and held the decorative shape well.  Everyone at the party (mostly folks who don't usually eat gluten-free) enjoyed it.<br /><br />I didn't realize at first that I would need two mixes, so I actually wound up baking the cake with the bottom half chocolate cake and top half yellow, which turned out to be perfect!<br /><br />The only drawback is that it's quite expensive since you need two of these mixes to get the same amount of batter as a regular cake mix.  One box will only make 12 cupcakes or one 8- or 9-inch pan.

review/summary: Good Taste and Texture, but a Smidge Dry
review/text: After eating several gluten-free baked goods that have texture like a cinder block and flavor like chewing dry rice, it's nice to have a cake that tastes like cake.  This adapted mix, based on soy and potato flours, has the springy texture you associate with a proper cake, and a flavor like good fresh fudge.  You could serve this at parties without having to blush at your wheat free alternative.<br /><br />One caution: this cake tends to be dry.  You need a good frosting to keep moisture in each bite, or you'll find partygoers rushing for glasses of water and milk.  Since you have to be just as gluten-savvy shopping for frosting as for cake, your job isn't done when you buy this mix.  However, the fact that you've found a palatable GF cake mix puts you ahead of the game.

Another idea -- bake it in a tort pan, make some quick chocolate mousse for the first layer of topping, and plop some fresh berries on top of that.<br /><br />One caveat: the package really only makes one layer, but it's the perfect amount for a tort pan.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: Pretty good for an affordable gluten free cake mix from a major brand but not totally amazing.  The rice flour is very evident due to the dense texture of this cake.  I made it and actually ended up throwing some out which NEVER happens with chocolate cake but only so much of the dense texture of the cake could be tolerated in our house apparently.  It is missing the airy quality that good cake has.  An acceptable alternative but nothing amazing.

review/summary: Yay Betty Crocker!
review/text: Is it bad that I'm so happy that Betty Crocker created a gluten free facility just in time for us to go gluten-free?  We've been gluten-free and casein-free for just about 2 weeks now.  I made this cake; along with some gluten free oat challah just last weekend.  The oat challah/bread that I made from scratch left a huge mess on my floor and countertop.  It must have had 6-8 different ingredients.  And I find that's about par for the course for gluten-free recipes.  You need to mix guar gum and xanthan gum and tapioca and rice flours.  Yikes.<br /><br />But Betty Crocker does what she does best.  She creates a convenience food (just add butter, eggs, and water) mix and bake.  I substituted margarine and the cake came out every bit as good as her normal cake mixes come out, albeit that it didn't seem to rise as high.  It was moist and it passes mine and my 3 year-old dd's taste test.  Thanks so much!

Even the resistant eaters in my family ate this and thought it was great.  Yummy!

review/summary: Moist even days after baking!  Can be modified and still turn out yummy.
review/text: This mix is delicious!  It is not grainy or dry like so many Gluten-free recipes turn out to be.  I used two boxes of this mix to make 24 cupcakes (it actually yielded 28 big cupcakes!).  I did modify it a bit by adding cold coffee in place of one of the cups of water and by adding about 3 oz. of goat yogurt.  I also used 4 duck eggs (I'm allergic to chicken eggs) instead of 6 chicken eggs.  I used Earth Balance as my butter.<br /><br />I was so impressed by how moist and ungrainy these cupcakes are and that they remained that way.  As, in my experience, even if Gluten-free items taste good when freshly out of the oven they often get dried out sooo quickly.  I'm so happy that these stay delicious and don't dry out.  YUM!<br /><br />I used this recipe with Toffee Vanilla Frosting Mix by Namaste which turned out great with some water, 2-3oz. goat yogurt to make it creamier, and shortening.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAVKX2">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Toffee Vanilla Frosting Mix, 16.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

She won't eat a wheat chocolate cake but she loves this. It's that good! I'm thrilled because everyone loved it.

review/summary: GF Chocolate Cake....Pricey & Low Yield
review/text: My wife and I picked one of these up at the local grocery store.  I've become accustomed to paying more for GF products, more so when they are organic, but she wanted to try it, and we hadn't had cake in a while.  The actual packaging of the cake mix is larger than a normal chocolate cake mix, but don't be deceived, you won't get more than 1 8" cake round out of this mix.  That was the biggest disappointment to the both of us.  More than twice as much as a normal cake mix, and only half the yield of a normal cake mix.  That is my sole reason for giving this such a low rating.  In fairness, if I had looked at the picture closely, or maybe read deeper into the details on the back, I may have figured this out, but I didn't.<br /><br />Aside from the let down of the low yield, the overall taste of the cake was okay.  It seemed a bit dry to us, but having only baked one of these, it could have been something we didn't do quite right.<br /><br />We won't be picking up any of the other BC GF mixes.  We're off to look in to making them from scratch.  I'm sure, with the right recipe and GF flour mix, it shouldn't be too much more work than making it right out of a box (not to mention, we can go with better ingredients, making it somewhat more healthy).

One wonders if this marinara could be even more Italianate with Sangiovese, Barbera, or a Super Tuscan blend. It's a rich sauce,and would be a great contrast to a cucumber salad with a vinegar sauce. This Cabernet marinara also pairs well with Parmesan. This sauce serves as a template--one could add chicken, tuna,sausage. It's very versatile. This Washingtonian sauce gives a taste of the Wine Country!

I wish someone would have reviewed the truth earlier so we weren't stuck now with 2 bad packages.<br />We then found the old brand we used to use in a store near us(a bit more expensive) and it turned out delightful as usual. buyer beware, I hate to have to write these kind of reviews...the company LOOKS professional....but! It's probably difficult to return PART of a partially used order.

review/summary: Why bother?
review/text: If you see Vernors Ginger Ale in the store at it's usual price, ie. > $3.00 snap it up as it is much better than Canada Dry or comparably priced Ginger Ale/Beer. I don't understand the point of vendors selling a product here and then charging between 50%-125% of the product price in delivery costs. Who is ever going to purchase anything with S/H fees that high?<br /><br />I have recently become a fan of good Ginger Ale/Beer and would love to find a consistent reliable source for Vernors(for every day drinking) to some of the really good brands; Cock N Bull, Reeds, or the last brand I tried, which I believe was named Santa Cruz,for when you want something really good.<br /><br />I have tried making it at home and it works well aside from the thus far insoluble issue of fermentation after 5-7 days (even refrigerated). If you can find this with free shipping, fill your storeroom, but aside from that, I don't know. The few brands Amazon carries with free shipping, I have issues with. Fever Tree; not great and 7 oz.bottles; Hansen's; too much vanilla taste, really overpowering. If you truly like ginger in different incarnations, the Ginger People make an excellent 5 oz. bottle of ginger juice; a drop of which will invigorate mass produced ginger ale. Their shipping is also outrageous but here is a tip with which I reluctantly part. Vitacost.com carries it by the case 12 bottles @ $4/btl. and has very cheap S/H-free over $75 and they have a broad line of nutritional supplements that you can easily add to cart to get total above $75 and get free shipping.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a quality ginger ale/beer distributor that offers free shipping, I'd love to know. In the meantime, even Canada Dry has responded and is now actually putting ginger in their ginger ale. I couldn't believe that it was all artificially flavored until about 9 months ago.

review/summary: Made in Michigan since 1866
review/text: I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 , no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime.  The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is "The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.

I alwasy bring enough back with me that I can have enough for myself and use it at school for special activities. It's become my little way of keeping part of home with me.

The outside is covered in chocolate.  It's somewhat hard to find and a bit expensive, though Amazon's price is a little better than the last time I purchased it in a store.

review/summary: Honeycomb Coated with Milk Chocolate
review/text: Violet Crumbles are a classic Australian candy bar: they've been around forever and are very popular over here. They consist of a fairly hard, but brittle bar of honeycomb coated in milk chocolate. And yes, they are delicious!<br /><br />They're also a lot like the (internationally) better known "Crunchie" bar. The main differences are that:<br /><br />1. Violet Crumbles have a slightly thicker outer layer of milk chocolate.<br /><br />2. The honeycomb in a Violet Crumble is slightly harder and more solid, so it tends to shatter rather than crumble when you bite down on it.<br /><br />3. The honeycomb in a Violet Crumble has a stronger honey flavor, with significantly more "bite" to it, so to speak.<br /><br />Note that Violet Crumbles can also be purchased in packs of six.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Candy Goodies, El Paso, Texas ROTC BLDG, Andress High School
review/text: This was an item I recalled from my childhood (early 70's) and I wasn't sure of the name of the candy.  BUT the item I ordered (and received) was the very item I had in El Paso, Texas in 1971!  Brought back great memories and I really appreciate the ability to still obtain the item!  Fast shipping, great service, but priced a bit high (with purchase and shipping)...  I suppose that is something we can't avoid though!

review/summary: Expensive and not what I expected!
review/text: Before I get into the meat and potatoes of my review, I'd like to point out that the front of the packet reads, "Sweet & Salty."  THERE IS NO SALT IN THIS PRODUCT.  The ingredients listed are:  Popping corn, coconut oil, sugar, beta carotene.<br /><br />Now, if you make this in your Whirley Pop according to the directions on the back of the packet, the sugar caramelizes.  Not only does the sugar caramelize, but the crank is VERY hard to turn once the sugar starts melting; this makes it very easy, indeed, to break the delicate, plastic crank on your lid.  What you ultimately end-up with is sticky, brown popcorn, and a BIG mess to clean out of your pot and off of the lid (and cleaning that lid isn't exactly what I'd call "easy").  My daughter, the Princess of Kettle Corn wrinkled her nose when she saw what it looked like, but being the trooper that she is, she ventured a taste...and (drum-roll, please) she declared, "Nope.  That DOES NOT taste like kettle corn!"<br /><br />So, after tossing the whole first batch and soaking the pot for an hour to get some kernels "unglued," I tried again.  I opened the side of the packet that contains the popcorn and sugar FIRST (being careful not to open the oil side) and emptied the contents into a wire mesh strainer over a bowl.  I shook the strainer so that ALL of the sugar was separated from the popcorn kernels.  I reserved the sugar and mixed a little popcorn salt with it.  THEN, I opened the oil side and put that into the Whirley Popper along with the (now sugar-free) popcorn kernels.  I popped the popcorn as I usually would.  When it was finished, and still VERY hot, I took a large bowl with a tight-fitting lid and filled the bottom with hot popcorn; I sprinkled the sugar/salt mixture over this.  Then I added more popcorn; then more sugar/salt, repeating the process until the bowl was filled to within two inches of the top.  Then I put the lid on the bowl, and tossed and turned and shook until I was fairly certain that the popcorn was adequately covered with the sugar/salt mixture.  My daughter tasted it and liked it much better.<br /><br />My family LOVES our Whirley Popper and Wabash Valley Farms popcorn, but this product (in my opinion) is a dud, and an expensive one at that.  If you want my advice, use the Real Theater Popcorn packet and sprinkle some extra-fine sugar on it in the bowl (not the popper) while it's still hot -- you won't have to clean burned sugar out of the pot (and gunk off of the lid), you'll save money and you'll have fresh, non-microwaved kettle corn.

review/summary: Good Cookies
review/text: These are really good cookies especially if you like a lot of chocolate chips in your chocolate chip cookies!  They aren't too sweet either.  I don't like cookies that are all unmelted sugar crystals and fat.  These have great flavor and lots of chocolate!  The cookies are packaged in little cellophane wrapped packs containing two cookies, just right for a quick treat or school lunch.  Best of all they're made with real ingredients, not a chemical soup.  The box is even pronted with soy ink.  I will be eating lots more of these!

review/summary: Misleading labelling of product
review/text: I had previously purchased these cookies at Homegoods for $3.99 a box. Therefore, when I decided to buy these cookies, the title of the item stated "Pack of 6", I thought I was getting 6 boxes for $24, not $24 per box!!!  I would never pay that much for a tiny box of cookies no matter how good they are.  This was very misleading, esp. since I paid alot less for these cookies elsewhere. I kept them because it was too much trouble to return.

review/summary: Not really a true chocolate chip cookie...
review/text: Are these cookies tasty? Definitely YES. They are very very good, which is why I gave them 4 stars. The only reason I deduct 1 star was because they are more like shortbread with mini chocolate chips rather than a traditional chocolate chip cookie. Beware though... These cookies are addictive. They aren't too sweet, which was a pleasant surprise.

review/summary: Excellent...no bones about it!
review/text: Deeeelicious!! I am very picky about fish, and this did not disappoint. Probably as good as the halibut I pulled out of Alaskan waters myself some years back. The best part - I've had 2 pieces so far and not one bone in sight. The price isn't any more competitive than anywhere else, but the quality was very high. It makes me want to buy more products from Omaha Steaks, if only I could afford them.<br /><br />I was worried about the shipping because I received a notice on a Thursday that it had shipped, and when they didn't arrive Friday... or Monday... or Tuesday... I wondered how they could possibly remain frozen. But they were frozen solid! Omaha Steaks could do a better job of describing the shipping process on Amazon. The fish steaks were packed in a cooler with dry ice. It worked out perfectly!

review/text: Got these and cooked them up on the grill - they were very good.  I don't think they are any better than the frozen ones found at the grocery store though.  I will have to compare prices to see which is the better deal.  Either way, I'm glad I got these.  It's one of the few fish that we like - very mild and the texture is good.  It holds together well on the grill.  We use it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q0V7RO">Char Crust Roasted Garlic Peppercorn Rub - 4 oz</a> and love it!

review/summary: Sriracha -- a condiment you can't put down!
review/text: UPDATE: Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at Bon App&eacute;tit magazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!<br /><br />Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show on Dec. 30, 2009 and shared, "If you walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on."<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it be a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hambuger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed "Thai ketchup." Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Sriracha is also an excellent value. Amazon offers three 28-ounce bottles for less than $14, or about 16 cents an ounce. That's a lot of flavor for your dollar.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.<br /><br />Fried Calamari<br /><br />1/2 cup calamari<br />1 cup milk<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup semolina<br />Vegetable oil for frying<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Soak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.<br /><br />In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.<br /><br />Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings<br /><br />6 chicken wings<br />Oil for frying<br />3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce<br />1 tablespoons sriracha<br />1 tablespoons butter, softened<br />Baby mache or other lettuce to garnish<br /><br />Fry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce

review/text: I can't get enough of this stuff, it's hot but mildly so and goes on just about anything. This is basically the asian version of ketchup, but 10x better. The only problem-I can't understand why it's so expensive when CostMo sells 28 oz bottles for about $2.50 each.

review/summary: Not the quality of the original product
review/text: I consider myself a fan of this sauce and usually buy it from store in person. Recently I decided to order it from Amazon, though even when ordering in pack of 3 it is still more expensive than normal retail. (unless you want to buy pack of 12 which I sincerely dont recomment). The quality of this item is different from the one you buy at the store and see in restaurants. It seems like the concentration of the liquid is less and when you want to shake it, it is like you are shaking a bottle of pepsi!!! Therefore it's quite natural that it is not as spicy as it is supposed to be. I think guys at Amazon should pay more attention when they are providing goods from third party. bottome line: WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.
