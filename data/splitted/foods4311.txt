review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: I have tried a couple of flavors and the cheddar is by far my favorite.  The Sour Cream/Onion has an off-putting sweet yet salty powder.  These are a little high in sodium and they are not like regular chips, but they are a delicious chip-like snack.  I recommend the individual serving packs because it is very easy to eat more than one serving of the larger bags.

review/summary: Great chip, little salty for me.
review/text: I ordered this box of potato chips a few months ago. I love the popchips, it tastes great.<br />One thing I have problem is it's little too salty for me. Anyone who has less tolerance of salt should be careful.

review/summary: Tasty, crunchy and healthier than regular chips
review/text: I have tried all of the flavors of Popchips and the Original is my favorite.  You know those chips Munchos that you get at convenience stores?  Well, these kind of remind me of them but they are: 1) tastier, 2) less salty, 3) less processed tasting and 4) better for you.  These are great snacking chips, good with dip, but definitely great on their own.  Crunchy and delicious!  If you like potato chips, you will definitely like Popchips.  Only thing that is weird is that some of the bags are saltier than others - I am not sure why.

review/text: I like that it's not greasy and has less calories, but it's a little salty side, and it doesn't taste like potato chips I'm used to. It tastes like rice cakes with a hint of potato flavor (I guess that's how 'pop'things taste like). I like that it's less of a guilty pleasure, but I don't think I will buy it again.

review/text: I got to sample some of these at a food show and they were pretty good. The original flavor and texture kind of reminded me of Munchos. The barbecue is good too, very sweet, like KC Masterpiece. And the sour cream and chives is pretty good as well. If I was looking for a quick "salty" fix, I would definitely go with the original. They are very light and airy, different!

review/summary: Healthier alternative for chip fix
review/text: In the last 8 years or so, there's been a potato chip Renaissance in the US.  I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a "sometimes" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer.

review/summary: YUMMY, YUMMY a little bit of love for your Tummy
review/text: Hey!!  these things taste good. At first I thought they would be like Pringles," which I don't care for " but they are not. Hard to explain since I don't know what to compare them too. I guess I would call them light and fluffy and yet nice and crisp with a great natural flavor.<br /><br /> These have taken some of the guilt out of eating this type of snack for me. I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.

review/text: Popchips are no ordinary chips. What's in them is as good as what's not in them.<br />No preservatives. No artificial flavors. No saturated fat. No gluten ingredients.<br />Popchips are thicker than ordinary chips. They're crunchy ,zesty, tasty, and not overly salty. I like that there's no greasy residue on my hands after eating some.<br /><br />The chips are uniform in size, strong enough to dip, and small enough to make double dipping unnecessary.<br />After sampling these for the first time, I'm looking forward to enjoying these great tasting and satisfying chips again.

review/summary: So much better than "baked" chips
review/text: About 3 months ago I stayed at a hotel in Los Angeles and these chips were in the room, offered comp to hotel guests. I am not sure I would've tried them otherwise, but I am glad I did and now I'm addicted. I am a thin person so it's all about the taste for me, calories are not an issue. I've never really liked the taste of greasy chips, but baked chips seemed so bland. These chips are the best  and you should give them a try. They are tasty and not greasy. My personal favorite is the original potato flavor, but they are all pretty good.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I don't normally review food products but these were so good I wanted to share.

There should be a box within a box and some type of protection..ie packing peanuts.

review/summary: The Barbecue are my favorite chips!!!
review/text: PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down. The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy. The calories and fat are very low. No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip. You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem. But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case and get to save money to boot.  These chips are not like regular chips - the texture is different, I assume from the "popping," but once you taste them, you will become addicted, too! One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!

I kept the bag and found them on Amazon and started buying them by the case. Not as salty as regular chips, they also have considerably less grease, more of a tasty rice cake experience than a greasy Lay's chip. I have bought cases of the single-serve bags, and end up giving them to friends and coworkers, who turn around and order them for themselves. Yeah, they are good.

I'm a 10-year plus Weight Watcher still maintaining my weight loss, and thanks to products like these that do not taste at all like "diet" food, I can enjoy all my cravings..one slight problem, my husband loves them too, and so now we have to order more!! :-)

review/summary: A tasty snack without the bad stuff.....
review/text: However the first thing to note about these is your going to be hammered with a strong garlic/onion after taste. And your significant other will remind you of this the next day. lol...But not hydro oils or fructose corn syrup or other stuff that should no longer be in any of our snacks are NOT in these. I have replaced the regular potato chips,"even the baked ones" with these. I think they're better. Going to try the sea salted vinegar ones as well as the plains. Will report following. (Id give these a 4.5 if I could)<br /> ***One other thing to note;if you have soft skin in your mouth these may scratch it up.

review/summary: The Barbeque Popchips Are Awesome!
review/text: I first tried a small bag of the Barbeque Popchips on a business trip in California.  They were so good I bought several extra bags and brought them home with me for my kids to try (9 and 10 year olds).  They liked them so much, I ordered a 24 pack online so they could have one in their lunch each day.  My kids shared these chips with their friends at lunch and told me that everyone loved them!  All their friends wanted to know where we got them from!

review/text: I have tried original, BBQ and salt and vinegar. They all they good, the BBQ is the most flavorful. The salt and vinegar is a bit off, and it kind of has that "hmm this taste like health food". Which the BBQ doesn't have that effect at all. Though I'm still happy with my purchase. I have always been a fan of Popchips and always recommend my friends and family to eat this instead of their fried trans fatty chips.

review/summary: Not for everyone!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE popchips!  So far, I have tried the plain (really don't like these - no flavor at all), BBQ (very nice, rather sweet - I do like these) and Salt & Pepper (by FAR my favorite).  The Salt & Pepper are VERY peppery.  More Pepper than Salt, but I really enjoy the savory bite these have.  I really enjoy the texture of these as well.  Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste "weight" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.  I would suggest going on PopChips website and see where they are sold locally, around me they are sold at Target Stores.

review/summary: Warning: will cause bad breathe (but oh, so delicious)
review/text: These chips are very very good. The flavoring on them is the perfect bbq flavor. Unfortunately they leave you with terrible breath (maybe don't eat them before going in for a kiss or talking in someone's face!).<br /><br />They have an odd crisp that's unsettling at first, but if you give it a try, you get used to it, and will most likely enjoy it. You eat them expecting that crunch of a potato chip, but are greeted by something more airy. It's a pretty unique texture that's not much like what I've eaten before.<br /><br />They are not baked or fried, but popped. Which means less calories and fat. They also seem to have the ability to fill me up even though the bag is small (smaller than most I think). So that is a double win.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend trying these in store before investing in a big box of these unless you are adventurous (or generous enough to give away if they displease you)...but DO try them!

review/summary: Much better than I thought
review/text: I only had the BBQ flavor since the variety pack was OOS at the time I ordered. This was the first time I ate these and they are much better than I expected. I read the reviews and saw that it got a lot of praises, but still skeptical since people's taste buds aren't the same. Once I received it, tried a bag and these are great. They aren't greasy at all and pack a lot of flavor. I rather eat these whenever I feel like I need a snack than original potatoes chips or something that's a bit greasy.<br /><br />Either way, these are great. Go to their website and see if you can find a vendor near you. Buy a bag to try out and if you love it, just keep getting more from your retail store or buy 'em cheaper here on Amazon!

review/summary: Great introduction to these chips
review/text: Okay, I personally loved how these chips taste. They are super crunchy and flavorful. I chose to take away one star because the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor was way too salty. BBQ was my favorite. Next time I order, I am getting just the BBQ. They taste just like the greasy unhealthier versions made by other brands. The Cheddar was good but you can tell it was a healthy version of this flavor chips. The rest of the flavors I would say taste as they normally do, nothing special or out of the typical range of those flavors.

I also bought the 3 ounce bags since my entire family loves these. Try these once and you will be hooked.

review/summary: These things are sooooo addictive
review/text: These things are great. I have tried most of the flavors and each one is great. When you open your first bag and put a popchip in your mouth and start eating it, it has a very different texture than you would expect, At-least for me, I did not know what to expect for the texture, and the first few I ate I was I was not sure if I would like it, but then the flavors started to do a happy dance in my mouth, and I got use to the texture and now I cannot get enough of these. They are very addictive, like a legal drug.. They are filling, low in calories and fat. They are my new favorite chips.<br /><br />I recommend going to the website and sending the company an email to let them know what you think of the chips. They are excited to hear what you think and may send you some coupons just for emailing them.<br /><br />If you have never tried these, do it, they are worth it. This variety pack is worth it, good price, great chips. I am eating a bag of bbq while I write this and have a bag of plain popchips waiting for me later. For a chip like this, I didn't have high expectations for the plain chips. Some low fat chips and foods that don't have seasoning taste bland and not work it, not these, even the plain chips have great flavor.

review/summary: The best chips EVER!
review/text: PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down.  The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy.  The calories and fat are very low.  No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip.  You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem.  But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case.  One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!

Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: These are really great! You would never know they are not fried and they don't have that bland taste like baked chips do. I must say though, this is the only flavor I care for. I bought the multi pack, and I just don't care for the rest. The sea salt and vinegar is downright horrible, the rest are tolerable I guess.BUT, the barbecue ones rock!!

review/summary: Fantastic low fat option
review/text: These chips were part of my recent diet in lieu of regular chips. The sour cream & onion and cheddar flavors are the best of the bunch (I purchased a variety pk b4 these) and are a great option to help you eat a little better. No luck getting the kids to eat them though.

review/summary: BBQ POPCHIP HEAVEN
review/text: Wow - I am totally addicted to these.  In my opinion, they BBQ flavoring is really good and these are very crunchy.  It does not taste like these should be healthy for you.  I would rather eat these BBQ chips than any other chips and I love all kinds of chips.  I have now switch over to POPCHIPS as I know I am eating a better chip and its healther too.  For 100 calories and around 3 grams of fat, I feel it is a good choice and the taste makes it worth wild.  I have taken some of these to work and have gotten some co-workers hooked on these as well.

review/text: I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.  Around 100 calories and 3 grams of fat is still a very good snack, in my opinion.  I would buy these again.

review/summary: Self-Control is the Issue!
review/text: I am not the type that ever writes reviews, especially for the internet, but Pop Chips are the best  "potato chips" that I have ever had -- so much so that I have to limit myself to one bag per week!  A friend introduced Pop Chips to me and I immediately told her that I hated her because they are so good, they are irrisistable.  I purchased a box of 12 to be delivered every three months so that I can limit myself to one bag per week ... otherwise, I would absolutely be in trouble.<br /><br />Believe me, you have to try these chips!

review/summary: salt &pepper popchips are the best
review/text: Anyone that likes Salt and Peppercorn Kettle Chips will like this snack.<br /><br />Salt and Pepper Popchips are one of the best munchie snacks that has come out in a long time.  No saturated fat, and no trans fat...Great taste with no guilt.<br /><br />Granted they are not quite as addicting as the Kettle Chips,  but they have a lot less fat.<br /><br />i am concerned that safeway and nobb hill grocery stores are not carrying this product anymore.  i am thinking about ordering a dozen cases and stockpile them up so that i am INSURED of my supply.

review/summary: Delicious Low-Fat Potato Chip
review/text: My husband loves pop chips, as a low-fat alternative to other potato chips.  They don't sell them at our regular grocery store, so we bought them on-line through Amazon.  The pop chips came on-time, packaged well, and it's cheaper to buy them in bulk like this!

review/summary: I never thought I'd switch from 'chips'
review/text: I am an avid chip eater. Ever since I was a child (I'm now 29),I was always a 'salty' tooth.<br /><br />I've gone through Ruffles and every other type of chip.<br /><br />The problem is that no matter if I buy a small or large bag; I'd have to finish it in one sitting.<br /><br />I read about this item in my "Shape" magazine for being a low-calorie food and yet being yummy.<br /><br />I tried to find at my local stores but haven't been able to (I live in the Seattle area).<br /><br />Thankfully, I found on Amazon and anxiously awaited my case to come. I was a little nervous to commit to a whole case but was pleasantly surprised when I opened my first bag.<br /><br />I chose this size (0.8-oz over 3-oz) cause I think it's about the right size for a lunch bag.<br /><br />The flavor has a little bit of a kick with it, not too spicy but definitely not a boring bbq flavor.<br /><br />I highly recommend anyone who loves chips but can't stop with just one to try a bag of these. They definitely satisfy and don't taste like they're not fried.

review/summary: As far as diet foods go, it's definitely 5 star!
review/text: We received a sampler package from Amazon that had several flavors....cheddar, bbq, sour cream/onion, plain, salt and pepper, and also the salt and vinegar.<br /><br />I've already received our first shipment of just the vinegar version.  These are a good salty fix without the calories...and each proportioned pouch is satisfying in one sitting.  I would've liked to try the garlic parm but it wasn't included.<br /><br />Our #1 is salt and vinegar and #2 would probably be the salt and pepper.

review/text: These BBQ chips are crisp, well-spiced, & satisfying.  I don't eat as many of these at 1 sitting as I do with regular (Lay's) BBQ chips.<br />We were buying these at Costco for a short while.  The problem with Costco is that when items become very popular, their bulk cost goes up & Costco moves on to carry something else.  Not even Central Market (TX) carries these!  Thanks goodness for Amazon.  I am signing up for the automatic re-ordering program!

review/text: These POPCHIPS are fantastic!!! I tried them at Target, on Sunday and I was hooked. I bought one bag. I came back on Monday evening, and they were sold out!!! I had to go to another store. The barbeque is my favorite!!! My kids enjoy them.  I have everyone at my job eating them also. They are a little pricey at the grocery store, but I have to have them on a daily basis!!

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I really like these. One reviewer mentioned they have soy in them. The last ingredient in them is soy lecithin (emulsifier)which is in many store bought foods. It is not a soy product though. I have to keep my soy intake down because I have Lupus but these do not bother me. They are quite salty and on the rare occasion when I made a pig of myself and ate the whole bag it made my tongue sore. They are really good though. I bought mine at Trader Joe's but am delighted to find them now at Amazon (for only 11 cents more a bag) as it is a pain to go shopping and have to get my wheelchair in and out of the car. I plan to order some right now.A great alternative to greasy regular potato chips.

review/text: These chips are awesome, simply awesome! I purchased a 24pk order of popchips from amazon a few months ago (Original flavour) and I absolutely fell in love!!! It's the only low-fat chip that gave me the same "crunch" as my favourite (super unhealthy) alternative - Kettle chips. I just ordered these last week, and my oh my, I think this is my favourite flavour now! Since I'm vegetarian, the BBQ flavour doesnt appeal to me, but I'm dying to try the Garlic Parm & Sour Cream and Onion... and OH, the cheddar ones are on their way.. can't wait :D... POPCHIPS ROCK and are a part of my daily 3pm snack routine :D

review/summary: Very good substitute
review/text: Well the main thing here is that you are trading oil for starch. I found that it had a slightly funny taste at first, but the salt and vinegar flavors are true to form so its a very workable substitute for oily chips. When I eat chips I tend to eat them for the salty flavor, not the oil.
