review/summary: Sampler pack ?????
review/text: This was suppose to be a 35 cup sampler pack. When it arrived(in a brown paper bag), I thought, OK this will be a good variety because I was happy to see that they were not spending a fortune on what I call useless packaging. But we were very disappointed when we opened it up. There were 35 K cups, but only 9 were not "Green Moutain" brand and of the 35, 18 were of 3 different flavors and a 4th flavor had 4 of it. That really does not give a very good sampling of flavors. Especially when 15 of the 35 are of a vanilla flavor(Vanilla creme, french vanilla, deluxe vanilla, etc.).<br /><br />I will have to think twice before we buy another sample pack, when it really does not give a very good sampling. No where even close to the picture that was provided. Keeping in mind that we did not expect exactly what was in the picture, but at least no more than 2-3 of any given flavor.

review/summary: NOT EVEN CLOSE TO 20 VARIETIES!!
review/text: If I had wanted 8 Spicy Eggnogs I would have just bought a box of Spicy Eggnog.  The same for Butter Toffee.  This was truly dissapointing.  I would sure like to know how you plan to fix this.  I chose this for the many different types, so i could try them without buying an entire box.  I guess I got scammed big time.  When I saw the list, I knew it wouldn't be exact, but mine looks like a Winter Seasonal variety. Lots of Gingerbread, Eggnog and Pumpkin Spice.  I want my variety.

review/summary: Missing half the flavors
review/text: When I got my sampler pack, it did not have all 25 advertised  flavors. I counted only 13 of the flavors were included. Also, I got an uneven amount of each flavor. For instance, I got 9 "Southern Pecan" cups which is not very good.

review/summary: NOT a 25 flavor assortment as described.
review/text: My husband and I were excited to try this assortment since it boasted the ability to try 25 different flavors without buying 25 different boxes.  While we certainly didn't receive anywhere near 25 different flavors, here's what we ended up with:<br /><br />1  Hazelnut<br />2  Mocha Nut Fudge<br />3  Golden French Toast<br />3  Kahlua Original<br />3  French Vanilla Supreme<br />3  Cinnamon Roll<br />4  Chocolate Glazed Donut<br />4  Gingerbread<br />4  Butter Toffee<br />8  Pumpkin Spice<br /><br />A few things..<br />For the 10 different flavors provided to us, overall we got nearly enough quantity of each flavor for both of us to try.  Thankfully, we're already fans of the Pumpkin Spice, or I'm sure we'd be a little irked about the disproportionate number of those in our bag.  With that said, we're satisfied with the purchase, but simply wish that the product listing did not indicate that 25 different flavors would be included.

review/summary: Pleasantly Suprised
review/text: I had some reservations about ordering the Crazy Cups flavored sampler due to the mixed reviews. But obviously most people don't read the actual description, it clearly states "Due to availability some flavors may be substituted without prior notice." The other thing I noticed is that this sampler is sold by several different vendors and fulfilled by Amazon. I think that has also contributed to the mixed  reviews. I purchased the 35 pack from Amazon Warehouse deals. I didn't have my heart set on getting certain flavors, I just wanted to try some new flavors without buying and entire box of 1 flavor. My k cups arrived packed loosely in a box and none were damaged. I got an excellent assortment of flavors. Brands included Wolfgang Puck, Green Mountain Coffee, Donut Shop, Timothy's, Gloria Jeans, and Grove Square. Of the 35 I got 20 different flavors! As far as expiration dates, I only checked about 5 of them and they all had dates of June or July 2012. So I think the biggest factor is who are the packs actually sold by. I noticed most people don't say who theirs was sold by.

review/summary: you don't get what it says
review/text: I am very disappointed in this sampler pack.  I bought this specificallly for the flavors listed and I was particularly excited about a few of them.  I did not get 5 of the flavors at all (most of the ones missing were the ones I was really wanting) and then I got other flavors that I definitely do NOT like.  And I got several of just 3 or 4 flavors and then just one or two of the other flavors, needless to say, the ones I got several of were either the ones I do not like or the not so special flavors.  I am very likely going to send them back.

review/summary: Not much of a Variety
review/text: I very rarely order k-cups any more because they have gone up in price.  However, I was having company over for the weekend and wanted to impress them with a variety pack of coffee.  So I ordered a package of 35 sampler K-cups.  At least 95 percent of the cups were vanilla flavored.  Vanilla decaf, french vanilla, vanilla supreme.  I don't even like french vanilla coffee.  Very, Very disappointed!!!!!  Were is the variety?  Won't order these again.

review/summary: Awesome sampler!
review/text: I love that this sampler box actually comes with SO MANY samples of all different types of flavored coffees. It's exactly what I was looking for so I could try a bunch of different flavors and figure out which ones I like best. Like other reviews say, it is not a fancy gift box but if you're giving it as a gift it would be very easy to throw a bunch in a basket with creamer packs, flavored coffee liquor, coffee spoons and a mug, tie a big ribbon on the handle and give it as a gift that way. There are plenty in one box to make at least 2 of these baskets. The poster it comes with IS sort of silly but I just gave it to my niece to color on. I was only getting this for myself to try out flavors and I'm very happy with it. The price is great for this type of variety.

review/summary: Crazy Cups Flavored Coffee Sampler
review/text: I have purchased the Crazy Cups Flavored Coffee Sampler K-cups 3 times now, one 35 pack and 3 of the 25 packs and I have been VERY HAPPY with it each time. I am confused by some of the reviews. Each time I have received exactly 2 each of many different flavored caffeinated coffees, with a GREAT variety. Great flavors, that I have never seen anywhere else!  I have NEVER had any de-cafs or teas or hot chocolates. Just coffee. It is exactly what I wanted. Each time the packaging has been different, i.e. a brown paper bag in a plastic bag or K-cups loose in a box. But NONE of the coffee cups was damaged, so whatever they are doing it is working. I will definitely continue to order this! Especially since the price is also great.

review/summary: Great Variety, I just wish FedEx held up their end of the bargain
review/text: For $35 (with shipping) I would expect all 35 of my K-Cups to arrive in great condition. Well, FedEx crushed my box ending up in about 10 of them to either get punctured resulting in coffee everywhere in the box, or the sides of the cups crushed making them unusable. Anyway, when it comes to variety, it was top notch. I had about 20 types of coffee in my packaging, and they were all over the spectrum. I look forward to ordering the types of coffees I like, praying they make it to me in 1 piece.

review/summary: The selection is very much as anticipated!
review/text: I was basically just interested in having my own personal k-cups to use with the office keurig machine, so I wasn't too concerned with the bad reviews regarding the balance of the variety of flavors (too many of 1 or 2, not a wide number of choices). So I was very pleasantly surprised upon arrival of my package -- the k-cups were packaged in a rectangular box (not the paper bag I saw mentioned previously), and the choices were awesome!!<br /><br />I would say that I got probably two of a whole slew of flavors: vanilla, butter toffee, blueberry, hazelnut, kahlua, spicy eggnog, the list goes on!! I think they really took in the feedback from customers because I really did not experience any of the negative issues previous customers had noted. All of my k-cups are not expired/good until at least this summer, did not arrive damaged, arrived in a robust cardboard box, and had 2 or so each of a large variety of flavors.<br /><br />Very excited to start trying the different flavors starting tomorrow!

I got a ton of Spicy Eggnog, which I didn't even know came in the pack and Pumpkin Spice, which isn't even listed. We also got several Blueberry Flavored coffees. One would have been great but 4? I only got one Chocolate Glazed Donut. There was also no Mudslide or Butter Toffee flavors. I didn't get a single Grove Square brand. DO NOT BUY this sampler, you don't get what you pay for, only gross, left over holiday flavors. Total waste of money.

Not 27 like I was supposed to. After reading the reviews I had mixed feelings, but ordered anyway. There were many bad reviews and some good ones. The packaging was nice. They came in a box with little compartments that everything fit nicely. I just wish I had gotten the correct amount of coffees. I also received it after the date they said I would. I have ordered online before and it has never taken this long to get. I order last month and just now received it.

review/summary: Not Unhappy
review/text: Wow - there are VERY mixed reviews for this item! After reading a bulk of them, I still decided to order the product because I didn't know of another way to try a variety of flavors without buying a box of each. The description above states that you will be able to try 27 different flavors of coffee without buying 27 different boxes (they must have changed the description, since a few of the reviews state that it reads 35 different varieties). After tallying them all up, I only ended up with 21 different varieties (sigh). I use the word "varieties" and not "flavors" because I did receive several French Vanillas and Hazelnuts, but they were from different companies. My cups also came packaged in a box, so perhaps they've done away with the paper bag thing?<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what I received: Green Mountain: Wild Mountain Blueberry (2), Southern Pecan (2), French Vanilla Iced (2), Caramel Vanilla Cream (2), Mocha Nut Fudge (2), Island Coconut (2), Hazelnut Noisette, Hazelnut Decaf, French Vanilla, French Vanilla Decaf/ Donut House: Chocolate Glazed Donut (2), Cinnamon Roll (2)/ Grove Square: Hazelnut Cappuccino (2), French Vanilla Cappuccino (2), Caramel Cappuccino (2)/ Gloria Jean's: Mudslide (2), Butter Toffee (2), Hazelnut, French Vanilla Supreme/ Wolfgang Puck: Hawaiian Hazelnut Aloha Noisette/ Timothy's: Kahlua Original (2).<br /><br />These just came today, so I have only tried the Green Mountain Island Coconut so far - over ice (I don't drink hot coffee...I know, weird, right?). I love coconut, so this is my new favorite. I am already planning on buying a couple of boxes of this one tomorrow. I didn't even add anything to it - just drank it black, and loved it.<br /><br />So, I think this would have received five-stars from me if only it had actually contained what it said it was going to (27 different flavors)...but again, I am not unhappy with the variety that I did receive.

review/summary: Great Variety - best purchase I could have made
review/text: There is a WONDERFUL Variety of flavors in this pack. I have fallen in love with about 5 of the types. The only bad thing is there are so many that I won't be able to use. For instance the tea, the cider, and the dark brews. I guess they are good for when I have guests over, but thats not all that often. I wish they we had the ability to chose the types of product we would like in the variety pack. If not you might get stuck with several kcups you have no use for.<br /><br />I DON'T know what people are talking about not getting a variety of flavors. I got plenty of different flavors and a couple duplicates (happened to be the best ones) I have been drinking now for over a week and A LOT of the flavors I didn't think I would like I actually do. I am also pleased they had a few decaf kcups for later in the afternoon evening when I am craving some coffee<br /><br />The good thing about this product is it allows you try several varieties and flavors of coffee with out having to buy an entire box of something in order to later find out you don't like the flavor. That would be a REAL waste of your money. I also got about 2 kcups of every flavor (or at least my favorite flavors) YAY! I am not going to sit and review all the flavors I have tried so far because everyone is going to have different opinions on the flavors. I will say I am happy with the fact that by purchasing this product I know what flavors I should buy.<br /><br />So if you want to taste a variety of kcups to find ones that you like. Purchase this product. If you don't like some of the flavors you can save them for when you have guests over.<br /><br />My Kcups also came in a cardboard box and I love it because I haven't purchased a Kcup holder yet so I use the box to hold all my kcups. It was packaged beautifully. Or as beautiful as you could expect to get a box of kcups.

However, I just received mine and I was very happy to see that each variety pack I ordered was in its own separate box and the variety provided was exactly as pictured. I would urge anyone considering buying the variety packs from crazy cups to do so! I am very happy with it and I can't wait to try the flavors with my new keurig! Dont be discouraged by the old negative reviews.

review/summary: Pleasantly Pleased - but not all coffee
review/text: Only one major complaint... it was advertised that I could "Try 27 different flavors without purchasing 27 different boxes." as listed in the product descriptions, yet I only have 24 different flavors.  This is why I gave it 4 stars.  That being said - I will order it again.<br /><br />It is important to point out that they aren't all coffee as 3 are ciders and 3 are a "cappuccino drink," which is okay with me, but may not be with you.  I listed out what was in my box that was actually kind of pretty and could be appropriately dressed up as a gift box as it is a decorative black/white box.<br /><br />Additionally, I would have liked to try something from the Brooklyn Bean Roastery.<br /><br />Gloria Jean's<br />* French Vanilla Supreme<br />* Mudslide<br />* Hazelnut<br />* Butter Toffee<br /><br />Timothy's<br />* Kahlua original - 2<br /><br />Green Mountain Coffee<br />* Island Coconut - 2<br />* French Vanilla Iced<br />* Mocha Nut Fudge - 2<br />* Hazelnut Decaf<br />* French Vanilla<br />* Wild Mountain Blueberry - 2<br />* Southern Pecan - 2<br />* French Vanilla Decaf<br />* Caramel Vanilla Cream - 2<br />* Hazelnut Noisette<br /><br />Grove Square<br />* Hazelnut cappuccino<br />* French Vanilla cappuccino<br />* Caramel cappuccino<br />* Caramel Apple cider - 2<br />* Spiced Apple cider<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck<br />* Cr&egrave;me Caramel - 2<br />* Jamaica Me Crazy-2<br /><br />Donut House<br />* Cinnamon Roll-2<br />* Chocolate Glazed Donut - 2

review/summary: Just Fantastic!!!
review/text: This was a magical box of mixed K-cups full of the most excellent and delicious flavors of coffee one could conceive.  Every flavor in the package was exceptionally delicious.  Also, there were quite a few of the limited edition or seasonal varieties in here, but none of the weird ones that nobody ever drinks.  I bought this for a gift but I'll be ordering another for me to enjoy.  When I opened the package and started reading all the flavors, I kept trying to talk my wife into letting me steal a few out of the box before wrapping it :)  I guess it is random who gets what varieties but I'm glad I ignored the other reviews and purchased this.  None of my K-cups were broken and there was a pretty even variety.

review/summary: Just what we wanted
review/text: I never write reviews.  Ever.  I had to write one for this product because I just ordered my second round we liked it so much! I read all the reviews prior to ordering, so I knew how the packaging would be.  Yes, it arrived all jumbled up in a box (tossed around, is more like it).  Didn't bother the coffee cups, so it didn't bother me.  Went through and noticed a few ciders which on the cooler days here I didn't end up minding at all.  Depending on how serious you are about your coffee, which we are, we enjoyed trying all the new brands and flavors.  It would become a joke to my husband and I as we'd text each other throughout the day to tell the other if we liked our kind for that day.  We'd race to get the last one if there were more than one!  Yes, there are a few repeats, but we liked that.  We felt the variety was very pleasing and it didn't bother us that we had three or four of one kind.  We're not fans of certain ones, but we'll drink them just because it's fun.  I think for the amount you're paying for this many k cups, you can't beat it!  Enjoy, know you'll get some ciders tossed in possibly and some doubles (triples even) of this mix.  I'll let you know what comes in my next "variety" pack!

review/summary: Hit and Miss - mine was a miss
review/text: It seems like whether or not this (or any of the other Crazy Cups samplers) are worth it depends on the day and who packs your orders.  I wasn't one of the lucky ones - over half of what I received were a vanilla flavor.  Sure, I've got vanilla cappuccino, regular vanilla from three coffee manufacturers, vanilla iced-coffee, decaf vanilla...  I assume they were out of the other flavors that day and substituted all vanilla.  Quite a disappointment since I was hoping to try a variety of flavors before deciding what to order.

review/summary: Very happy with my purchase!
review/text: I was hesitant to purchase this due to all the negative reviews, but I am glad I ignored them. I ordered the pack of 35 on March 6th, and received my order on March 8th (using Prime). My main worry was that they would arrive in a brown bag and the k-cups would be damaged. I was very surprised when my order arrived in a brown amazon box, and even more impressed when the k-cups were packaged in a white box instead of being thrown in the amazon box. My other worry was that I would receive a small variety of coffee with multiples of each. I was ecstatic to find that I received almost every flavor in the photo, and no more than 2 of some of the flavors.  Flavors I received:<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck:<br /> Creme Caramel (2)<br /> Hawaiian Hazelnut (2)<br /> Jamaica Me Crazy (2)<br /> Vanilla Francaise (2)<br /><br />Cafe Escapes:<br /> Cafe Mocha (2)<br /><br />Timothy's Kahlua (2)<br /><br />Green Mountain:<br /> Gingerbread (2)<br /> Spicy Eggnog (2)<br /> Golden French Toast (2)<br /> Southern Pecan (2)<br /> Hazelnut Decaf (1)<br /> Hazelnut Noisette (1)<br /> Mocha Nut Fudge (1)<br /> Wild Mountain Blueberry (1)<br /> French Vanilla (1)<br /> French Vanilla Decaf (1)<br /><br />Gloria Jean's:<br /> Butter Toffee (2)<br /> Mudslide (1)<br /><br />Donut House:<br /> Chocolate Glazed Donut (1)<br /> Cinnamon Roll (1)<br /><br />Grove Square:<br /> French Vanilla Cappuccino (1)<br /> Caramel Apple Cider (1)<br /> Spiced Apple (1)<br /><br />The only negative I have is the decaf coffee (I don't care for decaf). I would have preferred a multiple of something rather than receiving the decaf flavors. However, the picture does show the 2 decaf flavors I received, so I really can't complain.<br /><br />I am very happy with what I received, and will definitely be ordering this in the future.

review/text: We just recently purchased our Keurig right before Christmas and have been trying out all the different brands and flavors since. I was super excited to find this assortment stock on here, and even more excited because the price seemed reasonable compared to the grocery stores. I noticed the "clause" at the end, "due to the availability some flavors may be substituted.." Ok, I totally understand. However, when receiving the shipment, I was cheated out of many of these flavors! On a positive note, the shipping was FAST!!!! Maybe I just bought at the wrong time?<br /><br />Chocolate Glazed Donut, Cinnamon Roll, Butter Toffee, French Vanilla Supreme (didn't get), Mudslide (didn't get), Hazelnut, Hazelnut Decaf (didn't get), Caramel Vanilla Cream (didn't get), French Vanilla, French Vanilla Decaf (didn't get), Mocha Nut Fudge, Southern Pecan (didn't get), Wild Mountain Blueberry (didn't get), Kahlua (didn't get), Creme Caramel (didn't get), Hawaiian Hazelnut (didn't get), Jamaica Me Crazy (didn't get), Vanilla Francaise (didn't get), French Vanilla Iced Coffee (didn't get), Caramel Cappuccino (didn't get), Hazelnut Cappuccino (didn't get), French Vanilla Cappuccino (didn't get). Due to availability some flavors may be substituted without prior notice. Amazon is the only vendor of Authentic Crazy Cups Flavored Sampelr Packs.<br /><br />I did get: Green Mountain Limited Edition Golden French Roast, Pumpkin Spice, Gingerbread, & Spicy Egg Nogg (which were not even listed on the products page).<br /><br />I didn't receive ANY DECAF! I was hoping to, since I am pregnant! Wow..just realized I didn't get over half the listing! Luckily, I am just starting out so I haven't tasted these K-cups yet!

This was the best option, I was a little worried from the reviews, but its nothing like it others have said. My cups came in a box that was packaged with an expiration date on the outside, some of the cups come with their own expiration dates. None of the cups were damaged, or even dusty like others have said. I ended up getting 20 different flavors. So a majority of them I got two of one flavor. Which I am fine with cause then my husband and I both get to try them. I am very happy with the product, and cant wait to order again.

I did not get: French Vanilla Iced Coffee, Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee, Jamaica me Crazy, Creme Caramel, Hazelnut Cappacinno, Vanilla Francaise, and French Vanilla Cappacino... and that is just of what I noticed off the top.

This is what my (literally) brown paper bag contained: 6 french vanilla, 6 hazelnut, 4 southern pecan, 3 gingerbread, 2 chocolate glazed donut, 2 mocha nut fudge, 1 pumpkin spice, 1 cinnamon roll, 1 spicy eggnog and NINE, yes NINE, yucky wild mountain blueberry.  I think it's kind of stinky to get rid of unpopular product by loading it up into an assortment pack.  And it was most of the coffe was Green Mountain Coffee, which isn't neccessarily horrible but I also bought this particular assortment because of the variety of brands that were in the picture.  I'm disappointed and will now have to spend more money to try the coffees I thought I was spending money on already. It would be more accurate to lable this a K-Cup Grab Bag!

review/text: The coffee is great, of course! It is a great variety and nice selection, and a pretty good price. Why the 3 stars? Because I received 35 loose k-cups just thrown in a bag. No packaging, no box. It was weird. Only one k-cup came a bit crushed; all the other cups were fine. So, I guess the paper bag filled with 35 loose cups was ok. However, to me, that is poor packaging and poor customer service. I won't buy from here again because of that. I prefer my coffee in the appropriate packaging, with legal labels and legal selling information on the package.

review/summary: Watery tea, overpowered spice
review/text: The spice content is great, but it comes on a base of very watery tea.  This masala chai has a strongly imbalanced flavor; these same spices mixed with more black assam tea would produce a strong tea beverage, not bitter (steeping tea extra long releases bitter tanins, not more tea flavor), with a very pleasant flavor from the spices.  As-is, it is a failure.<br /><br />Since this costs as much as Irish Breakfast Tea bags, and I assume that the spices aren't free, it is my deduction that tea quantity is significantly lower in this particular blend.  Notably, if you were to use loose tea of the same composition, you would use more of it; although I imagine then the spice blend would be overpowering.  The best course would be to use loose Chai tea of the normal blend, and use more total quantity to raise both the tea and spice concentration together; or, for more spice, you would use an in-between blend, but again greater total quantity.<br /><br />This Chai tea is overbalanced towards spice; the total volume is too low for a proper balance.

review/summary: Even worse than their other efforts at chai tea...
review/text: I agree with the review that states this tea is watery. The taste of the spices is also almost minimal, with a faintly medicinal quality. I have now tried three of Twinings' chai teas (one of which is discontinued) and while Twinings remains my favorite brand for black tea they simply cannot seem to make decent chai. Do yourself a favor and try Tazo or Stash instead of wasting your money on this.

review/text: This is the first time I've tried Yacon syrup.  As the name implies the consistency is one of thick syrup or molasses.  The taste is also like a subtle molasses taste.  Unfortunately it doesn't taste very sweet to me so I end up using a lot of it since I like my coffee sweet in the morning.  And at this price it's going to be a pricey sweetner. At the same time I ordered coconut sugar and will likely stick with that over this..we'll see. The Yacon syrup does disolve well in hot things - haven't tried cooking with it or in cold things so I cannot speak to that.  I like that it is a prebiotic.  Would recommend people try if they are looking for natural sugar and sweetner alternatives.

review/text: I love this cereal, but I use it just as much for baking.  I add it to my oatmeal cookies recipe, substituting a half cup for half cup of flour.  It adds a bit of extra nutrition.  I also use a half cup or so in my pizza crust.  I haven't bothered with the muffin recipe because there is not much fiber per muffin, when all is said and done.  I buy a high fiber muffin mix ready-made....lots of fiber per muffin and really, really delicous.  But still....this cereal is great.  I do sweeten it a bit, usually with preserves of some kind.  And I always add raisens while cooking it.  Someone posted that it is lumpy, but I have always found it to cook really fast and really smooth.

review/text: I tried this for the first time this morning -- what a treat! I'm not a breakfast person, but I eat a small bowl of Quaker Oatmeal almost daily so I won't be tempted to eat junk food at the office. I found Quaker Oat Bran at the 99-Cent Only Store in Los Angeles (where rejected products go to die) and decided to give it a try since oatmeal was getting boring. It was hot, filling, and  surprisingly tasty -- kind of like the Malt-O-Meal I'd eat as a kid. Now that I know it's hard to find, I'll stock up at the 99-Cent Only Store. :)

review/text: I know that some people's first reaction to the thought of eating Oat Bran is not "Oh boy yummy", but this stuff is just that.  I have tried many other brands and keep coming back to this one.  For what ever reason, Walmart here no longer carries this and I found this price to be cheaper than what some of the other stores want and bought the pack of 6 so at least I have it.  I love this for breakfast in the Winter and often use it for a "fill in" meal when I just am not sure what I want.  If you like good whole grain cereal give this a try.  I cook it with Soy Milk and its very good.  I highly recommend it for both its taste and its "Good for you" factor.  >^..^&lt;

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious, but online it's expensive-itious
review/text: For some reason, this listing doesn't indicate what flavor of vitamin water zero is being sold on this page. Big oversight. I found this page because I was searching for acai-blueberry-pomegranate - the image here could be that particular flavor but is slightly lighter and may instead be fruit punch or dragonfruit.<br /><br />I was also wondering if there were any bulk pricing deals on Amazon that would save me the hassle of constantly lugging dozens of bottles from my local store, but that doesn't appear to be the case.<br /><br />One way or another, I am completely and totally hooked on vitamin water zero and recommend it highly. It is very tasty, and nutritionally has the following:<br />100% of daily requirements for vitamin c<br />100% for vitamin B5 B6, B12<br />25% for vitamin  vitamin A<br />100% for vitamin  niacin<br />100% for vitamin  pantothenic acid<br />manganese, vitamin B3, magnesium and antioxidant minerals<br />There are few if any preservatives.<br /><br />It's also ZERO calories and flavored with stevia, a natural sweetener, supposedly less questionable healthwise than sucralose/splenda or other artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I've tried about six flavors of vitamin water zero (note that it looks  almost the same as glaceau vitamin water and glaceau vitamin water XXX so pay attention to the label) and acai-blueberry-pomegranate is by far my favorite. I don't care too much for the lemonade one - it's too sweet.<br /><br />In regard to the price, yes, it is over-priced here, especially when you add shipping. In my own local environment (near Boston), about six supermarkets and grocery stores near me carry it, at prices ranging from 99 cents per bottle to 3 bottles for $4 to (at pricey convenience stores) $1.99 a bottle. Given that I drink three bottles a day, the latter is too expensive. So basically I buy it in bulk at the lowest price, and dilute it to make it last longer. It's still tasty when you add a considerable amount of water to it.<br /><br />Amazon does have a listing or two priced at 99 cents a bottle, and with free shipping, but the only ones I've seen so far are is the lemonade flavor, which is actually quite popular. But if you're a person who prefers lemon in water without sugar, then you too would probably find the lemonade flavor too sweet.<br /><br />Since there are many electrolyte-type waters out there that are not very tasty, have limited nutritional value, a lot of preservatives and sometimes a hefty amount of calories - do yourself a favor at try glaceau vitamin water zero. However if buying at Amazon, do a search for all of them listed to find the best price and best shipping deal.

review/summary: Love Big Hunks
review/text: I'm extremely pleased with my Big Hunk order.  This is the second time I have bought them online.  The candy is fresh, unlike the candy store purchases in my area.  Plus the price is great.  The candy stores charge $1.75 each. This is quite a savings.  No more wasting gas driving to the candy store.  Excellent product, excellent price,  and excellent service.  Can't beat that.

review/summary: Absolutely the BEST!!
review/text: Traveled to the store every day for sundry items and bought a couple of Big Hunks. At $1.79 each I checked around for bulk sizes and found them at Amazon. Bought 2 twenty-four count boxes about a week ago and it's time to reload. Just a fantastic candy for anyone who loves toffee, Very fresh and love the 2 day delivery.<br />Thanks so much.

review/summary: Is this really Sencha?
review/text: I am a daily sencha drinker and I have had not so good sencha in the past, but this wins the not so good medal from me.  When I first opened the ziplock packaging I could hardly smell anything and the tea looked more brownish than I am used to seeing sencha look  It was loaded with stems (about 10% stems I would estimate).  This was all not a good sign.  Next, I made a cup and only left it in the water for about 1.5 minutes which is about the max I steep Rishi Organic Sencha before it turns bitter.  I was left with a cup of tea that barely smelled like green tea and was seriously weak.  Next, I tried to steep for 5 minutes and still no change.  I guess you get what you pay for.  The packaging and the deliver is good is the only positive thing I can say.  On to trying another brand.

review/summary: Yummy mustard and sweet brown sugar!
review/text: We're big Bulls-Eye fans using a bottle of the regular "classic" sauce a week. We're always grilling up something for us or guests and Bulls-Eye is our go-to sauce. I thought I'd try something a bit different when I found these series of regional sauces: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TBF07U">Bulls Eye Barbeque Sauce - Kansas City Style 1 bottle 18 oz</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNKRJO">Bulls Eye Barbeque Sauce - Carolina Style 1 bottle</a>. We bought a six pack of the Memphis and the Kansas City and really enjoyed both. The Memphis was wonderful on pork and chicken and the Kansas City was sampled on some beef ribs. Already Bulls-Eye fans the variations were very nicely done. THe Memphis has mustard adding some light kick, red onions, garlic, white wine, and a bit of brown sugar adding some sweetness. A subtle tangy and sweet sauce. The Kansas City style was a bolder hickory, molasses, mustard, onions, and garlic and stood up better to the beef. My Memphis bottles came with a best use date 9 months from now, the Kansas City bottles just two months from now.<br /><br />Next order will be the North Carolina (ya'all) style.

review/summary: Fun and Cool snack
review/text: This is a really cool product. For the first part you arn't paying a arm and a leg at the museums. It tastes pretty good. It is a wierd texture to explain. It is a chalky texture, but when it hits your mouth it gets creamy. Try to think its not cold frozen ice cream. its going to be like room temp. The only down side i see is the secondary wrapper inside. Its almost always broken or wripped. But, its nothing to ruin the product. Its sealed with the outside packaging. So i dont see why the other package is there. Unless its to help control the moisture.
