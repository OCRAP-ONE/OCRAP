review/summary: good but a bit too gooey and sweet for me
review/text: These fruit slices come in a great variety of yummy flavors: cherry, watermelon, lime, pear, grape, and more. But unfortunately they were a little too sweet for my taste.<br /><br />Another point of displeasure was the consistency of the slices. I found them to be more gooey than previous fruit slices I've eaten. I even tried refrigerating them in the hope that they would become a bit tougher, but no luck.<br /><br />I think if you prefer sweeter, softer candies these would be great for you.

review/summary: Just like I remembered...
review/text: I fell in love with these things back 30+ years ago. You used to be able to buy them in bulk at specific grocery stores, but they quit carrying them and/or closed about 20 to 25 years ago. All I've been able to find up till now was cheap rip-offs that were sort of 'harder' and really chewy. I saw these online and found them available at Amazon, so I decided to try them and see if these were the ones I remembered as a kid. Several reviews would have you believe they aren't the originals, just more cheap copies. I'm here to tell you, don't listen to them...These ARE the ORIGINALS!!<br /><br />It was AMAZING when I first tasted one of these! It was like stepping back in time! EXACTLY how I remembered them both in taste and appearance. The second I opened the package, a smile broke out on my face. I recognized them instantly. The cheaper rip-offs have a more uniform look and they're usually thinner than these. The cheapo ones also usually leave a lot to be desired in the flavor department, but these...wow...the flavor is so intense it's like a slap in the face! Just like I remembered!!<br /><br />I don't know what the deal is or the motivation behind the negative reviews, though I speculate a couple may be due to the fact the reviewers are used to the cheap ones and never tried the original Boston Fruit Slices and at least one of them out there I personally believe has some sort of ulterior motive since his reviews are the polar opposite of reality when it comes to these delicious little jokers. If, like me, you long for those fruit slices from your youth (25 to 35 years ago), I would HIGHLY recommend these! They do NOT disappoint!! Simply amazing!! I will DEFINITELY be buying more and soon as these aren't going to last long around here!!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The watermelon flavor seems very different to me than I remembered, though it has been nearly 25 years since I had any of the original Boston Fruit Slices. It's a bit strange and not very watermelon-ish. However, every other flavor is exactly as I remembered them. Absolutely delicious! And there's even a new flavor they didn't have back then...pear. I love pears and these have a great pear flavor. I'm not real big on cherry flavored anything, but if I were, I'm sure I'd enjoy that one too. The grapefruit, blueberry, lemon, orange, and grape flavors are great as are the others I've yet to identify: a rich blue (not blueberry which is purple with a blue rind) and something that looks pink with a yellow rind (pink grapefruit or pink lemonade, can't tell yet...only had a small piece of it, sharing with my kids!). All yummy!!

HOWEVER, I have ordered these many times from Amazon and will never order them again in summer months or warm weather.  Even though they don't require refrigeration until after you open the package, my July shipment was mostly ruined from the heat.  I watched for delivery and picked them up within 2 hours of delivery at my mailbox but they had a smooshy and gross texture, a texture that remained even after refrigeration.  Alot of dog treats in this shipment, but I'll know for next time. I still gave them five stars because the snacks are great when kept in normal temperatures.

review/summary: Spoiled
review/text: I unpacked the box of Old Wisconsin turkey snack bite sausage pieces and put the separate packages on my pantry shelf and kept one out to open and my mouth was watering.  After the first package was consumed I took another package of them out of the pantry and started in on it.  Wasn't too much later in the following week I noticed a pretty unpleasant smell in the pantry.  I thought for sure a rodent had got trapped somehow and probably died and was slowly rotting somewhere I could not see nor could I find anything of the sort.  The smell lasted and I scratched my head and wondered if the dead thing would eventually just dry up. Pretty soon my whole place smelled like the county landfill on a busy day. Well, it wasn't too long I went to grab another bag of the turkey sausage and gosh I found out the hard way where the small was emanating from all this time.  The bag of sausage I had just picked up was all rotted inside and it was totally putrid.  It was totally disgusting and it made my stomach feel a tad queasy.  I took the bag out and placed it in my garbage can and now I just can't wait till the City of Oswego KS comes and empties that can at the landfill. I have had my fill of this stuff! I doubt I will ever buy sausages from this company again!

We order no more than we will use in about 6 or 7 months.<br /><br />Altogether the turkey is a good product and handy snack.

review/text: My family and I really like these snacks. Yes, they are processed food and not the healthiest thing to eat, but they are a good quick snack that tastes good and is a bit healthier than the beef and/or pork options out there. I like the fact that they are shelf stable, so we can grab a bag to take with us in case we don't have any other food options (travelling, etc.), and that is the main reason we buy them.<br /><br />We have noticed that these are packaged under a few different brand names, but I can't always find them locally. The price here on Amazon is competitive with our local retailers, so we buy these here when we run out and cannot find them elsewhere.

Problem is, that after a short period of time (way before the expiration date), half the packages molded disgustingly inside.  We have a completely air conditioned house, they were stored in a cool pantry that is mostly kept dark.  Reading the other reviews, I know I am not the only one with this problem.

review/summary: Delicious, bite sized treats!
review/text: I originally bought these to give my dogs as a nightly treat. When they arrived, I popped one in my mouth to see what they were like, and WOW, it was like this taste explosion of grease and flavor. YUM. These are EXACTLY how pepperoni should taste. Firm skin, softer inside, with that little squirt of grease. My husband then tasted it and he completely agreed. Out of the six packages, he took five and I was left with one for the dogs.<br /><br />As human treats, these are fantastic. But as dog treats, not so much. Each package is 8 ounces, which is a LOT of pepperoni. I opened the packages, put it into an OXO pop container (air tight), and within 2-3 days of being inside the container, it started to form white, fluffy mold. Gross. I threw it out and figured it was a coincidence. I ordered some more, and did the same with a new package. Same thing happened - mold. If you are planning to eat these, it seems the quicker you consume these, the better.<br /><br />With how delicious they are, it shouldn't be tough! Our entire family loves these!

review/text: A coworker had these one day in the office and she let me try them. I was hooked. They are a good source of protein and great for snacking. I like to go out to photograph local wildlife, birds, mostly at the local refuges and I can take a bag of these and some water and I am set for the day. They are very convenient and very tasty!

review/summary: In the search for affordable turkey jerky, this was dissapointing
review/text: Wisconsin Turkey Snack bites, I'm sorry for the low rating<br /><br />But,<br />I was pretty disappointed.  It might taste good to some, but not me. I've so far had one other brand on amazon, and a few brands in store, and I disliked this one.<br /><br />The snack bites have a few problems.<br /><br />1) They're fairly watery. Not only do they look more "reconstituted" than other brands, but their water content seems higher.<br /><br />2) they're lacking flavor.<br /><br />I try to solve problem one and two, by cutting them in half, dosing them in some hotsauce pepper mix, and drying them in the sun [and once in the oven]. This is rather time consuming, sort of. But even then, the oil/protein ratio is higher (meaning more oil) it seems than other turkey snacks.  Which is lame.<br /><br />So, I'll keep looking for good turkey jerky on amazon [which is basically anywhere, since beef is the game in most stores], any suggestions in the comments I'd appreciate. Preferably at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />P.S, of humerus note, I noticed one of the suggested tags are "Hip Hop".  Funny.<br /><br />UPDATE: I got a comment that pointed out how this is not turkey jerky, but rather turkey sausage. This invalidates much of my review. I dont remember why I originally expected it to be more like turkey jerky. That said, they still were not tasty..

review/text: OMG -- these are so yummy!!  So much gluten free bread-type stuff is just plain nasty, but these are incredibly good.  When the box arrived I had to try them right away.  I opened the package and took one out, took a bite, and could not believe the party in my mouth!!  I quickly closed the box and put it away, because these are definitely one of those "can't eat just one" products :D<br />The other problem I've noticed with gluten free cracker products is they break so easily, they can't even get to the store shelves without breaking.  But these were unbroken, and could easily stand up to a nice heavy dip.  Yum, yum!

review/text: I was thinking these wouldve tasted like regular bagel chips, but they don't! They taste pretty bland actually. Nowhere does it really scream bagel or parmesan to me, it has a hint of garlic but thats about it. They actually taste pretty awful. I bought a pack of 6 seeing to as all the good reviews it had gotten, and i didnt even finish 1 box. I ate one piece and spit it out, it was so dry, flavorless and disgusting. Not worth the money! And worst part is there is no way to return them!

review/summary: In Response to those saying its too sweet:
review/text: I am writing this in response to comments made that this is too sweet.  No I haven't been to Japan...the sushi I've had has been Americanized.  The ginger they normally serve with sushi at lower and mid-budget locations is pink dyed and tastes like remnants of a used alcohol pad.  This brand doesn't have the awful alcohol taste nor artificial flavors.  All the ingredients are organic, and yes, it does taste sweet...but I think that makes it palatable alone as a snack.  It doesn't taste over the top sweet to me...it has 5g. sugar per 2 tbsp.  I add it to my sushi as extra on the side and never notice the sweetness in contrast with the sushi flavors (I eat the ginger with the sushi), but when wanting to eat this alone I'm neither overpowered by the ginger flavor nor an artificial one taking its place.  I would recommend this as the only ginger product I can find that's all natural and organic.

The shelled sunflower seeds come in a packet separate from the flour mix, and you add it during the cycle of your breadmaker between risings when the breadmaker beeps for addition of ingredients.  The crunchy sunflowers really add to the texture of this bread as well as the flavor.  I gave some of my loaf to a neighbor, an experienced bread machine baker, and he marvelled at the taste and texture.  TRY IT, and be sure to toast a piece.  EXCELLENT

review/summary: Best Cat Food
review/text: Have been giving our cat this food for the past several years.  She loves the food and it keeps her coat shiny and smooth.  Last year we switched to another brand and she began to show flakes on her coat, switched back to this one and flakes are gone.  No problems with hairballs since using this food.

review/summary: Low in Calories, low in quality
review/text: We had used this product for over a year, along with another leading brand.  Our cat is a bit on the heavy side, so 'weight control' really appealed to us.  The food IS low in calories, make no mistake.  But looking at the first five ingredients - the ones the food contains most of - is a horror show! " Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Meal, Corn Grits, Ground Whole Grain Sorghum, Dried Beet Pulp".  Not a single reliable meat (only by-product meal) in the bunch, and two corn-based fillers in the top three ingredients.<br />Oh, Caesar ate this fine...though he often would take only small feedings at a time, he'd eventually finish most of it by tbe next mealtime.  After doing some research, I switched him to another brand that has better ingredients (no by-products and no corn based fillers), and he eats it passionately!  It has more calories, but we actually feed him less.  He seems to have a bit more energy too!<br />Please don't take my word for it, as I am not a vet or a scientist.  If you do a bit of research, I think you'll probably steer clear of this food.

review/summary: Solved my cat's chronic diarheaa
review/text: I realize I should have written this review long ago because it might have helped someone else but anyway,...I was really at a loss as to what to do for my beautiful, long-haired cat.  I was desperate and started surfing the internet to see if I could find out what other cat owners had done.  So many people were posting this problem but all I read were complaints about the hundreds of dollars they had spent on tests for their pets and still no solution.<br />You see, he's about 8 yrs old.  He goes in and out of the house all day long but I began noticing he was looking thin and then there was chronic diarheaa which was driving me crazy. I mean it was everywhere!  I do love my cat but I wasn't keen on paying hundreds of dollars so I thought the first thing I'll do is change his cat food.  Unbelievably, this formula resolved the problem.  I have tried other cheaper brand hairball formulas and always come back to this one.  Without it, he starts painfully haunching his shoulders and walking verrryyy slowly and then I know the chronic poops are starting again.<br />If you have this problem with your cat, give it a try.  Believe me, it beats high vet bills which we can ill afford in these harsh economic times.

review/summary: Good cheese, disgusting salmon
review/text: Although the cheese itself was yummy, the salmon looked and smelled(worse, actually) than catfood. The chocolates were not-so-great(the coconut flavor tasted manufactured) and I have to say now, after the excitement of seeing my boyfriend's happily-surprised face has worn off, that I am less than pleased with the product. I threw the salmon away, and there weren't even enough crackers for one of the cheeses included. Although it's a nice gesture to send to family and friends an assortment of cheeses and such, I'd look elsewhere in the future. Not worth the price.

review/summary: Tropical Get Away Matcha!
review/text: By the smell of this one I was really iffy as to wether I would like it or not.<br />It smelled just like green bananas! Tart really strong smelling green bananas to the point of smelling like artificial banana flavoring. HOWEVER ... wait for it ... this stuff is AMAZING!<br /><br />Oh and also when I was mixing it my daughter asked "what is that??" as she had smelled it from the other room! I asked her "what does it smell like?" she answered "bananas"!<br /><br />Okay no, I am not confused, I realize this is not banana matcha and in fact once you get it mixed it does not taste like banana matcha at all!<br /><br />This is yummy papaya! Like the passion fruit matcha I reviewed earlier today there is a rind like flavor to the matcha but its not quite as strong as the rind flavor was in the passion fruit, this is a very nice, fresh, ripe papaya tasting matcha and I LOVE IT! This is a very sweet tasting matcha too!<br /><br />Honestly, I never would have thought I would like this as much as I do based on the smell of the dry powder. Also this is one of the last matcha I have on hand that I have not yet tried or reviewed! Actually while I have not done my review yet on the brandy matcha I have had it and loved it. Just need to get the review done, so in fact, this is my last matcha to savor and oh yes I am savoring it!!<br /><br />I mixed this in my typical latte fashion and with the milk and creamer the flavors are incredible! I feel like I am drinking something on a cruise ship or at an island resort! The only thing missing is my lei and some island music! Gad this is for sure on my re-order list once this 30g is gone!

review/summary: great option for Toddlers
review/text: I usually purchase Similac Go & Grow, however, since amazon.com doesn't carry that item I decided to try Gerber Good Start 2. This product is for Toddler's ages 9months - 24 months.  My toddler drank this down just as well as the typical brand that we provide to him (similac).  This brand is also less expensive than similac.  I wish that amazon.com carried similac or offered this on subscribe and save.  Maybe they will in the future.<br />My toddler will not drink milk so this is a GREAT option if your child wants formula over milk.<br />Pros<br />- Toddler Formula that my Toddler actually loves<br />- Less expensive than the leading brand<br />- Great nutrition for your toddler<br />- Great if your toddler will not drink Milk<br />- My pediatrician actually recommends this and Similac go and grow for toddlers.<br /><br />cons<br />- The product seems to need to be shaken up in the sippy cup or bottle more than most before it can be drank

review/summary: Worth it for me.
review/text: My son wasn't quick to start eating table food. He didn't show much interest in it so we fed him baby food a bit longer than most. After he turned a year old I was concerned that he wouldn't be getting the proper nutrition from the random foods he would eat so for me, I felt like this was a better choice than milk. It also ensures that I know how much he is getting while with the sitter because I just send a pre measured amount. It's also a lot more convenient than milk. We have taken several trips that I can't really imagine the hassle of milk with a toddler so I was very pleased with my decision to continue with this. My son is now 16 months old, eating table food VERY well but we still give him about 10oz of this a day. He is happy and healthy and the Pediatrician fully supports the use of this.

review/text: I breastfed through 10 months, but needed something to "get us through" until the transition to cow's milk and this worked out well with no gas, fussiness, or constipation.  We had supplemented with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ARPKE4">Similac Expert Care Alimentum Hypoallergenic Nutrition Formula, Powder, With Iron, 1-Pound (454 g) (Pack of 6)</a> when my son was very young due to some health issues, and I can say without hesitation that this good start formula was way less stinky and less foamy when mixed.  Our pediatrician recommended it, and it doesn't have corn syrup as the first ingredient (sadly common among formulas).

review/summary: TOXIC hexane still in it!
review/text: RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website! Nestle owns Gerber now<br /><br />"Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be "agricultural ingredients." Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as "necessary vitamins and minerals," which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and "other" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from "natural"<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: "includes mutant organisms" and "recombinant organisms", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is "extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane."<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: "genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid" and "extraction with solvents such as ... hexane." Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.<br /><br />Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom<br /><br />The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health.

review/text: I've tried them all and nothing comes close to this one.  Just make sure to get the real one and not the sugarless diet version of it - that one tastes horrible (to me), but it does have different bottle color.  Anyway, even when I feel tired, or sick with cold, this drink puts me back on my feet and I run like an energizer bunny.  Better than coffee in a sense that no jittering occurs and no coffee smell (BTW I love cofee nevertheless).<br />Pricewise, find it at the local stores and save on shipping.  You pay slightly more per bottle but again shipping saves you much more than that. Won't say where I buy it - because they constantly run out as it is and I always buy all that they have LOL.

review/summary: Big Peach flavor without the calories
review/text: Gotta say it, I luv the stuff.  Great refreshing peach flavor without any aftertaste.  Big fan of Crystal Light products but it would be nice if they could eliminate the corn starch from the drink mix.  I like to mix it with a bit more water to keep the taste light and refreshing...try it...3qt H2O instead of 2qts.
