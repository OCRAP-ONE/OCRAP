review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: This coffee is pretty good. However it is a bit stronger than I would like. It has a slight tinge of an aftertaste to the vanilla flavor.  There's not much one can say about coffee. The package opened easily and the coffee was fresh.  And I did get my normal morning jolt to help me wake up.  The titles of this flavor says "fusions" and I would say it's pretty strong on the vanilla.

review/summary: Review of Starbucks coffee?
review/text: Listen here.  It's vanilla coffee.  Do you need a review of this?  Really?  You do?  Ok then.<br /><br />You see, coffee, and I know this a shock to all of you,  is a stimulant.  It keeps you awake, alert, and a slave to its rhythms.  Most everyone drinks it, and some people even go out on a limb to work in the coffee industry where pretentious goons stand around in circles and participate in "cuppings".  But that's another story.<br /><br />I cracked open this bag of coffee and, you guessed it, smelled a scent of vanilla.  I looked at the bag...by golly, it's supposed to smell like vanilla!  Wow!  What won't they think of next?  I poured some into a cup, added some water, drank it, liked it.  I spent the rest of the morning bouncing off the walls and annoying my co-workers.  Exactly as expected.  Success!<br /><br />Any more questions?  No?  Good.

review/summary: Typical Starbucks
review/text: As of this writing there have been 255 reviews posted. Sorta difficult to add anything new. I received one bag of this coffee from the Vine program. The day preceding its arrival I had brewed some French Vanilla by a brand that I regularly use and which is rated higher than Starbucks by the best known testing and rating org. This offered me an opportunity to make a somewhat taste comparison although, admittedly, the Starbucks was not French Vanilla.<br /><br />In the taste test Starbucks came in second. It was neither as smooth nor as tasty as the competitor. I drink my coffee with fat-free milk and no sugar so I get a fairly good opportunity to evaluate the taste. Starbucks afficionados undoubtedly will praise this and they have every right to do so and I have no quarrel with that. However, if you are not among that group I think you will find that you would be pleased with a different brand and save a few bucks as well.

review/summary: Is it necessary?
review/text: I'm not a big flavored coffee fan, but, for some reason, around the holidays it seems like I want to drink flavored coffee. Vanilla is my favorite, so when I got a chance to try this vanilla flavored coffee, I did it.<br /><br />It seems to me that every vanilla flavored coffee I've tried in the past did not really have a smooth vanilla flavor that I hoped for, and this one is no different. The vanilla doesn't seem to stand out or on its own. To me, the only way I can describe it is that the vanilla tastes "burnt."<br /><br />As a comparison, I tried adding Torani french vanilla syrup to my regular coffee. I liked that better. I think adding any type of vanilla flavor to regular coffee would produce a similar or better taste than buying it with the flavor already in it. So, is it really necessary to buy premixed vanilla flavored coffee?<br /><br />Maybe a coffee connoisseur would be a better judge of this coffee, but to me, the occassional flavored coffee drinker, this would seem a waste of money, especially since I doubt I'll use the whole package.

review/summary: Vanilla aroma 4/5, actual vanilla taste 1/5
review/text: I'm going to admit I'm a coffee addict but not a Starbucks fan.  Assuming you like Starbucks coffee (if you don't know...just go to a shop before you buy a package), this is a drip grind, medium strength.  It's definitely not a French/Dark roast.  It wouldn't hold cream well at all without over-powering it.<br /><br />That said, there is barely ANY vanilla taste to hit although the grounds have a strong vanilla aroma.  In general, a hazelnut coffee has about 3x the flavored taste as this does.  Yes I do realize vanilla is a much more subtle taste.<br /><br />I would recommend either adding a drop of vanilla extract, shot of vanilla syrup or vanilla cream to your already favorite cup of joe.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I've had many different types of Starbucks coffee and there are very few I don't like. I don't really care for the more mild blends but this has a nice taste to it. I usually prefer a dark bold brew like French but this milder tasting coffee did not disappoint. It has a smooth subtle vanilla flavor and is a nice alternative for a change. The smell of vanilla fills the kitchen as it brews.<br /><br />It's made with Latin American beans and has natural ingredients. Bring the empty bag to Starbucks when you're done and you'll get a free coffee.<br /><br />Overall, the taste/quality i'll give 4 stars.

review/summary: Overpowering flavor
review/text: I love flavored coffees, but in many of them the added flavor overwhelms the coffee flavor.  While I do enjoy flavored coffees, I still want to taste the flavor of the coffee, too.  This Starbucks Vanilla-flavored coffee is a perfect example of a flavored coffee that comes on so strong that almost obscures the coffee flavor.  Additionally, the vanilla flavor in this coffee has what I can only describe as a "chemical-edge" and aftertaste to it.<br /><br />I found it undrinkable served full strength, but mixing the grind with a regular coffee before brewing tones down and smooths out the flavor to a pleasant level. For my taste, mixing it at a 1-to-4 ratio (1 scoop Starbucks Vanilla to 4 scoops regular coffee, for example) worked very well.

review/text: I drink Starbucks regularly and wondered if I would like their newest flavored varieties. I was pleasantly surprised.  The base coffee is still good and the vanilla is not overwhelming.

review/text: This is a very smooth, rich tasting coffee without the bitterness of less premium brands.  If one follows the brewing directions correctly you end up with a very nice cup of coffee.  One of the aspects I liked most about this particular Vanilla blend is the Vanilla was subtle and not strong.  Some who love Vanilla coffee may be put off by this, but for me it was the perfect hint of Vanilla in a smooth brew.

review/text: I'm really impressed by this coffee!  Sometimes flavored coffees feature overpowering and fake-tasting flavoring that overwhelms the taste of the coffee itself.  This is not the case with Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored.  The beans were roasted just right, so the coffee smells rich, and when it's brewed it's just good coffee taste, without a hint of burnt beans.  The vanilla flavor isn't too heavy or so light you can barely taste or smell it.  It smells and tastes like the flavor you get from an actual vanilla bean, not a cloying, too-much fake vanilla flavor.

review/summary: Subtle Vanilla and Strong Coffee
review/text: This coffee has a very subtle natural vanilla flavor. The vanilla is probably less strong then most vanilla flavored coffee I've tasted. The coffee flavor is very strong, in-line with most of Starbucks other coffees. This is ground coffee, not beans. The recommendations on the package tell you to use two tablespoons coffee for every 6 oz. of water. This might be too strong for newbies, so you might want to cut that in half.

review/summary: Delicious Vanilla Flavor from Natural Vanilla Beans (No Fake Chemical Taste of Other Brands)
review/text: Starbucks French Roast (an unflavored, dark roast) is my favorite coffee which I buy in bean form and brew at home. I also enjoy splurging on fresh coffees from Starbucks coffee shops occasionally.<br /><br />I had not tried Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla until now, and am happy with this because it has a good vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Although I love the idea of vanilla flavored coffee, in the past, all the other coffee brands I've tasted which are served in restaurants, various coffee shops and take out restaurants (i.e. deli's and gas stations) had a fake chemical taste that I disliked. So in the past I avoided any flavored coffees.<br /><br />I have also tried some creamer products with vanilla and hazelnut flavors (not made by Starbucks) but those have a sweetner in them that has a strange, too-sweet taste for me.<br /><br />When I saw both the Starbuck's brand and the fact that this was a NATURAL vanilla flavor (made with vanilla beans) I decided to try it and I'm happy with it. It has a medium roast good flavor of Starbucks coffee with a vanilla taste that is not chemical-fake tasting and lacks odd aftertastes and the only sweetness is from whatever sweeter we choose to add.<br /><br />Bravo Starbucks! Your "Natural Fusions Vanilla" coffee is just right!<br /><br />Bonus: my package states (on the side) that  if we bring the empty bag to a Starbucks coffee shop within 30 days of the "best by" date they will give us a free 12 ounce freshly brewed coffee at no charge!

review/summary: Pleasant, But Ordinary Vanilla Coffee for a Cold Day
review/text: The doorbell rang on a frozen rain-rattled November afternoon. The postman left a box of Starbucks vanilla flavored ground coffee.<br /><br />Raggedly tired from the day, from the week, from the month, finding later autumn is rarely pleasant on its own merit, this was a good surprise. While plenty of coffee I had stocked in readiness for the first dismal days on winter, packages in the mail are like Christmas day presents. Eager, though already knowing what was inside, I smiled at the scent. Familiar. It reminded me of inexpensive coffee I bought before late novel-reading nights in college.<br /><br />Brewing quickly four cups, I poured the first taste into an old mug one of my first clients gave me, the one with pelicans on a sunny pier.<br /><br />Holding the mug with two hands, I sipped as anyone would hot coffee. Was it better, I wondered. No. Just ordinary. The vanilla was the same. The coffee was the same. Only the label was new. As it was already ground, it missed the freshness I can find even in any grocer who will grind the beans.<br /><br />I will finish the bag, and be glad I did, but having found nothing to compel me to look for it, I won't. If you have had vanilla flavored coffee, you have had this one.<br /><br />--Brockeim

It's a cloudy, dreary day here in the Ozarks and a cup of this coffee was the perfect and delicious "pick me up".  Another plus is that is takes less than the standard coffee as I found out when my first pot came out a bit too strong...not a problem...just added a little water.  I would certainly recommend this Vanilla flavored Starbucks blend.  It would even make a great Christmas gift.

review/text: I enjoyed the Starbucks Natural Fusions Coffee. I wish it was whole beans instead of grounds, but that's ok... it still tasted fresh. I did find, however, that it wasn't very tasty until I put what I consider to be too much sugar in it. Typically, I only put a tablespoon, but I had to put 3-4 in this because it had an unusual taste to it. It may be that I associate vanilla with sweet, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

review/summary: Excellent Vanilla Flavored Coffee!
review/text: About this review:<br />Let's face it. Any review about foods or beverages cannot be totally objective. It is usually subjective to reflect the type of taste enjoyed by the reviewer. We all have different ways to measure what tastes good to us and what doesn't. Some of us may enjoy strong coffee, while others may like it gentler. Some of us hate sour or bitter tasting coffee and others mask the taste totally by pouring so much creamer and sugar until it taste like something else.<br /><br />The Coffee:<br />This coffee has a nice aroma when open the bag. It is unmistakably vanilla flavored coffee. I followed Starbucks instructions on the bag and added 2 tablespoons for each 6 FL of water to my coffee machine. First impression was that the coffee is on the bitter side, but tastes like the good Starbucks coffee that you drink at any of their coffee shops. I added some sugar (I'm not a fan of masking the coffee taste by adding creamer)  and I took few sips. I decided to add a little more sugar (about 1 teaspoon per 6 ounce cup) and that tasted good to me. The vanilla taste is there. The strong slightly oily taste of a strong Starbucks coffee is all there. The next day I decided to make it slightly stronger, so I added 5 tablespoons for 12 ounces of water (instead of 4) and that seems to have all the elements I like about a good cup of Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If you enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning and you like Starbucks coffee and you also enjoy vanilla flavor, this is definitely a coffee worth considering!

review/summary: Smells Good, Tastes Good . . .
review/text: Since I drink my coffee black without any creamer or sweeteners, the taste of the coffee itself really matters to me.  This vanilla-flavored coffee comes ground, which saves me the step of grinding the beans myself.  Even though the beans are pre-ground, the flavor after brewing was still deep and rich, and the aromatic fragrance of vanilla still permeated after I opened the vacuum sealed bag.<br /><br />The flavoring of the vanilla in this coffee is subtle and mild.  I mention this because with some flavored coffees, a particular flavor can be quite distinct and strong, and dominate the taste of the coffee.  For me personally, that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the particular flavor; I like pumpkin spice strongly flavored, while I prefer cinnamon and vanilla to be more subtle.  So, if you are looking for heavily flavored vanilla coffee, expect something a bit more subtle with this flavor.<br /><br />At 11 ounces, this is not a terribly large quantity of coffee for the money.  That said, however, Starbucks has never been the bargain hunter's choice for economical coffee, and this is reasonably priced in relation to other speciality coffees.

review/summary: Awful, just awful
review/text: My wife and I fancy ourselves coffee connoisseurs.  We use an expensive drip-brew machine, cold filters, specially filtered cold water, and fresh fine-ground coffee from Pete's.<br /><br />However, we also frequent Starbucks when traveling, and Seattle's Best, and even [shudder] Java City from time to time.  We have exacting standards which we use at home, but we are fine with (and even enjoy), the occasional cup of Starbucks coffee, etc.<br /><br />With that in mind, I when ahead and ordered this coffee sampler bag from Amazon Vine, figuring it might be an interesting trial.  It was interesting all right, but only in the "i can't believe they tried to sell that as a premium new product" sort of interesting.<br /><br />The grounds arrive dried out and brittle, I suspect freeze-drying was the culprit.  The bag is a cheap-seal bag, glued shut, and the feel and smell of the grounds screamed "cheap."<br /><br />But, even with those misgivings, I soldiered on.  Maybe the coffee those grounds produced wouldn't be THAT bad ... right?  It is Starbucks after all, they have a MINIMUM reputation they are trying to maintain ... yeah, I was wrong.<br /><br />The coffee produced from these grounds was bitter, acrid, and acidic.  The vanilla flavoring is obviously an additive that was poured on to the beans, and it also contributes to the bitter and acidic taste -- you can feel it in the back of your throat, and curdling the taste buds at the back of your tongue.<br /><br />Cream and sugar mask some of the unpleasantness, but only some of it.  The bottom line is this product is a cheap, freeze-dried coffee bean that has been sprinkled with the cheapest imitation vanilla "flavoring" they could find.  I have tasted real vanilla bean infused flavor, and also premium vanilla extract flavor, and this was not it.<br /><br />If you want vanilla flavored coffee, I would say your best bet is to buy quality beans/grounds, and brew them properly, and then add a shot or two of premium vanilla syrup, or keep a couple of vanilla beans in your coffee beans/grounds, and let the flavor infuse directly into the coffee before brewing.<br /><br />Stay away from this offering from Starbucks, it is just nasty.

review/summary: Downsized For Price?
review/text: As a buyer of this prior, I am somewhat surprised to see this once 1 POUND had been reduced to just 12 ounces the last time I bought. Now? Just 11 ounces? Aside from the shrinking amount of coffee for the price (leaves a bad taste in my mouth!), how about the coffee? Well, I really have a liking for anything vanilla from juicing, to smoothies and coffee too. When drip brewed, I find this coffee a bit too full flavored (slightly bitter to me) and add a bit of creamer to soften it a bit. I am not a huge coffee drinker since a recent heart attack and had to go to decaf so this new batch is for my wife. She doesn't care at ALL for this brand however unless she pours in about 3-4 ounces of dairy creamer (coffee-mate French Vanilla from Nestle) so the price is just crazy for me when I see how she "modifies it"! But this is from a guy who just drinks a cup of instant Folgers decaf every morning these days (sad I know).<br /><br />  So I have to defer to the connoisseurs on snob appeal and such. To me, it has always just been a nice cup of coffee before I was no longer able to drink with any caffeine. This brand was just one in a bunch of experiments I treated myself too after retirement before the heart attack. To ME, it is just an "average" coffee with an above average price. To be fair, remember I am not a big coffee person so this is perspective from an old guy who just was a casual drinker of coffee, not a fanatic. I just don't see the value given both my wife and myself added so much coffee creamer to get the desired taste of Vanilla? I still rate this 3 stars (average) since I may just not be the type of coffee drinker to "appreciate" something I just don't get. For what it's worth, I also prefer grilled hamburgers over grilled steak. And yes, beer over whiskey too.....No reason to beat up on a Company I really respect for it's success and quality treatment of their employees (but that's another story)!

review/summary: The Scent of Vanilla
review/text: Having already tried the caramel fusion and enjoying it, I decided to give vanilla a try.  I am not normally a fan of vanilla coffee as the smells is often more potent than the taste.  You can always tell when somebody has been in the room with vanilla coffee because the artificial scent lingers.  Whereas other vanilla coffees have the vanilla ending in the scent, this coffee has a nice mild taste that does actually hint of vanilla.  It is not a vanilla taste that overpowers the taste of the coffee like a sugary creamer, it is authentic and subtle.  The coffee even has a smooth mouthfeel that brings hints of creme soda.  Overall, this is a worthy addition to the Starbucks family.

review/summary: Strong Coffee with a Good Vanilla Flavor
review/text: Starbucks Vanilla Flavored Natural Fusions Ground Coffee features Arabica beans from Latin America and all natural flavors.  I first brewed this in an automatic drip coffee maker and awaited the results.  I was pleasantly surprised that the vanilla wasn't overpowering.  The results were typically Starbucks, strong but then a not so typical lack of bitterness with a hit of vanilla flavor. Excellent.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit that I like flavored coffees but do not prefer Starbucks coffee.  To me, Starbucks is strong but too bitter.  This product, however, has the good strong blend without the bitterness and the bonus of Vanilla flavor.  I think this would be good for iced coffee drinks as well as homemade vanilla mochas and lattes.  I recommend this to Starbucks fans looking for a change and people who like strong, flavored coffee.

review/summary: Lousy flavor from the artificial vanilla chemical.
review/text: I got a free sample of this product (ground coffee beans) from the Starbucks company today (December 29, 2010).  The artificial vanilla flavor was NOT impressive.  It simply does not taste much like vanilla.  The added "vanilla" just provides some off-beat chemical flavor.  Even worse, is that this chemical flavor lingers on the metal coffee filter, and contaminates the flavor of any coffee that is subsequently brewed.<br /><br />Another overall problem with Starbucks coffee is that, in an attempt to imitate Peet's coffee, the Starbucks company provides a generous roasting of their coffee, but they over-roast their coffee to the point that the overwhelming flavor is one of charred or burned wood.<br /><br />Thus, for my 5-cup a day habit, I stick to Folger's, and when I want to treat myself, I buy Peets.  I am not sure why the Starbucks company is so successful, but I am sure it has MORE TO DO with their nice furniture, the creative nomenclature of their coffees, various other marketing gimmicks, and the endless selection of sugared, candied, confectioned, and embellished coffees, and LESS TO DO with the quality of the coffee itself.<br /><br />As a graduate student at U.C. Berkeley, I lived directly across the street from the first Peet's coffee shop, located at Walnut Square in Berkeley, California.  I first went to Peet's in the year 1973.

review/text: I love Starbucks.  I love vanilla.  So why didn't this work for me?  Why didn't this become my go to coffee in the morning, the one I would want to brew on cold evenings at home, the one that would accompany after dinner desserts with friends and family?  I really couldn't tell you.  I found the taste to be off, in that I didn't even think of vanilla as I drank it.  It also had a very bitter after taste that stuck with me for awhile even after only one sip.  I even attempted to add more milk and more sugar to decrease the vial flavor but amazingly it was like the coffee fought back, denying all my attempts at actually making something drinkable.<br /><br />I am sorry Starbucks, but this was a fail for me.  Actually threw out the bag so I wouldn't even have it in my kitchen.  I'll try again with something else perhaps not "natually fused".

review/summary: Ah-hhh... A pleasant "wake-me-up"...with or without creamer...
review/text: For me, half the pleasure of a good cup of coffee is the aroma while it's brewing. Since I love the scent of anything "vanilla," I decided to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>. With this special blend, Starbucks promises "a subtle flavor and pleasant aroma."<br /><br />I looked forward to having it before breakfast yesterday, so was pleasantly surprised to wake up to a most delightful vanilla bouquet. That flavor called out to me, so I followed my nose straight to the kitchen where my friend Lynn was quietly reading the newspaper and sipping a cup. She hopped up and poured one for me and before I could say "Thanks," she added a big splash of vanilla creamer. Ouch! She knows I generally add different flavors of creamer to my coffee, too, but I had wanted to test the "subtleness" promised in the ad--without any additives. Anyway, it was delicious with the creamer and I was pleased with the product.<br /><br />My true test of this natural fusions blend came this morning when I indulged myself by trying it a la naturale... Oh, my! What a taste treat! "Wow," I thought, "this is real coffee!" The vanilla was just the right amount to blend with the other natural flavors for a perfect cup of coffee. It pleases my palate as well as my olfactory senses... Can't beat that!<br /><br />As an additional test, I brewed a pot for another friend who generally enjoys stronger coffee. Although he liked it, he said it wasn't strong enough for him. So, if you like very strong coffee, this might not be the blend for you...or perhaps I should have added more coffee per cup. But then that would have been for him, not for me. And just how far should I go for a friend? Hmmmm...<br /><br />I have the open bag of coffee beside me as I type this review. I'm sitting here sniffing like a kid breathing in the aroma of a newly-baked cake. How's that for indulgence. :-)<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, December 10, 2010<br />Author of "Millennium Babe: The Prophecy," "Dream Reachers" (with Chase Von) and other books

review/summary: Not so hot.
review/text: I bought this for my wife who is an avid coffee drinker.  Here are her thoughts:<br /><br />As a coffee addict, I anticipated that this blend of ground coffee and vanilla beans would far surpass the cloyingly sweet fake vanilla coffee flavors currently on the market. My expecations were raised further upon opening the bag with the deep aroma of both vanilla and coffee bean. However, once the coffee is actually brewed, the vanilla is nothing more than a strange aftertaste--and not even a vanilla taste. The coffee itself is strong, as one expect with Starbucks brand, but it's not as full-bodied as their House Blend or other blends, such as Verona. Something just seems to be missing. I'm not sure if they're using a lower quality bean or the ground vanilla beans and/or Indian sasparilla root (the other ingredient in the blend) is throwing the balance of the coffee off. Or, maybe it's my perception of vanilla coffee being sweet; this coffee most certainly is not. I will stick with Starbucks House Blend for regular coffee, and if I'm in the mood for vanilla coffee, I would opt for Dunkin Donuts

review/summary: Truly engaging Vanilla flavor, but still over roasted
review/text: I want to preface this by saying I'm not a big fan of most of the Starbucks blends, though I am serious about coffee. I was pleasantly surprised and disappointed at the same time by this coffee.<br /><br />When you first open the bag the smell if of a surprisingly fresh and aromatic vanilla flavor. Upon inspection of the grounds you can see small bits of actual vanilla beans.  The aroma is great and better than traditional flavored coffees that use extracts that coat the beans or are roasted into them.<br /><br />I brewed the coffee using my Capresso 10-cup coffee maker with cold fresh water and a ratio of 1 tablespoon per 6 ounce cup of water.<br /><br />The coffee brewed with an aroma of coffee and vanilla. The vanilla dominated the brewing smells. First sip of of dark roasted coffee with a hint of vanilla flavor. I like the mild vanilla flavor. I love coffee and I usually don't like flavors masking the flavor of the beans. Roastmasters work hard to perfect their roasts and often times the flavors added destroy that. This is not the case with this coffee. The vanilla flavor augments the roast and adds to it, not takes away from it. The vanilla flavor is also fresher and more natural without the cloying artificial taste often associated with flavored coffee.<br /><br />My only beef with this coffee and with starbucks in general is that they often over roast their coffees to Italian roasts or beyond the second crack. I find this often masks complexities of the wonderful beans they use and substitute heavy mouthfeel and body for complexity. For that reason, I only give this coffee a four star rating.<br /><br />Another note is that this coffee seems to have plenty of caffeine. With only a cup or two, I feel the effects quite strongly, which is unusual because of the amount of coffee and tea I drink.<br /><br />Overall a good flavored coffee. Not overpowering and with a natural hint of vanilla flavor.

review/summary: The Rich Natural Sweetness Of Vanilla
review/text: Vanilla to me is like licorice: one of those flavors with so many artificial, bad-tasting imitations that it's a pleasure to experience the real thing.<br /><br />Starbucks new Natural Fusions line of flavored coffee may say 'a hint of vanilla' but to my taste, the natural flavoring is richly aromatic and full-bodied. I take  coffee with milk and no sugar; the vanilla adds just enough sweetness without detracting from the coffee itself.<br /><br />Many flavored coffees are over-flavored, probably on the assumption they're competing with large amounts of sugar. The vanilla in Natural Fusions complements the fine coffee taste rather than competing or overwhelming it. It's all about balance. You want to preserve the experience of the main component while taking it to a new level. I think Starbucks got it right here.<br /><br />If you're trying to cut down on sugar (or you know you should but aren't), give Natural Fusions vanilla a try; you may find you don't miss the sugar as much as you think.<br /><br />Instructions: Raise the cup to your lips, inhale, take a sip, inhale again. Repeat to your heart's content.

review/summary: Don't throw away that empty Starbucks coffee bag!
review/text: I must confess right up front that I'm not a coffee drinker, but everyone else in my family is, so this review is a composite of remarks and observations from all of them.  The vanilla aroma and taste is definitely there and yet is well balanced so it isn't overpowering.  This type grind worked very well in our cone shaped filter with a paper liner.  There were no grounds in the brewed coffee.  Even I could tell that this coffee had a very nice aroma while it was brewing, once again not overpoweringly vanilla.  Everyone agreed that this is what they would consider a mild roast (milder than the Pike's Peak as a point of reference), some experienced some bitterness while others did not.<br /><br />The overall opinion was that this was an enjoyable coffee which would be ideal for a specially brewed pot, but not for a standard get-you-going-in-the-morning pot.  It seems that my coffee drinkers want basic medium to strong coffee for that first cup of the day.  One really interesting thing I found on the package is that Starbucks will give you a free 12 oz cup of coffee if you take this empty bag to a Starbucks store before the expiration date for the coffee which is printed on the bag.  That might be standard procedure with all their bags of home brewed coffee but it was new for all of us.  It sounded like a great plus to my coffee drinkers.

review/summary: Is This Really Vanilla-Flavored???
review/text: I love a cup of Starbucks coffee, and I love a good flavored coffee. When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it. Vanilla-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial. I love Gevalia's French Vanilla, but prefer not to have to get regular shipments of a product.  I'd much rather be able to purchase my coffee as needed and at the local grocer.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark, just as they did with the Caramel Flavored Natural Fusions. The Vanilla Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no vanilla odor and has even less vanilla taste. Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging. In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup. This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the vanilla flavor. Rather, this coffee is a very good coffee, but does not have any layers of other flavors, either subtle or more noticeable.  For those looking for a flavored coffee which disguises the taste of coffee, this is definitely not for you.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew. If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's website and put the word "fusions" in the search box. You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards.

review/summary: Sweet When Strong
review/text: I drink 6-10 ounces of coffee every morning from my excellent Jura-Capresso Machine. Usually I buy beans and they are ground in the machine. I've tried using already-ground coffee before and it didn't come out very strong, but with this coffee that was no problem!<br /><br />The flavor is nice. I drink it with French Vanilla creamer, and the overall effect is a rich vanilla coffee that tastes delicious. I've long been a fan of Starbucks iced and specialty coffees, never so much of just coffee, but it seems the trick is to have it at home-sweet-home.<br /><br />I brewed a pot once (using a different machine), and it came out not bad, but not great. The trick is to make it stronger to get the good flavor across (if you make it too strong, add some other coffee and that produces an excellent effect as well).<br /><br />Admittedly, the first couple times I tried this coffee I thought it was just OK, I can understand why some people don't like it. I still prefer my coffee beans (from CoffeeAM or Costco). After several tries I came to like the flavor, but next time I want to break up the routine with some flavored coffee I'll try a different flavor.<br /><br />As for the price, you can definitely find less expensive ground coffee, but in my opinion the price is good. For a cup of coffee with my Capresso machine, I used (roughly) 1.5 tablespoons of the coffee for a cup. With 22oz total package here (44 tbs) that means it should last roughly a month. $13 for a month of nice coffee - I can do that for quality flavored Starbucks grounds.<br /><br />It will depend on your taste, and I recommend you give this a go.

review/summary: Can't be called coffee
review/text: Can I give it no stars?<br /><br />The bag arrived and I was all excited. Coffee does that to me. I'm a coffee snob. There I said it. It's not the most expensive brand nor is it the exotic nature of the coffee that is my snobbery. I love a good strong cup of coffee. To me coffee is a experience for all your senses. This failed.<br /><br />The first moment the bag was in my hands I smelled it, a slight hint of vanilla through the packaging. The best coffee I have had always manages to smell like the addictive bean no matter how it's packaged. That is nothing to hold against Starbucks vanilla though. Great and even good coffee sometimes only release their fragrance after opening. When opened, the package gave a distinct smell of vanilla. So strongly in fact that my head popped back, it smelled like cheap vanilla perfume that I got as a child at the five and dime.<br /><br />I got down to business, packing my coffee maker, frothing the milk and setting out the mugs. Once the coffee was done the smell mellowed a little but still was not appealing. My first sip was confusion. It tasted like coffee made with old milk. I looked at the container of milk which was fresh. I dumped out all the coffee and cleaned the pot again. Second pot same thing.<br /><br />So I left it all for another day. I bought new milk, made my first cup from my favorite brand and it tasted wonderfully. The second pot I made from the starbucks bag. The same results the coffee tasted like it was made with old milk. It was tangy, off and repelling. I asked my friend to try it. No prompting from me and he asked "Something wrong with the milk? You want me to go downstair and get some?"<br /><br />3 tries from me and one with a friend, each cup was horrid. My regular coffee tasted great. The $1.99 a pound brand that my friend bought to "test" the pot and milk was a good solid cup of coffee.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and buy something else. This is horrible.

review/text: We got this Vanilla coffee hoping it would be a good coffee. Hubby brews the pot as one of those lovely breakfast in bed scenes. Smells good as it's perking in the pot. I smell the cup when he places at my bedside table. I cannot describe exactly what I was tasting...Perfume...Chicory...something not so good. Down the drain it goes. Thinking we might need to make it stronger....maybe it will taste good this time??? NOPE. Down the drain. Rinse pot. Add our usual Starbucks Beans for the next pot in anticipation of a good cuppa and it still tastes like the awful vanilla. I've had to send the pot through its clean cycle now. Tomorrow we will try our regular beans again and hopefully we won't be reminded of that awful vanilla.....

review/summary: Starbucks Vanilla Coffee????
review/text: How I was looking forward to good Starbucks Vanilla Coffee at home!  When I got the box with this coffee inside, the vanilla aroma was coming through the box!  Even the UPS man said "something smells good in there."  Opened the box and saw the bag and, it had that good coffee smell with vanilla added.  So good I had to read the directions and make some of this Vanilla starbucks!  The coffee came already ground, not full beans.<br /><br />Oh, I was counting on this being so tasty!  Making it, the aroma it gave off was good.  Drinking it, YUCK, yuck, yuck!  It had one of the worse tastes I've ever tasted.  Like a rubbery, strong, sour vanilla taste. Yes, I know Starbucks coffee is strong, but this is a nasty strong vanilla taste.  Well I dumped it all out, washed everything and the next morning made it again.  Also I had to get rid of that taste in my mouth through a regular cup of coffee!<br /><br />So the next morning I made another batch of this Starbucks Vanilla.  Took extra close attention to the directions to make sure I was doing everything right (which I was).  Tried one cup black, another with cream and sugar.  The same all times!  A terrible taste!  I don't know it's a bad batch of beans, or too much Vanilla was added or bad vanilla was added or what, but it's bad.  Even other family members agree on the taste.<br /><br />A note here.  I went to a Starbucks coffee house and asked the girl at the counter working.  Before I got far she said "that has to be from a grocery store, Starbucks took it off the menu a while ago."  I looked and sure enough it's not on the menu!  I asked why and she shrugged her shoulders.<br /><br />Well I was disappointed on this. Actually I'm surprised as I do not think this Vanilla Coffee represents the Starbucks name well.  I've had many different types of their coffee before and never have I tasted something this bad.

review/summary: Subtle flavor, but overall quite pleasant
review/text: The first thing I noticed about this coffee is that it smells amazing. It smells great in the bag and smells great brewed. It makes my house smell terrific.<br /><br />Drinking it, I found that it's smooth and drinks really easily. There's a little bit of bitterness (which I don't mind but some people might) and doesn't taste acidic at all to me, though I am not an expert coffee taster and might be getting my terms wrong. The vanilla flavor is really subtle. I could do with a little more vanilla, and I can see why people are dissatisfied with the slightness of the flavor. What little bit is present, though, is a really nice vanilla taste and not the aftertastey yuck a lot of flavored coffees have.<br /><br />I think I'm going to have my flavored-coffee-hating roommate try this too. (Edited to add: Roomie liked it, commenting that it didn't have that fakey syrup taste; roomie didn't like the strong vanilla aroma as much as I did, though.) This could be a good coffee to try if you like vanilla flavor in theory but find most vanilla-flavored coffees too strong or too fake-y.<br /><br />Overall I'm quite pleased with this coffee.

review/summary: Fairly strange taste
review/text: I don't know what the odd taste is. It smells lightly of vanilla, and I've never brewed Starbucks at home before, so maybe all their coffee tastes this way, but there is an acrid, almost chemical aftertaste to each mouthful of this. I smell a decent basic medium roast, but I taste burning and something very off. The vanilla is weak, but strong enough to ruin the cup.<br /><br />I got this from the Vines program, and I'd never buy it again. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and this simply isn't worth the brewing, even if it was free. I've had better results from grocery-store brands that were pre-ground and on the shelf for who knows how long.

I called in to their customer service and of course they didn't know what I was talking about.  I love Starbucks for the rich bold roast and now this new version is just like the Dunkin Donat or other flavored water that they pass off as coffee.  I realize they are probably trying to get those customers that like crappy brown water but come on Starbucks remember your BRAND IDENTITY!!!!!

Like most Starbucks coffee, these beans are a dark roast. The taste is smooth, but the vanilla flavor didn't seem to add much to the overall coffee taste. In fact, I hardly even noticed the vanilla when tasting the cup. The vanilla is most noticeable as an aroma when brewing the coffee, which is actually kind of nice.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was okay, but I'd rather just stick to regular coffee.

review/summary: Smells good, but tastes different
review/text: I love coffee and especially grinding my own beans. I use a fairly fancy Krups that makes excellent coffee. I have some favorites and few are flavored.  I do like the occasional hazelnut or vanilla flavors.  I was hoping to have a hint of the flavor, not an overwhelming one.  I was not disappointed.  The smell of vanilla was a lot stronger than the actual taste.<br /><br />The coffee was good, not great or otherwise outstanding, but good.  I'd call this an easy drinking coffee and I feel I could serve it without mentioning that it was vanilla flavored.  All in all, it's a good coffee with a *hint* of vanilla.

review/summary: Great Smell, Good Taste
review/text: When I first opened the bag of coffee, I was delighted by how noticeable the vanilla was. The coffee was evenly ground, and at about the right texture for a drip coffee maker. Though not quite as fresh tasting as coffee you grind yourself, it still had a rich flavor with a medium body. It's a very mellow, drinkable coffee. Like most flavored coffee, the specific flavor (in this case vanilla) comes out more in the scent of the coffee than in the flavor, but both are quite nice.

review/summary: Delicious-- take home a bag & have Starbucks all the time!
review/text: I loved this coffee. The vanilla aroma permeated the house and was so warm and inviting! It's great by itself, or with flavorings, milk/cream and sweeteners. It seems to have a lower acitidity than other coffees, so you can drink more and not get an upset stomach! I really enjoyed this coffee and will purchase again.

review/summary: Not too far off the standard vanilla flavored coffee
review/text: Lots of people don't care for the Starbucks roasts, but I happen to really enjoy them. This coffee has the standard Starbucks "taste" to it, so if you are one that does not care for the roasts in their stores, you probably would not enjoy this coffee, either.<br /><br />What I did not care for in this coffee was the strong vanilla syrupy smell. The aroma alone was a little strong for my liking and left that syrupy smell in my house for most of the day after brewing. A little could have been nice, but it was overly sweet. Compared to the smell, the vanilla infusion did not have as overwhelming a flavor, but my palate would still have prefered more subtlety in flavoring . If you are sensitive to strong sweet smells, you might also find this unpleasant. I think the smell impeded my ability to enjoy the taste, and may contribute to my ho-hum impression of this product.

review/summary: Wonderful vanilla scent..........
review/text: I typically am not a huge fan of Starbuck's coffee because it is a little too strong and a little bitter for my taste; so, I wanted to try this thinking it would be slightly milder in flavor.  The smell of this coffee when first opened was amazing.  The vanilla scent was very pleasing to the nose.  The coffee however did not carry the same strong vanilla flavor that the smell had.  My husband who does not like flavored coffees does not mind this flavored coffee at all.  He can taste a slight hint of vanilla which he does not mind.  The flavor for me is not strong enough but I can still use my flavored creamers which is enhanced with the vanilla infused coffee.<br />Basically this coffee is a matter of taste preference.  For us it turned out to be a coffee we both can enjoy.

review/summary: Didn't Taste Much Different Than Regular Coffee
review/text: I'm not exactly a coffee connoisseur, nor am I exactly adventuresome when it comes to spicing up coffee.  I like mine black and I like trying different flavors.  I couldn't tell this one even had a Vanilla flavor.  It tasted like regular coffee that wasn't particularly strong.  I played around with adding different amounts, but in the end came to the conclusion that I have a very neutral opinion.  It's good, but not spectacular, nor is that different than other coffees on the market.  Not one I'll spend extra money on for sure.

review/summary: Rich and satisfying flavor
review/text: I'll admit it, I am a bit of a Starbucks addict. I love my Caramel Macchiatos and a flavored latte is just the perfect coffee drink for pretty much any day. So when I saw this product I decided to try it, hoping to be able to satisfy my craving for a daily vanilla latte also on the days when a trip to midtown would involve a major detour.<br />I wasn't disappointed - a heaping tablespoon of this coffee in my French press, steeped for about 8 minutes, delivered a drink that with just a little milk and sugar was a pretty satisfying substitute for a vanilla latte, that was also a hit with my equally Starbucks addicted brother-in-law at a brunch.<br /><br />I'd recommend it.<br /><br />(Note: I only received one pack, not two.)

review/text: I am not a coffee snob, I usually like the simpler coffees (not dark roast, not from some crazy unheard of place). I am a bit of a vanilla snob and that is where this was a bit of a dissapointment. There was a strong flavor, but it was hard to identify as vanilla and it didn't seem to add much to the experience. It was good coffee, but not something I would seek out again.<br /><br />Other reviews seem to alternate between too much vanilla and not enough. Perhaps there is some variability in the process (or age of the product) that is causing this.<br /><br />If you're looking for a flovoured coffee, you might want to check out something else.

review/text: I love a good cup of coffee, but I'm definitely not a coffee snob.  Some of my best cups are diner coffee (to give you an indication of my equal opportunity pallet).  I foud this one to be too overpowered by the Vanilla.  Even after I mixed it 50/50 with a non flavored coffee it still was too much "flavor" for my tastes.  The aroma hit me before each sip and was distracting.  If your looking for a subtel flavor I suggest buying a regular coffee and adding your own.

review/text: My entire family enjoyed drinking the Starbucks Natural Fusions coffee after dinner in which we celebrated the birthday of "Grandma."  We had two coffee pots going: one with this delicious vanilla-flavored coffee and another with a different brand.  It was soon easily determined which coffee was the favorite as we quickly had to brew a second pot of the Starbucks. When you drink this coffee, be prepared to enjoy the combination of fine ingredients that make this such a tempting drink. I enjoy  most all Starbucks flavors but this one is extra delicious.  Be sure and try it soon.

review/summary: Really Tasty!
review/text: I'm not a coffee snob, don't typically pay to have my coffee from Starbucks, and am quite content to drink my ground coffee from the Eight O'Clock brand.  The Starbucks Vanilla Natural Fusion variety came on my radar because of a promotion making the price very reasonable.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, the vanilla is spot-on perfect.  It doesn't taste fake or artificial in any way.  It's also strong enough that you know it's there (aroma and taste), but it's not overpowering in any way.<br /><br />The best part, however, is the bag.  Why you ask?  Because written on the side of Starbucks packaged coffees are instructions that the empty bag can be traded in at any Starbucks location for a free cup of coffee!  Not bad at all!  Enjoy it ground... then go get yourself a free cup while you're out shopping!

I own a coffee shop, and we only sell the best stuff. I thought I would try this at home. It is absolutely disgusting, in my opinion. There is no vanilla to it, at all. If you want a really good cup of vanilla coffee- buy Dunkin Donuts french vanilla. We actually sell it brewed in the coffee shop, as I feel it's the best vanilla flavored coffee out there, period. Don't buy this stuff. Even on sale.

All the ingredients were separated. If there was coconut milk, it has clearly dissolved into just being oil (not creamy, not good, nasty!). I bought this product based on the one great review, but it must be a shill. These packages come with no expiration date on them. Buyer beware.

review/summary: Best recipe ever
review/text: I need to order these online because my local store stopped carrying them, and now I cannot live without this incredible taste I discovered: Heat up a sweet potato (only about 6 minutes in the microwave). Split it open and drizzle olive oil (a little fat helps you absorb the vitamins in the sweet potato - high quality olive oil tastes best) and place a chipotle bouillon cube inside. Mash it up thoroughly inside the skin with a fork. Aside from the level of sodium, which you can adjust based on how much of the cube you want to use, this is a pretty healthy snack, and tastes incredible! (kind of like gourmet sweet potato fries) The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I cannot vouch for the healthiness of the cube or what it's made from, but I can tell you this makes for some serious deliciousness!

review/summary: Good price for a good product
review/text: I've been canning veggies and fruits from our garden for more years than I care to admit - lol. Whenever possible, I use this low-sugar variety of pectin for jam as our family prefers the taste of less sugar. IMHO, jam tastes much better and has a much nicer fresh-fruit taste using this low-sugar pectin. Example: 4-1/2 cups prepared peaches takes only 3 cups sugar. I've never had a problem with jams not setting up properly using the canning hot-bath method when using this product. I've also used this product to make freezer jams with good results - the set is just a tad softer.<br /><br />The instruction sheet is easy to read even for beginners, includes jam and jelly recipes for several fruits and berries and also has instructions for sugarless jam -- which I have never actually tried.<br /><br />The problem I DO have is finding this pectin in the stores in our area when I need it as it never seems to be available except at the end of the summer, and what's on the shelves after that can be getting near the expiration date for the product. Apparently, this product is considered seasonal; however, store managers apparently don't realize that canning goes on all year long. As an example, today (March 22) I just finished doing three batches of peach jam using peaches we froze last summer. I had to hunt around for the pectin, and what I found was almost near the expiration date and obviously left over from last year. (I'm trying to use up the peaches we had to freeze in 2007 as our trees are already budding for this year's crop).  The jam came out great and set properly even using frozen fruit.<br /><br />I've been using this brand of pectin for years and have been very happy with it. Plus, buying it here is so easy, and I don't have to spend time hunting around for it in the stores and being told, "We won't carry that stuff until the end of the summer." This is an excellent price as I've seen it as high as 4.75/package in one of our local screw-you grocery stores.<br /><br />There's a lot of satisfaction from making something like jam from scratch and a good feeling when you look in your cupboard and see the jars of home made goodies, plus you know exactly what went in to the jam as you're the one who put it in there. And it's easy to do - the trick is just follow the instructions and measure carefully. The kids really enjoy making the freezer jams as there's no cooking.

review/summary: All time best pectic available!
review/text: I've been using this for years, and teaching others how to make jam with it also. Last year some of my new jammers accidently bought other brands of pectin. They were very unhappy with the difference in the end product.<br />The best aspect of this particular pectin is that you can use any amount of sugar that you want, or none. I've found that most jams are really not sweet enough if you go less than 3 cups of sugar per batch. It still beats the heck out of the 7 or 8 cups sugar that a standard pectin recipe calls for.<br />But if you're making jam for a diabetic, you can use a sugar substitute instead.<br />This is the most dependable pectin out there.<br />And for 2 years in a row, amazon.com has had the most economical price for it!

review/summary: Great Sugarfree Jams
review/text: I used this to make some blackerry jam and it came out wonderful.<br /><br />I had read that sometimes sugarfree jam would come out thin, so I used a package and a half of the pectin to make sure that the jame set properly, it may not have been necessary though, I will experiment more with future batches.<br /><br />I used sweetzfree liquid sucralose in the jam and it came out terrific. We will be making orange marmalade soon with this pectin and the sweetzfree, as well as any other fruit we happen to come across.<br /><br />It's good to know there are alternatives to high sugar content foods, really helps controlling both your weight and diabetes.

review/text: I have been using Sure Jell Light for the past two years but could no longer find it at an affordable price at the stores I used to purchase it, then found it on Amazon on a link from Karft Foods.<br />Using Sure Jell Light I do make use of the wild berries I am lucky enough to find in this rural area as well as neighbors abundance; the jelly sets better, is healthier and costs less to make because of the reduced sugar amount. Join me, you will find out for yourself.

review/text: I've been using this brand for years. It always always always gives me the most delicious jam! This year I couldn't find it in any of the local stores (it was horrible!) so I used Ball brand pectin instead. Let's just say I'll never replace my sure jell again! I absolutely love the strawberry freezer jam recipe and it always turns out perfectly!

review/summary: Fresh Fig Low Sugar Preserves
review/text: I use this product religiously to make fresh fig preserves/jam, with figs from my two fig trees.  They begin to produce in late August thru early October, and I am busy making a small quantity of preserves/jam every few days during that period.  You can lower the sugar input to a healthier and more flavourful level without risking a no-jell disaster.  The stuff jells great, and doesn't leave the final product too hard or gummy, it is just right.  My secret is the juice of half a lemon, a pinch of cinnamon, and two tablespoons of Calvados (french apple brandy).  Enjoy!!

review/text: I make fig/raspberry preserves and reduce the sugar by 2/3.  This product is designed for low sugar jams, jellies, and preserves and helps make my preserves thick enough. Decreasing the sugar keeps the mixture from getting very thick.  When I discovered this product and used it, I was sold. Does what it says it does.

review/summary: SureJell disappoints
review/text: This product caused me to waste about fifty dollars in fruit.  I wanted to make<br />sugarless fruit jelly which you are supposed to be able to do.  The raspberries<br />alone were $ 25,00 and i wound up with nearly a quart of raspberry sauce. The<br />sugarless instructions are vague and hard to find; in sec 1 it says "spoon sugar into..."<br />Sec 2 says, "measure exact amount of sugar".  These instructions are followed by 40 inches<br />of charted insructions, all which mention sugar.  Deciphering the sugarless recipe is<br />harder than high=level soduku.<br /><br />The product is poorly packaged:  every pectin envelope was cracked on arrival and<br />pectin dust covered everything.

review/summary: Not as good as the regular SureJell
review/text: My family loves homemade jam and we go through it so quickly that I bought this pack of 8.  I am torn because I hate putting huge amounts of sugar into the jam, but this low sugar (or no sugar added) pectin doesn't do as well as the regular kind.  So far I have only tried it with strawberry jam.  It doesn't taste as fresh, the color of the jam is darker, and it has a weird consistency to it.

review/text: Love Sure Jell less sugar recipes.  Granted it is still a lot of sugar but way less then the full sugar recipes.  It sets up on the softer side, which I like.  You can really taste the fruit. I have made it with strawberry jam and pear jam, both were excellent.  Sure Jell's website has more recipes than the package insert.

I bought another color of sprinkles from a different company, paid the same price and got 16 ounces.  The seller did not specify in the description how many ounces was included in the price.  I took the risk because I needed the sprinkles and couldn't find them.  I will know next time to ask the question before purchasing.

review/summary: Misleading Description/Deceptive Pictures
review/text: I give the product itself a thumbs up. Coffee Mate is a good product. What is not good about this is the Distributor! Pay close attention and do not fall victim as I did. From the picture showing three bottles (one each of the flavors available) and the title saying " Total of 2 each," I was under the impression that I was going to receive a total of six bottles; two of each flavor. This was not the case. I received two bottles of one flavor. I overpaid for these two bottles. Had the picture and title not been so deceptive I would have purchased from another distributor. Sorry Hugos, but these are going back to you. I will be getting a refund and taking my business elsewhere!<br /><br />By the way, I took a screenshot of the ad incase anyone wants to dispute my claims.
