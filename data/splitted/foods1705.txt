review/summary: The Original Hostess Cupcake
review/text: Delicious Hostess Chocolate Cupcakes were the first Hostess Cupcakes.  You can now get orange flavored Hostess Cupcakes as well.  While homemade cupcakes are still the best, if you have too little time to whip up a batch of cupcakes, when these cupcakes are fresh they are hard to beat.  They have a soft, chocolate cake body with a creamy middle and chocolate icing on top.  The only problem with these cupcakes is that they are addictive, and those of us who spend too little time on the treadmill need to watch home many of these things that we eat, both at one time and altogether.<br /><br />Well, I hear a Hostess Cupcake calling my name...

review/summary: Not like I remembered...
review/text: Boohoo--everyone talks about how these really bring back memories. I thought they would invoke some of my yummy childhood days, but they were a letdown! The frosting actually peeled off in spots! The cake was a little crumbly too. My little girl tastebuds must have just had lower standards.

review/summary: Beef Fat?  In a Cupcake?!
review/text: I was shocked to read the ingredients of this and other Hostess products.  Can anyone explain why they put beef fat in these products?  I think it's disgusting - I've never seen such a thing and I'll never buy any Hostess products again.

review/summary: Our Favorite
review/text: I ordered these mainly for my husband. We can't get them in the stores in our area, so I asked him if I should order them from Amazon and he said "yes". These are our favorite item that Hostess makes. We love chocolate, and the cream filling is an added plus.

review/summary: LOVE these things!
review/text: Always the lunchbox stable, these chocolate cupcakes with their infamous white swirl down the middle are still one of my favorites.  No, they don't taste the same as they did in the 60s, but then again, WHAT does?  The cream is what I notice the most - not quite as creamy and lush as they used to be, but well, they're still great and taste great to the next generation.  They're also awesome frozen on a hot day.  They have to be considered an American staple - especially since Hallmark has turned them into a Christmas ornament!  Even though they do contain beef fat (weird, huh?), they're still good.  All cakes for the most part, unless you use applesauce, contain some sort of fat or oil to make them moist.  Just jump on the treadmill for a couple of minutes and well, there it goes!  Great product, been enjoying them for 40 years, highly recommend!

review/summary: So good that you just might forget the oncoming diet debacle
review/text: Hostess Chocolate CupCakes have a great chocolate flavor that mixes so well with the cream filling inside them. These cupcakes certainly aren't the healthiest for you; but they DO make for a great after school snack; and they are perfect for when you need a sugar kick burst of energy when you're on the go.<br /><br />The packaging is good; and they maintain their freshness so long as you eat them within a week or two of buying them. The cupcakes are relatively small and individually wrapped so they can fit in a small lunch box container for school kids, a lady's purse and even a briefcase for businessmen and businesswomen. Great!<br /><br />However, the fun may stop there. I would not eat these every day. These cupcakes are loaded with sugar; and sugar can turn into fat inside your body if you don't get enough exercise. They have a lot of carbohydrates, too. These cupcakes also contain partially hydrogenated ingredients; this means they DO have trans fats--and trans fats are very unhealthy for you. The frosting can sometimes get crusty so eat these while they're fresh.<br /><br />Overall, despite the health concerns, these cupcakes have several good uses that I couldn't ignore. They taste great; they are good for an after school snack or for adults on the run; and they come individually wrapped so they don't break and smear the chocolate cake or the cream filling all over your other things in your briefcase, purse or lunch box. Pick up a box of these cupcakes and enjoy one or two tonight!

review/summary: Delicious, Nutritious, great for Diabetics!!
review/text: I originally ordered this product after someone gave me one to try.  I ordered them that day!  The very full flavor of the orange and cranberry just explodes in your mouth with the first bite!  I later read the reviews and realized that these highly nutritious granola bars had a very low glycemic index (they were great for diabetics!)  They are high in fiber and I think they are made with agave nectar which is metabolized differently than sugar, so it doesn't give you that sugar spike and then drop.  My friend who is diabetic loves them.  I ordered a second order just for her.  The orange cranberry is much more flavorful than the very berry.  We both found those to be quite bland.

review/text: I've recently been trying to eat low carb and purchased these because of the health and low glycemic qualities. My husband, 5 year old son and I all enjoyed them. They are tasty and filling. They have a very strong orange flavor, which I think they would be better if it wasn't quite so strong. I like the texture and the healthy ingredients.

review/text: Each flavor stands out- the orange, cranberry and cinamon.  It is so flavorful.  My 3 year old nephew screams for spice orange cranberry, orange cranberry and he jumps for joy when I give him some to eat.  How funny I gave him some to share with me and now when he sees me he always asks for them.  His parents are thrilled that he likes this snack more then any other.  since it is healthy- unlike the cookies and ice cream which have now become second in line to these granola gourmet bars.

review/text: These are simply amazing dried apricots! There's a bit of a honey note in there, and they are glabrous, or fuzz-free. First read about them in Lucky Peach, and contacted the company for my first order. These folks ship fast, and the product is wonderful! I wound up giving an assortment of the Jelena, the Natasha, and the Larissa varieties out as Christmas gifts. I can't see myself eating any other dried apricots now, these have forever ruined the ones I used to get in the grocery store.

review/text: After trying most of the other store bought brands and not being satisfied, I have finally found a good cayenne source against which I can judge others in the future.  Good clean and pure taste with no added compounds.  Just tastes like good pure ground up cayenne pepper, and plenty hot too.  This is the logical next step up for any newbie who takes a liking to cayenne and is soon displeased with the quality of the other brands on the shelf.

review/text: Justin's nut butters are so delicious and these squeeze packets are amazing!  I have been buying them on Amazon Subscibe and Save for a few years now and never get tired of them.  They are great to carry with you and have with an apple for a snack and avoid the pitfalls of eating junk food.  They have about 200 calories each, so they aren't "diet" per se, but they fill you up and have protein so you feel satisfied.  They are also really affordable compared to buying them at the store.  I keep them everywhere for when I get really hungry, sometimes I just eat them plain.

review/summary: Yum...SO Good!
review/text: [...] I took it out of the box rinsed the package kneaded as directed and ate it straight out of the package.  It was so good I will definitely continue to order and probably try the other flavors as well.  Almond butter is a much healthier than Peanut Butter especially this brand and another brand I ate which only contain a few ingredients.  FYI for those who like Peanut Butter Justin's brands are just as healthy as their Almond Butters.  I wanted to try the squeeze packs because the other brand I have eaten in the past though good, it's such a pain to have to stir this huge jar of it every time and I like to keep an eye on my calories so having to measure out a serving from a jar each time gets messy plus it's so bland I always add a little honey to it.  This was was perfect not bland like plain Almond Butter, but not too sweet or salty just enough of everything.  Besides the convenience of not having to stir and measure from a jar I like knowing exactly how much I am getting plus these can be thrown in my purse when I go out for a quick healthy snack when I am out.  Being Gluten, Corn, Soy & Diary Free (among a few other things) makes its difficult when out so it's nice to be able to have something with me that I know is healthy and I am allowed to have.

review/text: These little containers are the perfect size for a 10 year old to be able to make himself a bowl of macaroni without parents having to be overly concerned about them getting burned... even once cooked, the hot water is low enough so it won't easily 'slosh' out resulting in burns (which was my big concern!)<br /><br />Don't fool yourself, these aren't anything like homemade, but they are exactly the same as the Easy Mac.  add a little pepper and they're pretty dang good!  I've even been known to eat them occasionally :)<br /><br />I actually signed up for the subscription service so that I could have these delivered on a regular basis because our local store often only has 10 or fewer of these cups or they have them in the other flavors which my child will not eat.  Plus, buying it this way is much cheaper than buying them locally (we were paying $1.25 per container when we could find them).

review/summary: Easy and Delicious
review/text: I sent this to my son at college. I have used this product before and it is very easy to prepare. Most people love mac and cheese and this is just as good as homemade. The best part about ordering from Amazon grocery is that they deliver to your door. If you have a love one that lives far away and has limited transportation this may be an answer for you. Just order and let Amazon do the rest.

review/summary: A childhood favorite that I can make anytime
review/text: Ever since I was a kid, I've loved Kraft mac and cheese.  Granted, the years have probably faded my memories, but I sure think that this tastes just like the stuff my mom used to make from the box (and I later made from the box when I was in college).  Unlike the box version, I can make these easily at work - woohoo!  I can store these in my desk drawer, and either one or two packs serve as a plenty satisfying lunch for me.  I've never had any issues with making these, with the recommended 3.5 minute cooking time being just perfect.  So simple to make - pull off the plastic seal, remove the packet of powdered sauce, add water to the clearly marked line in the cup, microwave for 3.5 minutes, add the powdered sauce, stir, and enjoy!<br /><br />The only downside to me is the disposable container for each serving that isn't readily recyclable in a lot of places (it's type 5 plastic).  Like many here, I'm much more conscious of my environmental impact than I used to be.<br /><br />If you watch for sales, you can get these for a good price.  I ordered them from Amazon for under 60 cents a pack, but they are almost always available for at or under a dollar a pack at the stores around me.  To me, that's a great price for a quick and satisfying snack/lunch.

review/summary: Can't beat these!
review/text: I actually have a subscription for these Easy-Mac cups - this allows me to get them less expensively even than at WallyMart and certainly more convenient!! No tax, free shipping - how can you beat that deal?????<br /><br />My 2 daughters will cook for themselves at times... but, when they are too tired, or busy, etc. THese make an easy snack that Mom is happy about! I am always trying<br />to get them to increase their calcium intake and this is a way to do it that they have no idea I'm giving them something good for them!!<br /><br />We have been on the auto-ship program for over a year now and only once did we have a little "stockpile" of them and I fixed it by donating the new case to our local food pantry!<br /><br />Our house would be very upset if Kraft discontinues this product or Amazon stops it's program!!<br /><br />Yay Kraft, YAY Amazon!!

review/summary: Easy to make, not as good as "real" mac & cheese though
review/text: As a person who works the graveyard shift, I'm always on the lookout for meals that are easy to carry along & easy to make. Meals that cook fast are a bonus. With that in mind, I decided to take a chance on the Kraft Easy Mac meals.<br /><br />The packaging is easy to carry & doesn't damage easy, which is good since it would be very bad if it got damaged either on the way or while it was heating up. The directions are also very simple to follow. Add water & nuke it in the microwave for 3 1/2 minutes, then mix the powdered cheese in. Up until that point, it's perfect. However after that point the big problem is the taste. It's good, but it's not as good as the real deal. That's to be expected though.<br /><br />Overall, I liked it & I liked it enough to purchase more for future meals. It's not very healthy, but it will fill you up enough until you can get home & make a real meal. I wouldn't suggest it as an everyday meal though.<br /><br />3.8/5

review/summary: Melted and burned plastic cup 3 stars for product, 0 stars for cup!!
review/text: My kids love this stuff.  It's easy enough for them to make themselves.  Just add water and microwave for 3 1/2 minutes.  However this morning my 10 year old daughter decided to make some and the plastic cup actually melted and the macaroni is a black clumpy plastic coated mess.  The entire house is filled with smoke.  This have never happened to us before but I have read that it has happened to other people so this isn't just some random freak thing.  I am now nervous about the kids burning down the house with this stuff.  I'll have to begin to monitor the microwave while it's cooking (as in stand in front and watch for the 3 1/2 minutes).  One incident probably isn't enough to make them stop cooking it but I just thought I would make others aware of this potential risk.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars since I do actually like the product since it's easy for them and actually doesn't taste bad.  But I if this happens again, I'll have to rethink the whole thing.  The actual macaroni is fine, I think it's just the cup.  So 3 stars as it stands and 0 stars for the cup!!

review/text: Well, it's Easy Mac. Easy Mac always came in little packets with noodles you nuke for a bit in water, then add the cheese. It was... Easy. My kids, growing up, loved it. We loved it because it allowed them to make themselves a snack (be more independant).<br /><br />They're older now, but they still love Easy Mac. These packs they can take in their lunches for school or work. A couple minutes in the microwave, mix in the cheese powder, and they're ready.<br /><br />Currently I subscribe and save a case of these every now and again to keep them in the house. The price is good.

review/summary: Good for what it is: a quick snack/dorm food
review/text: I used to have these all the times when I lived in a dorm, since dorm residents are restricted to using only a microwave in their rooms. It's not the most appetizing thing to eat, but that's the be expected. However, it's not terrible either, and it's certainly no worse than your standard boiled-in-a-pot Kraft mac & cheese.<br /><br />This is good for what it is: a quick snack; or for anyone at college that's limited to using a microwave to cook in their room.<br /><br />The only tip I'd give is to put a little less than the recommended amount of water in the cup prior to microwaving it, and add a bit of milk (whole milk is best) after microwaving to thicken up everything a bit.

The fire in the microwave continued to burn until it was doused, and now the whole house smells burnt, even after ventilating for hours.  It looked like it could have burned out of control if someone weren't watching it close enough to see it flame up.<br /><br />My microwave is ruined. My house stinks of smoke. We probably avoided a disaster out of sheer luck.<br /><br />This product is not safe for use by children, or perhaps even adults.

review/summary: Expensive for what you get
review/text: As a lover of boxed mac and cheese, I thought that these would be the perfect thing for me, so I bought some--and subsequently pawned them off on unsuspecting neighbors. Okay, it wasn't that bad, but they are definitely not like homemade (though I wasn't suspecting that), nor were they even like boxed mac and cheese (which I thought they would do a good job of replicating). I felt that these cups taste very powdery and were unappetizing.<br /><br />The only way I could get them down was to mix some milk and butter with them. However, after already paying over $1 for this food, I feel like I shouldn't have to add more cents on to the price by supplying my own milk and butter. I also question the environmental friendliness of this food--there is an awful lot of extra waste made for a small amount of gain.

review/summary: unfortunate consumer
review/text: This product called "Hot Cereal" came under Instant Oatmeal but I/we saw absolutely nothing that even<br />remotely resembled an oat.  There was no flavor despite the label and if one is supposed to feast with the eyes first, then I/we must say, without exaggeration, that it looked like pulverized cement mix with no aroma.  The taste?  Completely absent, defying any description in words.  To boot, the shipping fee is greater than the cost of what the manufacturer considers a food.

review/summary: The best refreshing drink ever!!!
review/text: We were introduced to the lemon-lime Kool-Aid 25+ years ago.  It is the best flavor Kool-Aid makes.  It is refreshing and tasty and since you add your own sugar, not too sweet (I use 3/4 of what they say). This flavor has been impossible to find in the NYC area for years, and now we can't find it in the Pocono, PA area either.  Thank goodness for Amazon, now I have a year's supply!!!  If you want to give your kids something tasty and fun to drink, with a little less sugar, you should try this one.  Enjoy!!!

review/text: I am very careful these days what I eat due to a recent diagnosis. One of the things I watch is MSG - read some reports on it and you'll understand why. Everything in my cupboard had MSG in it. This does not. The risk is always, "Will it taste good?". MSG adds a lot of salt and what the brain reads as flavor and sometimes removing it can seem like a reduction in flavor. Not so with this product!! It is so good - I use it wherever and whenever I can. I am finding that I do not have to use very much so it goes quite far. I now have the vege, beef and chicken flavored versions and they are all good. MMMMMMM...happy tummy!

Packages of Ginger Nuts can be bought in the International Foods section at the local Big Lots for two bucks or less--why buy online?

I bought the first box at World Market and he just thought it was "okay". However, when I bought the four pack online (much better price! best I could find around anywhere!)and we ran out of that-he decided he could not go back to plain old Lipton tea anymore! He tried....but he missed the taste of this tea and told me to re-order! So needless to say-we are on auto-ship now and I have to be careful we don't ever run out!

review/text: I've liked most of the Back To Nature (BTN) products I tried and this is no exception. These are about 40% whole cashews and 60% halves. They taste fresh and are lightly sea salted. There are no added oils. I wouldn't call them jumbo though, as they are the same regular size of any other brand on the market I've tried. Since usually it is the Kirkland brand from Costco I buy, I will say BTN's taste much better, but they are also considerably more expensive. I will savor these 3 bags due to their high caloric content.Yum.

Never happens with this brand.  Great taste and great value.  I would recommend them to everyone.

review/text: I was initially skeptical about purchasing these cashews as they are commonly available in most supermarkets.  This particular brand however is Superior to most others I have tried.  The nuts are amazingly fresh and salted just right.<br /><br />They have none of the oily taste associated with inferior quality cashews as they are specially roasted without the use of additional oils.  The only minor issue that I have for the price paid is that these cashews are in no way "JUMBO" as compared with other Jumbo cashews I have purchased.  There are also more than just a few broken nuts in the package which I assume can not be avoided.<br /><br />Overall, these are delicious and worth the money paid.

review/summary: The best tasting cashews I have had
review/text: Our family loves cashews for their supply of protein and are easy for the body to digest. I try different brands and bulk buys from our local natural foods markets and I must say my 1st bag of these provided the best tasting cashews I have had. They were roasted to perfection, not overcooked or undercooked (either of which drastically affects their flavor) and the perfect amount of salt. I love the fact that they do not have any added oils which is common with most brands to add peanut and/or cottonseed oil. The only negative is the cost. I can buy Target Brand or Planters cashews for 1/2 the cost and they are tasty as well but not at this level of purity and goodness.
