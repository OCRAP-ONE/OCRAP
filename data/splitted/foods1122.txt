review/summary: DOES NOT DELIVER....
review/text: I received yesterday my order of one 8oz bottle of that "pur Maple extract". Opened the bottle right away, i knew then it was a VERY weak extract.<br />Put it to the test already, my recipe calls for 1 teasp. extract for the batter, I used 2 TABLESpoons, to no avail, as the cake, now cooled has no maple flavor in its batter TO JUSTIFY THE TITLE OF MAPLE WALNUT CAKE...THOUGH THE WALNUTS i TOASTED GIVE IT A GOOD FLAVOR.<br />The glaze recipe called for one teaspoon extract also, I used a full TABLESPOON, and the glaze is delicious.<br />THIS PRODUCT DELIVERS A VERY FAINT MAPLE FLAVOR, not what you would expect for an extract at that price.<br />Will never purchase this item again, I am going to investigate other brands. SERIOUS BAKERS : skip this brand, UNLESS ALL YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS A WEAK, FAINT MAPLE FLAVOR.

review/summary: Kitty-Kap can covers
review/text: At first I had a hard time removing these lids from small cans such as Fancy Feast.  The solution is to just add hot water to a bowl and set the can in the bowl.  This takes the chill off the cat food and also makes the lid easier to remove.  (The cats don't like cold food and they don't like the microwave method!!)

review/summary: Good idea, bad execution
review/text: I have been looking all over for a lid that will fit both sizes of 3 oz. cat food cans -- some brands such as Before Grain and Blue Buffalo Wilderness have slightly oversized 3 oz. cans compared to Fancy Feast or Wellness.  Lids that I have seen at the pet store and elsewhere fit the smaller cans, but not the slightly larger ones.  Anyway, these Petmate lids did fit both size 3 oz. cans, along with two sizes of larger cans. HOWEVER, the plastic is so stiff and hard that they are next to impossible to snap on and off.  They were basically unusable and I threw them away.<br /><br />I also ordered another brand of lids (OurPets) for small cans and they are a dream.  They fit both sizes of small cans and are soft and easy to put on and take off.  Would recommend them over the Petmate Kitty-Kaps for sure.

It is a softer plastic and works much better.  If you use the smallest size cans, forget about this one!

review/text: I was disappointed when the product arrived and only one can cover was inside. I assumed by the image I was getting two covers - one orange and one yellow - but I only got the orange one. Had I known or realized this, I would have purchased from another vendor. So basically, I paid $6 for one lid. Boo. I was also frustrated that the lid was covered in stickers with glue that DOES NOT WANT TO COME OFF! I've tried to removed the sticky goop, but now I have to go buy goo-gone to get all the crap off. I don't feel like this lid fits as good as the lid I had previously. It works and gets the job done, but I don't think it's keep the food super fresh. Oh well, lesson learned.

review/summary: Seem pricey. I like them for 5.5  oz or large dog food cans I buy
review/text: I don't use small cans like Fancy Feast, so I cannot comment on those. However, I like these because they LAST. I bought them at a pet food store which no longer carries them, probably because they are so expensive.<br /><br />Except for a lid I bought at least 15 years ago labelled Sargeant's, these are the sturdiest. The more flimsy ones always end up getting a crack in them and are not always tight.<br /><br />For me, the 4 stars, not 5, is because they seem expensive. However, on Amazon, it seems that most of the can covers are more expensive than you would want to pay. It's the S & H that is outrageous.

review/text: Sour.  Goodness, the sour.  My boyfriend & I are connoisseurs of sour; we don't consider it sour until we've lost control of the facial twitching.  These do the trick.  Not really a great idea for small children... (under 12's should be brave souls)<br /><br />The three flavors are all good; the red (watermelon) is the sourest by FAR.  The green apple is mildest, and the blue raspberry is nicely in-between.  One frustrating aspect is that the sour lasts for about a minute or two, then the flavor lasts another 3 minutes (we literally timed it) and then you're chewing caulk.  No detectable purpose to this gum after the first 5 minutes.  Think of it more as a chewy candy-style experience.  Don't expect a bubble gum.  Despite this, I gave it a 4 because I really like the idea of sour gum - even if short-lived.<br /><br />The price is reasonable for the bulk amount, as well.  Good to pass around at parties and see who withstands it!  Also, does in fact blow decent bubbles.

review/text: This natural sweetener product tastes better than other liquid stevia I have tried, it tastes sweet without any chemical aftertaste.  This sweetener works very well instead of sugar in most applications (beverages), though with black coffee it is clear the product is not sugar.  Its probably the acidity level in the coffee that creates a different result than that with Iced Tea, which tastes very good with stevia.<br /><br />Other Stevia products have tasted more like a chemical to me when tried.

review/summary: Break the cycle of overpriced coffee pods once and for all!!
review/text: Just because these come in a tea bag type of pouch does not mean they can not be brewed in a single cup ($20) coffee pot. I tried this method of brewing single cups of coffee out of disgust with the price of the all-mighty K cups pods. With K cups, I found myself spiraling toward financial ruin simply to enjoy coffee in a single serving cup.<br /><br />So, for A FRACTION of the cost here is what I recommend. Purchase a $20 single serve coffee maker, doesn't matter the brand but this is the exact one I use with the metal permanent filter removed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041GNZSS">Single Serve Coffee Maker</a> ...get the cheapest one you can find. All it is doing is heating water - keep that in mind. Put one of these tea bag style pouches in the filter compartment. Push it down really good in the filter holder and make sure the water won't flow around it as it hits the bag. Sit back and wait, soon you will have a perfect cup of Folgers coffee.<br /><br />I have not brewed a pot of coffee any other way since going to these. I have purchased hundreds of packets and have never been disappointed. I just hope Folgers doesn't realize what they have here and jack up the price.<br /><br />So...cut yourself loose from the K cup cycle and with the cash you save treat yourself by purchasing one of the out-of-service space shuttles, or send an entire class of graduates at your local school to Harvard.<br />So...cut yourself loose from the K cup cycle and with the cash you save treat yourself by purchasing one of the out-of-service space shuttles, or send an entire class of graduates at your local school to Harvard.

review/summary: Tastes better than instant, less work than a coffee pot
review/text: These single packs are nice and convenient. Other brands make them, like Maxwell House also sold at Amazon, but I prefer the Folgers for now.  They work just like a teabag, you place them in hot water in your mug and let them steep. The amount of time to steep or dunk is relative to your what you like in flavor, simply let it sit longer for stronger coffee. For some reason, both this brand and others have chose to place 19 in a box, weird that they do not round off to 20. The bags are cordoned off in separate containers to stay fresh longer. While I will still use my regular pot for camping as it is part of the experience, I can see where this would be great for lighter weight backpacking, the flavor is better than instant for sure and not as messy.

review/summary: The Best There Is - IMHO
review/text: I really enjoy this coffee. I use it at home and work.<br /><br />At work, I use it in my office. With some filtered water and my Black & Decker Cup-at-a-Time coffee maker, I make a cup of hot (just right) water. I put the Folgers coffee bag in the coffee mug first and let the hot water drip onto it while it's making. When the coffee maker (or in my case, hot water maker) is finished, i dunk my coffee bag for about 10 seconds. I then let it sit for about 30 seconds. Voila' ! A wonderful cup of coffee. Another definite plus is the aroma experienced while brewing! It smells so good! Also, I don't have to walk from the 3rd floor to the 1st floor where there may or may not be fresh coffee made.<br /><br />At home, I sometimes like a cup of coffee on the weekend. I use the microwave. These bags have no metal on them, so you can put the bag in the cold water in your mug and then microwave. I microwave for about 1 minute and 45 seconds. (With my microwave, this just brings the water to a boil when the microwave cuts off.) I let the bag sit or a minute or two and I have a great cup of coffee. Others like to heat the water by itself and pour it over the bag in the mug.<br /><br />This coffee taste great, is very smooth and very convenient. The price is very reasonable for what you get. It's also one of the very few coffees I have found that doesn't give me heartburn! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

review/summary: It's My Bag
review/text: The taste and satisfaction of a cup of coffee made with a Folgers coffee bag lies somewhere between that made with ground coffee and that made with instant. And in that limbo territory it's closer to ground than instant.<br /><br />For those who want more flavor it's important to let the bag seep for at least five minutes or even longer if you don't mind reheating in the microwave. I like the taste of coffee made with these singles and use them when I just want one cup or when making a pot of "real" coffee is inconvenient or impossible. These singles are great for taking on vacation or for using at work.<br /><br />I still prefer my coffee from the pot, but these Folgers Classic Singles are a viable, convenient alternative in some situations. In fact, as I finish typing this review, I'm also finishing up a satisfying cup of coffee made with a Folgers coffee bag.

Backpack, camping and yes on the train in motel rooms etc. Used one of those little nify metal rods that heat coffee in the cup with a travel mug that's silcone coated outside and stainless inside and the heater fits just right. No trouble bumping around in train car either. Boils water in 3 minutes about and added the coffee bag to the boiling water before removal of the rod. Then unplug rod and cooled it under water faucet and repack it and capped the travel mug with it's lid after removal of the bag. Worked so slick....we did just love it...New thing for us anyway.

review/text: I stopped drinking coffee years ago, but recently decided that a dose of caffeine wouldn't be a bad idea.<br /><br />  Since I only want a cup or two a day, I looked for a simple way to get it done.<br /><br />  The Folger's single servings are great.<br /><br />  Each bag brews an excellent cup of aromatic, flavorful coffee. Just microwave a cup of water, dunk the bag for however long you like and you've got your cup of coffee. I find that 30 - 45 seconds of dunking gives me what I want.<br /><br />  I tried a generic brand from the local store - and it was pretty bad. Weak, little taste and lots of oil on the surface. The Folgers is real coffee in a convenient to use package. I'm sold on them.<br /><br />Jerry

review/text: I LOVE THESE. Started using post labor.  GREAT cup of coffee, just DON'T follow directions. Make sure water is a ROLLING BOIL, not just hot, then leave the bag in for 5 full minutes. Perfect every time. I don't suggest longer than that unless you want it bitter. 5 minutes delivers a decently strong cup without bitterness (when lightly sweetened & a touch of cream). I use a large 16-20oz mug and two bags.

Make sure to operate the handle after the blue light comes on. Then push the blue button you want for the size of the cup and the hot water flows into the cup, over the bag and in a copule if minutes I have a nice hot cup of coffee! I use the K cups for desert coffees. It saves money and is much faster and less wasteful than old types of coffee makers.

review/text: There's no denying that coffee singles are convenient for people who don't drink coffee every day or don't want to deal with the hassle of cleaning out the coffee maker (like myself).  However, the coffee from these singles is rather bland, with not much taste and no body.  Personally, I'm not convinced that theses singles are that much better than instant coffee.  Use them for the caffeine, not the taste.

review/text: This is the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. I have drunk many cups of Folgers coffee in my life; I've never been a big fan of their product but it was good enough for consumption at work. This is the first time I purchased their single serving coffee bags. I was excited about the product because it "scratched an itch" I had. Little did I know that this coffee was not at all drinkable. I've tried it twice and both cups had this awful, skunky flavor. I will not be purchasing this product again. Caveat - both bags that I used for brewing were from the same box. It's possible that I got a bad box but I'm not going to throw good money after bad to find out.

I used to use the coffee maker at work but the machine seems to never be as clean as I'd prefer and buying coffee on the road can get pricey. So, I found these as a worthy alternative to the traditional drip systems. They're convenient and the price is right. They travel well and I highly recommend them to anyone that is often on the go and needs quick and easy coffee without the mess for that pick-me-up.<br /><br />One helpful tip: I get best results when I brew with hot hot hot water from my electric tea kettle. This is definitely the way to get the best flavors. After allowing the coffee to brew in my mug a few minutes I drop a couple ice cubes in and it's the perfect temperature for hitting the road.

review/summary: A different way of making a cup of coffee
review/text: You should try these singles if you drink just one cup of coffee in the morning. They taste the same as normally brewed coffee, but it could take some time to get the brew process just right for you.<br /><br />Pros versus a coffee pot brewer: Less waste, less mess, less time to brew<br /><br />Cons: Doesn't work well for multiple cups of coffee, prone to error<br /><br />Because the brew process has to be manually performed by a person, it is easy for someone to make a watery cup of coffee using these. It wasn't until I got the process down that my cups started tasting like real coffee. Ultimately this is the same stuff you put in a pot brewer, so it tastes the exact same if done right.<br /><br />When you read the instructions, its important to follow all of the steps. There are three important parts: HOT water, steep time, and dunk time.<br /><br />HOT water: I have an electric tea kettle which can boil a cup of water in about 1 minute. I like it because it automatically turns off after the water is boiling, and its less mess than microwaving a pyrex container or a pot on the stove. Mine is a white plastic one that cost about $12. I highly recommend this method because it will get the water the right temperature every time.<br /><br />Steep time: After pouring the hot water into a mug with the coffee single bag, the instructions tell you to wait a minute. My experience is you can vary this time depending on preference. More time equals stronger coffee. I generally let it sit for 1-2 minutes.<br /><br />Dunk time: The part of the instructions I skipped over my first time was the dunking process. The instructions say to dunk the bag into the cup for 15 seconds. I find this process is where a large portion of the coffee flavor comes from. Once again this can be varied to suit taste. I generally dunk for 10-20 seconds.<br /><br />After performing the steps as the box says, it ends up tasting just like normal coffee. If you're used to strong coffee, all you have to do is let it steep longer, dunk longer, or put multiple bags in at the same time.<br /><br />I like this product and use it exclusively now. It ends up cost me less than how much I was spending making small pots of coffee. Its also more convenient for me. Highly recommend giving this a try

I was going to purchase all in stock which was 11 boxes at $2.00 a box should have been $22.00 + shipping it was like $66.00 for the order. THE PRICING IS DECEIVING.

review/summary: Almost as Delicious as a Mango Margarita, Just a Bit More Tart
review/text: Lipton Green Tea to Go, Mandarin and Mango offers a fresh-tasting delicate sweet tea that delivers zero calories and ten mg of caffeine per eight ounce fluid serving.  The Unilever product comes in a small box, packed in ten handy flutes.  It is, the manufacturer states, made from real tea leaves and contains 80 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce servings.  It is also sweetened with real fruit flavors.  It is, as well, easy to prepare.  You can add a packet to one bottle (16.9 fl. oz. of water), or half a packet to a glass of water: just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  It's obviously a handy thing to keep on hand for the office, the gym, the backpack, or anywhere you are on the go.  I've found it's a good pick-me-up when I'm hot and tired in the afternoon.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love mango Margaritas, figure somebody snuck that recipe out of paradise.  The mandarin orange taste here does add a bit of tartness, too.  However, in the list of ingredients I find Aspartame (Sweetener), Corn Syrup Solids, Modified Corn Starch,  Maltodextrin, and  Acesulfame Potassium as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me.  (Of course, I've no idea what might be in the mango margarita mix that bars use, so.)  I'm not a dietitian, just do my best to eat healthy stuff; this drink might, still, be more healthy than diet soda, I just don't know.

review/text: I was very disappointed when I found out that Lipton had discontinued its "Mango Mandarin" flavored green tea!  I used to buy five boxes at a time when I would go grocery shopping.  I'd keep some at home and bring some to work.  A few months ago, maybe even a year ago, that I went grocery shopping I thought they had just ran out but I was told that they had discontinued it!  I hate that.  I hope they realize that many people like it and want it back on the shelves!

review/summary: Disappointed in Lipton
review/text: I am very disappointed in Lipton for discontinuing this product. Like another reviewer I agree that their new products made with honey are way to sweet and their combinations of flavors don't compare to the Mandarin/Mango flavor. I called their customer service line to voice my opinion and my disappointment.  Their customer service representative was very nice and stated that she would make note of my disappointment and then offered to send me some samples and coupons for some of their new teas, which was  a very nice gesture.  I did recieve the product and coupons but have not found anything that tastes as good as the Mandarin/Mango ice tea mix.  I hope that if enough of their customers let them know how disappointed we are, they'll bring the product back to the market (just the way it was with no changes).  I live in MA and traveled to CT to purchase all the product one store had in stock . . . And now my stock is almost gone.  I refuse to pay what the online retailers are charging for the product, paying the s/h per box is ridiculous.  :o(

review/summary: Not this company's best
review/text: The overall taste of this sauce was a disappointment to me. I love many of this company's products so I was a bit surprised that this chili paste didn't taste any better. There are bitter notes to this sauce which I attribute to chile seeds, vinegar and an excessive amount of salt.  Buy some dry red pepper flakes and you'll eliminate the bitterness of this sauce but otherwise replicate it almost perfectly.<br /><br />I much prefer the Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. It is not only hotter but it has a wonderful sweetness to it combined with some pleasant garlic notes.<br /><br />This is a good company but not every one of its products hits the mark. This chili paste misses the mark by a wide margin in my view.<br /><br />The product label lists (in this order) chiles (with seeds), salt and then vinegar. The vinegar and salt add a lot of bitterness. As I said - I like this company's products but not this particular one. Salt and vinegar do NOT complement chiles that well in my view.

review/text: Clearly this is a subjective matter since I'm in disagreement with previous reviewers.  But while I have at least enjoyed, even loved other coffee varieties in the Tassimo machine, I hated the Gevalia Morning Roast so much I threw the rest away after making several attempts to tolerate it.  It was terribly weak, almost chemical-tasting; it tastes like what comes out of a traditional drip coffee maker if you forget to replace the used grounds with fresh ones.  (For the record, my favorites are the Starbucks House Blend and Colombian; Seattle's Best Henry's Blend is milder, less flavorful than those but still a decent cup of coffee, and cheaper than the Starbucks; Starbucks Verona is too strong for my taste.)

review/text: This stuff is absolutely horrible tasting, and not just one batch from one seller.  Over the past 14 months, I have had Gevalia's 12-oz. "Morning Roast" for Tassimo several times, and purchased it from Wal-Mart, the local grocery, Kohl's and even once through Tassimo Direct.  Not only was it metallic-tasting weak coffee every single time, but about 30% of the T-discs end up clogging about halfway through the brew cycle, and when they finally let loose, almost all of the grounds come squirting out into my coffee cup, ruining it anyway.  This is not a brewer problem (have cleaned and de-scaled both of my brewers), nor a water problem, as I use bottled water for coffee.  The worst part is that when you try to get any satisfaction from Tassimo, or even try to report that there's a problem with these particular discs, their idiot customer service people just want to refer you to the espresso disc recall!  I will not buy any more Gevalia branded coffee.

review/summary: Not too weak Not to Strong - good cup of coffee
review/text: This coffee saved the Tassimo machine from being returned.  I had a Keurig for years and to the most part it worked pretty well but there were two issues.  With all the flavors available I ended up using just one, Donut Shop Coffee by Coffee People which I liked.  However, the Keurig machine I have only has one brew size and I would end up using 2-3 K-cups a day to get a nice big cup of coffee in the morning.  The other issue was it just did not brew really hot coffee.<br /><br />Enter the Tassimo - I was really nervous about the limited selection of coffee available but I figured if I could find one I like it would be a good solutions especially since I  like the fact that on occasion I can make a cappuccino or other fancy drink.  The Starbucks coffee is just too strong so I tried the Maxwell House which was just OK.  I then tried the Gevalia Large Morning Roast and I hit the jackpot.  It as a good large serving so I was only using one t-disc.  It was HOT and it had a nice strong (by my taste) non-bitter flavor.  It reminds me of what I got in Italy when I asked for american brewed coffee.

While I am sure for people who tend to enjoy much milder coffee then I prefer it might be great, it is not great for me!  I am going to stick with my Starbucks Columbian t-discs.
