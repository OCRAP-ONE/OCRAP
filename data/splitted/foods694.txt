review/summary: Great product, but are you kidding me for this price?
review/text: I use the Oregon Chaie Sugar-free Latte mix every morning. It has replaced my McDonald's Iced Coffee addiction. I began using Oregon's product to save money, but found that I prefer the taste.<br /><br />That being said, I never would have tried it at the price offered by this seller. I get it for less than a third of the cost, even before factoring in the shipping.<br /><br />Yeah, for the product. Boo for the seller's price.

review/text: I picked this up one day in a store due to my recent ban from sugar (I'm a gastric bypass patient), and I shied away from this for the longest time.  One day I just got sick of coffee and decided to go ahead and jump-off the cliff and give this stuff a try.  I made it per the instructions, but with vanilla soy milk (this milk was sweetned, which made the mix a tad too sweet for my taste), but it was DELICIOUS!<br /><br />I had really MISSED my soy-chai latte's from s-bucks, but now that I've found this, and can buy my soy unsweetned, I know I'll be really HAPPY going forward!<br /><br />Now, if I could just find this mix but unsweetned, it would really take the cake!

review/text: I googled Sucralose and found plenty of research to indicate toxicity.<br /><br />I wish Oregon Chai would make a chai which has no sweetener; most people would prefer unsweetened chai these days, wouldn't they?<br /><br />This company's chais are too highly sweetened. This is unnecessary. I have tried them and find them undrinkable.<br /><br />NOTE to potential chai product makers. Make a highly spiced liquid chai which is unsweetened in any way, using only organic or at least natural ingredients. You would sell it.

review/summary: Great, but some considerations
review/text: Yes, they are delicious. There is no doubt that the chocolate, peanut butter, and crisp, blend to make the most irresistible flavor ever invented, but to package them in 2 packs! Amazing. This would get a 4 star rating if they were individually packaged, but because of the pairing, this earns a full 5 star review.<br /><br />I wish that the bars would hold up to heat a little bit better. Even my immense body heat melts the chocolate on my fingers, forcing me to have to lick them off. Possible infection to airborne pathogens can occur, causing vomiting, sickness or dizziness.<br /><br />I also feel that they could have made the bars a little smaller; maybe bite size. Unfortunately, when you break the bar in half, you get crumbs. This can lead to ants on your floor, carpet or cement basement floor. Also, despite the risk of fireants, can pose a health risk to your dog, which we all know should not ingest chocolate in any way.<br /><br />In the end, I think the bars are a well rounded treat that are made in everyone's favorite math shape, the rectangle; or, when looked at on an angle, the parallelogram.

It is normally brown in colour--the natural colour of cane sugar. It takes its name from the Demerara colony in Guyana, which was the original source of this type of sugar.

One box was much lighter when I picked it up even though it was closed when I examined it. It was about 200g  instead of 500g with sugar cubes freely moving on a bottom of the box. I have no idea what happened and it is impossible to report it to Amazon--missing links, circular instruction, no phone numbers, no customer support links. The buttons on most pages, even on Returns page are "Continue Shopping".

There are plenty of other Demerara sugar brands out there selling for far less.  Save your hard earned money and buy one of those brands.  Paying $2 more per box just to have square cubes is insane in this economy.

review/summary: One of the best all-around sauces for meats and dipping
review/text: Heinz 57 is a long-time favorite of mine.  I always found it funny that they call it a steak sauce.  Steak is about the only food I *don't* use this sauce on.  It's great for french fries, tater tots, chicken, fish sticks, burgers, and pork chops.  Below are a few of my favorite ways to use Heinz 57:<br /><br />* Mix 1/2 Heinz 57 and 1/2 ranch dressing for a great dipping sauce for veggies, kind of like thousand island, but tangier<br />* Mix melted margarine (never butter!) with Heinz 57 for one of the best wing sauces ever.  Add your favorite hot sauce for more heat, but the pure mix is just about perfect and reminiscent of the infamous Buffalo Joe's in the Chicago area.  You can add garlic powder and onion powder to taste, too.<br />* Put a touch of Heinz 57 in your scrambled eggs or omelet before you cook the eggs.  Adds a nice flavor, almost as if they've been scrambled with veggies.<br /><br />The plastic squeeze bottles are the best way to go, too.  It makes it easy to get the sauce out, for whatever purpose.  I don't buy it in glass anymore.

review/text: I know, I know: "real" restaurants frown upon this. You can't even get it at Outback, at least not around where I live. They consider it more like cheap condiment than real steak sauce. But I like it; it's got a tad of zing, and it goes with so much more than just meat. You can add some more heat if you want - just stir in what you want. I say sauce the way you want to. This quantity and size of bottles is the only way to go, and it compares very favorably to supermarket prices, given no tax or shipping.

review/text: Well, it's a steak sauce, so what's to say?  I've always like Heinz 57 for its tart and complex taste, but some people might not, so it's subjective (surprise!).  I'll say that this deal (4 x 20 ounce bottles) for around $22 is a great price.  My local grocery stores charge about $5-6 for ONE 10 ounce bottle.  If it takes you a long time to go through 4 large bottles, give one away to a friend who shares your taste.  You'll still come out ahead!

review/text: I bought three different varieties at the same time:<br />  Panama Bouquet Blend, Costa Rican Blend, and Guatemalan Blend<br /><br />Of the three, I liked the Panama Bouquet Blend the best overall, with the Costa Rican Blend a very close second.  The Guatemalan Blend is fantastic too, but it has a slightly heavier chocolate note and a dark acidity that I tend to shy away from (but Starbucks drinkers will like it better).<br /><br />For anyone that has actually been to Costa Rica, and you are searching for that same cup of coffee that you were served at the resort/hotel, this might be it.  I had the occasion (twice) to have to do some work in Costa Rica, and then afterward was frustrated at my attempts to find the similar lovely rich-cocoa taste that I'd had, until now.  This is it.  This is the real MCoy.<br /><br />In my world, only the (Copper Moon) Panama Bouquet Blend might be better, but the Costa Rican Blend is a bit more chocolaty, and has a bit of acidity that lets you know it's coffee and not a hershey bar.  Even though it has SOME acidity, I don't mean that it has anywhere near the kind of acidity that you will find anywhere else on the planet.  This is smooth, and rich, great aroma, chocolate finish.  Only the Panama Bouquet Blend has less bite than the Costa Rican Blend has.<br /><br />I will re-order this myself, because I like it best in the afternoon (I always have morning and afternoon coffee, Panama Bouquet in the AM, and Costa Rican Blend (or Guatemalan when the mood takes me) after lunch).

Not that the coffee is bad, mind you.  If I had to sum this coffee up in one word, it would be "average."<br />  Yes, as others have noted, it is not in any way bitter, but it just doesn't stand out head and shoulders above the pack.  When the PX here has any at all, they carry a German brand that is equally non-bitter, but has a more robust flavor, without being bitter and overpowering like most coffee from St**b**ks.<br />  Ah well, live and learn!

review/text: This mix is superb in taste, easy to mix up, just add water. It rises easily and bakes well. The best product for sweet rolls I have ever used. The taste of the batter reminds me of a cream cheese pastry batter for rugelach. Just ordered some more of this. I used this mix  to make sticky buns, but I used a lower  temperature setting per a cookbook recipe,  and baked them at 350 degrees for about 25 minute. They were yummy!!<br /><br /> Amazon, please keep this in stock. It is a Winner!!

I add it to any dish where I want to boost the impact of the tomatoes in the recipe.  And an added health benefit is that processed tomato products are even higher in lycopene than raw tomatoes.  Lycopene for your health, Contadina for your tastebuds.

review/text: I like these pumps, but like any pump, they require cleaning every so often. The less frequently you use them, the more you need to clean them, especially with the white choc sauce. I wrap the opening to the white choc pump with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out. Just remember, you are using a sugar liquid with this... it may crystallize and need to be cleaned with hot water =)

review/text: I got the bottle of chocolate and pump as a gift. Worked great at first. Then, it quit pumping chocolate. As the bottle was still over 2/3 full of syrup, I realized that the shaft of the pump only reaches 1/3 of the way down the bottle. Really?!

The tops of my feet and ankles were starting to hurt, I am a UPS driver and it had been a rough peak season and every year I am getting older and every peak seems to be getting harder. At first I thought I was getting gout , although the symptoms didn't quite match up. I looked up remedies online ( I hate taking prescription drugs needlessly, sometimes the cure is worse than the problem) Tart cherry juice was supposed to flush Uric acid from your system. I didn't have gout but the tops of my feet and ankles stopped hurting in about three days of using the juice. I bought tart cherry pills from Whole Foods they work but not as well as the juice. Hey it worked for me , I'll continue using it

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/text: The order arrived in a timely fashion & was well packed including an ice pack to keep the bars from melting.However, I ordred "Chocalate Delight" but received "Cinnamon Bun" instead. Upon reading the ingrediant list my mom discovered that the bars contain hydrogenated palm oil, a transfat. After a call to Russel Stover Candies, whence the bars were shipped we discovered we would have to do a return/exchange through Amazon. Well the bars are tastey & the whole return process seemed too convoluted to deal with so we'll keep them or maybe hand them out on Halloween to bad children.

review/summary: Phenominal!
review/text: I was so utterly impressed with the packing of the plant (didn't make a sound when I rolled the box to check integrity) and the care taken to ensure the plant was safe and warm (heat pack included and STILL HOT!).  Not only was I grateful that it took a full twenty minutes to unwrap my Orchid and the size and color were impressive, but I even liked the fact that the medium was dry, which decreased on shock and potential freezing of the roots if it were lost in the mail.  I just received this orchid yesterday and literally cried AND kissed the leaves! It was B E A U T I F U L !  I was impressed in the size and quantity of pseudo bulbs. In fact, I was so impressed that five minutes ago, I order THREE more Orchids from this grower. A Wilsonara Kolibri, a Degarmoara Hani Star of Unicorn, and an Odontocidium Catatante!  I cannot wait to get them. They will be kissed to death just like my Sharry!  I have wanted one since they started being available online and the prices and sizes baffled me. $80 or more for a plant the size I got from this seller!! Not only that, but the cheapest ones, which were about $30, were barely over four inches tall and only had one pseudo bulb!  I am close to tears right now. I cannot say how impressed I was. The Orchid pot was covered in paper towelsls which were taped atop the bark mix, the entire plant was wrapped in SHREDDED newspaper INSIDE more paper wrapped around that AND taped THEN covered in packing peanuts AND the heat pack was TAPED to the box, so it didn't knock around and damage the Orchid! I have NEVER seen someone take such good care of a plant. I had another order arrive the same day from another company, in which I had ordered two Maranta Prayer plants. The soil was only covered with tape, nothing really to keep it in the pot (soil actually came through the bottom of the box) and they were set in the box unprotected and only surrounded by a few packing peanuts. The box was way oversized, the heat pack was ice cold, the plants could be heard moving just by tipping the box. Needless to say they were in complete shock! That is what I usually expect, and I prepare for it. This I was NOT prepared for. This order I am beyond pleased with. I cannot wait for the three I just ordered today. You have my total thanks and the packing is why I came back. Well, and the price. Haha. Thank you eternally.

review/text: price is good, taste is good; but from description I somehow assumed it would be whole baby beets, but it is not. also, I don't think I have the palate to determine if a ground/pureed beet is a baby beet or not lol.<br /><br />some added sugar, but according to the label no preservatives at all, which is great. (beetroot, water, horseradish, sugar, vinegar, salt). imported from poland.<br /><br />anyhow they're tasty (if a little too salty for my taste) just have to find a different application for them (soup bases maybe)

review/summary: Not just for kids
review/text: I can tell by the packaging that this product was geared for kids, and it makes for a completely trustworthy snack. But I have to say that I loved it too! I'm currently on a kick to eliminate refined sugar from my diet, and it's been a challenge. But products like this one make it doable.<br /><br />Bear in mind that this isn't just dried fruit, it's freeze-dried...devoid of moisture. That may sound unappealing, but it's really good--the texture is crunchy, and you can soak it in your mouth for really long flavor. There's no added sugar in this, but it's really sweet on its own. I use it for dessert or whenever I need a sweet fix.

review/summary: ADDICTIVE LOW CALORIE SNACK
review/text: I've tried nearly all available low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snack treats.  "Funky Monkey" ranks at the TOP of my list!  This wonderful freeze-dried pineapple snack is imported from Brazil.  It's all natural and gluten-free.  One one-ounce package contains 110 calories.  It has the best flavor of all the freeze-dried pineapple snacks I've tried ever.  The pineapple chips have a crunchy texture that's like eating candy.  If you live in California, you can find them at your local Ralph's Super Market.  Unfortunately my local Ralph's runs out quickly.  Thankfully Amazon provides me with a way to satisfy my craving for Funky Monkey.  Be sure to get the 1-ounce packages.  The 1/3 ounce packages are disappointingly small portions.  However, if you are dieting then go with the small packages.  They make a satisfying low calorie snack to get you through the day.  I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Best Funky Monkey Flavor
review/text: Our family loves dried fruit as a healthy snack, but the Pink Pineapple flavor of Funky Monkey is beyond a doubt the best we've had.  My 3 and 5 year old children and I eat it regularly.  It makes a healthy dessert substitute, a delicious after-school snack, and a simple way to pack a serving or two of fruit in a school lunch box.<br /><br />The pink pineapple product is made of freeze-dried, organic pineapple.  A light powdering of guava paste gives it a subtle pink color and guava taste.  This freeze-dried fruit is very crunchy, and I've noted that it stays crunchy with the package open much longer than other freeze-dried fruit products that seem to absorb moisture from the air quickly and turn spongey.  Ew!<br /><br />The .42 ounce size is a perfect size to put in a child's lunch box and delivers a full serving of fruit and 40% of your Vitamin C for the day.  The 1 ounce size makes a reasonable snack for an adult, shared between two children, or for one hungry after-schooler.  You will be surprised how quickly 12 packs of this versatile snack will be used.<br /><br />Pink Pineapple Funky Monkey packages contain full servings of fruit, are gluten free, fat free, vegan, raw, all natural, 95% organic, and have no added sugar, color, flavors, or preservatives, .  What's not to like?!

review/summary: Cats Love Acana Grasslands
review/text: Acana Grasslands is one of the only dry kibbles I didn't have to mix into another food (or transition in) for it to be accepted by my one year old cats. They dove right into it.<br /><br />It's an all breed, all lifestage grain free kibble made by Champion Foods, who also produces Orijen. They are Canadian based and tout having regional meats delivered each day to add into their formula. They utilize regional ingredients and likely, regional suppliers. I'm cool with that.<br /><br />I mix Acana 50/50 with other high quality kibble as part of my rotation. Acana kibble shape is round and flat. The colour is very dark and if you're transitioning from a light colour food you'll note kitty's darker 'output'.<br /><br />I believe it's true Acana is more fish based than Orijen, but it's an excellent quality food which I'll continue to purchase. I like to buy the smallest bags available and plan to try Wild Prairie formula next.

review/text: This is the best dry catfood I have tried to date.  A friend recommended it and I can't praise it enough.  So good I was initially using it as cat treats to teach tricks while I was transitioning from their old food.  This is grain-free with stellar ingredients and is sold for decent price by Amazon and most of the better online pet stores (petfooddirect, Mr. Chewy, etc.).  Good stuff and worth every penny - and doesn't cost any more than the cheap stuff in the long run because with this you are feeding quality not quantity.

They were fruit-flavored and quite tasty when compared with the standard dark red Twizzler variety.  My daughter (and son) loved them.

review/summary: This is a light and refreshing drink that is good for you when are hot from exercise or working outside!
review/text: Working outside in the summer or exercising can deplete your body of necessary water, electrolytes and energy. This is a good tasting low calorie drink that refreshes you and helps maintain a healthy balance of what your body needs. Each 32 ounce bottle has 4 servings and each serving has 20 calories, 5 Grams of sugar, 110 mg of sodium and 30 mg of potassium. It replaces the salt you have lost from sweating and the potassium helps your muscles not cramp.<br /><br />This is an ideal drink for those lighter workouts or if you are diabetic and need to get refreshed quickly but don't need a lot of sugar. It contains the same electrolytes and hydration as the original Gatorade with � the calories and 1/3 of the carbohydrates.<br /><br />It is great for those hot summer days. It is best served cold and shaken before drinking.<br /><br />The unit price here is not bad but the shipping is extremely high. It is a very good product.

review/summary: Pinnacle - Limited Ingredient
review/text: I received the recommendation as a more natural healthy alternative to the more commercialized brands of avoderm, royal canine , and others.That have either reduced the quality of there food over time or bought out by larger pet food companies and drastically change the formuls. I was very pleased to have changed considering my english bulldog started to get allegies from those other foods. Her allergies eased dramatically once i started her on the Pinnacle. I find the food to be substantially better in quality and ingredient structure and heriarchy of the elements contained within. i find it equally comparable to Halo and Lonovo. The only negative is that if your dog has yeast problems inside and out then this product delivers its fair share of sugars(Carbs) from the potatoes which help fuel the yeast. i used for several months and would recommend to other dogs without yeast problems. good luck but, trying many types and finding the one that works is the best strategy.

review/summary: Best service for a great item
review/text: I had ordered both fresh white trufflesFresh White Truffles 1 ounce ( White Alba Truffle) and some caviar close to a holiday weekend (on the Thursday before Christmas on Sunday) and I had done so without anticipation of getting them except in time for New Years. Shipping was noted as $6 for each of the 2 items I'd ordered.<br /><br />Not only did the seller notice the 2 orders shipping to the same location and consolidated the shipping cost to $8 for both. But they obtained my phone number from Amazon, called me to tell me that normally they overnight these types of items in any event, but while they would happily upgrade for Saturday Delivery at no charge to me so I would have the order for Christmas, they had worries that there was possibly no Saturday delivery in rural area (I live in Bridgehampton NY and they were correct, there is no Saturday deliver here even from Fed-X) and so, to avoid the order sitting around unrefrigerated from Friday till Tuesday, they were calling to ask if they should hold the order and instead ship Tuesday for Wednesday.<br /><br />Since I did not pick up my calls Thursday eve or Friday AM rather than just leave a voice-mail a call their job done, when I finally answered a call at 5:20 Friday, it was from a seller employee's cell phone, who had my order with him, in order to be able keep it freshest, pending an instruction from me, and so as to make absolutely sure they were following my wishes.<br /><br />As you can imagine the items received were commensurate with that service, and when they arrived Wednesday morning they were perfect IN EVERY WAY.<br /><br />And no matter how expensive the items (and they were the cheapest of their kind I found this season), this kind of service, while certainly also rare as the items themselves, is in my estimation, priceless.

The packaging by Party Favors Club is well done; the chips are not crushed during delivery.  My boyfriend and I find the Fuego Takis to be addicting, so having a 200 calorie snack size helps with portion control--and a little really does go a long way!  The corn chips are crunchy, pleasantly spicy-hot, and have a perfect touch of lime.  Yes, I wish they were a little cheaper . . . but having 25 small servings does help them last longer than a single large bag would last in my home.

review/text: We bought this from a candy shop a couple of years ago. Make no mistake - this is not chocolate and it has no chocolate flavor. The orange in its name refers to the color it changes - not to its flavor.<br /><br />The directions call for you to mix the powder with hot water. If you do this it will taste terrible. It becomes only mildly acceptable (to some) when mixed with hot milk rather than water.<br /><br />Its only real use is that the empty cauldron can be used for a decoration around Halloween.

review/summary: Not chocolate!
review/text: I totally agree with the other reviewer.  I bought this (although I bought it with a Harry & David label on it so it was probably more expensive!) and no one in my family liked it.  It is not hot chocolate - more like what they call "white chocolate".  I thought it would be a chocolately orange flavor, yum.  Neither chocolate nor orange flavor.  Only the color is orange.  A big disappointment, I ended up throwing it out.  The cauldron is cute, but the words around the edge don't come off so it's not really reusable.
