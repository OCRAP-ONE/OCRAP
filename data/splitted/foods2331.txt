review/summary: Better than the plain version!
review/text: We buy a ton of the Terra brand veggie chips. The Sweet Potato Spicy flavor is great. It adds a lot to the sweet potato chip that the plain ones are missing.  We won't even buy the plain ones anymore.  It is super nice to have a whole pack of 12 lying around to munch on. They came fresh and as described. I think the pricing is similar to what you can get in the grocery stores, if you can find the flavor you like.

review/text: The Terra sweet potato chips with sea salt added are my new favorite snack! I don't care at all for the ones without salt, the only way I could eat them was with a salty dip. Now these w/the salt are great & they have ridges!! I really like the Krinkle Cut. Love that I can order them as a Subscribe & Save item. Can't find them in the stores where I usually shop & I've checked quite extensively.

review/summary: ALWAYS A FAVORITE WITH US!
review/text: I especially have always loved these. I always bought the larger bags at the store before.  It was too easy to eat one bag in one sitting that way. There are 3 of us plus our dogs, 1 parrot and 1 cockatiel who get one now and then too. I found out that sweet potato chewies are best and safest for dogs and birds and are sold at the Dr. Harvey's pet food site. I am ordering those for my animals now as I think they may be safer- less likely to cause choking. I am ordering some more of these , the small bags, for us now and it has been only 2 weeks.  We went through 24 bags.  Gotta have em! Oh and I was very impressed at the way these were packaged for shipping. They were insulated so well not one broken chip from shipping I guarantee! We use Amazon Prime shipping which is quick and free too.

review/text: I love these chips. You can usually find the mixed bag in our local store. However, the sweet potato chips are much better by themselves. These are some of the best chips. They have a good flavor and it is hard to eat just one chip. They are crunchy and they are thicker than the non crinkle chips in a store but they not as thick as crinkle chips (at least I think that). They are so yummy.

review/text: The Original flavor is scrumptious, not greasy, and crisp. It says "no salt added" and it was not missed at all. Unlike the picture on the bag, they are a beautifully deep orange color. The 1.2 ounce bag size is perfect, a nice snack without the worry of going over board on the larger bag since they are rather addictive. I bought the smaller bags as a part of a gift bag for wedding guests, which were well received.

review/summary: I fell in love.....
review/text: When I went to visit my boyfriend in Boston and he had a few large assorted bags of Terra Chips left over from a function at work. I have always liked the mixed Terra Chips but when I grabbed the bag of these it was love at first bite!<br /><br />I was not aware that these are not salted until I had eaten half of the bag and decided to check out the ingredients. I am a salt fan and on a high salt diet so I was especially shocked to realize that I had not noticed the missing salt.<br /><br />Within 24 hours the bag was gone and he had no opportunity to sample even one chip! He also hates beets but will eat them in this form. So, I figure a fried beet beats no beet at all!!<br /><br />I also love that I don't feel guilty indulging in these as some of the other snack foods I eat are questionable in nature. So I keep these on hand and the other snacks drop by the wayside. These are my 'go to' snack now. The price here is also excellent as I'd pay a great deal more at the store per bag. They always arrive fresh and in very good condition.<br /><br />Thanks Terra and Amazon!

review/text: I like sweet potato fries, and so I wanted to try these chips.  They're spicey, and if you like a spicey chip, then you should try these.  I like spicey foods, but I was a little disappointed in not being able to really taste the sweet potato.  This chip was given a high rating by CENTER FOR SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST'S Nutrition Action Newsletter.  I'm going to try the plain sweet potato chips.  I give ten stars to Amazon's packaging.  With packaging and fast delivery, who needs to go to the grocery store for chips?

review/summary: Open Bags on arrival !! Check every one!
review/text: 7 out of the 12 bags were completely open on the BOTTOM. Taking out the first bag, it was not damaged and I didn't see the issue until I pulled out the second bag. Over half of this purchase is completely unusable and of course, unreturnable. The oil from the bags also seeped through the cardboard box...<br /><br />This is a good product, don't get me wrong, or I wouldn't have purchased 12 bags at one time. But be very very careful and check every bag when the box arrives. I don't agree with rating products poorly for bad shipping, but this wasn't bad shipping. The bags never look like they sealed, but they might have popped open. The cardboard box they all came in was not damaged in any way, so this looks like a product packaging flaw.<br /><br />I will purchase these from the store in the future where I can check the bag, but never again online.

review/summary: Disorienting, but tasty!
review/text: I've had sweet potato fries before, and they really are delicious where I had them, so I wanted to give these a shot. From the first bite I'm pretty sure I got a hilarious look of astonishment on my face. It's like nothing I ever tasted before--weird, but quite good, which is about how I felt when I first bit into a properly ripe mango. Definitely the spices are unique when balanced with the sweet potato flavor. I think I tasted some garlic, but I know there's a very faint smidgeon of cayenne, and the cilantro was noticeable as well, but no one flavor or spice overwhelms the others, which is good.<br /><br />If you like any sort of spiced potato chips, like mesquite barbecue or jalapeno or the buffalo ranch doritos, I'd give these babies a try. They're healthy and you might find a nice occasional alternative to the not-so-healthy stuff. Hey, if it tastes good, why not? One thing these chips prove is that not all "health food" has to taste bland or nasty. Sort of like spelt bread and Newman's ginger cookies, and Izze's luscious pear soda. Terra's spiced sweet potato chips have a surprising flavor and are probably not for everyone, but if you like the spicy kind of regular chips, pick up a bag of these somewhere--they'll probably be just your sort of thing.

I will have to complain to the manufacturer if that is the case!

review/summary: Excellent Idea, but...
review/text: First, the lack of enthusiasm for this product has nothing to do with it's quality.  Not only are Shirataki products by "Miracle Noodle" good quality but an excellent product if you are counting carbs or calories.  My only problem is with the form of the "Rice"... it tastes and cooks up just fine but it really isn't a substitution for rice, it's texture and size are more akin to small pasta balls the size of peppercorns... (think Spetzle or Acini de Pepe) ((sp?))...<br /><br />Actually, the first thing I thought about when I cooked up my first batch was that they were slightly smaller versions of the tanslucent "Bubbles" that people seem to like to put in their iced tea and coffee drinks nowadays... (which in turn, remind me of little round gummy candies with no taste.)<br /><br />Shirataki noodles are an EXCELLENT no-cal/no-carb substitute for pasta... but if you are thinking that you're going to get anything like a "rice" substitute... I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you...  just go ahead and get the noodles.<br /><br />BTW.. the Miracle brand of Shirataki products are the lowest in Calories and Carbs that I have found but if you want something with just a couple more calories and only about 3-4 grams of carbs, you might want to try one of the shiritaki noodles out there that have tofu in them, they taste "hardier" and are much more like eating true pasta... I believe you can also get that type here at Amazon.com but, if not, you can normally get them at your local asian food store as well.

I just rinse it for a couple of minutes in a strainer under cold running water and put them straight into a skillet of browned minced turkey or chicken that's been pre-seasoned. I cook it all together long enough for the flavors to mingle and any extra fluid to be cooked off it...delicious! I only wish it didn't sell out as fast as it does and that it was more available than it is.

review/summary: Excellent if you know how to cook it! Great for Arroz con Pollo
review/text: I found these to be great if you know how to prepare them. First get a strainer and wash them with cold water, let the cold water run and run until must of the smell is gone.<br />I prepare a Puerto Rican "arroz con pollo" (rice with chicken) dish using these and it comes out very good almost as good as the real thing ;)<br />Here is the recipe,<br />2 bags Miracle rice(1 bag per person)<br />1 pack, chicken tights,4-6 pieces(no skin no bones)(Chicken breast drys out)<br />1/2 cup cut onions<br />Oregano powder 1/4 tsp<br />Lemon pepper or regular pepper (about 1/4 tsp)<br />1-2 chopped garlic or 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br />olive oil (1 tablespoon)(optional)<br />Red wine vinegar (or any other kind) 1 teaspoon<br />For color;use one envelope of Cilantro-Achiote Sazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B0ZEZE">Goya Sazon Cilantro-Achiote Seasoning</a><br />or 1/2 cup tomato sauce.<br />*3/4 to 1 cup water (or use 6oz of beer and 2oz water)<br /><br />If available use 1 tablespoon of adobo(replaces the pepper and garlic powder)for more authentic flavor.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TA9MDQ">Goya Adobo All Purpose Seasoning, 8 Ounces</a> you can buy it cheaper at many store that sells Latin products.<br /><br />Wash well and cut the chicken in small pieces, season with the vinegar, adobo or garlic powder, pepper and oregano powder, set aside.<br />Add the Olive oil garlic and the onions to the pot at medium heat, after a minute, add the chicken and cover in medium heat.<br />Cook in medium for about 8-10 mins, add *water (or beer)and cook uncover and let it boil for about 3-5 mins.<br />Meanwhile wash the miracle rice in a strainer under cold water, drain it.<br />Add the Miracle rice to the chicken and the seasoning packages, mix it well and let it cook uncovered for about 15-20 minutes or until water is evaporated. (sometimes I drain some of the water since I put extra when cooking the chicken)<br />For more flavor, add a little envelope or cube of Ham flavoring<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQOSQE">Goya Concentrated Ham Flavoring, 8-Count Packages (Pack of 36)</a>or chicken <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SW1FYK">Goya Cubito En Polvo Pollo/Tomate, 2.15-Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />Try it, it taste great! You can also follow the recipe and use pork, or canned garbanzo beans, pigeon peas or beans, instead of chicken.

review/summary: Few simple steps give you a nice substitute
review/text: I am surprised to see people ordering the UNUSUAL product and expecting to use USUAL ways to prepare it.  Also expecting the USUAL taste, texture, smell, etc.,<br /><br />First - if one just follows directions and rinses WELL, then dries the product (rice, or pasta, I've used both) - the smell is gone and texture is not bad at all.<br /><br />When drying - I don't mean paper towel drying - throw it on the non-stick pan and dry on low heat until most of the moisture is gone.<br /><br />After that - use with either "dessert" type of concoction ( I often use it with Almond Milk and a few drops of stevia, or Coconut Kefir and a few drops of stevia) OR with the "main dish" type of foods like ground turkey and/or stir-fried veggies.<br /><br />It then works as a filler, much like Tofu - tasteless and blends with the food you prepare it with.  And just like Tofu - does not taste good on it's own.<br /><br />Another good thing is that Glucomannan (that what those products are made out of) is good for one's digestion - being a soluble fiber that we all need and don't get enough in our regular diets.  Keeps you regular :-)

review/summary: So Happy This Product Exists!
review/text: Miracle Rice is amazing! I added it to chicken vegetable soup, and also created a delicious dish of ground beef, fresh basil, garlic, onion and the rice. The rice really doesn't have any flavor at all - it just adds volume to your dish, making it more filling, but still with a very light consistency. Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture - in my opinion, less like rice and more like little pearls, or Israeli cous cous - not chewy at all, just blends lightly and beautifully into your dish.  It's so easy to imagine many recipes to which the rice could be added to increase volume guilt-free, without adding any calories or fat.  This is truly a miracle product!

review/summary: These are terrific if you know how to cook them...
review/text: The secret to making any of these miracle noodle or no-oodle products edible and actually good is to DRY FRY them. They will smell VERY strongly of fish when you open them, but after a good rinse of cold water in a colander, the smell goes away. After they are rinsed, all you have to do is put them in a heated skillet and cook off the extra moisture,about 2-3 min. Then, add whatever sauce or ingredients you want. I have had the best success with mixing in some teriyaki marinade, grilled beef, and broccoli. It was truly delicious. I tried them plain and then with some beef broth and really did not enjoy them, so keep experimenting until you find what works best for you. But definitely dry fry them and it will improve the texture and be a nice treat if you are avoiding carbs and calories.

review/summary: Good Rice Substitute
review/text: Actually this is more like couscous, or risotto than rice. It has a softer, more pasta-like texture. But it fills the empty spaces left when you're trying to give up, or cut down on, rice. Like the noodles, this has an odor when you open the package, but a good rinse, quick par-boil, blot with a paper towel and you're set. Also, like the noodles, it has no flavor of its own, so it goes with anything. You do need to use something like a screen, instead of a regular colander, when rinsing and/or draining, otherwise you'll lose it through the holes :-)

Very, very good.<br />Microwave your main dish, rinse the rice and add to hot entree.<br />Also tried it with baked greek chicken. A little homemade gravy. Or package if you can't cook. It was excellent.<br />Let your dish sit for a few minutes before eating. This gives time for the rice or noodles to blend with the sauce.<br />I had a little mixup with the shipping and this company couldn't have been more helpful.<br />I would highly recommend this product.

While they do not contain any flavor, they really do take on the taste of the foods they are cooked with.  Make sure to rinse them very, very, very well before adding them to your meal.  I have found the "rice" is a great addition to soups, especially chicken soup.  I made the mistake of freezing my soup twice and thawing them in the microwave.  Both the noodles and rice shriveled up and looked really weird.  Haven't tried to freeze/thaw again.  Make everything fresh.  These aren't bad and I think I will incorporate them into my everyday cooking for my family when the diet is finished.  :)

review/summary: Gotta be creative
review/text: I would not recommend eating this alone.  But be creative.  To me it tasted like rice.  Here's what I did.  I am on the HCG diet and the way I prepare it did not interfere with my weight loss.  But see for yourself.  Everyone's body is different.  But it should work like a charm on any other weight loss program. I made miracle rice in a way that it really tastes good once you put out of your mind how it is packaged and smells before rinsing. I rinsed two packages and put it in a container with one can of 99% fat free chicken broth (that's what I had). Then I sauteed and lightly seasoned onions (in PAM and later added water to make tender since I was not using oil) and put it in the broth-"rice" mixture. Seasoned the mixture just a little with a non salt seasoning. I am really enjoying it. It isn't salty and tastes just like chicken soup with rice. It would be funny if someone else thought of this already. It's so simple I am sure someone did. But my hunger and curiosity kind of brought out some culinary creativity. I think half of this is was only 10-15 calories with the broth and the onions.

review/summary: Great way to cut calories!
review/text: I have tried the "linguini style" but prefer the "rice" shaped Miracle Noodle. Since they have zero calories it cuts the total in any dish we substitute them in for rice. They don't need as much moisture as rice does, so we had to get used to changing that in the recipes, but we don't really lose any taste, even if the dish ends up a little soupy. My favorite is Spicy South West Chicken. We usually have that a couple times a month at least, so I got on the auto ship for Miracle Noodles from Amazon.com. Just remember to blanch the noodles with boiling water to rinse off the fluid they are packaged in, then let them "dry" out a little while on some paper towels. That way they can absorb more flavor when you add them to the recipe.

review/summary: Rice? okay...
review/text: Shirataki style noodles are always sold wet. I suspect they shrivel up to nothing if you tried to dry them. The extra water gives them body. Do not try to use this in any recipe that calls for loose, cooked-but-fairly-dry rice: pilafs, fried rice, just a simple side of rice. You want to use these where they will work wet, and where you have a flavor to add to mask any lingering flavor from the packaging water. Soups would be ideal, or served with/under a stew. The linguine shape worked pretty well for a Cincinnati chili 3-way.<br /><br />In general, I recommend to anyone who has never tried shiratake noodles before to buy one package, not a case of 6. We bought a case, and ended up throwing most of them away because the smell from the packaging was so off-putting we couldn't bring ourselves to use the noodles. Yes, the smell rinses away, but can you get past that to use them?

review/summary: This IS a Miracle!
review/text: I was skeptical about this but tried it anyway. I was more than pleased with the results. I did not go into this thinking it would be just like rice. I was open-minded and took it for what it was. I used it in stuffed green peppers just as I would have used rice. The results were amazing! It worked quite well as the filler that regular rice would have, but no carbs! I followed the recipe exactly but replaced the regular rice for Miracle Rice. My husband made a small pot of regular rice to add to his, but it wasn't necessary. I'm going to try it next in stuffed cabbage rolls.  I guess if you're a really big rice lover, this may not work as well for you, but if your looking for a really great substitute, this works great. If you think this will be just like regular rice, you will be disappointed, but when you consider the advantages, it's worth the difference.  I'm just so happy to find something I can use instead of rice in my recipes!

review/text: To the previous poster, Doomspore:<br /><br />I love your idea of adding it to other dishes to bulk up a meal for zero additional calories. Brilliant!<br /><br />I think the rice is great. It's kind of funny to read about the people who are disappointed that it doesn't have a rice-like texture. Hello? It's the same stuff as the rubbery noodles, only in a different shape....a shape that makes it more versatile.<br />It has no flavor and the smell leaves after you rinse well and give it a short bath in boiling water. The directions say to dry it on paper towels, but I opted to give it a quick saute in a non-stick pan to evaporate the extra moisture. In my mind it seemed easier than trying to deal with removing little rubbery bits from the paper towels.<br />This stuff is not for everyone, but for those of us who are trying to reduce our carb/calorie intake and who are willing to incorporate some unusual foods in that pursuit, it's a wonderful option.<br />And for other carb-conscious folks, take a look at CarbQuik. It's a low carb substitute for BisQuick. Compare prices online first.

review/text: I have been using Miracle noodles for a while now. What I discovered was that if you want a true rice substitute, get the Orzo..I think they only sell it as part of their variety pack or if you buy directly from them, they have a special "members" area where you can find the orzo. It is amazing..I often take it with me to the Chinese restaurant..I order vegetables and mix it with the orzo..it has th same shape as rice and for some reason, it's texture is closer as well..I wish they just made and sold orzo for general sale..but they don't and they keep it a secret. I would write to them and encourage them to make the ORZO available to everyone, just like the noodles. I am a diabetic and eating whole wheat and whole grain is not an answer for me as it drives my sugar up..but not these little miracles..whether it is the pasta or the orzo, it hits the spot and keeps my numbers low, while I enjoy what I am eating without any guilt.

They absorb any flavor you put with them so that adds a plus as well.  Just couldn't give a full 4 or 5 stars because of the difficulty to drain and dry

review/text: Ok, I first tried the spinach miracle noodles. They were gross, nasty, disgusting, smelly, tasted horrible, and made me queasy just looking at them. However, I am on a VERY strict diet for health reasons and I knew I had to try something to fulfill this carb crave I get.<br />So I VERY reluctantly tried miracle rice. Believe me, I did not have high hopes for it. I rinsed it like a mad lady though I didn't get that overwhelmingly fishy odor even when I opened the bag like what was there with the spinach miracle noodles. Then I cooked the rice in the same broth that I cooked my vegetables and shrimp in. Oh dear Lord above, this was probably the best meal I've had since being on this diet! I didn't feel like I was suffering in the least, I didn't feel jipped, I felt as if I were eating an actual bisque.<br />Yes, the texture is different from normal rice. However I LOVE rice (all versions), I dream of rice, I love sushi, I love fried rice, you get the idea. I'm a foodie and one of my greatest craves is rice. This product made me feel like I were having actual rice. The texture I could get over. It wasn't sickeningly rubbery like the spinach miracle noodles. I think I'll have nightmares about those for the rest of my life!<br />I very highly recommend trying the miracle rice. I'd still rinse it more than what the directions say to just because that nasty spinach version haunts me. (And I like spinach!)<br />Next, I'm trying this product cooked in low-sodium chicken broth to use as a side for a nice yummy fillet of rockfish. Nothing goes better with fish than rice if you ask me. Hopefully this will work just as amazingly in this preparation as in the bisque. I will try to remember to post how it goes.<br />But let's just say I'm ordering a whole lot more of this rice. It is AWESOME!!!!!

I like to buy frozen diet dinner and mix whatever I got with an equal or slightly less portion of Miracle rice, and voila! Twice as much food for the same amount of calories, more filling!

review/summary: Weird but neat!
review/text: This rice has the consistency of tapioca pudding, minus the pudding. To taste the true flavor of it, I prepared it according to the directions and tried it as-is, without anything added. It tasted 'neutral' to me. I ate the whole cup I made as it came right out of the package. It reminded me of eating only the small pasta balls you see in Italian Wedding Style soup that Progresso makes. Totally versatile, you could add anything to it to make it more interesting if you wish, however eating it as-is wasn't a problem for me! I also tried the noodles as well, same experience. I will make sure to purchase more of these!!

review/summary: when you are starved for rice these are great
review/text: When I say "starved" for rice, I am talking about people like me, diabetics for whom rice is like eating candy: ie: your blood sugar goes way, way up. So, no rice, it is a big no, no. So now I have lost 25 lbs on low to no carb. I no longer need insulin unless I eat carbs. But sometimes one wants this type of food. So, I finally tried these things and I say yes, yes, yes! They are great! They can be a comfort food that gives you your cake and you can eat it too. They are easy to prepare and I initially made a risotto with cheese. It was great, easy to make. I never did smell a fishy or other odor and they went down well without either a chewy or gelatinous texture despite the gelatinous look. They make a great mac and cheese substitute without the backlash that eating carbs give you. They arrived promptly and without damage in secure packaging. I will be eating these frequently and will now send away for and try the noodles.

review/summary: Works just as advertised.
review/text: I just received my order of Shirataki noodles, and added a package to my red beans and rice Nutrisystem meal which is similar to a heathy choice frozen dinner you'd find in the grocery store. When I first opened the package I noticed a hint of a "fishy" smell, and thought "uh-oh" because I hate fish. However once I rinsed the product, and added it to boiling water for one minute as per directions, the smell was gone, and I mean GONE, or I wouldn't have been able to eat them. The "noodles" had absolutely no flavor, and only added volume to the meal which made it felt like I was eating more food than I actually was. And no carbs???  amazing!! I love them, and can't wait to try a package in a soup recipe.

review/summary: Finally found something low carb to use as rice
review/text: Is it rice?  of course not, or it would be full of carbs, but it sure is a great low carb substitute!  It was so nice to have a meal that was more than meat.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and rinsed in a wire mesh strainer for several minutes. While it rinsed I browned some ground beef, drained fat, and added the "rice". Let it fry a minute or two and stirred in a heaping tablespoon of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E5IC3E">Goya Sofrito Tomato Cooking Base Sauce 12 Ounces (1 unit)</a>  with a can of drained chopped tomatoes. Then I cooked a few minutes stiring often.  I made sure to let it sit about 5 minutes before serving to allow flavor to absorb.  It was wonderful! My family wanted my dish instead of the real stuff I cooked them.

One bag is just enough for one adult portion size, so that equals to $3.00 per serving...for NOODLES!If it were packaged differently, with less water and more noodles, I might be tempted to buy these again, but I feel like I got scammed....big time!<br /><br />As for taste, it tastes like nothing, and is kind of like the Asian Tapioca balls that you get in drinks! They are tiny, though.<br /><br />In addition, one of the bags was leaking and smelled horrendous, so I was unable to eat it!

review/text: Yes, shirataki noodles are an acquired taste, even though properly rinsed they have no flavor of their own. No, they are not like pasta, but there is no good true low carb pasta for everyone (Some people find that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018Q1G94">Dreamfields Spaghetti</a> spikes their blood sugar or breaks ketosis, even in a 2 oz portion size). I'd rather eat Miracle Noodles and not have to worry about it. Shirataki act much like rice noodles and are best suited to asian dishes, or recipes specifically developed around shirataki noodles. I've found the rice shape to be the most versatile, so that is what I buy.

review/text: I admit when I first open these noodles the smell is a bit fishy.  I don't like fishy whatsoever, so I was relieved when I found a warm water rinse cures the noodles of their "BO". I saute these noodles using a bit of parmesan cheese to give them a bit more body, and throw in bits of lettuce or cabbage, small chunks of pork and a bit of sauce.  It's more filling than the meat and veggies alone, it absorbs the flavors very well and it is very low carb and low calorie.  The texture is nothing like rice, but I didn't find it hard to get used to.  Though you can get used to anything if the right bikini is hanging on your closet door!

In fact, I usually boil them for a little over a minute to make sure all of the smell is gone.<br /><br />Using chicken stock makes a BIG difference in flavor. The noodles will soak up the stock and taste delicious.

review/text: This product was featured in our local newspaper along with a recipe for Jambalaya so I thought I'd give it a try.  The article said you would probably have to buy it online so I ordered the 6 pack from Amazon.  As others have said the stuff comes in pouches packed in liquid.  "Rice" packed in liquid, that's a little strange but the worst part is the God awful smell when you open the bag.  I mean WHAT is this stuff packed in?? It's GROSS!  I rinsed it forever in the hopes of getting rid of the smell, but never could completely.  The finished Jambalaya turned out "OK".  This product is similar to pearled barley in size, taste and texture so I think I'll continue to use that in recipes as my rice/noodle replacement.  I don't think I can eat the other 4 packs and deal with that smell again!!

review/summary: Not Real Rice, But Very Nice
review/text: I bought this product after reading many reviews. I realized that I don't always agree with all reviews, so I had to try it for myself.<br /><br />Does this product replace rice?  Not in flavor, but in how I use rice.  It actually seems more like couscous, risotto, or mini boba pearls.  As long as you rinse it well with cold water, then boil it in a big pot of water, you can use it freely.  I chop and stir fry onion, celery, mushrooms, cilantro, and garlic with  ground turkey and spices, then I toss in the hot "Miracle Rice."  Yummy...<br /><br />"Miracle Rice" is fun to use, especially if you like to experiment with recipes like I do.  I made a tabbouleh-like salad with it, and I even made spicy Thai salad with it.  It is great to use hot or cold, but never forget to rinse and boil it first, and remember that the more flavorful and spicy your meal is, the better the "Miracle Rice" will absorb the flavor.<br /><br />The best thing about "Miracle Rice" is that it bulks up your meals as a "carb-substitute," so you don't feel so deprived when you are dieting.<br /><br />My next experiment is going to be to try to make a low-calorie dessert using "Miracle Rice."  Good luck with your own kitchen experiments.

review/text: Having tried Miracle Noodles previously, I knew what to expect when I opened the package (horrible smell which dissipates with vigorous rinsing; Klingon-looking food-substance floating in clear liquid). However, the "noodle" varieties look and behave like noodles once you have prepared them. The "rice" resembles tapioca in shape and texture. It still absorbs the flavor of whatever sauce is applied to it, but in no way shape or form did it feel like rice when I was eating it.

review/summary: angel hair
review/text: Being on a low carb diet, I was anxious to try these "miracle noodles", so I ordered 10 pkgs of the angel hair pasta. Upon opening my first package, I realized that 1/2 of the "7 oz" was the watery solution they were packed in.. meaning that one whole package would feed only one adult... we might say expensive to feed two, or three people.  I followed the directions to a "T" to remove the fishy odor, and to dry them out before adding my low carb marinara sauce. I also TRIED to cut the noodles in half to shorten their length, and to try and unglue the tangled mess, which was almost impossible to do!  After my first bite.. I was pulling these jelly noodles from inbetween my teeth, but worst of all..... I found them almost impossible to swallow, as they stuck to the back of my throat like jellied rubberbands.  I had no problem with them being tasteless, but the amount of time you have to spend rinsing, drying, sauteeing (to dry out more), the fact they are a tangled mess of glob, then to almost choke when trying to swallow them is just too much!  I MAY give the "rice" noodles a chance, but I'll never buy the angel hair again.  I had to throw the rest away because my husband couldn't chew, or swallow them well either.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055DXIPG">Shirataki Miracle Noodles -Angel Hair (198g) No Carbs!

Still way to much sodium there, but I was just testing them out. They were just ok. I could tell they weren't real noodles. It was a texture thing. I haven't given up on them though. I still plan on trying some of the recipes out from the web site. I also plan to try some of my own recipes out using them in place of other types of noodles. Slightly expensive at Two dollars average for a seven ounce bag. But what diet food is cheap? I even decided to buy the rice noodles and want to give them a try as well. Will get back to you on my final opinion.

review/summary: A Good Alternative to Rice
review/text: In general, I am a meat and potatoes man. I do not like a lot of vegetables, so for my side dishes I've always eaten things like potatoes, rice, or macaroni. This made things very complicated for me when I was diagnosed with diabetes. I tried the pasta alternatives (such as Dreamfields), but still got glucose spikes with them. I also tried using cauliflower as a rice substitute, but couldn't get past the taste. I was therefore not very optimistic when I placed my first order for Miracle Rice.<br /><br />Upon opening the package, I did notice the fish smell that other reviewers had described. I rinsed the rice in cool water for about 15 seconds, then boiled it in a pot of water for about a minute. I drained the rice, then spiced it up with kosher salt, pepper, and a dash of Old Bay. I sauteed some venison tenderloins and made some brown gravy from a package.<br /><br />The end result was a pleasant surprise. The texture was quite different from real rice; there was very little chewing involved. The Miracle Rice did indeed take on the taste of the spices and gravy, and was an acceptable substitute for the real thing. It's a little slimy, and loses heat pretty quickly, but is definitely edible. I will certainly order it again, and am glad to have an alternative for rice that is at least mildly reminiscent of the real thing.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like much but smells bad
review/text: Miracle Rice doesn't taste like much. However, when I opened the bag I was overwhelmed with the bad smell of the product. It smelled like my cat when he has bad fishy breath then licks his dirty fur in an attempt to clean it. Rinsing the product as instructed on the bag didn't help the smell. Blanching the product like instructed on the bag didn't help either. My husband, not knowing I was cooking anything or had any food open, walked into the kitchen and asked, "Why does it smell fishy in here?" I won't order this again because I can't get past the smell.

review/summary: NOT WHAT I REMEMBER
review/text: I used this product a couple of years ago when I was on a diet.I really did enjoy it .So when I needed to loose weight again I ordered some more.The only thing I can think of that is different this time is I had been dieting about 3 months when I ordered them and I must have been extremely hungry or maybe my digestive system is just not as good(I am almost 61).They seemed to have stuck in my throat for about a 1/2 hour.They did not taste like a food at all.Maybe I need to diet a few weeks and try them again.Maybe then I will be hungry enough to appreciate them.

review/summary: Excellent Low Calorie Substute for Rice
review/text: When you are on a strict diet it is great to get a bit of bulk that appears to be real.  I use it with a Gumbo.  Be sure to drain all the packing fluids and rinse well before boiling in a large amount of salted water.

review/summary: You're kidding right!!
review/text: These are the nastiest things I have ever tried. I would rather do without than eat these noodles. I don't understand how anyone can think they are even a least bit good. When you open them they stink like fish, you have to rinse them well to get the smell off. Don't waste your money - They are miracle noodles all right - a miracle if you can eat them! really they are gross!

review/summary: I was so excited but then.....
review/text: I was so excited about these "Miracle" Noodles and Rice. I order them both. I have been on a no or low carb diet for 6 months now and was ready to try these in hopes that someone finally found the answer to the cravings of a diabetic.  But alas.. this has not yet happened. despite the reviews about the really bad fish smell ( which I did not experience) and the Texture (which I found utterly disgusting) I ordered them anyway feeling that everyone is different and I had to find out for myself... Really....I mean really? is someone out there really enjoying these disgusting things? I can eat ANYTHING.,. that is part of the reason I am having the problems I am having.... But really.. all I can say is that if someone is promoting these things.. they must have stock in this company... BAD is an understatement.....!

review/summary: They made me sick!
review/text: These literally made me sick.  First, when you open the package you have to drain off the water, which is fine except that once you do the whole thing has the faint scent of fish.  I guess that's not so bad if you like fish, but I don't. (2) Then you have to put them in a pan full of water and boil them for about 1 minute.  What you come up with are these small little pearls that essentially smell fishy and taste like nothing at all unless maybe its pearls of tasteless rubber.  I tried butter and salt, the flavoring from ramen noodles, spaghetti sauce, velveeta for mac and cheese.  Nothing made the consistency of these little pearls any better.  In essence it feels like you are taking a mouthful of big metamucil (which makes me gag anyway).  But beyond that, after I ate the smallest amount of them, they made my stomach cramp and I was nauseated for the rest of the evening.  At first I thought it was just a quirky thing, but I tried something else on them to see if it made them better and I got even sicker.  At that point I was done.  Yeuck.  A waste of money.  I'm going to try the kind mixed with tofu and if they stink as bad as these, or make me sick then I'm done, if I don't end up in the hospital with some gastric illness.

review/summary: I love it
review/text: I really enjoy this product.  I have been adding it to all kinds of things, eggs, meat, tuna, etc.  The texture was a little different at first, but once I started using it regularly, I just love it.  And I am not hungry constantly.  I use it to compliment my portion controled meals and I am slowly losing each week.  This product and the angel hair pasta has jump started my weight loss program again. So glad I found it.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: I am on a moderately low carb diet and tried the shirataki rice.  If you are expecting anything close to actual rice you will be sorely disappointed.  I found these things (they taste like little bitty round pellets of fat) to be barely palatable.  I haven't tried the noodles yet but I can say the shirataki rice is not a good substitute for actual rice.  I wish it was, but it's not.
