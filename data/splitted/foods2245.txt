review/summary: Wow!
review/text: This is a new favorite of mine. The flavor is light with no tannic after taste. It is brewed as a black tea. The color is a light golden color.  I like my teas sweet and I usually brew this with a mixture of honey and raw cane sugar. So far I have only drank it hot, but I may venture trying to make a pitcher of iced tea here soon.  I liked it so much that when I saw that Amazon was down to just two bags without the usual more on the way message, I ordered one more bag of the stuff. On Davidsons site this is almost twice as much for the same 16 oz. bag.  Just a note due to the loose long leaf style of this tea the bag is 50% larger than normal Davidson teas.  Really recommended if the taste of stronger tannic tasting tea is a turn off.

review/summary: A terrible disappointment...
review/text: A bisque is defined as "a thick cream soup made from shellfish."  While this soup understandably lacks the shellfish (it's salmon after all), it also inexplicably lacks cream!  It's got milk and vegetable oil (which predominates) instead, and it is not a concentrate!  What a disappointment in taste, especially as we are fans of Bar Harbor's delicious chowders (salmon and clam... haven't tried the lobster).  Pass on this if you know what a bisque should taste like.

review/summary: Tastes okay but...
review/text: I actually liked the taste and texture as they were pleasant.  But I warn you that it's exactly what the ingredients list says: tapioca thickened water and milk with a touch of salmon.  Fishy taste, not much salmon, lots of thickening.  Way too expensive for what you get so I won't repurchase but it's edible so we'll finish it.

review/summary: Big hit with the dog, great for partial feeding...
review/text: I bought these on sale and was hoping my dog would like them as much as he does the stella and chewy's freeze-dried. He absolutely does. And I love freeze-dried raw too, b/c the ingredients are all natural, less processed, teriffic ingredients and always a huge hit with the pup.<br /><br />I feed them re-hydrated, which imo is the only way to feed when as part of a meal(as opposed to tiny bits at a time for treats). I can't remember if it says it on the Nutrisca packaging, but on Stella and Chewy's packaging they make a point to write: "Your pet should consume 1/4 cup of water per patty daily". So it's easier for me to rehydrate so that my dog can start to get the amount of extra water he will need (does that make sense? lol). I just put a couple (my dog is 8lbs) in a bowl, fill with water, wait 1 or 2 mins then take them out and break them up and put them in his dish. My dog dives in then seconds later looks to me for more. They must be yum yum yum indeed.<br /><br />Anyway, of course i would not feed my dog these freeze dried dinner bites for his complete diet, they're just too expensive for that, but i do make a point to make his diet about 20+% raw, whether that is freeze-dried, air-dried (like Ziwipeak) or frozen raw. This way he gets some less processed food in his diet complete with the meat, bone and organs that is part of a dog's ancestrial diet.<br /><br />The difference btwn these freeze-dried patties and S&C's is really minimal. The biggest difference is that the Dogswell take longer to rehydrate, so i think i like S&C better for that reason. Biggest difference ingredientwise that i can see are the priobiotics in S&C, and a slight difference in the protein to fat ratio. They're close enough that I would just purchase whichever is less expensive at the time.<br /><br />Nutrisca:<br />Chicken with Ground Bone, Chicken Liver, Apples, Chickpeas, Peas, Flaxseed, Chicory Root Extract, Cranberries, Salmon Oil (a Source of DHA), Dried Kelp, Potassium Chloride, Salt, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Mixed Tocopherols (Preservative, a Source of Vitamin E), Vitamin D3 Supplement. (40% cals from Protein, 30% cals from fat).<br /><br />S&C's:<br />Chicken Ground with Bone, Chicken Liver, Chicken Gizzard, Pumpkin Seed, Potassium Chloride, Organic Cranberries, Organic Spinach, Organic Broccoli, Organic Beets, Sodium Phosphate Monobasic, Organic Carrots, Organic Squash, Organic Apples, Organic Blueberries, Choline Chloride, Dried Pediococcus Acidilactici Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Bifidobacterium Longum Fermentation Product, Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Taurine, Tocopherols (Preservative), Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Iron Sulfate, Iron Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Copper Sulfate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Sulfate, Sodium Selenite, Manganese Proteinate, Thiamine Monohydrate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin B12 Supplement.

review/text: Our dog loves these. He is a 5 lb yorkie so one freeze dried disc is his whole breakfast.  For larger dogs, this food could become pricey.  For small dogs, a bag lasts a while.<br /><br />We feed break up the bites and feed them dry.  The bites crumble easily, however so far the bags we have purchased have not had many if any broken bites. Our dog eats the whole thing pretty quickly... and definitely likes them.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

There are no animal products listed in the ingredients, unlike the savory soy sauce flavor, which contains beef tallow.

review/summary: BEST Tasting Yakisoba Noodles
review/text: Spicy Veggie Yakisoba is simply has the BEST flavor of any variety I encountered from a box.  It is truly "spicy" but not overly so or too "hot".  Delicious!  It does need some soy sauce as not salty enough for my taste, but one can adjust that to their taste.<br /><br />Highly Recommend<br /><br />Note:  1 cup of water for the time indicated in a 1100 watt microwave oven does make noodles a bit overly mushy, I reduce by about 1/8 cup of water and reduce cooking time 30-45 sec. to get more firm noodles and is plenty of time to hydrate the veggies.

review/summary: Yummy noodles
review/text: These delicious noodle packs are only .89 cents a piece at my local grocery store. I can't stand Maruchan Ramen but I freaking love these! There's no broth like with you get with the soupy Ramen. It's turns into a sort of thick sauce after sitting for a minute which sounds gross, but trust me, it's truly the awesomesauce. It's got chunks of rehydrated veggies that are surprisingly tasty. I suggest the Spicy Vegetable, Roast Chicken and Cheddar Cheese varieties. If you're looking for filling lunch that's incredibly cheap and quite flavorful, you can't get much better than these delightful noodle packs.

review/summary: Great Taste, Great Deal
review/text: Out of all the varieties of Maruchan's Yakisoba lineup, I can honestly say that the Spicy Vegetable is my favorite. As others have mentioned, you may not need the whole packet of seasoning, as some people may find it a bit overwhelming. I've experimented a bit and as someone who enjoys spicy food it tastes great with the entire packet. Amazon's deal on this at the time I bought them ($5.67 for 8, or roughly 70 cents per package) made sense, as it's cheaper than buying them in the store and the shipping was free. All in all, this is a perfect buy for people like me who live on a budget, as the noodles are quite filling.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I hadn't eaten "instant noodles" in years and the TV commercials were enticing. Too enticing.  Some nutrition data would sure be useful on the Amazon screen.  Half the package is 250 calories so if you eat the whole thing you're in Big Mac territory.  The sodium content is off the chart for most of us and is the dominant flavor. It requires two flavor packet additions at different times during preparation. The final product just doesn't taste very good. After preparing one package I ditched the rest in the trash.  If possible, buy one at a time at the supermarket and find one you like before investing in a pack of 8.  And read the nutrition panel!

review/summary: Nice and quick
review/text: I'm a collage student that doesn't have a lot of time to prepare food for lunch in between classes, and Yakisoba is a quick and good tasting choice (wow, I sound like a star endorsing this). All you have to do is add water, put it in your microwave for 4 minutes, then mix in the seasoning. I usually don't use the whole bag, as if feels almost like I'm just pouring salt on noodles which doesn't seem very healthy. Sometimes there is access water, which soaks up the seasoning, so I drain out the water before the final step.<br /><br />As for the spicy vegetable flavor, it's not bad, though I prefer the spicy chicken flavor. Nether is too spicy and honestly, most maruchan yakisoba's taste the same. It also won't completely fill you up, but amount is still satisfying. Worth having every now and then, especially if you're strapped for time.

review/summary: SALTY DEAL
review/text: I love salt, pepper, yakisoba at a good price and this takes the cake.  You get a generous 3.79 ounce portion per instant tray and at a cost of about 75 cents per tray.  Very tasty and filling.  For those who don't like it as salty, do not use the entire flavor packet.  I would not pay more than a dollar for this so paying 75 cents makes this a quick cheap meal that you don't have to leave your home for.  The instructions (fill the tray with water up to the fill line and use 1000 watt microwave for 4 minutes) left my noodles still in a puddle of water and I like my Yakisoba dry so I stuck it back in the microwave for 1 more minute.  Now it is just a little wet, enough for me to mix the noodles and the flavor packet.  After mixing, it is basically dry.

review/text: Eating a pack as I type. Really awesome.  Most of the spicy varieties have a nasty chili powder that I don't like.  I would say this has more of a black pepper taste.  Reminds me of a rice noodle dish from an asian restaurant, at least in taste.<br /><br />Somehow this flavor tastes less salty, but I have not compared nutritional info.  It's a shame I can only find these on Amazon! Guess I'll be getting use out of my prime account.<br /><br />(I'm a law student, therefore fairly poor and on the go and a huge fan of non-perishable tasty foods)

You have to use only half or less of the powder seasoning though because the entire thing would be too much,( too much salt and too spicy.) Otherwise I plan on living off this flavor :). It even has little cabage and brocolli pieces. MUST Buy great for work!!

Also, it is not overly salty like regular shells & cheese or mac-n-cheese which is VERY NICE when you're trying to feed your toddler healthier options. What I DON'T like... once it is opened and you have to refrigerate it, the sauce becomes more runny. When you heat it up after it has been in the fridge, it turns into Shells & Cheese soup. NOT easy to feed your toddler!! If your little one can eat it all in one setting, it may be good for you. Otherwise, I'd pass on this purchase.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: My baby has serious allergies, and it's difficult to find microwaveable foods she can eat. We took a container to her allergy doctor and she okayed them for us. Tonight we tried them and lo and behold, she loved them. She ate the whole bowl, a first in her recent history. It's a pity that Gerber makes most of her products with carrots and sweet potatoes. We would have a greater choice if they didn't. However, we are willing to try more new foods in the near future. By the way, we microwaved the bowl but it did not become too runny like other reviewers said. It was the perfect texture and softness. I would even say it tasted better than Kraft's version. We all are very satisfied!

review/summary: Great quick meal, but it can't be reheated
review/text: These are great for a quick meal for our son, however they can't be reheated. Upon reheating these they turn to mush. My son seems to love the taste of these and thinks of them more as a treat than a normal meal :). I would buy these again, but if your child is not as hungry as you anticipated, count on throwing these out right away.

review/text: My 3 yr old son LOVES these. He asks for them all the time and they are very easy especially in a pinch (30 seconds!). I take them with us when we travel incase he decides he is on a hunger strike (he never refuses these) or when we will be out and about and can't get to a restaurant. I just zap it before we go and pack it up. It can't be put in the frige and reheated even though the package says so. It turns to liquid. I don't think it tastes like much, but he sure does!

Or you can get them online any number of places, including from Ghirardelli's, for $3.95 plus far more reasonable shipping charges.  I didn't think this kind of price gouging was even legal on Amazon! Wow!

Not worth the $ savings - I'll buy the equivilent in beechnut at a certain national chain for $1.06 per meal and have a long expiration over this.<br /><br />Be warned, you are gambling on expiration with these.

review/summary: Great supplement, super fast shipping!
review/text: Our Siamese cat has had countless problems from consuming some toxic chemicals (Xmas tree water) -  years ago, before we realized what he was doing. For years, he's had an assortment of problems, leading up to a general decline in health at the ripe old age of ten - and ten isn't old for a Siamese.  We've had him on 'gold-plated' cat food for years, which helped some, but not enough!<br /><br />SAMe has done the trick!<br /><br />Since putting him on this supplement, he's much more active and outgoing, besides losing some weight and not throwing up.<br /><br />What I like best about this supplement is that they've put the necessary supporting vitamins and Milk Thistle in with the SAMe, thereby preventing homocysteine buildup, providing better liver support, and getting most of the required nutritional supplements into one pill.<br /><br />Wish they had one for humans! :)  My SAMe is plain, so I have to buy and take extra other supplements.<br /><br />Thank you for this great supplement - and for getting it to me so fast!

The green tea has a slight, but not overwhelming, hint of fruit to it. It is exhilarating to drink. This is my favorite green tea hands down. For comparison, my next favorite would be Tazo's Zen, followed by Mighty Leaf. These tea bags are relatively pricey, but for the quality you are getting, it is well worth it.

review/summary: Taste great...look great...and perfect for a party!
review/text: I would politely disagree with the above reviewer- I bought each of the three Cobblestone cupcake varieties on a friend's recommendation, and am so glad that I did!<br /><br />I made these cupcakes for my girlfriend's baby shower, and everyone loved them- they were easy to make and were much higher quality than other gourmet brands I've tried. The cupcakes were very light and were the prefect size for a cocktail-like party. One suggestion I have would be to make double the amount of icing they recommend- The amount they suggest is sufficient to cover each cupcake, but I made double the icing so that I could pipe it on (...they ended up looking just like the high-end cupcakes you see in fancy shops.)<br /><br />These delightful cupcakes helped to make my party a success...and the packaging looks so pretty that you are not afraid to hide the box in the recycling bin!

review/summary: Inedible chemical flavor. Our guests unanimously agreed.
review/text: We purchased a three pack of chocolate caramel, strawberry vanilla, and lemon poppyseed because the package looked so attractive, and I thought it would save me some time. The flavors sounded very appealing.<br /><br />Reality couldn't be farther removed from the picture. The cupcakes were practically inedible. The chemical flavor of the additives was unbearable. I actually spit out the first bite I took of the chocolate caramel. I asked several guests to try a bite of all three flavors (because I wondered if there was something wrong with me. Couldn't imagine three flavors of such an attractive looking mix could be THAT gross), and not a single person liked them. I ended up throwing everything away, and having to buy something else in a hurry.<br /><br />Furthermore, I'm not someone who likes much frosting on cupcakes, but the package provided barely made enough to thinly cover the cupcakes. Very thinly. If you were to put as much frosting on your cupcake as is shown in the picture, about a third of your frosting would already be used up. This is probably a good thing, since the frosting had that horrible quality of coating the roof of your mouth in a layer of revolting grease that is hard to get rid of. (And I used strictly fresh ingredients that I had just bought, added according to the recipe.)<br /><br />What a waste of THREE packages of cupcake mix and fresh ingredients!!

review/summary: Glutino Yogurt Covered Pretzels - Gluten Free
review/text: Having recently gone to a gluten-free diet, I thought there were going to be several things I was going to have to learn to live without - a good pretzel being one of them.  I stumbled across these at the grocery store and thought I would give it a try.  These are a little pricey (what gluten-free product isn't?), but TOTALLY worth it!  The yogurt is smooth and the pretzel is crunchy and crisp (the way they should be) - a great taste together.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Best Flu Medication On Earth!
review/text: A friend gave me three boxes of this tea. Then one day I got the flu really bad, nothing helped that I took. I remembered that ginger is excellent for an upset stomach and I had the nausea feeling you get with the flu. So to get rid of the nausea, I drank a cup of this tea. Within a half hour I not only was rid of the nausea my whole well being was back to normal. I felt great!<br /><br />Just yesterday I was feeling sick, headache upset stomach aching I took 2 Advil that didn't touch my headache or the crummy feeling I was in. We were coming back from Orlando headed home a three hour drive! I could not wait to get home and drink my ginger tea. When I did within 30 minutes all my symptoms left!<br />I tell EVERYONE about this tea when they complain about flu like symptoms, I swear by it now!<br /><br />Keep it on hand!<br /><br />Debbie, in south Florida

review/summary: Has the right amount of sweetener...
review/text: Several weeks ago, I tried the unsweetened version to this instant ginger tea & loved it.  I was in a local food market looking to purchase more of the unsweetened tea when I found this.  I tried it for the first time a couple days ago and it works just the same! Only difference is I don't need to add any sugar.  This sweetened ginger tea has the perfect amount of sugar needed.  It's not too sweet nor too bland, it's just right!  Also, the strength of this tea is great just like the unsweetened version.  The strong flavor/taste of ginger definitely comes through.  My only wish is that Caribbean Dreams would put more sachets in the box!  I love to drink big cups of tea and 10 just isn't enough when I like to use 2 at a time.  I will continue to repurchase this or the unsweetened version, whichever I can find locally.  I prefer this much more than the ginger tea bags, so I'm willing to overlook the amount sold in the boxes.

review/summary: Best of the Sugar Free Cough Drops
review/text: When I have a cold, the slightest tingle of irritation in my throat can send me into a coughing fit. I have always depended on Hall's to help coat my throat and clear my head. With diabetics in the house it is necessary to have a cough drop without sugar. These sugar free Honey Lemon drops from Hall's are our favorite flavor. They have no nasty chemical taste. They sooth and coat the throat and the vapors really do a-lot to clear the sinuses. They come in resealable bags and stay fresh for many months. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Long lasting, and safer in my experience.
review/text: My dogs, and many of my client's dogs, inhale regular rawhides.  I was always worried about them swallowing big chunks.<br /><br />And I really hate flavored plastic bones, as well as veggie bones, since I've seen chunks of those being swallowed whole right in front of me a number of times.<br /><br />These have been by far the best solution for me.  It takes the dogs much longer to chew them, and they really have to work at it.  For all my medium to heavy chewers, these are my first choice.<br /><br />Having said that, nothing is 100% safe.  After chewing up most of the bone, a very food motivated chewer could the remaining hard chunk - which could be a serious problem.  That's why I tend to choose the bigger sizes (8" or 10") over the little ones (4"), and take the bone away when it gets to a swallow-able size.  I buy these in bulk.  The value compared to other types of rawhides is huge, even without a bulk discount.<br /><br />These come in flavors also.  This plain style, as well as the the chicken flavored ones, have not been messy at all.  The beef ones are not quite as tidy.

review/summary: Nasty aftertaste!
review/text: I have tried other Torani syrups, french vanilla, vanilla, vanilla bean, hazlenut...all of which I liked. This caramel syrup has a strong, chemically aftertaste and smell which can be somewhat diminished if you put it in REALLY strong coffee but even then lingers on very unpleasantly. Amazon was great they sent me out another 3-pack to see if it was just that batch.....Nope. It's definitely something off with this flavor. They refunded my money. I will continue to buy Torani, but not this caramel flavor.

review/summary: Not good at all.
review/text: After trying Torani's Vanilla and Cherry syrups and being very satisfied, thought that the Caramel would have to be good as well. WRONG! I have not found anything that it taste good in yet. It's awful on ice cream and yogurt, but I keep trying it in diffent drinks in hopes that there is something that it will be palatable in so that I don't have to throw three bottles away since Amazon will not refund this item. I know that taste is subjective, but honestly, I wish I could force feed this to those reviewers who convinced me that this stuff tasted good.<br /><br />Update and apology to those reviewers who rated the "plain" caramel syrup positively. After some research, discovered that there are two different Torani Caramel syrups: just "Caramel" and "Classic Caramel". The Classic Caramel is the one that Amazon is sending out to unsuspecting buyers and it tastes awful. Another reviewer has noted this in a different Torani review.

review/text: We use this syrup to make our own caramel mochas at home. The product is excellent and the price is right. We use it on desserts too (it's nice on ice cream with hot fudge) and a little goes a long way. The biggest negative is that the plastic bottles the syrup comes in have a wider mouth than our pour spigot that fits the glass bottles. We just transfer the syrup to the glass bottle we have. Since I'm not a big fan of plastic packaging, I'd like for this product to be available in glass bottles.

The Torani Syrups are wonderful, because they can be used for flavoring coffee, tea, even ice cream, and I get the full coffee house experience without leaving my home! Great...and really good, too.

review/text: I have tried other torani syrups and like them.  I have tried the DaVinci Caramel and love that.  I only tried this brand because it had a good price.  Now I cannot return it, and have wasted money.  There is no way I can use this.  It is absolutely disgusting!  I could not even drink the first cup that I made with this--it made me gag!  It does NOT taste like caramel at all!  It tastes like chemicals and has a spicy after-taste.  I will definitely be going back to using DaVinci.  Wish I had not wasted my money on this.

review/text: Wow. I am a bona fide junkie for Torani Caramel, but this trio of bottles has left a bad taste in my mouth. It is unlike any of the dozens of bottles I have enjoyed this flavor from. My coffee tasted like . . .scrap paper. I tried a glass instead of plastic cup. I tried vanilla soy milk, very vanilla soy milk, plain soy milk. Iced, hot, two pumps, four pumps, a swig straight from the bottle even! There is absolutely no conclusive info about this version of the product, and I find it hard to believe that Torani (which consistently produces a GREAT product)is totally behind this. So very disappointing.

This one has a very bad aftertaste and really makes my coffee unpleasant to drink.  Not sure I will be able to finish these because of the awful flavor.  I will not repurchase.

They carried only 3 flavors and I just knew I'd get a caramel one off amazon.<br />Buying the bottles off of here is a massive savings. I brought a tiny bottle for the same price as one of these 25oz guys!<br /><br />Please don't think that this syrup tastes like caramel topping. It's CLEAR!! And it's meant to flavor drinks. That being said, I love this stuff! I make a large latte for myself a few times a week and put a shot of this stuff in there and it tastes better than local franchises!<br /><br />I love that it's all natural and it doesn't have too much sugar. I'm using this stuff instead of sugar to sweeten and flavor my lattes from now on.
