review/summary: Love Fruit Snacks But...
review/text: I received these a few weeks ago and was so excited I couldn't wait but when I opened them I was so disappointed there were only 3 flavors-mixed fruit, grape & strawberry. What's going on do they repackage them or what the box stated there would be other flavors but there weren't.Still I ate them but was just disappointed that I didn't get all of the flavors.

review/summary: The snack that's good for you.
review/text: Like the commercial says: "If it comes from Welchs, it must be good for you."  These fruit snacks are delicious.  The serving size is just enough to take the edge off of hunger.  In addition, the package itself is small enough to fit in your pocket.  I just wish they wouldn't put so many concord grape flavors in.

review/text: I have always loved this product and was glad to subscribe so that I could have a constant supply on hand.  The smoky flavor and the lower salt content are very tasty.  The supplier keeps juggling the price and sometimes it's not available; I suspect we consumers are eating these poor fish faster than they can propagate. I'm very glad Amazon makes these available, buying them locally can be very expensive by comparison.

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: I spent quite some time researching the Kippered Snacks available to me online.  I went with this product because it had a lower sodium content, no added ingredients, and I was impressed with Crown Prince seafood company when I went to their website.  An added bonus, the price was very good... even better than some of the companies that added artificial ingredients and tons of salt.  Today, I tried my first can of these Kipper Snacks and was very pleased. I was afraid there would be bones because these weren't advertized as "boneless" like the Kipper Snacks I used to get.  But there was not a single bone, there was plenty of nourishing "fish juice" that the kipper was nestled in, and the taste was just as good as the kippers that are packed in tons of salt.  Also, the fish itself was firm, not soft and squishy like the other kippered snacks I was used to. Now I know I've made the right choice and will continue purchasing my Kipper Snacks from Crown Prince from now on.  Would highly recommend this brand to anyone!

review/summary: Reminiscent of Moroccan tea!
review/text: This refreshingly smooth decaf brew leads with spearmint flavor and scent with a trace of peppermint.  Decaf green tea provides pleasant robustness to the blend without being overpowering, as well as providing healthy antioxidants. Reminiscent of Moroccan tea. A favorite!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 5 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee. The level of antioxidants and information about them would be a good addition. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"No bird soars too high with his own wings."  William Blake

review/summary: The "Red" in Red Velvet Cakes!
review/text: I recently began baking Red Velvet cakes and was surprised at the cost and difficulty of locating and buying single bottles of red food coloring for the cakes.  These cakes take two TABLESPOONS of food coloring per batch and when the batch is doubled, as I frequently do in order to make a four layer cake, the food coloring was becoming very costly.  I was only able to find single small (I think 2 oz bottles) of McCormick in the stores.  Maybe there are other places to purchase larger bottles but I am not aware of them.  I also purchased a couple boxes of multi-color food coloring from the Grocery Outlet and just used the red.  This no name brand imparted a slightly unpleasant flavor to the cake.  I was hesitant place an order for such a large quantity of Durkee without first testing it in the cake.  My concerns, however, were unwarranted!  I've made several cakes and they have been great.  This is the BEST deal I have found for purchasing red food coloring and now I don't have to pay $3.00 for a small bottle from which I can only bake one cake.

review/summary: Hummingbird food dye
review/text: I bought a three-pack of 16-ounce containers. They are in plastic bottles with a flip-top, which I like, you can easily drip in a few drops of food coloring versus the tiny glass bottles from the market which get expensive fast when you're using this to mix up hummingbird food (1:4 sugar to water, so 1/4 cup for 1 cup of water, etc). I understand that the hummingbirds don't care about the red dye, but I like to see what the level in the feeder is. And it just looks good. This dye seems perfect for the job, and compared to the supermarket price for the red dye in the little glass bottle this was a STEAL.

review/summary: Broken caps
review/text: The packaging on this item was not sufficient as all three bottles arrived with broken caps, which is quite annoying as knocking one of these big bottles of red coloring over would make a huge mess. Once you remove the paper seal from the bottle top, there is nothing to keep the dye from seeping out of the cracked tops if the bottle gets knocked over. This item needs to be package with bubble wrap around it to prevent this from happening.

They're still just as filling if you need an afternoon pick-me-up, but not overly fattening as if you've eaten a Snicker's bar (250 calories).  Love these things, still same great taste after all these years. Highly recommend!

review/summary: Make Starbucks mochas at home!
review/text: I discovered this years ago when I was looking for a way to get my Starbucks mochas everyday, but cut the cost of getting them from an actual Starbucks store.  I brew my own espresso in my drip coffee maker (must be Starbucks brand to get close to the taste) and then make the same syrup they use in the stores using this powder.  I have the say that the taste is extremely close to the real deal.  There is something about coffee going through a $2000 machine that makes it taste awesome, however, if you are tired of paying $4.40 per mocha, get this and make at home for a fraction of that cost!

review/summary: Great Mocha Powder
review/text: I had been waiting and hoping for Starbucks Mocha Powder to be available again after disappearing from the shelves at the Starbucks coffee shops. It tastes just like I remember and it came promptly after I ordered it -- I ordered 2 cans to make sure I have it on hand for awhile. Thank you for carrying this well loved and missed product.

review/summary: Bleddie Okay at Best
review/text: I crave 'dried sausage' or droe wors as we call it in South Africa.<br />I usually order from AfricanHut.com. It costs about $9 dollars more per 1/2lb, but is well worth it.<br />I tried this company because of their affordable pricing.<br />I got 3 bags and it was kinda okay tasting but was a little too thick, and dry as a bone.<br />It needs more fat for flavor because it just tastes like vinegar! :(<br />This sausage needs work.<br /><br />It is not "Bleddie Lekker" yet, but is close.<br />Maybe ill try the biltong.<br /><br />WE NEED MORE ONLINE OPTIONS TO ORDER QUANTITY. IM HUNGRY!!

review/summary: Bledie lekker is a bit of an overstatement
review/text: I bought this droewors when I was craving a taste of home. The other products I bought were great but this wors isn't the best I've ever had. It's a little bit plastic tasting and leaves a sort of coating in your mouth. It's also rather thick; the wors I typically prefer is thinner. Bledie Lekker (which means bloody tasty) isn't the worst I've ever had but it's not my favorite and I'd probably try other brands before buying this one again.

review/summary: Sweet, Pungent, Adventurous
review/text: This mildly sweet, pleasantly pungent simmer sauce leaves a satisfying taste on the tongue long after you finish eating.  It's rich with chunks of savory vegetables, like onions and peppers, and it tastes of tomatoes and chilies without smacking of spaghetti or tacos.  As I cooked it, I watched the sauce permeate the chicken breast, which flaked nicely on my fork and almost dissolved in my mouth.  I recommend this for anyone who loves Indian food, anyone looking for a quick family meal that doesn't taste like it came from a box, and anyone who just likes inventive, adventurous cuisine.

review/text: I am becoming one of Goya's biggest fans. I had seen these on the shelves,<br />and they were really inexpensive, but I opted for a test can of Vienna<br />sausages instead. They were so good I went back the next day to get this<br />tin of sardines.<br /><br />They have a great sardine flavor, not fishy or oily at all, and the tomato<br />sauce is thick and rich. I am of the opinion that sardines make everything<br />taste better, and these go great just on a regular saltine. Great for snacks<br />or a pack lunch or road trips. I'll probably edit this review sometime in<br />the next month to give this product 5 stars cause I see addiction ahead. LOL

You do have to be careful because too many will cause diarrhea but I cut them small (when necessary) for my 8 lb Papillon and he can have quite a few before having any problem.  It does smell like liver so you won't want to carry them in your pocket without putting them in a plastic baggy.  Excellent for training!!!

Friends try the bars that I carry with me for when I need a little snack and they can't believe they are gluten free!  My 3 yr old grandson loves my granola bars and won't eat the ones his mom buys just for him.  The bags of cranberry maple nut granola are filled with nuts and sweet morsels that really fill you up.  I put a small handful on top of my yogurt and it keeps me filled up for a long while.

review/summary: Disappointed re:  Beer Nut Bar Mix
review/text: I was disappointed because it didn't taste like the Beer Nut Bar Mix<br /> I had at the Gale Street Inn in chicago, Illinois on Milwaukee Ave.<br /> I think theirs had beer nuts that were sweet or something.  Not sure<br />what problem is.  I was so looked forward to it because I couldn't<br />find them sold anyplace in town, so someone suggested Amazon.<br />Anyway,  I'm not sure what I did wrong because I called them the same<br />m<br />name that the bar had on theirs.  It wasn't in a jar but in a large<br />bag, I believe.

review/summary: A fun, delicious gum
review/text: This is one of my favorite candy items, and one I think is well purchased by anyone with a sweet tooth, any gum lover, or any one looking for a taste of the orient. Three of the flavors in the package: Peach, Mixed Fruit, and Green Apple are in a `brick' form. They are about 1 in X � in and are very soft and easy to chew. The remaining four flavors: Orange, Strawberry, Grape, and Melon all come in small boxes that contain four gumballs each.<br /><br />Each flavor is powerful without being overpowering. They have a smooth, almost creamy texture when chewed, and blow nice big bubbles. Also, they're not overly sweet, or grainy with sugar. My teeth are often sensitive if gum is too sugary, yet these offer no obstacles, only mouth appeal.<br /><br />I highly recommend this gum!

review/summary: Fun Gum for Kids and Adults
review/text: Living in the States, this was a fun thing to find a different Flavors of gum and the different textures!  I especially liked the Pokemon stuff.  Most of the other, I can find at local Asian Stores, since I live in a large Metro Area, but if you don't, you will find the flavors and shapes to be a nice "difference".  I recommend this for Christmas and other occasions, for the "under 15" set.

review/summary: The best ginger candies on the market! Sweet and SPICY!!
review/text: The Ginger chews by the Ginger People are my favorite candies of all time! These are the Ginger People's pure Ginger candies and they are of excellent quality. They are perfect if you like really spicy candies. These candies are similar to the "See's" brand Crystallized Ginger and I feel that the quality is about the same as "See's". Unlike the See's brand, these do not have a chocolate coating which is good if you don't really like chocolate.<br /><br />I love the spicy, chewy flavor. It's so hard to find delicious Ginger foods and candies (except online) and I'm so happy that Amazon started carrying these products by the Ginger people.<br /><br />These are great for nausea, too.<br /><br />Great for travel sickness, great for morning sickness, and just great taste when you want a really spicy candy. I love them! The pilots use them.<br /><br />Recommended! But if you don't want something SO spicy, I recommend that you start out with the Ginger People ginger chews first. If you like these, you can graduate up to the Crystallized ginger.

review/text: I've tried a bunch of brands, and this is the best - the most tender and fresh ginger available. Strangely, despite all the extra packaging (and waste), Amazon makes it cheaper to buy it this way then in the 5-pack of larger canisters ($7/lb versus $9.30). They should lower the canister prices!

This is hard to find and you will not be satisfied by other brands. Learn from my mistake and enjoy, but be sure to maintain a surplus. You won't forget twice.

review/summary: Very Good Product
review/text: This is by far the best crystallized ginger I've ever had. So many brands are a lot of sugar and not a lot of ginger, this ginger is the complete opposite. The pieces are bigger than the tiny crystallized ginger that I'm used to, a little smaller than a Starburst. It has sugar coating the outside, but not a lot. It's definitely more ginger and less sugar. It's soft and easy to chew, but still maintains some of the texture that fresh ginger has. It's very spicy and tastes incredible. This is a great price as well. I'm used to paying a lot more for an inferior product. I'll definitely be purchasing this again and again.

review/summary: Previous delight, recent disappointment
review/text: I have loved ginger since my father introduced me to it over fifty years ago.  I have tried many brands, and was delighted to find this ginger on Amazon.  I ordered it several times and was highly satisfied with it, finding it had excellent texture (many gingers sold in the US are hard lumps, but this has the proper ginger texture), bite (good sharp ginger flavor without an excessive bite), and sugaring.<br /><br />However, the last order I received was a disappointment. I have waited through about a dozen bags before posting this somewhat negative review, hoping the first few were just an anomaly, but sadly no.  The issue is that, while in all previous orders the ginger consisted almost entirely of bite sized chunks, this recent order is an almost equal mixture of those chunks and small to tiny sized pieces which, because they are sugared over their entire surface areas, give almost entirely a sugar taste with little ginger bite.  The bite sized chunks are still as good as before, but the other half of the bag is a great disappointment and not at all what I have been used to from this company.<br /><br />I don't know whether the company is having trouble getting enough quality ginger to fill their orders and is filling their bags out with scraps which I would have expected to be used for ground ginger, in ginger beverages, or otherwise than as crystallized bites; whether they have decided to fill their bags with these bits to keep their costs down; whether my order was simply filled from the bottom of the batch and the problem wasn't caught in time; or whether there is some other reason, but whether intentional or inadvertent, this is not the product I used to get and is not the quality product I think customers have a right to receive.<br /><br />When this order is exhausted I will probably try the product again, hoping that it has returned to its prior quality, but if not, sadly I will have to resume my search for a quality ginger to enjoy.

review/summary: Hot Damn, This Is GREAT!
review/text: I pondered buying this product for days because of mixed reviews, many concerning the size of the ginger. I feel for those people who got scraps, but in my 24-pack I received pretty uniform cubes of a VERY good size. This is, hands down, the best crystallized ginger I've ever had except for once... and that was home-made in Hong Kong.<br /><br />First, the chunks are just the right size to be tender and sweet without being too large to enjoy as a snack. The quality of the ginger is outstanding, with a deep, fresh flavor and just the right amount of sugar. The color is a light gold, and the texture lacks the fibrous strands of mature ginger that too much crystallized ginger is made from. So, they say baby ginger, and I can attest, it must be. Because of that, the flavor is strong without being an overpowering heat, but the heat is there. I'd place it on the mild end of the ginger spectrum, which works for me, but if you want fire this isn't for you. This is one of two crystallized gingers I'd recommend, and the other is the fiery one (Reed's), but this has the better overall flavor of ginger.<br /><br />This is definitely ginger for snacking; if you want to bake with this you could, but you'd definitely need to get busy with the knife-work. If you're looking for dried ginger, this isn't that either... this is fresh, tender, and sweet-heat ginger. For tea... I could see mashing a cube or two and making something pretty terrific, but I'd probably end up eating it straight. I'm gong to buy some of the baking cut (small nuggets) for ginger snaps now, because if they're using the same ginger it's going to be amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line: while it's possible that some people received a bad package with small pieces, in 24 packs I saw minimal variation in size, and nothing I'd describe as too large or small. This is fresh as hell, not too sugared, and the quality of the ginger is out of this world. If you like ginger, I'd find it hard to imagine not falling in love with this.

review/summary: Great for Upset Stomach
review/text: The other five-star reviews have said it all.  This is an absolutely fabulous product.  I just want to emphasize that it is also very good if you have an upset stomach.  I suffer from chronic stomach issues, and I've tried a number of different brands/types of crystallized ginger (including the flat pieces that kind of look like orange wedges). Nothing works like the Ginger People.  (In fact, the flat pieces don't work at all.)  Maybe because this is baby ginger?

review/summary: Delicious right out of the bag
review/text: I sometimes use these for baking, but more often just enjoy eating a square right out of the bag.  If your recipe calls for chopped candied/crystallized ginger you will need to cut these into smaller pieces.  I use a slap chopper, and it works well, but it will get really gummy if you are trying to chop a large quantity.  The baking chips are much easier to use, but you will also get a little added sugar if you go the other route.<br /><br />These are delicious right out of the bag, and I always keep a bag when traveling to help with any motion sickness, or travel upset.  Plus, they're wonderfully tasty.  I don't need an excuse to eat them!

review/text: I eat crystallized ginger because I have a finicky stomach. I've tried several brands. This brand just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Each package has ginger, coated very liberally with sugar, and then about another teaspoon of sugar added to the bag for no particular reason. The extra sugar just adds weight to the bag. If you buy this, shake the bag up, then remove the ginger. At the bottom of the bag, you'll have a nice teaspoon of sugar for your coffee or tea.<br /><br />If you like super-sweet candy and  plan on filling your sugar jar with the extra sugar, then you'll like this. If you're looking for something that tastes like ginger, look elsewhere.
