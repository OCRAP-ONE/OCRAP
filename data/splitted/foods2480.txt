review/summary: Pricey Stuff and Hardens up Real Fast!
review/text: I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.  The other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl. If he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and I had to literally scrape it out of his bowl.

review/summary: Tasty topper my dog loves!!!!!
review/text: I just got my 1yr old shihtzu the turkey and she loves it. I mix it with her dry food. It does have a gel substance around the food. I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: Consistently in the top ten recommended canned dog foods
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and other healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

review/text: After reviewing the lamb product that is labeled the same way it is worth noting that this food is very good as well.  Not quite as attractive as the lamb, but still rated high on her taste test scale.  It provides a way to give some variety without upsetting her system.  Most of the Wellness canned foods are remarkable in that respect.

I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.

review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

review/summary: Good Choice
review/text: I just wanted to supplement the dry food that I feed my two schnauzers. I tried several other brands and even other canned food by this same brand. My dogs did not do well on any of them until I tried this one. They love it and it does not cause stomach upset or potty problems. I highly recommend this product for extra protein, esspecialy if your dog has a delicate system.

review/summary: Good but Beware!
review/text: This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.

review/summary: Better vegetarian chili out there
review/text: I love mole enchaladas and black beans, so when this chili came out it sounded wonderful. Unfortunately, the flavor isn't the complex blend of spices that I expect from mole; it tastes very strongly of coffee. I tried giving cans away to family and friends, and their response was the same. I'm giving this two stars because I did manage to use the rest of my case by including it as an ingredient in larger pots of homemade chili--where the coffee flavor was diluted to a more pleasing subtle background note--but this chili simply isn't workable as an open-and-heat chili option.<br /><br />I recommend that you hunt down a can in your local grocery store to try it before you invest in a case, or skip this alltogether in favor of other vegetarian chli options. From now on, I'll stick with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BF54MS">Worthington Chili, 20-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> for easy from-a-can chili. (Incidentally, if you can find an Adventist Book Center, you should be able to purchase Worthington products for less than sold here, though the convenience via Amazon can't be beat.) If you have a Crock-Pot, I recommend this easy dump and cook recipe: 1 bag Morningstar Griller Crumbles, 15 oz can whole corn, 10 oz can Original Rotel, 4 oz can green chilis, 10 oz can tomato soup (undiluted), 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto beans, taco seasoning to taste, 1 onion, diced and sauteed (optional). Throw it all in your Crock-Pot and cook on low for several hours (timing doesn't have to be precise; this is good just heated through but better cooked longer to allow the flavors to meld).

review/summary: Desert Roses
review/text: I recently ordered two of these lovely little plants, the Sparkle Star and the classic pink-flowering desert rose.  Both arrived well-packed and right on time, and are healthy with new growth sprouting at the top.<br /><br />The larger plant, the Sparkle Star, came without soil (as per the description) and many of the bottom leaves have fallen off due to transport stress.  However, as I said before there is a good deal of new growth, and they are hardy little plants in general.  If you're looking for a nice plant to keep indoors (in a well-lighted area), I'd definitely recommend these plants and this seller.<br /><br />Just a note: desert roses are poisonous, so wash your hands well after touching the plants, and keep out of the way of pets and young children.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PUFBLM">9GreenBox - Adenium Desert ROSE Sparkle Star House Plant Bonsai</a><br /><br />Dear Sir:<br />After ordering a white desert rose on April 9th, 2012, I received a pink flowering plant. After complaining, I was told either to get a replacement or refund. I asked for a replacement, after two weeks I e-mailed for the status of my replacement and was told it was shipped long ago. After communicating back and forth four times, I was told a new one was shipped again, again no plant. Again I was told that I would receive another within three days, again no plant. I e-mailed again asking for shipment confirmation and no response.  Finaly on June 30th a received my replacement. It's great to finally receive a new replacement but yesterday I looked at the plant and new flowering buds seem to be developing. But again, the buds are pink and not the white plant that I originally ordered. Seem that 9GreenBox is a very dishonest plant company that does not ship what they advertise and it takes a long time to get a new one. After all my complaints not receiving the right one, it happens for the second time. Most companies would not make the same mistake twice. I request that you refund my money with shipping cost as soon as possible. Please let me know on what to do with your two pink plants. My recomendation to other desert rose buyers buy from a reputable plant company.<br /><br />Dennis

review/summary: Flavor Comparison
review/text: For years I've used Nestl&eacute; chocolate chips because it's readily available and good quality. But I have a few recipes that call for milk chocolate, and since Nestl&eacute; uses vanillin in their milk chocolate chips (a flavor that I find cloying and artificial), I wanted to find a new milk chocolate for candy and baked goods. So I decided to conduct a taste test Guittard vs Ghirardelli, both of which contain real vanilla and not vanillin.<br /><br />Both chocolates were very good, but Guittard came out on top, hands down. The texture had a nice snap, melted like silk on the tongue, and had a beautifully balanced flavor with toasted nut and caramel notes. Ghirardelli was grainier, melted a bit stickier but still velvety, and had a rich, roasted flavor. Unfortunately, the Ghirardelli also contained far less pleasant tangy, stand-out notes of cooked (UHT) milk and green coffee.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the quality of Guittard milk chocolate chips, and surprised at the difference in flavors between the two.

One nip of this stuff, and you'll be unfit to drive for hours. To put it simply? It will mess. you. up.<br /><br />If you know that going in, you may be able to withstand the effects of this heady brew.<br /><br />Do take note of the product's two year shelf life, however. After two years, enough oxygen will undoubtedly have penetrated to turn this vinegar into wine. Not a good wine, not a fine aged wine, but a blend in the vein of Two Buck Chuck.<br /><br />In short, use it sparingly but use it quickly, then buy some more. It's slightly cheaper than just burning your money!

review/summary: Quickly cleared my slow-running drain
review/text: I had a terrible plugged drain that nothing would clear. Finally a friend recommended that vinegar might dissolve the blockage. This had so frustrated me that I decided to buy the best vinegar available. When my box of Modena Extravecchio Gold Seal arrived in the mail I immediately went to work. Within minutes, my kitchen sink was flowing freely once again.<br /><br />I am a bit upset about the short listed shelf life of only two years. I'm afraid that my drain will stop up again just after the two year shelf life has expired and I will be forced to purchase a new case. Given that it is already 75 years old it seems like an unreasonable limitation, but of course I wouldn't risk going against the manufacturer's recommendation.<br /><br />It certainly commands a small premium compared to other drain-cleaner products, but it is well worth the extra money!

review/summary: Great tasting flaxseed meal
review/text: I have tried 10 different brands of flaxseed meal and can tell you that this is by far the best tasting and has the most consistent quality. There are two types of flaxseeds, brown and golden. Both have the same nutritional value, but golden flaxseed is significantly smoother in taste and not as pungent/bitter aftertaste.  I especially like Bob's Red mill for the organic offerings at a minimal price increase. I regularly sprinkle 1-2 tablespoons on my cereal in the morning to give it a nutritional punch of fiber, protein and essential fatty acids. The texture is very fine and almost has no noticeable effect on the cereal, if I went with 1 Tbls, you wouldn't even know it was there. I highly recommend giving Bob's products a try, I am sure you will find it as enjoyable as I have. Always store flaxseed meal refrigerated, opened or not.

review/summary: Good Stuff, Great Price!
review/text: I've had trouble finding Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal locally.  I was surprised to find it on amazon.com.  I have been using flaxseed meal for over 5 years.  It is ground, so you get the full benefit of the omega 3 fatty acids and fiber.  It isn't well known that flax seeds are not digestible unless the seed is ground.  While you could do this with your teeth, good luck chewing dozens and dozens of flax seeds mixed with cereal or in baked goods.  The meal is the way to go.<br /><br />This product is at least 60% cheaper by weight than the Bob's Red Mill Flaxseed Meal I was buying at a health food store.  While four 32 oz. packages seems like a lot, you can freeze what you won't use right away.  Or share it with friends.  At this price, this is easy to do.

review/summary: More mellow than regular (darker) ground flaxseed
review/text: I like to toss a couple of tablespoons of ground flaxseed into yeast breads and pizza dough.  I think it makes for interesting tweedy texture and imparts a nutty flavor.  However, the other person in the house who consumes the baked goods finds regular flaxseed by the same manufacturer to be too assertive and too multi-grainish despite arguments for its healthful advantages.  This product is a good compromise: golden flaxseed produces a nice straw colored hue instead of a tweedy look, has the same healthful properties and is more refined in flavor and texture.  I store it in the freezer and it lasts  indefinitely.

review/text: This finely ground flaxseed is easy to sprinkle into any dish you are cooking and adds great nutritional value. It's affordable in comparison to other products I've looked at. Best of all, the taste is negligible - I don't notice much of a flavor difference when added to various dishes.

review/summary: Bob's Mills is tops in the industry!
review/text: Flaxseed is healthy, good tasting and a good substitute for butter or margarine in a recipe. I use it in cereal, smoothies, a glass of water, veggie dishes and any recipe I wish to 'edit-out' butter, magarine or oil. (Use 3 parts flaxseed to 1 part 'other'). As far as Bob's Mills? I order other products, which arrive intact and are of gr8 quality (buckwheat flour, apple spice muffin mix, 10 grain hot cereal mix and herbs'n'spices. They also make an awesome bag clip to keep their product fresh (I cheat and use it on non-Bob's products!). I should have ordered at least 5 more bag clips. Oh well, I'm sure there will be a next time! Happy Harping!

review/summary: Golden flax meal is the better one
review/text: This is a great product. The golden flax is slightly better tasting than the brown. Its good enough to put in muffins and (for us) toppings such as apple bake where you can taste it. We actually do consume enough to justify buying it buy the box. We also consume it in shakes but its best when baked- works great in cornbread too. We also get stone ground flours and cornmeals, and these three make up a lot of value in this department. Flax oil of course is very high in short chain Omega 3's. Fish oils are better, but if you have the other nutrients and enzymes in your body you can make the long ones from the ones in flax- hence this product fulfills this need very well (flax is very concentrated in short chain 3's). Did I mention it actually tastes great in baked goods? Bob's Red mill is a quality product.

review/text: An excellent product inside, I just wish the packaging were different.  Information recommends the flaxseed be stored in its opaque packaging.  But it's just a bag.  So I cut off the top and hope my clip won't slip off and I'll have flaxseed spilled all over the refrigerator shelf.  Better packaging might be a shaker container like what's used for parmesan cheese, but opaque.<br /><br />The package is big and you have to buy 4 so even using some every day on my cereal, I will have flaxseed for a long time from this order.  Store extras in the freezer, put the one you're using in the refrigerator.

review/text: I have always ground my own flax seed to get the full benefits of flax. I purchased this product after my grinder gave out on me and I needed more ground flax seed. In the meantime, I purchased the flaxseed meal until I found the grinder I was looking for. I am very pleased with this product because it has a nice texture. The meal I made ended up like flour but this meal has a bit of the seed in tack for a good crunch that makes it a nice added topping to yogurts, cereal, etc. Now when I buy a new grinder it will be used just for coffee beans and I will purchase this product again because I could not grind the seed the way Bob's Red Mill product does.

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since.  I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems.  The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator.  I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose!  It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix).  I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal).  The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me.  The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky.  I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy).  Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again.  The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake.  He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

review/summary: Better than brown flax!
review/text: I have been using Hodgson's Mill brown flax from the local supercenter for a while. When I went with a low carb lifestyle, I needed to up my flax usage for recipes and to keep things "regular", if you KWIM. Anyway, someone posted that golden flax was tastier & had a "lighter" flavor than brown. I decided to try it for myself. Couldn't find golden flax locally, so I ordered off Amazon. I am pleased with this product. It does have a lighter taste & makes a prettier (IMO) MIM (muffin in a minute). Kind of like comparing wheat bread to white bread. Just a lighter, less "nutty" flavor. If you don't want a whole case (4 packs) you could go in halves with someone, or just store your flax in the freezer to keep it nice till ready to use.<br />Here's my favorite MIM recipe for all you low carbers:<br />Rich Cocoa MIM<br />4 TBSP golden flax<br />1/2 tsp baking powder<br />1TBSP unsweetened cocoa baking powder (I like Hershey Special Dark)<br />1 packet Splenda, or use 3-4 drops of EZ Sweetz liquid sucrolose (like Splenda)<br />1 whole egg<br />2 tsp heavy cream<br />2 tsp butter<br />Mix thoroughly all dry ingredients together in a mug, first. Then add wet ingredients. Mix completely. Microwave for 1.5 to 2.5 minutes, depending on wattage. Can serve with cream cheese, whipping cream, butter, etc.

review/summary: Neutral tasting product, to add somethings to diet
review/text: As one who has issues with taking fish oil (love fish, hate the indigestion burp of the oil), I ran across flax in a newspaper article and thought--well, why not. Quick trip to WF and there was Bob's. This fluffy, neutral tasting product isn't one that I find delicious, but it is NEUTRAL. Very light and easy to add to occasional smoothies, on top of cereal. It doesn't add any horrid taste, no indigestion. Only been a short time but it seems to add to regularity--a problem for some of us who are told to take rock hard calcium. So if it does that and add to omega 3, I'll be a happy camper. Will be interesting to see long term if it helps with cholesterol and other issues. But for now, try it, it is FOOD. Also seems to make the cereal fill me up longer, something most cereal doesn't do.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill For Fiber and Omega 3!
review/text: I wrote this review in regards to another product.. but it pertains to this one as well.. so I will post it here.<br /><br />This - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FL2XWW">The Protein People APC (Active Protein Complex) Whey/Soy Protein, Creamy Vanilla, 5-Pound Tub</a>- is a great part of my diet and general workout plan.<br /><br />I actually combine equal amounts of The Protein People APC (Active Protein Complex) Time Release Protein, along with with equal parts of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087HF8">CytoSport Muscle Milk Nature's Ultimate Lean Muscle Formula, Chocolate, 2.47-Pound Plastic Jar</a>- and a scoop of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTRRXI">4Ever Fit L-Glutamine, 1000 Gram Tub</a>, with every shake ... I then add 2 or 3 (depending on your tolerance - and you will see what I mean once you try it for a few days,)heaping teaspoons of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDSE8">Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal, 32-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>along with some frozen strawberries and a banana... and I have a really great meal replacement shake.<br /><br />Depending on whether I use the immersion blender to mix the shake with water or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4Q8L0">Silk Soymilk, Organic Vanilla, 8.25-Ounce Carton (Pack of 18)</a>- it can be a post workout shake as well and the caloric value can be adjusted by the type of liquid you use.<br /><br />I created this shake as a way to add protein to my diet so that I could create leaner muscle mass and stay fit. The time release allows for a longer absorption time over a period of a few hours and I can really tell the difference when I'm running around. The glutamine is helpful in muscle repair while the flax adds fiber which is essential and necessary omega 3 fatty acids. Whole strawberries and banana give needed vitamins, not to mention a really great flavor boost. I use frozen strawberries to give a nice chilled consistency to the shake as well as a way to keep a larger amount of strawberries handy.<br /><br />I stick to a plan of 4-5 meals a day, and this shake is great in helping make that happen. 2 Egg whites cooked for breakfast then a shake in the morning after the gym.. a couple of small meals and snacks throughout the day, and then a protein shake about an hour before bed.. eating or snacking every 2-3 hours. This is the way to go for me.<br /><br />Studies have shown that higher protein content in your stomach - as the last thing ingested, will keep you body from producing less insulin. This will in turn keep you from storing the food in your stomach as body fat, while kicking up your natural production of growth hormone. Growth hormone will create greater lean muscle mass and helps to put your body in a more anabolic state - so that you are burning your stomach contents as fuel all night long. You awaken ready to eat - already burning more calories to get your day going!<br /><br />This shake has been essential in keeping my muscle mass higher and leaner while allowing me to still keep the needed calories to not fade out during the day. It is not a intended to be a magic elixir ... but the balance of muscle vs. body fat is helped kept in check. I do 30 minutes of cardio 3x a week as well as 3o-40 minutes of resistance training on those days. So basically 3 hours a week of working out.<br /><br />Hope this helps you like it has helped me. Check out my other reviews on supplements I have added to my routine that I feel have been helpful as well.

review/summary: Rancid product, poor processing, no quality control
review/text: I bought Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal, 32 oz., 4 pack, and first of all, it took nearly two weeks for it to be shipped and arrive despite the deceptive listing stating it was "In Stock" at all times.  More importantly, the product was completely rancid.  All four bags smelled like rotten fish with a mixture of paint odor.  This signifies horrible quality control and inferior processing for sorting the seeds prior to grounding and/or the grind processing itself as any flax seed processor will tell you. Evidently, "Bob" is really just a corporation who wants to make money rather than sell anything close to resembling an ordinary quality product which is sold by the rest of the industry.  If the bad seeds are not sorted out, this exponentially accelerates rancidity.  Also, the grinding process itself, if not done correctly and everything properly cleaned betweened grinding (imagine multi-year old rancid seed remnants sitting on the bottom and ground into the equipment that your so-called fresh and "organic" seed is mixed with and ground into) then you also accelerate rancidity.  As everyone knows flax seed meal has little to no omega-3 benefit at all as it is what is left over from the pressing to extract the oils for other uses ("Bob" thus making his money twice on the same seed), so the meal is basically just good for fiber like a million other (and much fresher) sources in nature.  However, to then treat this oil-defunct and nutrionally defunct product so poorly in processing and have such crummy quality control such that it is rancid by the time it reaches the consumer renders it useless and in effect a health detriment. Rancid remnant of oils will cause diarrhea at a minimum and far more free radicals than one is presumably tring to avoid to begin with. It also tastes like crap.  Worthless product in my opinion. I threw it all out and will never buy again. This should never happen.  I've been eating flax seeds, using the oil, and the meal for nearly a decade and know exactly what it is all supposed to smell and taste like.  I've tried many brands and ground it myself as well. Buy this product if you want inedible food leftovers with all the oils you originally were seeking taken out and are left with rancid remnants laced in fiber dust that will do anything but provide for health.

review/summary: MY DOG LOVES CHEF MICHAEL'S
review/text: My wonderful doggy has been spoiled by eating mostly people food.  I ordered Chef Michael's Canine Creations because I wanted to give her a balanced, healthier diet.  I didn't think she would eat it, but she loves it.

review/summary: My dogs do back flips when they see me get out their food bowls!
review/text: My dogs go absolutely crazy over this food!  I have a Chihuahua/Terrier mix and an English Mastiff.  I normally buy high end food from pet stores.  We've been on Avoderm for over a year and I thought they liked it just fine.  But one day I ran out and didn't make it to the pet store before they closed so I ran to the supermarket just to get something to tide them over.  My husband picked this out because of the high protein content.  It was a huge hit but I truly considered this to be an inferior supermarket brand so the next day I bought my usual Avoderm.<br /><br />You know how they tell you to mix the old food with the new food so your dog's stomach won't get upset?  When I do this now my dogs will pick around the Avoderm and only eat the Chef Michael's!  They are not picky eaters but they don't usually get excited over food either.  Now when they see me get the bag they practically start doing back flips!  It's pretty hilarious but I am happy to see how much they like this.<br /><br />It's roughly the same price as the food I was buying so it's not sticker shock to me, but I really wish it came in larger bag sizes.  It's only been a few days so I haven't noticed a difference in coat condition or "output" (trying to think of how to phrase that delicately!)  I'll post an update in a month or two.

review/summary: She liked it.....at first
review/text: My 25 pound mixed breed dog is a picky eater. She insists on variety and will lose interest when fed the same meal repeatedly. I tried Chef Michael's chicken flavor and she seemed to like it for a few days but then stopped eating it entirely. I finished the bag off by mixing it with other food she preferred. Part of the problem is that if you don't seal the bag tightly after each use, the kibble can get hard and probably stale.
