review/summary: Great Green Tea!
review/text: *****<br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

It's a good price and a nice, big bag of licorice coins.  Everyone in our family enjoys them, including the 7 and 3 year olds.  It's not sweet like American licorice, but is a firm, dense not-too-salty version of the Dutch or Finnish candy.  We like double salt licorice, too, but this is a tasty, less intense alternative.

review/text: The star anise is another Asian-inspired spice. Regular anise is sometimes substituted, but lacks the nuances of the real thing. It holds its flavor and scent in the jar and will last along time. It has been used whole and powdered in soups, stews and marinades. The powder is very powerful, so add cautiously. A very heavy mortar and pestle is recommended for the crushing job. I use granite and cast iron for example. That little herb masher for bruising basil will not be effective.

review/text: I'm not a big fan of the new type of Quaker Oats granola bar; lot's of barley/rice filler material, not many oats.  However, the chocolate chip is the best tasting in my opinion- well, maybe it ties with the peanut butter chocolate chunk.  There are enough chocolate chips in the bar to give the moist fattiness that we all desire, yet the chocolate chips are small enough such that you don't feel too guilty eating them.  Maybe that's a bad thing, because it encourages you to reach for another.<br /><br />The granola bars seem a bit smaller than I remember, but there's plenty of flavor packed inside.  These aren't too healthy; still a lot of corn syrup (though no "high" fructose corn syrup as they stress), fructose, dextrose, hydrogenated oils, etc..  Not intended to be a meal replacement bar (unless you ate the whole box), but they're a tasty, traditional snack.

review/summary: Good Crispy Filling Snack
review/text: I don't usually like snack foods with flavored coatings, and I wasn't that into the Bugles with peanut butter and chocolate.  But I think these are very good.  Unlike the pb/chocolate Bugles which are coated with a pasty goo, these just have a pretty light dusting of flavoring.  It does leave some mess on your fingers but it's not too bad.  The individual pieces remain crispy and you can still taste the original Bugle flavor, combined with the nacho cheese flavor.  I think the flavor balance is very well done.  If you've never had Bugles, the pieces are little hollow cornucopia shaped bits, with a sort of cross between a fried and puffy texture, and the flavor is similar to a corn chip, but distinctly unique in its own way.  Also it's a snack food which I don't think is too salty.  The plain Bugles have what I would describe as a mild but appealing flavor; the nacho cheese ones aren't really spicy but have a nice cheese taste without overkill.  The bite texture is similar to something like fritos; they aren't hard, nor are they brittle, but still crunchy.<br /><br />I purchased the carton containing the 4.1 oz. bags, which I find to be too much for one sitting as a snack, but it might be a good individual size bag for some people.  These are a filling kind of snack that can replace the desire for a meal.  Of course it's probably better to have a real meal of uber-healthy foods, but sometimes I really am hungry and just don't feel like cooking.<br /><br />The bags are easy to open without ripping and flinging the contents everywhere.  The product arrived well packaged and everything was in good condition.

review/summary: A little TLC for incredible sugar!
review/text: So misunderstood! A little TLC is needed, but Billington's is well worth the time! It quite often arrives hard. The solution: Place the unwrapped sugar in an airtight canister, slightly moisten a clean, folded (larger than the container opening) paper towel, place over the canister opening, not touching the sugar, and secure the lid. Come back in 2 to 3 hours, and you have a soft, golden sugar.  Remove the paper towel and store air tight.  It never clumps, is always soft, and absolutely delicious!

review/summary: Best Demerara I've Found.
review/text: I first bought this sugar at Whole Foods and other gourmet food shops, but it got difficult to find, and it was expensive. This is absolutely the best price I've found. Being half a Brit, I love it in my tea; although they seem to prefer it in their coffee. As for the clumping, any brown sugar will do that. All I do is take a bit of sandwich bread and put it in the jar with the sugar for a day... The moisture is absorbed back into the sugar. Problem solved.

review/text: I learned to love Demerara sugar while living in the U.K. in the 90's. but couldn't always find it here in the States. These days it's generally available, but it's expensive. However, The Billington's is real Demerara at half the price of the supermarket. Great tasting in the morning coffe or tea.<br /><br />The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it has a slightly higher moisture content than other brands, causing it to form a brick in the cellophane inside packaging. You can't really store it in the original package after opening. However, a little gentle "massaging" of sugar in the inside package before opening will return it to a nicely granulated state, which can then be stored in a sugar bowl or other container (I use one of those clear lucite airtight jars).<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I was hoping for better! The tea has a burnt flavor and is very weak. The odor is not at all what you expect from oolong. In fact, it is down right unpleasant. The bags are way smaller then most tea bags. Several bags are needed and a much longer steep time. The strings on each tea bag are not tied and just slide right off. The bags themselves do not absorb water well and do tend to float on top of the water. A little more effort is needed to get the steeping process started.<br /><br />I will not purchase this again!

I tried letting it brew for a LONG time, even with 2 bags I wish it was stronger (For comparison: I normally take a regular lipton at work, dip in water & mix just long enough for sugar to disappear, then throw out the bag.) I guess it's just meant to be light and light teas are not to my taste-bud's liking.

review/summary: This oolong tea has perfect flavor
review/text: There is an Asian restaurant in town that serves the most wonderful oolong tea.  I began my search for oolong tea so I could have this decadent drink at home.  After searching all the grocery and specialty stores in town, I quickly learned no one sells oolong tea!  I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon and at such a great price.  This tea has 'perfect' flavor--not grainy/grassy like some green teas; and not as strong as a black tea . . . .it has that wonderful oolong tea flavor you've experienced in your favorite oriental restaurant.  I'm ordering my second round of 2 boxes.  The hard core green tea drinkers have quickly adopted this as their favorite!

The taste is delicious, rich but not cloying, and so good that you may well think long and hard before offering them to anyone not near and dear to your heart..otherwise the recipients may well follow you with the intensity usually called stalking, just hoping you'll drop a cookie. Seriously.  They're that good.

review/summary: Love, love, love!
review/text: Having grown up eating lots of canned processed crap (Campbell's soups, boxed mac & cheese, Chef-Boy-R-Dee pasta, etc.), I sometimes still find myself hankering for the "delights" of youth--even though I'm now an organic gardening, veggie loving, fresh-and-healthy eating gal. This is where a product like Annie's P'sghetti Loops comes in!<br /><br />Obviously by the name, this is intended for kids. (And I'm sure kids would love them.) But I've happily eaten this for years as an adult, and I always purchase them by the case to save money when I can. Sure, the noodles are soft and somewhat bland--they ARE canned, after all!--but those little soy meatballs have an appealing, slightly chewy-crumbly texture, and the tomato sauce has that touch of sweetness that is reminiscent of those mainstream brands...all of which adds up to make me a happy camper indeed!<br /><br />What I like even better is that this product is natural and organic--no fields of wheat were sprayed with petroleum-based chemicals to make it, which means the beneficial insects are still alive and the groundwater isn't contaminated. ("Conventional" agriculture dumps 3.5 pounds of pesticides PER PERSON on U.S. land; 20% of these approved pesticides are listed as carcinogens by the EPA. Not very appetizing, huh?)<br /><br />Annie's has been promoting organic foods for years, unlike so many newcomers to the "green" trend. (Although better late than never, I suppose.) While I'm not a fan of ALL of her products (the boxed mac & cheese has never won me over), there are others, like these P'sghetti Loops with "meat"balls, that are satisfying to both my palate and my conscience.<br /><br />Sure, it'd be even better if I made homemade pasta (and I often do), but for those times when I want something quick and convenient, this totally fills the bill. :-)

review/summary: Love my P'Sghetti!
review/text: Finally, a quick, tasty and affordable instant meal for vegetarians on the go. I keep a couple cans of Annie's in my desk at work so that I've always got lunch prepped regardless of how hectic my morning might have been. I've tried the Bernie-O's, P'Sghetti Loops and the Raviolis and I've been pleased with the flavors of all three.<br />The soy meatballs in the P'Sghetti Loops are distinctive. I happen to love them, but I can understand why some people don't, they are a pretty strong flavor for meat-eaters who are used to bland hard little balls of cheap meat in the big commercial brands. The sauce is mild, creamy and very palatable, but again, if you are used to and prefer the chemical-ish overwhelming tang and flat flavor of Spaghetti-O's, you may not be a fan of Annie's.<br />I'm so glad to find it here on Amazon, and with the super saver shipping too! All of my local grocery stores have stopped carrying the Annie's canned pasta meals, and I was despairing of trying to find another quickie lunch option. Amazon to my rescue!

review/text: I've been eating Annie's Homegrown Organic P'sghetti With Soy Meatballs since I was pregnant with my first son, craving "comfort" foods, but trying to eat as organically as possible while meeting the high protein requirements my doctor ordered for my "delicate condition". Admittedly, this isn't a perfect taste match for the mainstream (fatty/salty/totally un-natural) Spaghetti O's of my childhood. Still, it is quick and easy to prepare, and I find it tasty and of reasonable nutritional quality.<br /><br />Amazon's case price works out to 90% of the price I pay at my local natural grocery store, so I would be happy to Subscribe & Save if that becomes an option in the future.

review/text: This is a good product for those who want to relive the "nostalgia" of having eaten too much of the processed Spaghettio- type canned pasta as a kid.  I wouldn't want to get my kids hooked on the stuff though.  For those who are not a fan of the meatballs, I find that they are better when they break up in the sauce and you are just left with a crumbly, chewy texture overall.  That being said, this $2.50+ per can is a steep price to pay (plus, like I said, you don't rurally want to eat too often- it may be organic, but it's sure not health food).  Also, if you have the opportunity,  Whole Foods has numerous store brand versions of Annie's products.  They all seem pretty much the same to me, and they are a good deal cheaper.

review/text: I've been a vegetarian for 10 months. I have tried Annie's Bunny Grahams and enjoyed them! I've recently started trying faux meat. Target had the  P'sghetti With Soy Meatballs one sale for $0.99 per can. I picked up a can and was eager to relive my childhood chef boy-ar-dee days. I cut one of the "meat"balls in half and ate it with a spoonful of pasta. My first thought was "this tastes gross!". I took another spoonful of pasta  with a tiny bit of the "meat"ball, so little that the tomato sauce would covered the taste. I enjoyed it! I ate tiny bits of the soy meatballs until all of the pasta was gone. I hated throwing them away, but just couldn't stand the taste of Annie's mock meat. I will load up on the plain pasta varieties!

review/text: I'm not commenting on the quality of the item but the poor experience buying it through Amazon.  Of the 12 cans, 10 of them came crushed and dented, a health hazard due to potential air entry into the cans.  I had to throw them out because Amazon didn't want them back.  I asked for a refund so I didn't end up paying $13 a piece for the two good cans.  Amazon refused at first, saying they would re-send it.  But it was out of stock.  I waited a while, wrote back, and they finally refunded the product, making me feel guilty for the dented up cans.<br /><br />I have bought many things through Amazon and will continue to do so.  But I won't buy canned items.  They don't survive either the Amazon warehouse or the shipping process.
