review/summary: Yummy delicious crunch
review/text: I ordered both the Chili Nacho and the Parmesan. I found the chili nacho may favorite. I am vegetarian with a gluten sensitivity, so these are wonderful for giving me a healthy crunch with protein and no gluten. I have like these as well as most chips. I have now subscribed and I hope I don't run into the stale problem another reviewer did.

review/summary: Good snack food
review/text: THe chips taste great i love them, the only problem i have witht hem and this i why i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the chips are kinda small and some times its like eating crumbs because they get smushed easily. OTherwise the chips are great. nice little healthy snack. also the packaging of the 5 oz bags arent very good either, but the product taste is great.

review/summary: Good for gluten free
review/text: I like the flavor of these chips.  They did seem to leave a bit of a film taste in my mouth when I was finished eating them but if I chewed a piece of gum, the problem was gone.  I think these are pretty good for gluten free.  They are good to keep in the car and at school for a quick pick me up snack.

review/summary: OK but not as good as the big bags.
review/text: I bought this same product in a health food store in bigger bags... BUT I guess it was not the same in the smaller bags.  They were called Parmesan Chips but they were not as crunchy and they were full of parmesan.  There was almost too much parmesan on the chips in these smaller bags and it seemed as though at least 1/4 the bag is parmesan.  They just were not as good as the bigger bag.  Maybe it was a manufacturing error... but I will not buy them again.  I really wanted them for a protein supplement to my snaks.  OH WELL.<br /><br />If someone gets these and they are crunchy then I really would like to know that.

review/text: I love Kay's chips as a way to get my snack fix while maintaining my weight loss.  The taste of all these chips, including the lemon herb and chili cheese, are great!  The only negative is that the texture is a bit crumbly, thus messy.  I will continue to buy these, however, as a fast and healthy snack option.

review/summary: Really not that good
review/text: Saw the bunch of 5 star reviews and thought I'd give these a try. So people complained about it being salty, but that wasn't the problem for me, since really, potato chips are just as salty as these. I think someone else called this taste "unnatural", and that pretty much tells the story. These chips taste like they were manufactured in a laboratory, and not actually the product of natural consumables. They look like corn chips but they seriously just taste like flavoring and oil and basically empty of flavor besides these. Not recommended.

review/summary: Very good chips!
review/text: I was a little wary of these due to the mixed reviews here. However, I'm glad I purchased them. I think the flavor is good and the chips are crunchy and taste fried to me. One drawback is that they are pretty small so it's tough to dip them without getting your fingers messy. They cheese can also stick to your hands. I actually like the taste of these more than the sour cream and onion Pop Chips I purchased in the same order. These also have great nutrition compared to those (10 grams of protein per serving, 15 per bag!) I will probably buy these again, they make a good snack.

They stick to the foil wrapper, so when you pull them out, you get a lot of crumbled pieces around the edges of toaster pastries, and a big mess. These tarts do NOT stay together. If I can eat one without a huge mess, it's an accomplishment. I understand portion control blah, blah, blah, but you are getting very little for your money.<br /><br />edit: these tarts will stay togeher if you put them in the refrigerator.

review/text: These taste so good it's hard to believe they are good for you! They have a soft, cake-like outer shell and a gooey inner layer of fudge. Compare the nutrition label with 'non-health food' products and you will notice a big difference in the fat, the sugar and the artificial stuff. These have nothing fake and nothing bad for you. If you are watching your carbohydrates you might not want to eat too many of these but other than that I highly reccommend them as a healthy alternative to cookies and candy bars! The best part is, these taste great and even kids will eat them right up! They make other flavors of this product and they all taste good but being that I am a chocoholic, these will always be my favorite!

review/summary: Mmmm, Day or Night - a Smooth Flavored Coffee
review/text: It is 17 degrees outside, I'm snuggled under a blanket with the fire in the fireplace drinking my very first pot of this coffee. Warm and smooth, it adds just the right touch of chocolate to my morning, just a hint, nothing overwhelming.<br /><br />I purchased this directly from Gevalia (along with a free coffeemaker), and they included instructions to make their coffee the SAME WAY you make yours. Since I normally use about 1/2 of the grounds that the box recommends, I fixed it my way.<br /><br />I was making 6 cups, so I added 3 TBS of grounds. Then, I had learned a long time ago a trick for getting the best flavor out of flavored coffee and put 1 tsp of sugar in with the grounds.<br /><br />My way also includes a bit of cream and sugar (actually Equal), which is how I made my cup.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the flavor is smooth, and there is no acid taste or "tummy acid" after I drank this. And, as I wrote this simple review, I drank my first cup down to the very last drop. Fortunately, there is more in the kitchen.<br /><br />Best of all, since I ordered the decaf, I can drink it day or night ...<br /><br />I never expected to give a coffee 5 stars, but this one earned the right!

review/text: I am a regular customer of Gevalia and have been for over 10 yrs. or more.  I receive shipments from this company on a regular basis, mostly their flavored coffees.  My preference is to mix decaf with caffeinated, half caf/half decaf.  I made this purchase from Amazon when the price of coffee started to rise.  I hadn't tried this flavor yet so I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />It has the bold flavor that one would expect from dark chocolate and the truffle gives it an earthy aroma that I'm still getting used to.  All in all it is a very interesting blend for a chocolate flavored coffee.

review/text: Update on 12/21/2011: My review below was based on what I purchased, which was altogether a different product than the one now listed.<br />..........................................................<br /><br />When I figured cost per ounce, the accountant in me had to order this product. Also, I was intrigued by the mix of coriander, lemon juice, basil and garlic. I know my olives and tested this next to a kalamata olive spread containing capers, garlic and oregano. I wanted so badly for this product to withstand the taste test.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say the deal is not good. I'm afraid you'll be immediately disappointed with this product. I'd not serve it to a Spaniard, Greek or North African (they know olives). The main ingredient in Gaea Green Olive Tapenade is an olive variety that is definitely not a table olive. There are many types and most make great table olives. You can see that under the Wikipedia entry for "olive." The olive used in this tapenade should be used for olive oil and fuel (the solid parts discarded from in oil production are often literally used as fuel).<br /><br />The major pizza chains do not use this type of olive on pizza. A stand-alone pizzeria in a Chicago neighborhood would be the subject of the local police blotter if it tried serving this type of olive on pizza. The addition of coriander, lemon juice and garlic did not compensate. By definition, a tapenade is supposed to use table olives. This is an instance where things that appear too good to be true are just that.

I'll be inventing ways to use up the remaining 5, but never ordering again.

review/text: I was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the taste of this and/or quality, but after having been consuming this for a couple days, I really do enjoy it!  Initially I thought it would be gross, but it really wasn't!  It is nice with the fruit in it, and has a kind of "nutty" taste. Great shipping, great quality, amazing nprice, and I def. rec!

review/summary: Nice Tea
review/text: This tea is subtle, which is pretty common for white tea.  I'm enjoying it, and find the lychee and almond add just a hint of flavor.  The aroma does not draw the masses as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007P2NEI6">Tea Fort&eacute; Tea Coconut Mango Colada, 16-Count</a> does, and that's ok . . . but at this price point, there are other teas I prefer.  For a similar light sweet fruit flavor and 1/3 of the price, I'm likely to reach for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4IVGU">Stash Premium Decaf White Raspberry Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> instead, a long favorite of mine.  For something with a stronger nutty flavor, I love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009K77O8">Yamamotoyama - Genmai Cha (Brown Rice Tea) 90 Bag Value Pack</a>.  Whatever you pick, I hope you enjoy it!

review/text: The flavor is surprisingly pleasant, although the powerful combination of the lychee and coconut aromas did take a bit for me to get used to.<br /><br />I usually enjoy it hot, but have also put a bag in with green or black tea when making iced tea. It adds an unexpected flavor and aroma to plain iced tea that seems to make my guests happy.

review/text: The dragon pearl tea is a blooming tea. I brew it in the coffee maker, and store it in large canning jars. Sometimes I brew up to six 24 oz jars. I keep them in the fridge and drink them when I am gardening or working around the yard. The crystal rock sugar can be added when you decide to use the brew, not while it is in storage. Jasmine tea gives you energy and it smells incredible!

review/summary: File this under "dog laxative"
review/text: I bought these "treats" expecting my pup to enjoy an all-natural snack. She did enjoy eating them, but I, alas, was "treated" to an deluge of foulness. Knowing that switching foods can cause an upset stomach, I only gave my hearty, healthy, and athletic canine 1-2 "nibbles" a day.<br /><br />Though I was satisfied with the product's "100% chicken" composition, I was proportionally disappointed by my dog's irregular "nibble-stools" and never-before-seen bathroom accidents inside the house. One such occurrence even took place in my pup's crate, the one place in this world that is sacred for my dog.<br /><br />Thinking,"ah, it must be something else," I performed a series of logical experiments to determine the gastrointestinal culprit; holding all other variables constant over the course of a week or so, I concluded that the treats, though unarguably delicious and well-packaged, had caused my dog's present condition.<br /><br />Wanting to be rid of the canine Metamucil, I passed the treats off to a friend, who later found that her dog had come down with similar issues- noisy stomach, uneasiness, and diarrhea. I quote: "it sounded like he had a pack of wild monkeys in his stomach!" Hyperbole aside, I'm sure that these treats are great for some, many, or perhaps even most dogs. But I would also warn those with pups of particular countenances that "Chicken Nibbles" may, in fact, leave your dog empty rather than full.

Figures the Vet would know what is best.<br /><br />My dogs both LOVE these treats, beyond any other, has been the best training treat to date, they are the size of a quarter and break in half and to 1/4 size easily which works great for training - and my dogs love even the smallest nibble of them - they seem pricy but it is well worth it!<br /><br />I have decided these are the doggie equivalent of Doritos or potato chips - they cannot get enough and always respond for training with them !

The noodles are quick and easy to prepare and the whole family enjoys the flavor and the noodles texture.<br /> If I had any complaint it would be to much salt and the "Vegetables" can be hard at times" Often after the noodles have steeped to the desired tenderness we just pour out the salty broth and just enjoy a nice cup of hot tasty tender noodles!<br /> I wish I had some now!

review/summary: Great product - ridiclously expensive shipping
review/text: These "straws" of diet Snapple taste great (slightly different taste from bottles of same product." They take up much less room than storing a bunch of bottles. Their unique "straw" shape makes then easy to pour into a bottle. My kids love Diet Snapple so it's great to have them.  One odd thing:  Bottles of diet Snapple have 0 calories and these have 5 calories. Something about use of corn derivative that I'm not sure is in the bottled version. The products shipped reasonably quickly and Lynne's Essentials included a "gift" box of a different flavor.  Nice touch! My major complaint and what keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the outrageously expensive costs of shipping. I ordered 8 packages (each package contains 4 boxes  and each box contains 4 "straws".)  So I ordered enough "straws" to create 128 bottles of Diet Snapple.  Each box weighs .45 ounces so all 32 boxes weighed 14.4 oz.  The cost of the boxes was $79.92. That's quite reasonable and a good buy. (About 63 cents per bottle which is much less than buying a bottle in the store.)  But the cost of shipping this order weighing less than a pound by USPS was a whopping $39.60. That brings the cost of the order to $119.52 and the cost of a bottle from about 63 cents to  $1.07.  Please, Lynne's Essentials.  LOWER THE COST OF SHIPPING! It's much more than the cost of shipping for computer equipment I purchase which is much heavier and ships in 3 days via UPS.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KRYJB2">Diet Snapple Singles to Go Lemon Tea (4 Sticks in each box) 4 BOXES</a>

review/summary: The Perfect K-cup, 40 Years in the Making
review/text: First of all, yes, it is expensive.  Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review.  I'm sure it'll come down eventually.<br /><br />I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.<br /><br />Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.  I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered.<br /><br />You know what?  Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars.  It's that good.

As an aside, Starbucks opened  their first store in the Pike Place Market in 1971.<br /><br />When I received my Keurig, I hoped to find Pike Place K-Cups, and that was one of my first purchases.

review/summary: Good, but not Great
review/text: I live near Seattle and have drunk "Pike's Place Roast" at the Pike's Place location many times. So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a "Bold" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right

review/summary: Wonderful Coffee
review/text: This is the perfect medium roast K-cup. The coffee never tastes burnt or watered down. It tastes just like it would if you ordered it at Starbucks. This coffee is just as good as the French Roast, but not as strong. I will continue to buy these as they are the best K-cup I have tasted yet!

I was so elated when I found out that Starbucks was now going to be in Keurig form, let alone this flavor.  I normally can not stand coffee with cream and sugar.  I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and "Oh my God", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.  This tastes as good as if it was from their coffee shop.<br />Since this can get expensive if your going to have more than (2) cups a day, I've decided to purchase this in 1lb bags and use the "ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers", to make this more cost effective.<br /><br />The bottom line is I think if you, like me, don't like this coffee, by itself, try it with cream and sugar.  You'll be surprised at the difference in taste.<br /><br />By the way... why this says I'm in New Caledonia, I have no idea nor can I get it to change.  I'm from NJ.

review/summary: OK, but not great
review/text: I live near Seattle and have drunk "Pike's Place Roast" at the Pike's Place location many times. So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a "Bold" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special.

review/text: I'm not sure what happened, but my box of "54 k-cups" only had 52 cups in it.  There was no packaging inside the box to hold the k-cups in place and protect them, they were just laying in the box loosely.  Some of the cups in the box were also damaged, probably due to the lack of packaging in the box.  This is not the quality anyone would expect from companies such as Keurig and Starbucks!  I suspect the box has been opened previously.  I do not know what happened on the sellers end, but what they sent out was not an original new package of keurig k-cups!  The cups seem to be authentic, but it is hard to tell since the packaging was not up to par and even though the box was sealed, it is looks like the box has been opened previously.  The product I received was sold by "BECCO CORP" through amazon.

review/summary: Mediocre Flavor & Brew, Not StarBucks Quality!
review/text: In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered<br />what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and<br />started researching a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the "K-Cup" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.<br />When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Pike Place + Colombian + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian was the Best of the lot.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig "Brew" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!
