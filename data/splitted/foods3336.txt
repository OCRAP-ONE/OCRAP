review/summary: Price Point
review/text: We had tried a few of these mixes from our local "health food" store and have purchased from their bulk section. Similar product in the bulk bins $5.49/lb, price per bag on shelf for Lundberg mixes $3.59(SALE) - $5.89. I'd gladly paid the price for this great stuff at the local store but went looking for it on Amazon to see if I could get it sent to my college student rather than pay to mail it WOOHOO not only is it here but eligible for free shipping and cheaper than I've seen it anywhere!! Life is good!

review/text: I prepared a package of this flavorful rice tonight for dinner.  Everyone loved it.  I used my rice cooker for the full package and it turned out perfect.  Just the rice mix, water, salt and a tad of butter.  Absolutely irresistible.  We didn't stop until we finished the last grain.  I can't wait to try the other varieties.  It is definitely worth the expense.  A much better deal here on Amazon than I can find locally.<br />Try it, you'll be glad you did!

review/text: Enjoyed, I bought using a kindle special offer and really became a fan of this tea. It brews a deep rich red, the mix reminds me of the English Christmas wassail but with more smoothness which comes from vanilla I think. Very nice for a cold and tastes wonderful esp. because their ingredients are so fresh.

review/text: DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.

review/text: I bought these almonds after reading the previous 1 star review. After tasting them, I realized that they are 100% over-roasted. Only positive thing I can say about these almonds is the packaging. But apart from that...they really taste burnt. I hope that the manufacturers of these almonds can stop over roasting them and add a little bit extra salt. I have down-graded the rating from 3 to 2 stars as I think these are well below average tasting almonds.

Just add coffee and hot water without replacing the lid or screwing down the tamper and it takes over an hour to get it drained. One day I'll try drilling the holes out larger. Right now it looks like the openings in a very fine salt shaker.

review/summary: I liked it until I hit the wild rice
review/text: Take the wild rice out of this and I'd give it 5 stars.  As it is, the weird textural thing the rice brings to the party is very, very unwelcome.  You feel like you bit into a piece of soft bone or  tendon and it adds nothing to the flavor.  I guess this helped them beef up some nutritional component or make it look 'healthier', but if I were them I'd leave it out.<br /><br />After the 'wild rice surprise' (I had no idea that was in there) I've eaten them and they've been acceptable.  At the current prices in my opinion the ostrim are larger, cheaper and better tasting without any weird textured ingredients.

I agree the packages are a little tricky but no big deal. About the mold - sounds like a bummer but I haven't had any issues. I will definitely keep on ordering this stuff for once in a while treats and emergency snacks. The mild is good and the spicy has a little kick, but not too much.

review/summary: Not quite magic, but close!
review/text: My mother is a huge believer in home remedies, in herbs and plants to help soothe away your aches and pains. Burn your hand? Break off a bit of the aloe plant. Stomach ache? A soothing tea made of sarsaparilla root (which is apparently kinda dangerous...oops). My minor in college was Folklore, and I love this kind of stuff, different plants that supposedly help with different aches...I've seen it firsthand in my wife. She gets crazy bad migraines, and a good cup of mint tea can help her keep things under control. But I love the Red Leaf Teas website, especially their matchas, that list everything the plant involved in the flavoring can do. Take this tea for instance:<br /><br />Did you know that studies showed that pomegranate juice destroys breast cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone? It may also prevent breast cancer cells from forming.<br />Pomegranates also offer the following benefits to list a few :<br />Lung Cancer Prevention<br />Slows Prostate Cancer<br />Keeps PSA Levels Stable<br />Protects the Neonatal Brain<br />Prevention of Osteoarthritis<br />Protects the Arteries<br />Alzheimer's Disease Prevention<br />Lowers Cholesterol<br />Lowers Blood Pressure<br />Dental Protection<br />taken from the Red Leaf Teas website.<br /><br />Now, part of me just brushes most of that off, but the part of me that is my mother's hippie daughter drinks this matcha just in case. My aunt recently started chemo to deal with her breast cancer, and one of the things that helped speed up the end of my grandmother's life was breast cancer, so I don't mess around with it. If there's even a slight possibility something might help prevent breast cancer in my body, I'm there. I've already had that scare once, so it's not something I take lightly. And pomegranates are just a good idea all around. If I can get that great, juicy pomegranate flavor without having to deal with the hassle of getting in to an actual pomegranate, even better.<br /><br />The smell is wonderful. Nice and strong and juicy, I can already taste the delicious smoothies that will come from this. But I'm moving away from the smoothies more and more, as I used to think the only way I would enjoy matcha would be in a smoothie and I have since learned that that is decidedly not true. I'm on my third cup today!<br /><br />I don't know how to describe the taste other than juicy, which I feel like I've been using too much lately. But it's true! All of the fruit blends I've had from Red Leaf Tea have been juicy! This one especially...and I can just see a Matcha Pomtini in my future. Or mix this with a little orange juice? Yum. This tea is definitely one I want to spend a bit of quality time with.

However, at $2.50 a bottle and another $1.00 per bottle shipping, it is hardly worth buying here.  I can get it at our local market--where food is always more expensive than the large conglomerate city stores--for $1.79.

It serves Americanized Mexican food - tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, etc. They are delicious, especially with their small packets of sauces. This mild Taco Bell Restaurant Sauce is full of favors of chili pepper and other spices. I use it with tacos and burritos as well as other non-Mexican dishes. I highly recommend it.  I first noticed bottled Taco Bell sauces in supermarkets a few years ago but they disappeared from the shelves of my favorite supermarket shortly.  Recently, I notice that this Taco Bell sauce is again on the store shelf. See my comment below for additional buying option.

review/text: I use this product for a cookie recipe and it always gives me perfect cookies every time.<br />The only complaint I have is that I cannot get it shipped directly to Hawaii, I have to mail it to a friend on the Mainland and then they ship it to me.

review/summary: One of the best root beers available
review/text: First of all, for most people a birch beer and a root beer are almost the same thing. The taste is similar, and birch root is used in many products labeled as root beer. This company also bottles another soda called root beer, but this tastes better. It has a touch of wintermint in the complex flavor, spices, and vanillas. Nice  creamy texture on the tongue, less carbonation than most, which is good since it allows the flavor to come through. Yet it still has a nice foamy head.  They did not use high fructose corn syrup,  but chose cane sugar as their sweetener. It is more expensive but you can weigh down a soda with the corn syrup. So without it it is lighter and more refreshing.  I have to warn you, you may get spoiled if you drink Boylan's sodas as they are not cheap, but very addictive.<br /><br /> Originally brewed in 1891, this New York classic has the same flavor as it did over a century ago.  Boylan's Birch Beer started in a apothecary in the early 1890's and developed into the most popular flavor of The Boylan Sodaworks. Boylan was a bottling and keg filling operation located in the heart of Paterson, NJ, the first industrialized city in the country. Competition increased however, and in the 1930's Boylan was forced to close its bottling lines, leaving Boylan's Draught Birch Beer as its only product. Shortly thereafter, the rights to the name, the formula, and the sole route was purchased by the driver. His grandkids the Fiorina's still run the company in New Jersey today, and have expanded to near a dozen very delicious flavors. They recently changed to the very good looking and nostalgic bottles and painted on labels that are different than the shown at the time I write this reveiw.

review/text: Although I grew up in NYC, I had not tried a Boylan's until recently when I was in California. I was hooked quickly. Soon I found that this was being carried by Cost Plus, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, BevMo... Now back in NY (Ithaca) I can't find it. One distributor carries it but it's a drive. Sometimes I order a case through Amazon. The Birch is the best Birch I've ever tasted. This is not too sweet and lightly carbonated. Very spicy. Excellent quality. Try the all natural line as well, it's great. The Black Cherry is phenomenal.

review/summary: Best Beer I've had so far!
review/text: I tried this on a road trip when we stopped off in Omaha, Nebraska. I asked a worker at the Durham Museum what the flavor was like and she said 'its root beer with a more bitter flavor.' I tried it and was amazed that it tasted homemade, was less sweet, and better than all the other root beers on the market. I couldn't find this flavor in my hometown so I ordered it on Amazon unsure of how well Boylan's would package it. It arrived in a small box that I thought would have lots of bubble wrap in it but was pleasantly surprised when I found two perfectly die cut styrofoam pieces holding the 12 bottles in place on the top and bottom. I'm finally enjoying this Birch Beer once again!

review/summary: Amazing Birch Beer
review/text: I ordered Boylan's Original Birch Beer, the 12 pack, from Amazon. And the seller did a decent job packaging the bottles. All the bottles arrived intact and safely, and within a good timeframe from when I placed the order. I was first introduced to birch beer when my sister and I dined at Schlafly Bottleworks in St. Louis. My sister and I tried Lewis Osterweis & Sons' birch beer and ginger beer. This brand also has root beer. I liked the birch beer better than the ginger beer. My sister and I thought the taste of the Lewis Osterweis & Sons' birch beer was excellent and amazing. It's similar to root beer or cream soda, but different, unique, and yummy! The problem is that it's very hard to find Lewis Osterweis & Sons' birch beer. You can drink bottles of it at Schlafly Bottleworks or buy some from their giftshop or try to find some bottles at some other places in St. Louis, but other than that, you're kind of out of luck. I went on Amazon, and out of the birch beer products offered, the Boylan brand stood out. I went on Boylan's website and read how these New Jersey-based birch beers have been their "flagship" products for more than 100 years. I like how the birch beer is made with natural cane sugar. I've been a fan of Boylan's other drinks, but I didn't try their birch beer until recently. It's a nice birch beer, and it's great to share these bottles with your friends and family. I give a big thumbs up to this product!

review/summary: Birch Beer rocks!
review/text: I love the flavor and body of Birch Beer. It is almost too light, as I can practically swill it except for the cost. I have been drinking the Creamy Red Birch beer for many years when it is available at Cost Plus, but this original flavor has never been available here, and Cost Plus says that the Red is all that they are shipped. The Red has vanilla in it, but otherwise I think the birch flavor and concentration may be the same.  I couldn't really tell the difference.  I will hop over to Cost Plus before these are all gone and buy some Red for a direct comparison. I do find both the Red and the Original to be a little too sweet for my taste, but the exotic flavors in them make it worthwhile to consume a few now and again.  A couple Birch Beers, after a hike on a summer day, are extremely satisfying, more so than a Coke or a beer.

review/text: Standard purchase this time of year - roasted chestnuts. My husband makes the traditional English chestnut stuffing for Christmas dinner.<br /><br />I tried these trying to do my own private taste testing to see if price and/or packing do make a difference.  These are a half the price of the more expensive ones packed in jars and it is a pretty large bag.  Taste wise they are OK, a little softer than the ones in the jar.  I read the other reviews about them going bad after opening.  I have the remainder of the bag in the refrigerator. Two weeks and  they are ok.  Still smaller portioned bags might be nice.<br /><br />I still say, the best ones are the ones in the jar that Wms. Sonoma sells,  but they sell out FAST.

review/text: Of all the date sugars I've tried to bake with, this is by far my favorite. I simply substitute 1 cup date sugar plus 2-3 tablespoons water (to help it mix well) for 1 cup granulated or brown sugar. I've found that cookies made with date sugar are always better the next day (if they last that long). Great results making peanut butter, brownies, honey snickerdoodles rolled in date sugar and cinnamon, vanilla wafers. For chocolate chip cookies, I mix date sugar with a little water for one type of sugar and unrefined cane sugar (Rapadura or Sucant) for the other. The kids love them!

review/text: Many years ago I began to suspect that sugar consumption was adversely affecting my health.  I cut it out of my diet and noticed an immediate improvement in my energy, and other great benefits as well.  I even went to a doctor and took the fasting test to see if I am diabetic or hypoglycemic but was told that I am not.<br /><br />After that, I read "Sugar Blues", which further confirmed for me that sugar needed to be permanently removed from my family's diet.  Since then I have searched for ways to enjoy sweet treats without the negative effects of sugar.  This syrup is delicious and does not cause any of the problems I noticed after eating sugar!  It's wonderful after literally years of not enjoying pancakes and french toast to have this excellent product.  Thank you Fifty-50; your product is not just for diabetics!

That is quite a statement since it is pretty much impossible to screw up a red (chinook) salmon filet. A bit of salt and brown sugar for a rub, let it sit for a day, pop it into the smoker until it is done. It is automatically delicious and I've never known anyone, even a rank beginner, to screw it up. But somehow these folks found a way to produce a vaguely fishlike slab that tastes of nothing.<br /><br />This was so expensive that I will have to find some way to use it up but it will have to be some way which entirely disguises the lack of salmon taste and that won't be easy to accomplish.

Just the natural sweetness of the bananas and of course, cinnamon.  Each package is 110 calories, so it makes for a good portion controlled snack for weight watchers and a healthy choice for kids.  The other Funky Monkey flavors are just as good.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Crunchy and yummy!
review/text: I suspect the negative reviews are from people who were expecting this to be more like dried fruit. It is not. It's freeze dried, which is not the same thing.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that from way back in my teens, I was a huge fan of Seneca Apple Chips, and also of banana chips. I loved the taste and the texture, but eventually had to back off from both of them because they are deep-fried, and that, to me, doesn't make a great option for a healthy snack. Then, a few years ago, I saw products by Crispy Green on my supermarket shelf, and decided to give them a try. I tried the Crispy Pineapple, Crispy Apples, Crispy Apricots, and couldn't eat any of them. The freeze-dry process left them with a chalky texture that would make my skin crawl when I chewed them. (I have the chills right now, even just writing about that experience.)<br /><br />Then, in August of this year, a friend of mine gave me a bag of Funky Monkey to try. They were so delicious and not at all chalky, I didn't even think that they were freeze-dried! They are so light and airy. They fizz a little bit and melt on your tongue if you don't chew them right away. They are very pleasant to eat, and taste great. And the freeze-dry process retains most of the nutritional value of the original fruit, making this a great option for adults and kids alike.<br /><br />These are NOT apple chips, or banana chips, or dried fruit. If you're not accustomed to freeze-dried fruit, the texture may take some getting used to, but Funky Monkey does a far better job of preventing chalkiness than any other freeze dried fruit snack I've tried. And they have fun, exciting flavors! I brought a case of these along on a camping trip, and they were a huge hit! So many 5 star reviews can't all be wrong, right? If you haven't tasted these, at least give them a try.

review/summary: Bananas for Bananamon
review/text: Bananamon is my son's absolute favorite Funky Monkey flavor. He asks for it at breakfast time (along with lollipops and chocolate--sigh) and I don't mind giving it to him, especially when we're on the go.<br /><br />It's way less messy than toting a banana in the car and he's getting three servings of fruit in the one ounce bag! Plus the only thing that's added is organic cinnamon.<br /><br />What could be better for my little monkey?

review/summary: Crunchier than a fresh banana, but just as healthy
review/text: When you compare the nutritional facts on a package of Funky Monkey Bananamon to that of a medium raw banana (calorie king website) pretty much everything is the same.  The freeze-dried ones contain a tad more sugars (15 vs 21) but the fiber and potassium are right on.<br /><br />Personally, I hate the texture of fresh bananas, but love the banana taste so these crunchy treats were wonderful.  The package clearly states that they are freeze-dried, which is VERY different from a dried fruit.  If you have not before had freeze-dried bananas, try a single pack!  Dried fruit can either be crunchy-hard or soft and pliable, of which these are neither.  They get gummy if you suck on them, so I can see them being a good treat for older infants/young toddlers with fewer teeth.<br /><br />The cinnamon was a nice touch to the banana, and not overwhelming at all.  My 3 1/2 year old tried to eat a whole bag without sharing, and now that I've compared to the "real" thing, I will let her!  These are going to be great to have on the run when a fresh banana just won't make it (like in the glove box during a WI winter).  The cost will prevent us from making these more common in our household, but with an expiration date 2 1/2 years away... well, a case would never last my child that long anyhow!

review/text: To be perfectly honest, this is the first time I've ever had Korean BBQ and it absolutely knocked my socks off.  A close friend recommended Mama Eun's home delivery service and I decided to go for it.  I placed my order, paid the bill, and forgot all about it.... until one day when the delivery guy dropped a package on my doorstep.<br /><br />Mama Eun's packaging system is great!  Everything came securely wrapped up inside a cozy disposable (or reusable) ice cooler.  The freezer packs inside kept the meat nice and cold during shipping and are now hard at work in my freezer (nice bonus!).<br /><br />Then, I went to town.<br /><br />I tossed about half of the package onto the grill and a few minutes later the aroma had my mouth watering.  Seriously, people - this is great stuff!  Everything is already marinated inside the package and ready to go.  The meat was so tender and fresh I seriously reconsidered every buying any kind of meat at my local grocer ever again.  Who knew delivered food items could be so darn yummy!<br /><br />Now I'm hooked.  I love Mama Eun's "homemade style" and business approach.  Everything was very professional (but not in a lame corporate way).  They even included some cooking tips/directions in the delivery.  Needless to say, i was very impressed by this company and will be back again soon.  I'm placing my next order right now...

review/text: I ordered this because I once bought great teabags called Two Leaves and a Bud that came in a triangular shaped teabag and were very good.<br /><br />These are not that. I am not sure if the manufacturer has downgraded their quality or what but here are problems with these that I didn't have when I originally bought from this company a year ago:<br /><br />The teabags are packed together more tightly now and are squished into small plastic packages, you are supposed to expand the teabag into it's original 3D shape afterwards, this doesn't work as well as the original packaging.<br /><br />But the bigger problem is that the bit of paper on the end of the teabag string (does this have a name?) is glued, actually STUCK, in each individual package to the teabag portion. Try as you might to detach it so you can put only the bag and not the paper into your tea, it will rip the bag, and then tea leaves will leak out! I should call it tea dust becuase tea leaves are what they used tohave, but squished into thier new package they are just and expensive version of any other organic camomile tea, they are no longer the cool unique ones that had really quality tea in them.<br /><br />I am a pretty picky person about my tea, but I am very dissapointed overall as this is not what I remember or expected about the quality of this tea.

review/summary: Very weak... and a hint of plastic?
review/text: The sachets come individually wrapped in plastic baggies.  For a large cup (say ~16 oz), you'd need 3-4 sachets to brew a tea that wasn't obviously weak.  I tried it well before the box's expiration date, so that wasn't the problem.  As the tea soaked in the water, it seemed to develop a faint taste of plastic.  Not sure where that's coming from.  Could be the baggie it was in or the sachet, which is made out of some kind of plastic fabric.

review/summary: Not up to my expectations
review/text: I purchased a quart carton of chamomile tea at a street fair about 2 years ago.  I started using it a few months ago and it was excellent, in spite of its age.  It had a great calming effect on me and I went to sleep about 20 minutes after drinking it.  Thinking it was "cheap" (after all, I bought it at a street fair), I ordered Two Leaves and a Bud brand from Amazon and it was awful!  I had to use 3-4 tea bags in a single cup  to achieve any degree of strength or taste or desired result.  In my opinion, the packaging is gorgeous; the product leaves a lot to be desired.
