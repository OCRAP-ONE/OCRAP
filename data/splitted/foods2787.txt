review/summary: Ah, Back In France Again!
review/text: Seems France knows what to do with butter (beurre).  If you've ever sampled the delicious butter made in the north, in Brittany and Normandy, you know what I'm saying.  The French are masters of using butter in cooking.  So, in turn, the French know butter cookies.  These are French butter cookies, and it's quite a treat finding them on Amazon. Vive Le Petit Beurre!

review/summary: Buy Them Off the Shelf
review/text: For years, the only Lu's I could find at my local market were the USA Lu's, which aren't as good as the Belgium biscuits.  So, I was happy to find them at Amazon this past July, 2012 and bought the case of six boxes.  Unfortunately, they didn't taste fresh and had an expiration date of Dec. 2012; that explained the stale taste, but I chose not to return them.  Instead, I nuke two in the microwave for 5 or 6 seconds and it sort of revives the flavor.<br /><br />Well, last week, Sept. 14, 2012, I found the Belgium Lu at my local supermarket and bought a single box.  That box expires Dec. 2013, over a year from now, and the cookies definitely taste better.  Moral of the story: Buy them where you can read the Expiration date.  I surmise that having a year or two shelf life should be about right.

review/summary: PIMS ORANGE
review/text: This is the second (and last) time in a few years that I buy Pim's Orange from Amazon. Like the first time, I was disappointed, not because of the cookie itself, which is normally delicious--as a French person, I am very familiar with PIM'S cookies and know what they should taste and look like--, but because of the improper manner in which the packages are stored and handled along the way (I cannot figure out at which end). Obviously, the packages go from cold to hot temperatures (or vice versa), possibly multiple times, which is the worst thing that can happen to cookies incorporating chocolate and filling: this alters their appearance and consistency--chocolate surface becomes discolored and collapses due to melting before regaining some firmness, and the cookie part and filling become too soft. The taste is not affected too badly, but you cannot serve them to guests, because of the cookies' miserable appearence.  In order to save them anyway for my own consumption, I wrap the individual packs in a bath towel and store them in the vegetable compartment of my refrigerator. That helps regain some firmness in the cookies, but of course the chocolate surface remains discolored. So my advice is:  buy individual packs at your grocery store if they carry PIM'S, because the cookies are normally delicious, but do not buy them from Amazon.  It's too bad that Amazon has done nothing so far to correct this storage problem. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, to my satisfaction 99 p.100 of the time, including LU "Petit Beurre" cookies (these are rarely available in US grocery stores). Since they include no chocolate or filling, the shipments are usually in perfect condition.  I give PIM,S Orange three stars because the product is excellent under normal conditions, and the problem is not caused by the manufacturer.

review/text: My French teacher (native French) introduced these cookies to me. I tried to bake these at home following a reliable recipe but it just didn't taste/feel the same. As a healthy eater, I usually don't consume much butter. But the "petit beurre" biscuits are now my favorite companion for tea or coffee. They are not heavy or too sweet--just perfect in its texture, taste, and design. I just received a box of 6 just 2 days after ordering (go Amazon prime!) and couldn't help but enjoy two biscuits right away--yum! Probably going to order more once these are gone.

review/text: I'm always on the hunt for the best Scottish Shortbread and after several other brands, I found Lu's to the the BEST for any mass made shortbread cookies out there.  Visitors always comment how good they are and often switch to this brand after trying it just once.  Scottish Shortbread is supposed to be buttery, dense and not sweet, just a bare minimum of sweetness.<br /><br />Don't even bother with Wxxxxx's...blech!  If you like Scottish Shortbread, almost like homemade, then this is the one!  I'm so happy it's available on Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" program.

review/text: These "soft biscuits" are less like biscuits/cookies and more like really really dense cake. It was quite a surprise when I first tried one because I was expecting something similar to the soft cookies you buy in the grocery store. Never the less, the taste is very good with the raspberry filling being nicely complemented by the dark chocolate.<br /><br />The flavor is nice but the cookie part was too odd for me so I won't be buying this again. Still, I think there are probably a lot of people who would enjoy this product and if you like raspberry and dark chocolate you may want to give it a try.

review/text: These shortbread cookies are amazing. They are made of only 4 simple ingredients (wheat flour, butter, sugar, and salt), and they taste heavenly. If you made these cookies yourself, at home, you would use the same ingredients. There is nothing artificial added.<br /><br />Besides all of that, they are crispy, very satisfying and not too sweet. My grandchildren love them as much as I do. If you like shortbread, you will love these cookies. If you haven't tried shortbread cookies, I suggest you give these a try and start with the best, right from the Scottish Highlands.

So this week I was back in my Fresh and Easy Market and the Z bars were still on sale. This time I bought a 6-bar box of the Chocolate Brownie Bars.They're excellent. Nice rich dark chocolate flavor. Somewhat chewy and grainy. Not at all like a candy bar. Each bar is made out of 8 grams of whole grains plus 12 vitamins and minerals. They work out to 130 calories per bar and they've got a good fiber content. Not bad for a treat-type item.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: terrific variety for coffee lovers
review/text: There is something for every type of coffee lover in this package.  My husband especially enjoys the bold flavor of Newman's Own and for a full-bodied coffee taste, he goes for the French Roast.  I prefer the Caribou for my morning "wake-up" and appreciate the smoothness of the Nantucket blend.  All around favorite collection of coffees for us!

Anytime something says expired and you just bought it, well, that doesn't instill a lot of confidence in how the company inventories their products.

review/text: Never really had a problem purchasing k cups, However, I decided I wanted more of a variety, so I went with this product. My wife and I were extremelyl disappointed to say the least. 3/4 of the k cups were different kinds of decaf coffee. I don't know about the rest of you, but I mostly drink coffee as a wake me up in the morning, not for the taste. (which I find bland). Decaf flavors should be sprinkled in here or there, not dominate the entire package.

review/summary: special edition packaging leaves tons to be desired
review/text: I was a little disappointed with this collection.  It came in a shipping box as if the different pods were just thrown in there according to the combination described online.  When I read it was a "collectors" edition, I assumed more care would be taken in the packaging and the packaging itself would be special. Instead it's just a print that they put in with the coffee -- it's a black and white print that isn't any better quality than your regular poster.  The coffee itself is as described (although there are so many "bold" flavors that I'm not sure how they can claim this is a medium roast collection).  If you are looking to sample different brands and types of coffee, this works.  However, being new to Keurig brewing, I'm not sure if this is price comparable and if it costs more for the special "limited edition" package for this collection, I'd skip it as it's not worth the additional cost.

This box was shipped to and arrived in Alaska without problem.  More recently when I attempted to order more K-cup coffee via Amazon, the order was refused with the excuse it couldn't be shipped to Alaska.  So, based on that I won't be buying my coffee from Amazon in the future.  How dumb is that?

review/text: Really good selection and variety, however I only got 20 different favors instead of 24, and they seemed to prefer one brand, instead of evening out the order. 7 out of 35 are decaf, so it's not bad, but not great. And since I am ordering medium roast, chances are I don't want a bold or extra bold flavor and 7 of them were just that. So those are going to have to get a lot of cream.<br /><br />13 Green Mountain Coffee, 2 of them blend over ice. Not sure I am looking forward to that.<br />3 Donut Shop<br />1 Van Houtte =( and it is decaf. I love this brand, and I only got 1<br />4 Caribou<br />7 Wolfgang Puck<br />2 Newman's Own, both extra bold<br />4 Tully's<br />1 Barista Prima Coffeehouse<br /><br />Overall, I would probably order again.

review/text: I've tried about half a dozen of the crazy cups samplers.  Except for the chocolate one that was mostly powdered hot chocolate in a cup and very little coffee, they're a great way to experience a wide variety of flavors from different companies without having to buy into a big box full.  I've found flavors and varieties I hadnt seen before that we liked.  What we tend to do is buy the 2-3 varieties we usually use in bulk to keep the cost per cup down, then we salt the collection with one of these variety boxes to spice things up.

The Green Mountain is not bad either but not as smooth.  And I have had no complaints about the other flavors from the hubby.  At the price we got it for I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Great idea for coffee tasting from Amazon
review/text: This is a great idea when you're new to this whole Keurig thing (which I am) and I wanted to taste and test these brands before buying because this stuff is expensive.  I'm glad I purchased it but I must say that what probably works for most people doesn't work for me.  I like really bold and strong coffee and I found the coffee in this sampler to be "wimpy" which is to say it's probably great coffee for normal drinkers.  However, if you like bold and strong I recommend buying the Green Mountain BOLD or stick with Starbucks BOLD (any flavor) as long as you have the word BOLD.  Every other brand is too weak which is probably "normal".  I did determine in this experiment that I would only buy Green Mountain if I can't get my first choice which is Starbucks brand.

review/text: This set comes with four different coffees.  Here's my feedback on each.<br /><br />Green Mountain Nantucket Blend: This is probably the best of the bunch.  Just an all around good coffee without being overly rich or laced with any extra flavors.  It smells great and tastes smooth.<br /><br />Newman's Own Organics Special Blend: This is my second favorite.  Paul may be known for his salad dressing, but he also makes a good cuppa.<br /><br />Caribou Blend: No complaints, but it's nothing special.  Just a regular run of the mill coffee.<br /><br />Tully's French Roast: This is my least favorite of the bunch.  The coffee seems a bit watery and bland.  I never have been a fan of French roast so that may weigh in on my opinion.<br /><br />Overall this is a good collection of K-cups for your morning coffee fix.  Perfect for someone who doesn't want any flavored or frilly coffee, just a straight up good cup of Joe.

review/text: My sampler pack arrived the day after I ordered it, so kudos for quick delivery! Although I bought the 35 cup sampler, there were only 33 cups in the box, so the people packaging should be more careful. I would have made a stink about it, but since it's a great deal I thought it wasn't worth the time to complain. None of my cups were damaged.<br /><br />On to the coffee: I received a nice sampling of coffees...I think I got at least one of every coffee shown in the picture. Many were doubles, which is fine by me, and I was pleased that there were 7 decaf cups included (including the half caf). I'm loving the medium roast coffees so far...we have found the light roasts to be a little on the weak side (especially the flavored coffees), and this is a great way to sample different kinds without committing to a whole box. I recommend this option if you are new to the K Cups or you're looking for something different to try.<br /><br />So, overall, we are happy with this purchase. I would have given it 5 stars if they had given me all 35 k cups!

review/text: I wanted to back up a previous review that you really are NOT getting 35 medium roast K cups.  This is a nice assortment though and of my 35 I would have guess that half were medium roast - I also had about 10 bold or dark and about 7 or so DeCaf.  Personally I was OK with the mix and I like the selection - Decaf is great for a late day coffee!  Also note that the price fluctuates greatly on this I paid $27.50 at one point and my next order is under $18.  I have seen this on MANY items on AMAZON so keep an eye on that if you buy.  All in All though I thought this was a good deal!!

Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was exactly what I was looking for and am enjoying them each day when I wake up and, at times, during the day.  I have served them to friends when they come to visit, and they have complimented me on how good the cup of coffee is.  I tell them that it was all done with the Keurig brewer and unfortunately, I had nothing to do with that cup of coffee.  They smile and enjoy their coffee.<br />I will be ordering this assortment again when the current one gets towards the end.

review/summary: Decent Mix
review/text: What you see is what you get....not a stunning variety, but adequate. There are 12 each of four different kinds: 12 Tullys French Roast, 12 Caribou Blend, 12 Newmans Blend, and 12 Green Mountain Nantucket Blend. Nothing out of the ordinary or exciting but a solid way to restock a collection with some variety for different tastes.

review/summary: Excellent Collection of Morning Coffees
review/text: I got the Keurig for Christmas from my loving wife, and this was the first box of coffees I purchased after exhausting the sampler that came with the machine. There are four different coffees in the box; two are very bold, robust coffees and the other two are milder. I like all four, and will definitely buy this collection again.

review/summary: Too expensive
review/text: This collection<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TM5458">K-Cup Coffee for Keurig Brewers, Coffee Lover's Collection - 48 Count</a> works out to nearly one dollar a cup. I can see that manufacturers would like to sell a machine with a high use cost [just like cheap printers with cartridges that constantly have to be replaced] but surely most people will give some thought to the cost per cup. Costco sells a box of Tully cups at $37 for 80, less than fifty cents a cup.

review/text: Three of the four coffees are excellent ... but the Green Mountain Nantucket Blend I thought was Rather qweak and unimpressive.<br />They titled this "For Coffee Lover's" son I expected flavorful somewhat bold brands to be included. The other three were.<br />I have since found a Green Mountain brand called Sumatran Reserve, extra bold which is excellent, but according to their literature, they have over 50 types of coffee availabe in the K-cup format........only one of the many brands for the K-cup... quite a selection.

I only used half of the sauce packet and I still thought my face was going to explode.  It is just unbelievably salty.  Of course, if I had read the nutrition facts carefully, I would have noticed the 980mg of sodium.  980!

review/summary: The Best Instant Noodle Meals You Can Buy!
review/text: Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that "crunch" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)

review/summary: One of the top two brands of Decaf K-Cups
review/text: If you like your coffee a little stronger than mid-strength, this one is for you!  You would never know this is decaf coffee.  I'm a very fussy coffee drinker - too weak = bla;  too strong = bitter and undrinkable.<br /><br />Tully's coffee as a rule is a little stronger then the GM brand, overall. Typically 'House' blends don't mean a whole lot to me, but this one is exceptional.  Not bitter, not watery, wonderful aroma. The only other decaf brand I would ever recommend is Emeril's. All the other brands are too weak for me.<br /><br />My husband can only drink decaf and we tried every, single brand when we were switching from ground coffee to the K-cup.  This is the only one he liked - and he doesn't like strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee - WE BOTH LOVE THIS ONE!  (finally we agree on something)<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I bought Tully's Decaf House Blend Coffee K-Cups in bulk, originally on E-Bay, because of a really good deal. I hadn't tried it before, and was worried that I had made a big mistake, buying it. I was supprised after my first cup, at it's strength, and full bodied flavor. It is now my most favorite k-cup coffee. I was never into "Decaf" before, and I feel that this coffee will make, both Decaf and Regular coffee drinkers alike, very happy. Don't hessitate to try this blend, you will not be sorry.

review/summary: A good cup of decaf
review/text: It is difficult to find a good tasting decaf coffee. Often it's due to lack of selection and or attempt to please too many tastes. I tend to go for a strong yet "un-smoky" cup of coffee. Not too many decafs fit that bill. While this could be even a bit stronger for me it has the most body and flavor balance I've found in decaf yet...in traditional or K-Cup varieties.

review/text: Although the flavor of the coffee is good, the K-cup is not properly sealed.  The cover seal breaks when brewing, resulting in coffee grounds in the brewed coffee and coffee coffee grounds in the Keurig brewer.  This necessitates a thorough cleaning of the brewer each time a new K-cup is used.  I ordered and received two boxes of Tullys House Blend.  I have not opened the second box because of the inferior seal on the K-cup.

review/summary: K-Cup foil not sealed and hot coffee spurts out all over
review/text: We purchased two 24-count packages of Tully's House Decaf. Obviously something went wrong in manufacturing of these K-Cups.  After we began the brew cycle, very hot coffee came out over the top of the K-Cup and the compartment in many directions and only a portion of it went into our mug below.  Thinking it was only a problem with that one, we tried another.  When it happened again, we investigated more closely.  The foil seal over the top of the K-Cup is not complete.  Very hot water under pressure inside the K-Cup was forced up and out, along with coffee grounds, and sprayed quite a distance from the machine. Our Keurig is in the bedroom - what a mess!
