review/summary: Great Product... Raised prices after 2 purchases
review/text: We are a small company that does BBQ 6 days a week. We were purchasing BBQ sauce monthly for the buisness. We bought about 24 bottles a month. Two months ago I found it on Amazon.com for ALOT less expensive. I have now ordered it 2 months in a row. I logged back on this month to do my monthly purchase and I went onto my previous purchases and clicked onto the link...I than found the BBQ sauce went up quite a bit and the shipping is now almost doubled. Same seller as before. I dont get it. How is it the pricing goes up so much from one month to another. Last month I paid $50.40 with shipping and handling, this month I am expected to pay $84.10. How did that happen?

review/summary: first time taster
review/text: This has the same consistency as natural peanut butter, however, i found this very hard to swallow. It's very very chalky, takes time to get used to this. It had a lot of little specks, i assume this would have been A LOT better if the almonds were blanched..smoother and easier to swallow. So buyers beware, this is grinded up roasted almonds not blanched roasted almonds.

review/summary: Tastes good but poor packaging
review/text: This is the best almond butter I've had, and it mixes more easily than other brands I've tried. However, when I opened the jar after it arrived, the jar was only 3/4 of the way full. The almond butter went to just past the top of the label on the jar - there was at least an inch of empty space. For the cost of this item, it should be a full jar, or the company should pack the almond butter in smaller containers.

review/text: I bought this because the price was good and it was convenient to carry to restaurants. I have been using xylitol for several years and like that it has NO aftertaste.  This product has a bad aftertaste.  The little bit of sucralose they added to the xylitol to make the product sweeter takes over and leaves a sickening aftertaste.  If you are used to using Splenda or other sucralose based products you probably will not notice it but I really did.  Will not be buying this product again.

Easily my favorite flavored cracker at this point in time.<br /><br />So why not a 5?<br /><br />Well, writegirl is correct in her review below. I have yet to get a box that was not at least 50% broken. For my purposes, this is not a huge problem as I never use them to dip or for hors d'oeuvres. I tend to eat them plain as snacks. But if you intend to use them to entertain, or need them intact to hold a topping, then you may have a problem.

review/text: I've tried a lot of KCups, looking for the fresh, dark, really rich espresso-roast flavor that I love; all of them seemed weak and/or flatly bitter compared to my dark beans-by-the-pound favorites. I'm almost a coffee snob and only bought the Keurig because my mornings are just too rushed, sort of a shocking decision. I love the convenience of the machine, but it was like grabbing a cup at the convenience store taste-wise - just the required morning medication, eh.<br /><br />So I was really, really surprised and delighted when I discovered this one. I hear they pack the Barista blends with more coffee - that does seem to be the case, they're plump little cuppies.<br />And wow, a real espresso taste, zero acidity, darkly fruity and full-bodied, and for once not tasting watered down. If you don't like espresso you won't like it, especially neat. But with half and half and sugar this one's really wonderful, too.  Love it, love it.

review/text: I've been a Timothy's Rainforest Espresso fan for a couple of years now but this coffee is giving it a run for the money (well not really because it's overpriced).<br /><br />I delayed purchasing it (I have a $.50/cup limit and Barista runs twice that) until I found it on sale. Having used Keurig pots since they first came out a decade ago and having tried about 80 flavors, I find myself choosing this one over the Rainforest for my first cup each morning.  It's flavor is bolder and clearer than Rainforest and seems more satisfying.  We have a house full of guests now and the carousel has dozens of different coffees on it but the Barista coffees are the ones I keep having to refill.<br /><br />Still I ding it one star because of price.<br /><br />8/12 - found them for $.60 a k-cup (box of 96).  Bought two boxes which will last me two months.  Love this coffee.<br /><br />10/12 - Been drinking Barista Italian for 10 months now and have tried over a dozen new options in the interim.  None came close to the robustness of this coffee.

review/summary: Best dark roast k-cup by far
review/text: I am pretty picky when it comes to my coffee.  Tried just about everything.  Can not stand the weak blends and only like dark roasts (extra bold).  Used to drink Timothy's Parisian Nights, Midnight Magic and Green Mountains Dark Magic on medium water selection to get a strong enough brew, but now Barista Prima French Roast ONLY, on the large water setting.  Even with extra water it is perfect.  Little pricier than some of the others, but it is worth it, plus I get a full cup of coffee now when I brew on the large water setting.  I should also mention I only use filtered water when I brew my coffee, makes a huge difference.  Filtered water and a Barista Prima French Roast K-cup and it will by far blow everything else out of the water.  Nothing else compares.  If you like a really dark, smooth, flavorful coffee, you must try this.  You will not be disappointed.  But keep in mind, this is only for people who truly like the darkest roast (i.e. I think it curls my hair). Serious coffee drinkers only!

review/summary: Good Coffee for a Designer Coffee
review/text: I have gradually come to realize good coffee doesn't have to bite your head off. People have been convinced that the more your socks curl, the better it is. This is a pretty mellow but substantial brew. It doesn't have the hardcore after taste and isn't bitter. No fruity or whatever else descriptors. It's just a good basic cup of coffee for the average person. Basic is what I'm looking for in the morning.

review/text: One of the best k-cups we've had.  If you miss the way starbucks tasted on the Tassimo, this is the closest thing you will find in the k-cup world.  Coffee was great and the price was very good too.  Super saver shipping took FOREVER.  They sat on the order for a week before even shipping it and then it was another 4 days to get to us.  I actually had to go out and buy a box before this arrived which was what I was trying to avoid by ordering it online.  Used to order all my coffee online from Amazon before they dumbed down the free shipping.  Now, not so much.

review/summary: Italian Roast very nice
review/text: Amazon seems to have combined the reviews for three different products here, Italian, French, and Columbian. I picked up a box of the Italian Roast at the grocery, and I really like it. It is strong and full flavored without bitterness. For hot coffee, I make the larger size cup, and the smaller for iced coffee. I checked Amazon to see if I could save money, but it looks like the same price I paid at the store ($9.99 for a box of 12).

review/text: At first I thought I had wasted my money. I hated this coffee. It is very bitter. Then I had a great idea...use it for iced coffee.  I brew it for a medium cup. Fill a tall glass with ice. Fill glass 1/3 full with milk. Add your favorite creamer. Add coffee and stir. So if you hate this coffee hot, try it cold.

Love the smoky flavorl  I recommend you buy it straight from Keruig, as a member (which is free) you can get a box of 24 for 17.24.  I always order 3 boxes at a time and get free shipping.  Also like the Italian roast, but is a bit stronger and, I think, harsher flavor.  Where ever you end up buying Prima French Roast, you'll come back for more!

review/text: My wife is a coffee snob ( she calls herself that too) and we have browsed Amazon for K cups for  a couple years, We must have purchased every dark French Roast there is. All the coffee was good but just was not "it" until we ordered this coffee. Finally a coffee dark, bold enough yet smooth and not bitter. She even runs it thru the machine twice and still gets a good cup of coffee. May cost a little more than others we have purchased but well worth it. Now when re-ordering I can just go to my last coffe order and re-order same. Simple, quick and satisfing. Plus it has a cool picture of the Eifle Tower on the box.

review/text: This Columbia Blend leans more to the medium side than the bold side of coffee.  However, there is a slight kick to it, so solid medium coffee drinkers may want to take a pass.<br /><br />The blend is also slightly bitter, but not so bitter that it would be considered a harsh taste.  The bitter can be toned down by milk, which would leave no significant aftertaste.<br /><br />I would put this kcup in the same category as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>, although I would choose this Barista Prima Columbia blend over the Caribou Blend.<br /><br />This is an OK blend, but there are better coffee blends on the market.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers.

review/summary: Ahh, the smell of horse shit conveniently sealed and preserved within a can...
review/text: I like pizza.  But regular pizza literally destroys my body (celiac disease and dairy allergy - yes, it does suck).  So my love of food has driven me to learn how to make decent versions of food I like which are gluten and dairy free.  I am now a MASTER pizza chef, to put it modestly.  Practically a PIZZA GOD.  I've got the pizza stone, the piel, found the best gf crust, the best df cheese, and the result is usually pretty great.<br /><br />ANYWAY...<br /><br />I like mushrooms on my pizza, specifically SLICED mushrooms, and I make pizza at home often enough that checking out at the grocery store with 20 or 30 cans of sliced mushrooms draws awkward stares.  The solution, of course, is to order in bulk via Amazon.  Have done this many times, trying out different brands, etc.  I'm almost certain I'd purchased this exact product in the past with no issues...but this latest shipment brought with it a harrowing ordeal involving smelly mushrooms and untopped pizzas.<br /><br />At first I thought I might have gotten a bad can, so I tossed the first stinky one.  Then the next one smelled just as bad.  Now - the smell isn't a rotten smell or an unnatural smell.  The best way I can describe it is a combination of normal canned mushroom smell and... horse shit.  If you don't know what horse shit smells like just imagine dog shit with a lot of hay and some mud mixed in.  So I stopped there and made my pizza without toppings.<br /><br />The next day or two when I made another pizza I decided maybe my sense of smell had been off before and to try opening another can of mushrooms from the same case.  Same fecal smell.  Even after extensive rinsing it smelled like I had been rinsing the mushrooms in an unflushed toilet bowl.  I had my wife smell the can (oh, she LOVES being asked to smell-check gross stuff...actually, no).  She agreed with the horse shit description.  I put the remaining cans back on a high shelf far out of sight.<br /><br />When next I went to the grocery store (actually, Target I think) I got a couple cans of Green Giant sliced mushrooms and later when I used them on a pizza they smelled totally normal and free of ungulate diarrhea.  You can see in the attached image how one of my normal pizzas comes out...with normal mushrooms.<br /><br />So I'm highly disappointed...and it's left me feeling unsure of any Giorgio mushroom cans...and unsure about any organic mushroom cans...and just about canned mushrooms in general.  I like to use fresh when I have them (like, as I write this)...but most of the time when I make a pizza I use canned shrooms.  But I feel deeply scarred by this turd-infused experience and may have trouble trusting any canned mushrooms for a while.  Which is definitely going to cramp my style pizza-wise.  LAME!<br /><br />(In case anyone is wondering, this is not a joke, even if it may be funny to laugh at my stinky mushroom ordeal.  I lived it and I have the battle scars to prove it.)

review/summary: Tried them for the first time today......
review/text: Today I tried the spaghetti Tofu Shirataki noodles by House Foods. I would give these noodles a five stars if it weren't for the pre-preparation that is involved. I found these at my local Asian mart for about $2.00.<br /><br />First you must rinse these noodles well because the liquid they come in smells like a lake (you should prepare yourself for the smell). Second, you need to lay out the noodles on paper towels and press down removing as much of the liquid as possible before use.<br /><br />Next I fried them on high heat with a small amount of oil and butter. After a few minutes I then added my frozen stir-fry vegetable medley. I then added some broth, soy sauce, and finally a thickener such as corn starch. Stir it up, bring to a boil, and turn it off.<br /><br />Really it tasted great- very much like the ramen noodles.  It is important to note that the noodles themselves have "no flavor" and actually absorb the flavor of whatever ingredients you are cooking them in. So let them sit it whatever flavor suits you.

review/summary: Tofu Shirataki Noodles
review/text: I first heard about Shirataki noodles years ago and decided I would try it.  I went to Fiesta and got these Tofu Shirataki Noodle.  Shirataki are made from Konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture. The noodles without tofu added is 0 calories.  The one with tofu is 20 cal per 4 oz which is low in cal. I always rinse the noodles first. I never cook it longer than 3 minutes. The first time I ever made Shirataki Noodles I cooked it like regular pasta and it turned into a gel--this was years ago. I learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how I make these noodles. The next time I made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce. That didn't work for me, since the flavors did not merry and I was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta. The noodles are similar to the texture of vermicelli rice noodles. I personally prefer it in soups and not as a substitute for spaghetti.  I would sometimes eat it with a sauce I make with soy sauce, shredded ginger, chili paste, and sprinkle green onions on top for looks.  I have tried this rinsed without it being cooked and it has no flavor whatsoever.  It isn't like Ramen noodles which as a flavor without anything added.  Even though I still eat the Tofu Shirataki, I just got the one without tofu and it is very similar.  The one without tofu is 0 cal which is a plus.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I did some more research on Shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes.  I found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired.  It seems Shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long.  These noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner, something it seems some people like.  I went to the store that I used to get my Tofu Shirataki noodles, and looked at the for an expiration date.  Lo and behold, it was expired by over a year.  I even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years.  It seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long.  My mom used it in stir fry, and I have also tried it baked which is also a great idea.  I been lazy and not just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine...I just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup.

review/text: I tried both these and just the plain shirataki noodles with zero calories purchased at my local Asian market and I prefer these the best. The plain Shirataki feel like a noodle shaped gummie candy when you eat them...not as hard but too 'slippery'..The House Brand with tofu didn't have that same 'slippery' taste. I didnt find preperation to be that bothersome as a couple of posters have mentioned. I just open them and pour them in a strainer and let the water run over them throughly, flipping them once or twice to get them rinsed well then I toss them in a pan of boiling water for about 15 seconds (they're already cooked) drain and season them however I wish. They have been a great addition to my low calorie diet. I just tried them last night with a packet of seasoning from a box of Suddenly Salad (classic) and I was in heaven...40 calories for the WHOLE bag!

review/summary: Fantastic Product
review/text: How nice it is to no longer be deprived of pasta and noodles. If you follow a low carb lifestyle, then House Foods Shirataki (Tofu) Noodles are heaven sent. I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one. This is an excellent, healthy alternative to pasta and noodles that will not wreak havoc upon your glycemic index. Good cooks will have no problem incorporating this into their menu planning.

review/summary: NOTHING like regular pasta
review/text: I agree with the other reviewer, the preparation alone with these noodles would cause me to give them fewer then five stars. However, if they tasted like regular pasta with only 40 calories a bag, I could deal. Unfortunately, they are disgusting. I am a big fan of the cookbook author/food blogger Hungry Girl, and she uses these all the time so I had to try them. Needless to say I was very disappointed. They were very chewy (she told her fans this, so I was prepared for it), smelled nauseating when I opened the bag (rotting vegetables or fish smell maybe?), and had a bizarre taste. Regular pasta just kind of works as a texture filler for dishes, but these noodles had a strong and weird, chalky flavor. I will NEVER, EVER buy them again and will just settle for eating pasta dishes made with whole wheat noodles only once in a while. If you still feel the need to try them, I'd recommend buying only one bag until you know whether or not they are for you.

review/summary: This is my favorite variety of shirataki noodles
review/text: I'm trying to limit my carbs but I am a noodle addict. I've tried several varieties of shirataki noodles, different shapes, with and without tofu and I like these ones best. The thicker ones just have a weird texture to me - too gummy and gelatinous. The angel hair ones come out very similar to thin rice noodles. They're pretty easy to use compared to cooking any pasta from dry.  Just give them a rinse and parboil for about 2 minutes and dry them off before putting them in whatever you're cooking. In my opinion, they do not work well in place of semolina pasta - they are much more like rice noodles with very little flavor of their own.  I especially like them in seafood curry stir-fry - masks any fishy smell that might still be on them.

review/summary: A delicious way to save on your WW points!!
review/text: I first discovered these while searching through some Hungry Girl recipes. I simply dump the bag into a colander and rinse well, removing all of the water that the noodles were packed in. Then I blot them dry and throw them on a microwaveable plate and microwave for 1 minute. I again blot all the excess water and microwave for one more minute. That way the noodles are cooked, the "weird odor" is completely gone, and the noodles are similar to al dente. I just dump whatever my sauce/concoction I made for the noodles over it and toss! If it seems time consuming with the microwave- think about waiting 12-14 minutes for pasta to boil- not to mention time for the water to come to a boil ;).<br /><br />I would buy these noodles in a HEARTBEAT on here, but that's just highway robbery to pay 10$ in shipping!! I'm going to give Miracle Noodles a try because I can't afford to pay 28$ for a few bags of noodles and they have free shipping. C'mon House Foods!! 10$?

review/summary: Great Asia Noodle
review/text: If you are looking for something to substitute for pasta this ain't it. These are great for asian dishes like noodle soup, stir fry etc. We love them and a side benefit is they are good for you. If you want a wheat pasta substitute try the rice pasta (not the asian rice noodles), just do not over cook them.

review/summary: a diet saver
review/text: Let me start by admitting that I am no fan of most food substitutes. Vegan cheese is the perhaps the most disgusting food on earth, sugar substitutes make me bitter, and tofu dogs are like some kind of rank joke to me. But my favorite food is spaghetti, and pasta is very limited on any healthy diet.<br /><br />Enter these noodles! I rinsed them in hot water, mixed in with some hot tomato-basil pasta sauce, a few ounces of ground turkey breast meat, and topped it with a couple tablespoons of parmesan cheese, and I had a perfectly acceptable bowl of spaghetti for under 300 calories. Add a nice veggie to the meal, and you are eating like a true health pro.<br /><br />Next, I am going to try Miracle Noodles in an Asian stir-fry. Hurray for shirataki noodles!

I have a history of gestational diabetes, so when I found out I was pregnant again, I became very interested in lo carb options to control my diabetes through diet.  These are great!

review/summary: Good for Asian-style food, but pricey per serving
review/text: I bought 3 pasta shape varieties of these 8 oz. 2-serving bags of noodles in liquid in the refrigerated tofu section of our local grocery store for $1.99 per bag yesterday.  I am puzzled how they can be sold and shipped since the front of the bag states "perishable - keep refrigerated".  I opened the bag and smelled the noodles, and they did have a rather strange, strong odor.  I immediate poured the noodles into a strainer and then rinsed them under cold water.  I put them in a sauce pan with a small amount of Lorivo expeller-pressed peanut oil and let them sit for a while, stirring occasionally.  I decided to add Guilin chili sauce, garlic powder, powdered ginger, a small amount rice vinegar, water, 3 - 4 tsp. coconut sap sugar and 1/2 large can drained bean sprouts.  I warmed this mixture for awhile - maybe 20 or more minutes.  It worked!  I created a palatable side dish with a good- tasting broth and appealing consistency.<br /><br />I served this side dish with broiled tuna, mahi mahi, and a Spring greens salad mix with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.<br />I wish that these noodles were available in larger sized bags at a lower price per serving, but $1 per person for two modest serving sizes per bag isn't outrageous unless you compare this with the cost of regular pasta.  I added the bean sprouts because the noodles alone didn't look like enough food for 3 people, and I thought that adding bean sprouts would offset any texture issues with the noodles. This recipe has now worked out twice with no real concern about cooking time for the noodles. Maybe the vinegar is the key, but the noodles are just like any other noodles when prepared this way and they make a great noodles with Asian-style broth meal or side dish.  And finally ... a use for those canned bean sprouts!<br /><br />Update:  I have now mixed these with baked tofu and Asian-style sauce. That combo worked out great.  Also I took the wide noodles, rinsed them and then put them in spaghetti sauce to simmer.  They tasted fine. Texture-wise, they will always be somewhat slimy and slippery and not al dente like well-prepared pasta, but otherwise, they worked out well. Just remember - just 40 calories - in an entire bag! And next to no carbohydrates!

I followed the directions on the package to rinse thoroughly, drain, and then heat for a minute or so in the microwave to dry them out. I used a couple of very short sprays of oil and stir fried them with fresh garlic, canned chopped tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and then added some scallions and cilantro at the end. Very delicious and hit the spot for my pasta craving! I will definitely purchase again!

review/summary: GREAT!!!
review/text: I love the Tofu Shirataki noodles (angel hair, spaghetti & fettucini). I eat 2 bags most days. Very filling and only 40 calories. I am not much of a cook. I prefer the simplest of methods to cook. I rinse off quickly in cool water, then throw on a non-stick frying pan. I used to use Olive Oil but have found I don't need that, either. I sprinkle with Mrs. Dash or Vogue vegetarian chicken base. Just stir for a couple of minutes to get some of the water out. It's great. Last night I brought an unopened bag to a Cajun restaurant with me, and they agreed to cook with it in place of the traditional pasta that was supposed to come with my meal. The owner was surprised how much it tasted like pasta. For breakfast I sometimes use a little Almond Milk and Stevia for sweetener. I think they taste GREATTTTT, very very similar to pasta (unlike the shirataki without the tofu that isn't refrigerated and is more gel-like and not as similar to pasta). The product is great for your digestion and fills you up. I often stir-fry one and put into a plastic container with cooked vegetables and reheat for lunch. I'm addicted to House Foods Tofu Shirataki. However, if possible, search at your local grocery stores. The shipping online is expensive because it needs to be refrigerated. Highly recommend!!

review/summary: At first I hated them
review/text: They kind of have an acquired consistency that you need to get used to. The texture reminds me sort of like cooked mushrooms. They have a slightly rubbery snap to them. The first time I tried them I hated them. I started the Atkins diet and now that I never eat chips or pasta I have learned to get used to them, then I started really liking them. The first time I boiled them way too long and the recipe I made with them wasn't good. Just mix in RAGU and pour cheese on top and you have guilt free spaghetti. I even took Alfredo sauce which usually has like 3 carbs per serving? mixed that in there, fast, simple, and NO CARBS it's crazy. The fact that they are so guilt free made me have an acquired taste for them. Being that they are tofu, they would totally taste amazing fried up in stir fry, the texture would work well for that most definitely. So give them a couple tries, or check out some good recipies online and take your time with them, they are worth it.

review/summary: Prep is the WORD
review/text: I LOVE these noodles and I really enjoy them in place of ramen. For those dieting, Ramen is the worst thing you can eat, boasting 65% of your daily saturated fat due to the palm oil. To prepare, I rinse well with hot water or drop in boiling water for a minute (best) the let dry. As for flavoring, I find these to work best in "Soup" applications with strong flavors. Like tofu, these will absorb whatever they are cooked in. My fave and easiest method is to simply sacrifice a $0.20 Run of the mill beef ramen, steal the flavor pack, and cook my noodles in the broth. I also add  Heinz reduced sugar ketchup to add body to the sauce and give it a lip smacking goodness. A bit frugal, but it is really good. I have given this to other people and they dont even realize its not the real deal. Prep, Boil, Add to flavorful broth. Done.

review/text: I heard about these through Hungry-girl.com and am so glad I tried them.  I kept hearing how I should replace pasta with spaghetti squash and found the texture and taste to be unsatisfying.  Although these need to be rinsed well and patted thoroughly dry, I think these are the closest thing to real pasta at about 10% of the calories.  I have tried the fettuccine and the macaroni, both which I like, but the angel hair shape is the best.  Works great with the Hungry-girl recipe on the back too.  YUM!  I highly recommend.  The seller also sent these to me so quickly and at no additional shipping price for my multiple orders.

review/summary: So much better than the Non Tofu Shirataki!
review/text: I have tried both the Tofu Shirataki and the Non Tofu Shirataki. The non-tofu variety is very gel/gummy (literally like little strands of flavorless gummy worms). I ate the non-tofu noodles, because, hey they are sooo low calorie/carb. But now that I've tried the tofu shirataki which contains only 20 calories per serving, I am sold on the tofu shirataki. Tofu noodles were more like ramen noodle consistency. Perhaps not the exact same texture as a real flour based noodle, but for the calories and carb content these are excellent!<br /><br />As with any shirataki noodle, you do have to make sure you wash, wash and wash them some more. If there is any scent at all, you have not washed them enough. About 2 or 3 minutes seems to do the trick for me. I made a low carb peach kugel (dessert) with the fettuccine and a stir fry with the angel hair. I just could not believe how much better they were than the non tofu variety.<br /><br />I was also very impressed with the seller (Low Carb You Foods). These arrived within 2 days on regular shipping, shipping all the way across the country. And, I bought 2 different varieties with no additional charge on the shipping! I will certainly be back again.

review/text: I do not have human children so I can only comment on how this works for my furry kids. I have a cat with severe pancreas/GI issues & he has steadily lost weight over the past 2 years.He cannot seem to absorb enough nutrients from his foods. He is on B-12 shots & prednisolone to help calm the inflammation & spure his appetite but sometimes the ONLY thing he will eat is this chicken baby food. He has also eaten the ham & turkey versions of this brand but lately...........just the chicken. He's fussy & has always been a "drama queen" & he also has allergies in the Autumn that affect his willingness to eat (if a cat can't smell the food a cat won;t eat the food) so getting anything into him is helpful & the baby food is good for both nutrition & for hydration.My husband & I will do most anything to keep him happy & enjoying his quality of life for as long as possible & this baby food helps us do that for him. Our other 3 cats also enjoy this as a sometimes treat so it works well for our family.

review/text: My baby is ready for some new foods in her diet so I decided to give Gerber 2nd Foods a try. Gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried. The other brands seem to be similar in consistency. There is really no difference in the consistency of Gerber 1sts and 2nds. The difference is that 2nds includes turkey, chicken and beef and 1sts are all fruits and veggies. My baby did not find Gerber 2nds appetizing. The color and odor of the chicken is also nothing like actual chicken. I placed the lid back on the jar and refrigerated the jar since I was hoping to try it with her for another meal. The next day I got the Gerber 2nds jar from the fridge and reheated it. When it was reheated the food was so runny that she could have drunk it from a bottle. The consistency does not keep from one day to the next. If you're looking for a baby food with chicken, turkey, or beef then I would recommend that you try Beech Nut Stage 1. My baby loved the Beech Nut turkey, chicken, and beef. The only problem is that the major grocery stores in my area do not sell Beech Nut. Next trip that I make I plan to stock up on the Beech Nut!

review/summary: See's gets 5 stars, but shipping charge gets ONE star.
review/text: By far, the best chocolate in the USA. Better than Godiva, I think, but others may disagree. I LOVE See's Candies, BUT the shipping cost is almost the same as the pound of truffles.  I know shipping chocolate may be difficult during hot or cold times, but geez, something has to be done about this..... Maybe buy multiple See's products for shipping discounts? we don't have See's stores in the East, just little stands in malls during the holiday season with few choices. I WANT MY SEE'S KEY LIME WHITE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES.  Your best bet is to search amazon's grocery and gourmet food site and find discounts. During the winter holidays, I got terrific truffles at a deep discount, regularly $100 for $20 plus free shipping.

review/summary: See's candy is delicious
review/text: See's candy is delicious. There were shops in California where I grew up.  Now I live in New England and there is no other way to get it except mail order. I'll take it! ;)

review/summary: See's Truffles through Amazon
review/text: I have already communicated with the See's company about my disappointment in the item they sell as truffles.  My definition of Truffles and See's are not the same.  The candy they sent was delicious and I ate it all, but it was not what I expected i.e. round chocolates filled with various flavors of chocolate ganache.  The item See's sells as truffles was a box of assorted soft centered chocolates of various shapes.  I may buy other candy from See's in the future, but certainly not truffles.

review/summary: why buy something when you are getting ripped off?
review/text: See's makes delicious chocolates; close to the best; but their chipping charges make each purchase a total rip off. I think that every one should boycott See's for that reason.

review/summary: Jack loves these
review/text: These are basically moldable bits of chicken putty, and my liver-spotted dalmatian Jack loves them. Every morning he takes a big fish oil capsule that he thinks is weird on its own and two pills. I tear one of these pill pockets in half, then mush one half of the half around the fish oil and mush the other pills into the other half of the half, and he gobbles it all up without complaint. I'm stingy with these, because they get a little expensive when you have to use them every day, but they really are just the thing for getting a dog to take medicine. I'd use as many of them as necesary to get Jack to take his meds, but so far the economy approach is working. Great product!

review/summary: Can split in half to be more economical
review/text: I've been using Pill Pockets for the last year or so. My dog has never spat one back out, and I find them much easier to use than e.g., peanut butter or bread.<br />In the past, I've used the tablet size pill pockets, but decided to try the capsule version. For roughly the same price, the capsule version is far more economical. The pill pockets are huge! You can easily split them in half to make the bag last longer. I will never go back to the tablet version again.

review/summary: Dogs love them
review/text: I have to give my lab mix 6 capsules a day. This being the dog that can somehow spit out the teeniest-tiniest pill no matter how much good stuff is wrapped around the medication, I was thrilled to find this product. The capsules I have to give her are actually too big for this pocket (hence 4 stars instead of 5) but I can moosh the pill pocket around the capsule well enough that she's eaten the pill pocket and looking for more before she realizes that there's medication hidden inside. With only 30 pill pockets in each 7.9oz pouch, I'll definitely have to buy in bulk. I'm saving so much time and energy and wasted medication; I'd definitely recommend these to anyone who has a dog who hates takes their meds.

review/summary: Great and helpful product!
review/text: We've been using Greenies Pill Pockets for a couple of years with all our pets (dogs and cats). They are great! They are often much larger than the tabs and capsules, so we frequently only use 1/3 or 1/2 of each pill pocket per dose. That works out even better because we get more pill pockets for our money!  I have even put more than one pill in the pocket, with no issues from the pets.

review/summary: A life saver for my cat!
review/text: My cat has kidney problems and has to take three pills twice a day.  It was undoable and gag-inducing until Pill Pockets.  Now he begs for them.  Astounding and miraculous!  Thank you for making these!

review/summary: Time for your medicine puppies!
review/text: Getting pills down a labador is not always easy and it is amazing how they can actually eat an entire piece of cheese and still spit out a teeny tiny little pill!  The Schipperke is even smarter ...  With Pill Pockets we can actually say "time for your medicine" and they come running.  Buying these off the shelf (when you can find them) is far more expensive than amazon.com -- we buy in bulk and save a ton.  Not just on the Pill Pockets ... but on the cheese, peanut putter, hot dogs and whole chickes we use to have to buy to hide that teeny tiny little pill!

review/summary: A God Send
review/text: I love these things. My dog has arthritis and needs to take medication 3 times a day. Before I found these we had to push the pill to the back of her throat to get a pill down her. We had tried all the usual things that involved putting her pills into various types of food but she always managed to spit out the pills and get the food.<br />Now with Greenie Pill Pockets the pills go down 1st time every time and no one is traumatized; especially me.<br />A great idea, if you have a dog taking medication these are fast and easy to use. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.

review/summary: Truly a heaven-sent...
review/text: We have two dogs who have to take pills once in a while. I don't know what we would do without these pill pockets...!! Before we found them we always felt so bad, stuffing bitter pills down our dog's throat. But not anymore... Giving medication is a treat now..!!! It is awesome!! They are a bit stinky but I guess that is just how dogs like it... LOL<br />Great product we will keep buying for ever...
