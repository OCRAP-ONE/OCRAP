review/summary: Chewy Sausage
review/text: I bought these sausages along with some Merguez sausage (Algerian Lamb Sausage). The merguez was wonderful and I am going to order them again soon. However the saucisse de Toulouse were close to inedible. They were chewy and had hard lumps in them.

review/summary: A good whole bean flavored coffee
review/text: A good resource for whole bean amaretto flavored coffee, especially if you don't live near a shop that carries whole bean amaretto coffee (in my case, a town).  A nice medium roast.<br /><br />The bags are vacuum sealed, keeping the the beans as fresh as you can short of roasting the beans yourself.  This allows me to order 5 lbs at a time.  I open and use one pound at a time, leaving the other bags sealed in their bags to stay fresh, then when I'm down to my last pound, I simply order again and before my pound is gone, I have another 5 lbs of fresh coffee at my door.  Even if my local shop carried whole bean amaretto now I don't think I would go back to stopping off to buy it there.  Ordering it online, getting this freshness and home delivery is just too convenient!

review/text: Good stuff. My dogs have been eating this for several years and they seem to like it better than some other brands I had tried. I stuck with this food because, well, the dogs like it, but also because it's one of the few canned dog foods that don't cause either digestive or allergy issues with either of my 2 dogs. It's nice to have the mix of flavors so they're not eating the same flavor every morning. They eat this for breakfast then they eat the same brand of dry varieties the rest of the day. Seems like a nice, healthy diet.

review/text: Being French I grew up knowing how important it was to use a good unrefined salt. The one from Brittany being the very best. No! It's not foolish to spent money on a  basic spice. It has a very delicate flavor (almost floral) and you don't need a lot. Will taste great on salads. A clear healthy winner.

review/text: Not really sure if I can describe this salt properly. Yes, it has a wonderful flavor without too much of a salty flavor. It's very clean tasting. Mostly, though, I think it seems "creamy". Yea, I know that sounds weird, but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment. I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.

review/summary: Great stuff,and a must to have
review/text: I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me.

We even took a taste test, first this French gray , then Mortons salt. Hands down we could taste the difference and we could taste how much better the French Gray was. I would get the fine salt next time. I wanted that but must have hit the course by accident. We still like it! You will too. Worth every dollar. And now im spoiled.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, "French gray" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.

My guess is they really screwed up the roasting process and are just trying to recover some of their cost. So if you're excited to see "gourmet" beans for so cheap, don't be, all you'll do is make your coffee grinder smell horrible for a month.

Also, if you aren't used to a high fiber diet, keep in mind that one box of soup is 80% of the daily fiber requirement...and can cause some gas/bloating if you are not used to that!  The entire container was 300 calories and kept me full from lunch all the way through to dinner!  Can't wait to try the other varieties of McDougall's!

review/text: Dr. McDougall's Lentil Soup is the right combination of healthy food and great flavor. Lentils are a great source of protein and fiber. This soup kicks it up a notch. It's a good basis for other soups. The Moroccan lentil stew with raisins in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BFZ9MG">Vegetarian Times (1-year auto-renewal)</a> uses this soup as its base. Blended with white beans, saffron, raisins, garlic, cumin, yogurt, and red pepper flakes, it's healthy and punchy.<br /><br />Dr. McDougall and his famous diet are based out of Santa Rosa, California, not far from the nutritionist for NBC's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XEC7W2">The Biggest Loser Workout (Full Program)</a> and Connie Gutterson, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013L4D5I">The Sonoma Diet: Trimmer Waist, Better Health in Just 10 Days!</a> who are based out of Napa. It's Bay Area health and goodness. Try it! It's delicious, nutritious and filling.

You have to buy 6 boxes at a time here, but most other places I looked you had to buy 10 - 20 at a time.  The boxes are actually very easy to store and the actual tea bags are individually wrapped.

review/text: I am not usually a cracker person, but I discovered these at our local grocery store in Seattle and then found them at a good price on Amazon.  I have an unusual affinity for Saltines, so this should give you an idea of my cracker tastes.  That said, I serve these often with a variety of dips and people always comment on how good they are (the crackers and the dip!) These crackers are what I would call a grown up version of a saltine.  They have an excellent crisp and are great for topping and dipping.  There are many varieties of the Croccantini, but my favorite is still the original.  They also come in larger versions that taste just as great, but are huge and tend to break up quite a bit.

We place these in cap full of bottled water and it is enough to perfectly moisten the towel for cleaning up hands, faces, tables, etc.<br /><br />These are so convenient because they are so small and easy to carry until needed.<br /><br />The only note of caution I would make is that these really do look like candy mints, so they should be kept away from little ones.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: a great toy for supervised play
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:45 Mins<br /><br /></span>My kitten is a 15 week old Savannah cat. We have the Play-N-Squeak mice in several versions - he loves the sound and they have been very durable with moderately rough play.<br /><br />In the video, the ceiling is a little low in that hallway, about 7+ feet. If the cat gets ahold of the mouse and tries to drag it off it can forcibly spring back up like a slingshot and this can make a considerable amount of noise. I have neighbors upstairs so for their sake I do not use this toy in that location in the evenings or at night. My 9ft ceilings in another room work much better to control the noise and the mouse doesn't get hung up or tangled on the hanger. The door where this is attached is probably going to see some wear and tear over time since he can jump at this for 10-15 minutes at a time easily.<br /><br />This is a well made, durable toy.

It's too tall for her attached to the door, so we added some large rubber bands to the string and it reaches perfectly from the door now. She plays with it incessantly, and loves the sound it makes. This is a great addition to your cat toys, especially if you want them to have fun without you having to participate.

review/summary: Bouncy, squeaky FUN!
review/text: Both of my cats love this toy but one of them plays with it far more than the other because he won't let his brother near it.  He even lays underneath it and just swats at it when he gets tired. I hung this on the door of an armoire in the living room so we could watch the cats play with it...not just because it's fun to watch but because they are prone to biting in half the string of any toys on a string and then trying to swallow the pieces.<br /><br />Sometimes one will grab the mouse in his mouth and try to walk away with it only to have it bounce away due to the elastic string section-hysterical! Then they get all fiesty as the mouse bounces all over from the tension. I think the elastic section of the string is what really makes this toy fun for them -plain string would not have done the trick. It makes the mouse so bouncy and squeaky. They still haven't managed to bite the string in half yet and it's been several weeks -probably because they can't keep hold of it long enough to chew through!

When we saw this box of 50 K-cups for about the same price per cup, we decided to order two and that way place fewer orders.<br /><br />However, we have thrown away more defective K-cups from this one box than we have from everything else we've purchased in the 6 months since we bought our Keurig machine.  And we have bought A LOT of coffee & tea, much of it from Green Mountain.  I don't know if its a problem at the factory or if its an issue with the packaging but 1/3 of the K-cups in the first box had to be thrown away.  Frankly, these things are too expensive to accept that kind of waste...not to mention the hassle of cleaning up the mess they make first thing in the morning when all I want to do is sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and wake up.<br /><br />I hope that its from the packaging (the K-cups are not as tightly packed and therefore get bounced around a lot more during shipping - I HOPE that's the root cause of the problem) and not an issue with manufacturing because I would HATE it if we had to stop buying Green Mountain products altogether. Dark Magic and Triple Black Diamond have become our two favorite coffees, replacing Newman's Own Special Blend. As it is, I will go back to ordering the smaller packages and hope that this solves the problem.<br /><br />I give the coffee five stars but only one for the packaging so I compromised by assigning 3 stars to this product.

review/summary: Had to downsize because K-Cups were so weak
review/text: The coffee is pretty good at the smallest cup size, but it gets weak fast the larger serving size you use. For a brand claiming to be "Black", I expected more coffee per cup.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: Just finished off my first Amazon packaged (50 count) box, and am impressed with the quality of the k-cup (ZERO wasted cups - no cups with broken seals, and no cups that resulted in a cup full o' grounds).<br /><br />My 5-star rating comes with a caveat.  It's not the best coffee I've had, but it is very good.  I almost gave it 4 stars, but then realized that out of all the x-bold offerings I've tried (and I've tried quite a few), it's one of my favorites at its price point.  It is a good coffee with good, bold flavor... and I did just put in an order for a second box.  My favorite from Amazon was Coffee People's Oraganic x-bold coffee (yellow foil cap).  Not sure what happened to this one, but I only see it rarely, and then at a ridiculous price (just saw it at $99 for a 24 pack... that's over $4/k-cup!!).

review/summary: My go to brew when I need a kick in the am
review/text: If you like good bold coffee to get you moving, look no further.  A bit smoother than Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond but stronger and more complex than both Nantucket Blend and Newman's Own Bold, it is full bodied even when brewed on the 14 oz setting.  It is my first cup, make that mug, in the morning as I sit in my sunroom and watch the fox make tracks into the woods and the finches and cardinals arrive at the bird feeder.  It's coffee to greet the sunrise and help you face the day ahead.

review/text: I don't know that I've ever tried anything quite like this.  I like it though, although I probably wouldn't drink it every day.  I find it a little difficult to describe, but it's kind of like the difference between milk chocolate and dark chocolate, with the Dark Magic being the dark chocolate.  I intend to pick up a box for those days when I feel like something a little different.

review/summary: Dark Magic is a great cup of coffee
review/text: I am just 1 week into owning my Kuerig B60 and this was in the sample pack. When I brewed it up, coffee grounds were in the cup and I was hoping this was just one faulty package. It smelled so good and I didn't want to throw it out I strained it twice added my cream and it was really good! This was a keeper and I went back today after church to B3 with my 20% off coupon and purchased a box and promptly had a cup while I was preparing my lunch.  I determined I could buy 3 boxes-18 count each with coupons for $24.28 once I finish this box and the two others (French Roast and Butter Toffee) I bought at the time I purchased my Kuerig. Dark Magic along with French Roast are my morning travel mug brews, and I will usually finish the evening with a smooth Butter Toffee.<br /><br />Update 7/25/12: Dark Magic is the only K Cup I am drinking.Truly a great cup of coffee, I have a 10 oz travel mug on my morning commute and then a 6 oz in the evening either before or after dinner. At either amount and a little cream it taste great, not bitter or weak. Love it!!! New owners definitely want to register your Kuerig and receive the  buy 2 get 2 free k cup offer, I paid $29.68 for 4-(24)count Dark Magic k cups

review/text: Green Mountain Dark Magic is one of my favorite Keurig pods. I make the big cup, add 1/4 c. skim milk, 1/4 sugar free Vanilla Coffee Mate, 1 Sweet and Low, and it's still strong but delish--my version of a latte. And the price is great. A friend warned me to check the expiration date--mine had plenty of time left. All is good in my coffee world.

review/text: What a great purchase.  I was originally looking for the ice coffee k-cups but they are ridiculously expensive (I feel).  After reading that their is not much of a difference and I was most concerned of the "watered down" taste so I thought and "extra bold" strength would do the trick, which it did!!!! I will be buying more soon and in a larger quantity now that I know how well it works ;)p

review/summary: It is Extra Bold and Extra Acidic
review/text: I love bold, robust coffee and decided to purchase Green Mountain Dark Magic k-cups. Definitely a bold coffee, but so acidic it's not enjoyable. Severely disappointed in this coffee. Am trying other brands but because of this experience trying to steer clear of all coffees distributed by Green Mountain; and that's a shame because they offer so many choices. Money is too hard to come by to blow it on coffee you can't drink!

review/summary: Gave this a try after GMC Espresso Blend was discontinued...
review/text: I'm on the second k-cup in the box and find myself comparing it to Green Mountain Coffee Espresso Blend which I've been drinking for over a year now.  The box reads, "offers the rich aromatics and flavor qualities of espresso".  Even Keurig is recommending Dark Magic to those who previously purchased the Espresso Blend.  Another reviewer wrote this coffee was: "Strong but flat, lacking definition".  Well, it does taste watery compared to the espresso blend and lacks that burst of flavor in every sip.  I'm not a big coffee drinker but love making daily lattes and cappuccinos from my Green Mountain Espresso Blend and now Dark Magic coffee.  This coffee is barely acceptable for this purpose but it is acceptable for someone who likes a strong/bold cup of coffee.

review/text: I really do not like to review Coffee because it's a matter of personal taste. But I thought why not. I have been using this brand for a few months and I must say that I love the coffee. Any one that drinks this coffe loves the product as well. I brew my coffee twice on my Keurig. I brew a large cup then brew a small cup with the same cup. Still very bold and nice. I would recommend this but then again it's the matter of personal taste.

review/text: This blend isn't too harsh though.  Admittedly I use creamer with all my coffee; but I find that this particular blend does well with me.  If I were to buy more Dark Roast in the future, it would probably be this one.  I'm a fan of most all Green Mountain Coffees.

review/summary: Nice Bold Flavor
review/text: Not as strong/bold as I was expecting based on other reviews, but still a nice strong flavor when brewed at the standard 10oz setting. I like a nice strong cup of coffee, black. Dark Magic (Extra Bold) competes with Starbucks Verona and also Barista's Italian Roast for my "go to" morning coffee choice. If I was to rank these 3, I would say #1 Barista's Italian Roast, #2 Starbuck Verona, #3 Green Mt. Dark Magic. Emeril's Extra Bold dark roast is also a good choice.<br /><br />Costco (my local store) sells Starbuck Verona. My next purchase will probably be Barista's Italian... If I catch Dark Magic on sale, I may buy some more of that brand.<br /><br />I give it 8/10 on 1-10 scale. If you like strong coffee, you will probably like Dark Magic.

review/text: I've enjoyed the Dark Magic coffee and re-ordered several times.  What I like about it is the strong taste and dark roast.  This is definitely one that I brew on the biggest cup size (12oz on my unit).<br /><br />The only negative I have is the lingering flavor is not quite as good as some of my more favorite k-cups.  However, I still put this in my top 10 and will continue to order occasionally for variety's sake.<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this to anyone who likes a strong, dark brew.
