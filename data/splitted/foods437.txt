review/summary: Good
review/text: I would have ranked this cereal 5 stars if the protein count has been higher. Two grams isn't enough for a flea.<br /><br />Taste-wise it's surprisingly good. It's not as sweet as I anticipated but is just enough to satisfy without it being a kids' cereal. It's vitamin enriched, heavily, according to the label.<br /><br />I added a quarter cup of shaved almonds and a scoop of whey protein and it was quite good. That's all I had for my 7am breakfast and I wasn't hungry until my 10 o'clock midmorning nutrition bar.<br /><br />I didn't experience an aftertaste, as one reviewer noted, and I would have to disagree that it's high in sugar as noted by another reviewer.<br /><br />All in all, pretty good for a cereal, one that should satisfy both adults and kids.<br /><br />Loren W. Christensen, author of The Fighter's Body.

review/summary: Yuk! And who goes to Amazon to buy cereal?????
review/text: This stuff tasted like (insert favorite negative adjective that Amazon won't print). I like most cereals but I couldn't put this stuff down, tasted like cardboard something with a half stale texture. Hate to throw 3/4 box of cereal away, we'll see if the birds will eat it - I have my doubts.

review/summary: Cereal for the kids.
review/text: I ordered this stuff for the boys since they are the main cereal eaters in the house.  According to them, this is along the lines of Honey Nut Cheerios.  I'll have to agree with another reviewer that mentioned Honey Bunches of Oats.  4 stars, it tastes good but other cereals on the market tastes very similar.  Get it at the grocery store, the price here is crazy!

review/summary: Like a combination of Honey Nut Cheerios and Honey Bunches of Oats
review/text: Kellog's Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey cereal is (at least it seems to be that it is) designed to be a competitor of Post's Honey Bunches of Oats and Honey Nut Cheerios. This is a good cereal with a slightly stronger taste than the Post cereal, but it is close enough to be of interest to fans of both. To me it tasted like a combination of the two - a very interesting combination.

review/summary: a moderately sweet snack
review/text: As other reviewers have noted, this is a round O's-type cereal. I like the fact that it isn't excessively sweet. I avoid most "kid's cereals" these days because of the excessive sweetness, but this cereal is OK from a "grownup taste" point of view (for lack of a better term). The peanut flavor is fairly strong, which is absolutely fine with me. Perhaps a little too carbohydrate-laden to be a main breakfast course for me, but it does make a tasty snack.

review/summary: Much better than Honey-O's
review/text: Having always liked Honey-O's, I thought I would like these and I found out I liked Kellogg's version better!!!  Honey-Os always had a slight chemical taste but these Crunchy Nuts have all the great flavor (and then some), with NO ODD AFTERTASTE!<br /><br />Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, they have a satisfying crunch to them without tearing up the inside of your mouth! A very strong honey and mild nut flavor top it off to become one of my favorite sweet cereal craving choices!

review/summary: Frosted Flakes with nuts
review/text: Just as the description implies, these are very much like Frosted Flakes with specks of peanuts and glazed honey. That said, there isn't much difference since the days of Tony the Tiger, but if you really like them, this is easily a five-star product. Of course, this cereal can't be good for a diabetic or one allergic to peanuts (I am neither, or I wouldn't be writing a review). As a matter of fact, having just eaten a bowl prompted me to type this up! (This is my third review on a food product, by the way.)<br /><br />Eat this in moderation. A new product but probably based on a highly successful product with bits of nut added to the mix. Enough said.

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: I had been wanting to try this cereal for some time now and it finally went on sale ($1.99 for 10.8oz box) at local supermarket. I expected the texture to be more "weighty" but instead, it has a light crunch.  It has a good amount of sugar but it wasn't super sweet.  I also expected the flavor to be strong but it was rather dainty...not bad, however.  I would only purchase again if it's on sale and I have a coupon.  It's not what I expected, was rather boring; but it is different.  Quaker Oh's: now that's a tasty cereal (mighty hard crunch but tasty)!

review/summary: Sweet, crunchy, and doesn't get soggy
review/text: Whether breakfast on a Saturday morning or even as a late night snack, what hits the spot better than a big bowl of cereal?  With dozens of varieties lining the wall of any given grocery aisle, the real question here is whether Kellog's Crunchy Nut is better than the competition and worth the price.<br /><br />Combining the shape and texture of Cheerios with the flavor of a much sweeter treat, the Roasted Nut and Honey cereal is a winner for anyone who likes an intense honey taste and a strong crunch.  Soggy cereal - the bane of any breakfast - isn't an issue here, as it stays firm and crunchy for more than enough time to finish off a full bowl.  The edges of each piece are a little sharp, but they don't shred the mouth like Peanut Butter Crunch or similar breakfast cereals.<br /><br />For the cereal lover with a sweet tooth who doesn't want their breakfast to get soggy, Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey is a great choice and well worth trying out.

review/summary: Yummy!!!
review/text: I'm always looking for a good breakfast cereal and there are so many on the market now that are both delicious and nutritious that it's hard to choose.  This one I had trouble keeping away from my 14 and 11 year old daughters so that I could review it.  It's not *too* high in sugar and calories and contains a pretty good amount of fiber- two of the key things I look for in addition to taste.  My only knock against the cereal is the same as all of these cereals with "bits" of nuts attached to the cereal, the nuts are too small to really have any texture left and there's not enough of them to really taste. If the box hadn't said there were nuts in there, I would have never known.  I prefer cereals with whole nuts or at least slivers of nuts.

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: It's hard to say that I "like" Crunchy Nut cereal. It basically tastes like Cheerios, with some nutty sugar sprinkled on top. It's not a super healthy cereal, it's not particularly original, but the taste and crunch are fine.<br /><br />I wound up sprinkling my Crunchy Nut cereal onto desserts to make crunchy treats, rather than eating it as a cereal. My go-to cereal is plain old raisin bran, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.<br /><br />So as a dessert item, Crunchy Nut cereal is very good. As a breakfast item, I think I'm fine with throwing my own sugar on my Cheerios when the mood strikes me. I don't really need that to come prepacked for me.

review/text: These are obviously closely related to Honey Nut Cheerios, but get less soggy and have a somewhat nuttier flavor. I haven't tried them side by side, but I think they're also a bit sweeter. I like the Cheerios, but I think I'd choose these for the consistency and texture if I were picking on taste alone. That said, if you LOVE Honey Nut Cheerios, I'd just stick with those.

review/summary: Tastes okay initially but has bad aftertaste
review/text: This cereal reminded me a lot of Quaker's Oh's.  It's a lot lighter and less substantial than Oh's, however, and has a weird aftertaste (a bad aftertaste).  The cereal is made with rice and corn instead of wheat, so it doesn't really make you feel full.  The roasted nut and honey taste is somehow adulterated so that it simply does not taste good in your mouth.  Calorically speaking, the folks at Kellogg's did a good job, and the cereal makes a better study snack than breakfast cereal, if not for the horrible aftertaste.<br /><br />Steer clear of this product.  Check out Quaker's Oh's instead.<br /><br />Even if you're on a diet, there is no need to torture yourself with unfilling food that tastes bad.<br /><br />One star.

I could taste the honey, but the nuts are a bit too subtle.  I kept comparing this cereal unfavorably to Quaker Oh's, which are crunchier, sweeter, and have a more satisfying flavor.

They also taste great with vanilla yogurt, which is important to me because a bowl of cereal with yogurt is a great bedtime snack without the risk of spilling milk into your bed when one of your children come in and jump on the bed. It is a smaller size box. Hopefully Kellogg's will come out with a family size box. This cereal will be eaten up quickly.

I tried this hoping to find a very similar product that I could buy on sale if the other wasn't. The other option was a cereal that was so different that it would  become a new option for me.<br /><br />The taste was adequate. The nuts were almost nonexistent....at least to the naked eye. They may have been rolled in dust, but there were definitely no pieces on the side of the cereal.<br /><br />The color of the cereal was awful, reminding me of the color of what babies leave in a used diaper. It was not at all appealing. In addition, there is a lot of sugar in this cereal.<br /><br />For the above reasons, I wouldn't bother to buy this in the future.

review/text: First of all, i was really happy to see that this new Kellog's cereal was all natural. I try to stay away from cereals that are more chemical compounds than foodstuffs I can actually recognize. So i was happy to give this cereal a try.<br /><br />I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either. It had a burned popcorn aftertaste that I really didn't care for, but the actual cereal itself wasn't too bad. It was something to take a bite of here or there as a dry snack. It didn't seem to work too well with milk.<br /><br />That being said, my rabbits were willing to kill for a bite of Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey as if they were crack addicts looking for a fix. At one point, one of them snuck into the kitchen, jumped up on the counter, pushed the box off, jumped down onto the box and then began dragging it to her cage. Something about the smell of the cereal just drove them into voracious eating. Maybe Kellog would do better selling this as a pet food treat rather than a human one.

A friend who used the same amount of cereal and milk didn't experience that, so it's probably different for everybody.<br /><br />Secondly, several times as I was eating, I found a clump of compressed peanut bits and dust.  It was a very unpleasant contrast of texture and flavor with the sweetened milk and the rest of the cereal.

review/summary: another sweet, non-nutrious cereal to add to the list
review/text: First off I think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044CPA28">Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut, 14.1-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> taste better than this version, but I had to try it.<br /><br />Also, the cereal stays crunch for a bit in milk, but that is because it seems like a big bit of honey coated batter. Not much nutty crunch, more like a cracker crunch to it.<br /><br />Ingredients: Yellow corn meal, sugar, corn bran, peanuts, honey, molasses, salt, whole oat flour, caramel color, baking soda, annatto extract color, ascorbic acid (vitamin C),niacinamide, reduced iron, zinc oxide, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Thiamin Hydrochloride (Vitamine B1), vitamine A, Palmitate, BHT (preservative), Folic acid, Vitamin D, Wheat starch, Vitamin B12.<br /><br />Well? Ehh. Some of the cheapest ingredients (i.e. corn) so don't expect much here. Just surprised that with the heal conscious movement that a more healthy option isn't being made here.<br /><br />It's a nice crunchy snack you could eat straight form the box without milk, like fiddle-faddle or something.<br /><br />I ate a two servings an hour before a bike ride. Went out for a ride and 30minutes into ride I had no energy left. I wasn't surprised as this is just an empty sugary cereal.<br /><br />I personally wouldn't buy it again, but it isn't a bad cereal don't get me wrong. Just wasn't spectacular and doesn't give me a reason to leave my honey-nut cherrios (seeing a pattern here in the ingredients?)<br /><br />For those that need a little something to snack on vs. making this a meal it could be a good option.

review/summary: Surprisingly nutty!
review/text: I got these expecting them to pretty much be Honey Nut Cheerios, but was pleasantly surprised.  They had a much more distinct nut flavor and actually tasted more like Cap'n Crunch Peanut Butter but without the kind of waxy coating that cereal has.  Overall, the flavor was good (could have been a bit stronger), the texture was great, and it was very fresh and crunchy.  The reason I didn't give it five stars was simply due to value.  The box is quite small and the price is not.  I'm not sure how many servings the box claims, but I'd say you can expect three cereal bowls full and that is about it out of a single box.

review/text: My kids really enjoy this cereal probably because it is so sweet. Even sweeter than Honey Nut Cheerios!<br />The image on the box shows each piece coated in nut flakes, far from accurate! You will find a few nut flakes on most of the Os, some with none at all.<br />however, even though the photo isn't accurate, they still taste great. I would like to try some with more nuts as shown though, they might be even better and the additional nuts might better balance the sweetness.<br /><br />The cereal stays crunchy in milk and is very satisfying to eat. They also make a good dry snack and don't leave your fingers sticky.

I eat it "dry", sometimes strait from the box! I like this so much I went and bought three more boxes to put in my pantry!. I usually have some as a snack, as it's much better than chips and candy. The other day I ate some while watching a movie, instead of popcorn. This is very tasy stuff indeed and I hope Kelloggs keeps producing it. Hopefully enough people will like and buy it so it won't get discontunued.

review/text: The cereal looks like Cheereos, only a darker brown. I didn't see any peanut pieces in the little grain morsels until I got to the bottom of the box, but maybe I just didn't look hard enough.  I couldn't really taste the peanuts either. The cereal tastes like sugar. There's not much difference in taste between this cereal and prepackaged donuts. The crunch is more similar to a donut than to a potato chip, so the cereal is easy to chew.

Just please don't think that these are anything close to Cheerios, because they are not. These are much, much sweeter and more tasty, in my opinion. The packaging and amount of product was typical for cereal - nothing out of the ordinary.

review/summary: Not sure this is filling any cereal void for me.
review/text: Crunchy Nut cereal is definitely tasty.  For me, it's just a little too nondescript.  If I want a healthy cereal, I go towards a GoLean and add some raisins to jazz it up.  If I want to splurge with a little sugar I'll hit the Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  I thought this Crunchy Nut might fall in between and allow for a healthy, compromised, third option.  For very little Fiber and Protein (2g each), I needed to be more excited to dig in.  But it's just - meh.<br /><br />I couldn't go as low as three-stars because it is tasty and nutty, I just don't think it's found a spot in my regular cereal rotation.  If you don't focus on getting some protein or fiber out of your cereal, than this might be an option for you.

review/summary: Greasy Kix?
review/text: We had been eyeballing this on the shelf for a couple weeks at the local grocery store and were thrilled to get it to review.  My favorite cereals are Honey Nut Cheerios, Honey Bunches of Oats, or Crispix.  If it is my birthday or a camping trip and I am going to indulge in a sweet cereal I prefer Frosted Flakes. Cereal tends to be a sweet breakfast treat, and not a staple in our home, so I can overlook the nutrition facts.<br /><br />Probably the best way I could describe Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is "greasy Kix."  It left a funky aftertaste and slime on my tongue.  The flavor, even before the aftertaste, wasn't good, though it was not the most horrible cereal in the world.  It was edible so I gave it an one star more than something... inedible.  My son thought it was ok, though not a favorite, but this seems to be packaged as an "adult" cereal so his vote doesn't count.  I was done after my first bowl and let him finish the rest over the course of two weeks.  This is unusual in my house as we usually go to blows on who gets the last bowl of cereal.  Even my son did not ask to repurchase!<br /><br />Unfortunately this failed for me.  Sorry Kellogg's!

review/text: I was really pleasantly surprised by this cereal. I eat cereal almost every day so I'm a big fan and very picky about what I eat. I prefer cereals that are actually good for me (like the Kashi stuff), but I never compromise on taste. A lot of cereals nowadays either taste like cardboard or are too sweet. Surprisingly enough, this cereal is delicious, keeps me energized for average or above average compared to my other cereals, and is not too sweet at all.<br /><br />If you've ever had Oreo O's it reminds me of that flavor EXACTLY but more nutty instead of chocolatey, and not quite as sweet. I know that sounds crazy, but if you eat one after the other I think you'll agree with me.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're a fan of peanut butter and cereals that are a bit sweet and crunchy, you'll really enjoy this one.

There isn't much nut taste in this, only sugary cereal that doesn't stand out much.  It's not really bad, but I wouldn't bother buying it.  I did like it better without milk.  I could see kids enjoying it as a snack, though I'd stick with Cheerios.

review/summary: Tasty but not special
review/text: Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is a tasty yet unremarkable breakfast cereal.  I've given it a 4 star rating because I enjoyed it.  Yet at the same time, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again.<br /><br />One of the main ingredients is peanuts, yet the nut taste is not pronounced.  In fact, I wouldn't have known that it even contains peanuts if I didn't already know.  The flavor reminds me of a cross of regular Cap N Crunch and Cheerios.<br /><br />Sugary sweetness is the dominant theme here.  I like sweet, so I'm not complaining too much.  But I suppose they could throttle back on the sweetness a bit.<br /><br />A 3/4 serving provides about 25% of many of the major vitamins, so there is certainly some nutritional benefit to the cereal. It also provides about 8% of your recommended daily allowance of fiber.<br /><br />The ingredients appear to be decent for the most part, although I have no idea what Pyridoxine Hydrochloride is.  The first ingredient is yellow corn meal followed by sugar, corn bran, peanuts, honey, molasses, salt and whole oat flour.  Again, generally not bad at all.  As noted, I'd prefer that they cut back on the sugar, but then I suppose that they probably wouldn't sell as much of the stuff.<br /><br />So I liked it.  I probably won't buy it again, but if someone served it to me in the future, I'd be perfectly happy.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4.

review/text: It takes real innovation to start with corn and sugar to put together scrumptious miniature glazed doughnuts (mmmm ... doughnuts).  The doughnuts of this cereal are about the size of Cheerios, and surprisingly have the same calorie content despite being made of twenty-five percent sugar.  It is real sugar, not the fake high-fructose stuff.  To me, they taste a lot like Belgium waffles smothered in syrup.<br /><br />As an experiment, I sprinkled some under my bird feeder.  The regular birds ignored them.  However, a flock of crows was attracted, probably by the orange color.  The crows hung around for a while but lost interest without sampling the cereal.  Squirrels then appeared to consume the cereal.<br /><br />If they give a Nobel Prize in Food, I think that the designers of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CYLW7A">Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey</a> deserve the trip to Sweden.  I am still trying to decide whether this is a good snack or whether the rest of it should go under the bird feeder.

It tastes great...better than cheerios..possibly due to its crunchy taste or the rugged structure tickling my taste buds in a different way. Whatever it is, it tastes great and I like it.

I eat slow and by the time I finish the last bite is still crunchy. My favorite part of the cereal is the actual nut pieces on the cereal. It gives it that real nut flavor and bite. The nut flavor is not overwhelming either. Nor is the honey. It is a great balance between the two. If you like honey nut cheerios and the crunchiness of apple jacks then you will really like this cereal.

review/text: It's a good quality dog food, I recommend it. I have been giving it to my Yorkies since 2003. They used to have 2 options: chicken and pork, now they have turkey and pork. The ingredients are good, no by-products or grains and they are small bites, perfect for a little Yorkie's little mouth.

review/text: My puppy loves these vitality treats. After reading the other two reviews I became concerned and quickly e-mailed the company with my concerns. Here is what they replied to me which immediately relieved my worries. They also sent me documentation of their checks on the products and pictures of the non-caged chickens.<br /><br />ello Karen,<br /><br />Thank You for contacting us here at DOGSWELLï¿½.<br /><br />The DOGSWELLï¿½ manufacturing facilities meet the highest and most strict sanitary conditions.

We regularly visit our manufacturing facilities to ensure the quality and safety of our products.  We are always looking to bring the manufacturing over to the United States, we have just not found a supplier who will add all of the vitamins and nutrients that we want at a price the consumer is willing to pay, once we find one, we will definitely bring it back over to the US.<br /><br />We don't determine our source country for ingredients based solely on the country of origin; we find the best quality ingredient combined with the highest quality supplier and testing specifications and select them. You can be confident that DOGSWELLï¿½ products are natural, high-quality and provide the best for your pet.<br /><br />Please know we certify that our products are safe and clean with regular testing and ensure that our products meet high quality standards.

Please see attached for an example of test results for our treats; I have attached one of our VITALITY(tm) products that were tested recently.<br /><br />Our material suppliers are certified clean and clear of any contaminants. If raw ingredients do not meet their specifications and pass safety tests, then the ingredient is rejected immediately and never enters our processing facilities. Moreover, we strive to use products from suppliers that treat their animals humanely.  Please see attached for an image of our chickens in their barn.  I do not know of a reliable site that describes the process.<br /><br />Please know that we honestly believe that pets are family too and we feed our products to our own pets regularly.

review/summary: DO NOT PURCHASE THESE STRIPS IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR DOG ALIVE!!!
review/text: BUYER BEWARE! This caused severe intestinal bleeding and an inflamed stomach lining in two of my toy poodles who had to be taken emergency, to my nearest animal hospital! The vet bill cost me $1,200 for a $25 6 pack of death strips! I have the remaining 5 packs that are sealed and was going to return them to amazon, but they don't accept edibles..<br /><br />I always buy Mellow Mut and wanted to give these a try. I don't know what possessed me to switch, but I'm so sorry I did!!! They seemed a bit rough, like an old piece of leather, very coarse, not the usual kind of texture my dogs have been used to. I didn't think much of it at first, because they eat these types of treats all the time and they are supposed to be the ''nautral choice'' only healthful, not harmful! But, I never knew the damage they would cost my dogs. They began to become very listless after digestion, severe bloody vomit and explosive, watery diarrhea with blood followed, almost to the point of shock!!! I just got home from a long night at the hospital with them and they are in a very delicate state and still not in the clear. I have to return with them if the vomiting continues for futher investagation!<br /><br />I don't know what to expect in the next couple of hours! They are on very strong medications and must follow a very bland diet for three weeks that is, if no more complications arise! I pray my babies make a full recovery! I urged amazon to pull these off the website, before this tragedy occurs with another innocent life! They are poison for dogs, maybe this batch was just the contaminated one? Either way, you don't want to take that chance with your beloved pooch! Please stay away! I don't even care if I lost my money on this order, you can't put a price on your best friend! I just want everyone's dogs to be safe! Vitality brand dog strips are toxic!!!!<br /><br />P.S. I just found out Mellow Mut and Vitality dog chews are made in China and manufactured by the same company Dogswell! I will never EVER purchase their products again! I'm reporting them to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration!

It's the one treat I can always get them to do their tricks for! I used to get them at a dog shop in a town over an hour away. Now, I get them on Amazon for a fraction of the price and they're delivered to my door every month (free shipping).

Be careful what you give your best friend, he trusts you. Now I am not one to want to hurt a companies products by bad mouthing them but I am not happy that I gave my dog chicken products from China, maybe by accident, I didn't see the small print (and it is VERY small print), as yourself the question too, if they made the words 'Made in China' bigger and on the front, would anyone buy this? If I am proven to be wrong I will be fair and remove this review but my Vitality chicken strips have the words 'MADE IN CHINA' in tiny print on the back.

review/summary: I gotta admit, these are great.
review/text: I first came across these while buying a variety of treats and toys for my new Australian Shepherd puppy. The lack of fillers and bad stuff, and very simple (essentials only) ingredients list was impressive.<br /><br />My dog loves these, and they have been very helpful for training purposes. As soon as he hears me open the bag, he comes and sits and waits in anticipation.<br /><br />They are slightly dry, which may account for some slight constipation, but like anything, treats should be given in small quantities and in moderation.<br /><br />My only real disappointment with these treats (and this apparently applies to all treats made by this company) is that they are made in China. While this isn't necessarily everything, if it were not for the great bullet point list of qualities these treats have, I would be looking for a US-manufactured product.<br /><br />It is my understanding (based on statements by Dogswell) that their China-based facilities are highly inspected, etc.  Hopefully, this is true, but there's no real way to know without flying to China to take a look.<br /><br />Either way, if Dogswell were to move its<br />Manufacturing to the US, and keep or even improve its standards, I would give these treats a 5+ rating, as the concept is really great, and my puppy loves them.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company will consider doing this soon.

review/summary: Great Treats
review/text: At first, I was very hesitant to buy this treat for our dogs. I was expecting these to be hard, because they look very similar to the one I usually buy from PetSmart. The "hard" treat I'm used to break up in to tiny sharp pieces, and sometime choked our dogs making them cough up.<br /><br />However, I took a leap of faith based on the great reviews on Amazon and bought the Chicken Breast flavor.<br /><br />To my surprise, they were soft, and easy to bend and tear apart. The dogs seems to love them, and I was able to cut up 1 strip in to smaller bit-size to use them as a training incentive.<br /><br />They will do anything for this treat, so it's a great product to our dogs motivated to do tricks for treats.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: These treats are an absolute MUST for my dogs. They would probably stop eating dog food if I gave them more of these, but one nice aspect of these treats is it tells you on the back how many they can have (by dog's weight) daily. My two toy poodles will do just about anything, including chewing the bag open for me, to get these. Except, maybe, eating their dog food dinner first. Dogswell has these treats for vitality, but it  also has these treats for arthritis and other problems too. And besides chicken, they also have duck breast, which my dogs are crazy about. It's so convenient to get them thru Amazon, too.

review/summary: 4.5 Stars: Healthy Treat with noticable benefits
review/text: I bought Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast for my finicky Boston Terrier after visiting my mom's and she gave him a dried chicken meat treat which he devoured. But I didn't like how brittle and hard the jerky treat was and made me concerned about him choking on it, even after breaking them into bite size pieces. I found Dogswell Vitality for Dogs at Target and gave it try after feeling through the bag that it wasn't as hard as the other dried meat treats with a slight bendable feel to it plus the disclaimer that the flaxseed and vitamins included helped dog's healthy eyes, skin and coat. The reason the disclaimer appealed to me is my dog has dry, flaky skin and occasionally gets dry patches.<br /><br />I have tried all types of shampoos, both prescribed by the vet and store bought, even RX fish oil pills from my vet, which I disliked giving my dog because I don't like putting pill in mouth daily since I couldn't trick him by putting it on his food. I can say none of them worked near as well as Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast for his skin problems.<br /><br />I've been given my dog, who weighs approx. 18 lbs., two to three strips a day broken into bite size pieces for nearly two months now. After about two weeks, I noticed the flaky dry skin scales weren't as noticeable and now it's barely noticeable at all. When I noticed the difference at two weeks I started ordering Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because I knew this treat was going to be a regular part of my dog's daily meal plan going forward and the program helps cut the cost of these expensive dog treats.<br /><br />I do recommend in an additional to this treats zip bag, putting the treats in a second ziploc type bag to help keep the jerky strips from drying out further and loosing it small bit of moisture. I have found this keeps the jerky strips as moist as when you first open the bag. And even though these jerky treats aren't as brittle and hard as it's competitors, they are still brittle enough that I feel I need to break them into bite size pieces for my dog.

review/text: From :[..]<br />FDA issues health warning to veterinarians, pet owners about chicken jerky products from China<br />Nov 21, 2011<br />DVM NEWSMAGAZINE<br /><br />Rockville, Md. -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning to veterinarians and pet owners about chicken jerky products imported from China, after seeing an increase in dog illnesses over the last 12 months.<br /><br />The illnesses, attributed to consumption of chicken jerky products from China--also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats--were reported to FDA by both veterinarians and pet owners.<br /><br />FDA first issued a cautionary warning about chicken jerky products in September 2007, and again in December 2008. Complaints dropped off in late 2009 and for most of 2010, FDA says, but the agency is once again seeing a rise in cases.<br /><br />The agency is advising consumers who feed their dogs chicken-jerky products to watch for these clinical signs:<br /><br />* decreased appetite,<br /><br />* decreased activity,<br /><br />* vomiting,<br /><br />* diarrhea (sometimes with blood),<br /><br />* increased water consumption,<br /><br />* and/or increased urination.<br /><br />If the dog shows any of these signs, FDA says pet owners should stop feeding the chicken-jerky product. Pet owners should also consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours, FDA says.<br /><br />Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some adverse event reports have involved mortality.<br /><br />FDA says it is working with several animal health diagnostic laboratories to determine why the products are causing illness. Despite extensive chemical and microbial testing, FDA adds it has not been able to identify a contaminant yet.<br /><br />FDA is also asking veterinarians to report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or Click here<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've been awarding this "Chicken Breast, Flaxseed & Vitamins" strip of chicken jerky to my 25 pound mixed breed dog for over a year without any problem. In fact, this is her favorite dog food treat, valued almost as high as freshly cooked chicken or sliced Swiss cheese. The instructions say she can have up to two a day and if it were up to her, she would happily devour the entire bag (including much of the packaging).

review/text: Dogswell jerky treat come China.  They are not safe.  I've had a subscribe and save subscription for the product, but I've calcelled after reading this story from September 15, 2012.  (Just search for the article's title, which is the same as my review.)<br />----<br />The FDA now says 350 dogs and one cat have died in the last 18 months, reportedly after eating chicken jerky treats made in China.<br /><br />An FDA report released this week says they've received 2,200 reports of illnesses linked to the treats - the deaths are included in that number. There is no geographic pattern to the illnesses and deaths - cases have been reported from all 50 states and 6 Canadian provinces.<br /><br />The FDA says the majority of complaints involve chicken jerky (treats, tenders, and strips), but others include duck, sweet potato, and treats where chicken or duck jerky is wrapped around dried fruits, sweet potatoes, or yams.<br /><br />The report goes on to say that in the past 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in importation of pet food from China. It is estimated that nearly 86 million pounds of pet food came from China in 2011. Pet treats, including jerky pet treats, are currently considered the fastest growing segment in the pet food market.<br /><br />The FDA has been investigating the reports of illnesses, but no definitive cause has been determined.<br /><br />"The ongoing global investigation is complex, multifaceted and includes a wide variety of experts at the FDA including toxicologists, epidemiologists, veterinary researchers, forensic chemists, microbiologists, field investigators and senior agency officials," the report says.<br /><br />The FDA says product samples have been tested for contaminants known to cause the symptoms and illnesses reported in pets, and they are now expanding testing to include irradiation byproducts and they are consulting with NASA experts about it.<br /><br />In their report, the FDA says jerky treats are not necessary for pets to have a balanced diet - basically advising people not to feed them to their pets. But if you choose to give your pet the treats,  watch them closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination.

review/summary: Dogs FAVORITE treats - stinks that they are sourced from China!
review/text: Far and away these are my dogs favorite treats - and I've always liked the fact that it's really just pure jerky with a few added beneficial ingredients. She really loves the "Duck" Happy Hips the most for whatever reason, but she also likes the Chicken Vitality Treats and sometimes the Chicken Happy Hips.<br /><br /> She started eating these intially (when I first brought her home) because my local Safeway used to sell them at a decent price buy one, get one free. I would stockpile like crazy whenever they went on sale and as she got pickier and pickier as she got healthier these remained one of the few treats she would eat.<br /><br />Unfortunately I know that "free range" chicken (or duck, or any poultry, really) doesn't mean a thing as the requirements for a farm to be called free range are not stringent at all. Pretty much they will pile them up on top of each other but so long as they can "touch the ground" (not in cages) it's "free range." (Ugh, now I remember why I've been a vegetarian for 15+ years....)<br /><br />I have heard of a number of issues with the jerky chicken treats sourced from China and I keep closely monitoring her for any changes; in the interim I limit the amount of treats she gets anyway and the air dried raw food she eats is sourced from New Zealand. Hopefully I will eventually be able to find something to replace these with, but until then I'm fairly confident about them.<br /><br />After all, I feel better feeding these even if they ARE sourced from China because they are (at least) not irridiated and I feel better feeding these than the biscuit-style treats that have little nutriotional value.<br /><br />Unfortunately my Safeways finally stopped their buy-1 get-1 sales and raised their prices accordingly so I started orderign online via Amazon. I'm cautious whenever I open a new package of ANY kind of treats so I really like the fact that I now buy the larger packages for "bulk" discounts. It means I am using the same bags longer.<br /><br />Of course not all treats are for all dogs, and if I was starting from scratch I'd probably avoid feeding her these. (I really like Jones Natural Chews and would love to try their USA-sourced jerky) However, considering I'm on a very tight budget at the moment and she is picky beyond belief I have to made do.

review/text: Enough of these misinformation.<br /><br />The FDA has investigated this product since 2007 and have not found any problems with the product.  FDA recently issued updated report dated 3/9/2012.<br /><br />Google:<br />"Questions and Answers Regarding Chicken Jerky Treats from China" by March 9, 2012 issued by FDA<br /><br />"<br />What is FDA testing for?<br />Since 2007, FDA has been actively investigating the cause of illness in pets reported in association with the consumption of chicken jerky products. Samples have been tested by FDA laboratories, by the Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (Vet-LRN), and by other animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S for multiple chemical and microbiological contaminants.<br />Product samples were tested for Salmonella, metals, furans, pesticides, antibiotics, mycotoxins, rodenticides, nephrotoxins (such as aristolochic acid, maleic acid, paraquat, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, toxic hydrocarbons, melamine and related triazines) and were screened for other chemicals and poisonous compounds. DNA verification was conducted on these samples to confirm the presence of poultry in the treats. Samples have also been submitted for nutritional composition (which includes glycerol concentrations), vitamin D excess and enterotoxin analysis. Some samples from recent cases (2011-2012) have been submitted for multiple tests and we are awaiting results. More samples are in the process of being collected for testing.<br /><br />What are the results of testing?<br />Samples collected from all over the United States have been tested for a wide variety of substances and to date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses.<br /><br />Has there been any indication that metal contamination in chicken jerky products may be the cause of illness in dogs?"<br />FDA's previous testing of chicken jerky product samples did not show toxic levels of metals. In addition, results from March 2012 toxic metal analyses, which included tests for heavy metals, have again shown samples of chicken jerky products to be negative for toxic metals.<br />"<br /><br />Amazon,  please continue sale of this product.  I have been a loyal buyer for the past 4 years and this has consistently been her favourite treat, second only to home-made Chicken Jerky fresh from the oven.

review/summary: Your dog will love these!
review/text: My dog got hooked on these pretty young, and now they're the only "treat" he'll eat. My mom had been giving them to her dog, and when he stayed over there he got a taste of them and went crazy. They seem to be relatively healthy, and we can make them last a long time. My dog is a wanderer, and the best way we've found to keep him close, is to give him a piece of one of these when we whistle and he comes home. Since we've gotten him trained, he always comes back to a whistle. He's a small dog so we usually only give him about 1/3 of one of these, and one bag will last us a month. If you do the subscription plan with Amazon, the price ends up being very reasonable.

review/text: I've tried giving my dog more treats than I can count, and this is about the only thing my picky Chihuahua goes nuts for. We give pieces to her in the morning before we leave for work and that keeps her preoccupied so she doesn't feel sad we are leaving her. It's better for your dog than rawhide and gives them the chewing satifaction that they crave.

review/text: Jerky-type treat, too big for my Yorkshire Terrier to swallow whole, which is great, I have worried a lot about the super-mini "greenies" but everyone has always been fine.<br />Anyway, at a special sale price, these are GREAT in every possible way. The only hesitation I would ever have for a human companion of a 20lb and under fur baby is the cost.

review/text: My dog (miniature dachshund) is not a treat-eater and turns her nose up at most treats, organic or not.  However, she'll literally bounce her way to me and run like crazy to get one of these.  They're of a softer consistency than the chicken breasts and don't stick in her throad like some of the other dried treats.

review/text: I adopted a 6 year old female Yorkie a year ago. She had been rescued from a puppy mill in Missouri where she had multiple litters of puppies and was caged in a small kennel. She looked pitiful when I got her. She had never had a treat of any kind, but soon understood what it was. These Dogswell Vitality treats with Flaxseed and Vitamins have contributed to transforming her (Brees) coat and skin. She looks beautiful now. I like that this treat has no added hormones, no fillers and no byproducts.  The only downside is that it is made in China.

review/summary: Proceed With Caution
review/text: My beloved black Lab recently experienced liver failure. The vet said he was 24 hours away from death.  At the time he was eating the Dogswell Vitality Chicken<br />strips as a treats.  Though it would be impossible to say that these treats caused the problem, I would proceed with caution.  If it does not say that the product ingredients come from the USA and that the product is also made in the USA, I no longer buy it.  I will pay more for a product made here rather than risk this happening again.  In all fairness, I cannot be 100% sure this product caused the problem.  All other food my dog gets is organic meats and vegetables that we eat as well. And we have had no liver problems. I will gladly pay more money for USA products that support USA jobs. Which is why I switched to the Colorado brand treats.
