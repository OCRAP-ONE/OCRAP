review/summary: Tastes great, less filling, no side effects or aftertaste
review/text: I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the aftertaste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available - 10 years? - because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from.<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time. When it comes to cooking, the Splenda is calibrated to be the equivalent of sugar by volume. In other words, a cup of Splenda is used whenever the recipe calls for a cop of sugar.

review/summary: Good stuff, average price
review/text: I can get 9.7ozs of Altern (an off brand version that's exactly the same thing as Splenda) for $5.24 at any store locally. Also, I haven't really found Splenda's sugar-to-Splenda ratio to be accurate. It doesn't really go that far for me. But in many things, Splenda/Altern does taste like sugar or very close. So I still use it. It works well in green tea, for instance, but not so well for sweetening fruit juices.<br /><br />Until Amazon goes back to something like their old offer (2 bags of 9.7oz Splenda for around $7.00, which was discontinued months ago) I'll stick with Altern from the local store. If you don't have this option where you live, this might still be worth while.

review/summary: Best of the Sugar Substitutes! Highly Recommended
review/text: Splenda had been a real blessing for me since becoming a type 2 diabetic. I really like the flavor and try to buy diet products that use it as the main sweetener. All of the other sugar substitutes just taste bad to me or have a significant aftertaste. Splenda does not impact my blood sugar levels or cause me any "gastric issues".<br /><br />This is the granulated version that is great in coffee and for cooking (a little goes a long way).<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Xylitol and erythritol are better
review/text: The taste and aftertaste of sucralose is artificial and unpleasant.<br /><br />Xylitol can have a bit of an aftertaste sometimes but it generally tastes more like real sugar and has less of an aftertaste. It also helps to combat tooth bacteria. Erythritol is nice for some uses because it's basically non-caloric. I've tried all the sugar replacements, and I prefer xylitol for most things (baking especially), and erythritol for other things (chocolate, lemonade, et cetera).<br /><br />The best news is there is no debate about toxicity when it comes to xylitol and erythritol, unlike Stevia extracts, aspartame, saccharine, and sucralose. Everyone agrees that these sugar alcohols are non-toxic (except don't feed dogs xylitol because they can't metabolize it correctly).<br /><br />I see no reason to pay so much for sucralose, which is several hundred times "sweeter" than sugar so should not be so expensive. Maltodextrin, the bulking agent, isn't expensive to produce either.

review/summary: Not great
review/text: This is an odd product. I had used the Splenda Individual Packets before and liked them ok (as much as one can like sweeteners in the first place). Then I decided to buy this bulk bag because I got a bit tired of opening up several small packets when needing a bigger amount of Splenda. Much to my surprise it seems as if the Splenda in the bulk bag is significantly less sweet than the product in the individual packets. When using it in a cup of tea, two packets of Splenda used to be plenty but not with the bulk bag. It requires at least three heaped teaspoons to sufficiently sweeten my tea, sometimes even more. What's more, when adding this Splenda to hot drinks it really fizzles, almost as if adding something carbonated. I never noticed this happening with the packeted Splenda and find this quite strange.<br /><br />Also, ever since I switched to the bulk bag Splenda, I have experienced relatively frequent digestive upset, something I never had with the packets. I am not too fond of this stuff and will not buy it again.

review/text: My little Pomeranian loves treats, but this product makes him physically ill. I even cut them into smaller, bite-sized pieces (no easy chore by the way because they're rock hard) but they just don't agree with him. In addition, they have the most awful fake-bacon smell you'll ever encounter.

review/summary: These treats make my pooch sick!
review/text: I have a Cocker Spaniel who absolutely adores these treats. I jokingly refer to them as his "crack sticks," because he is seriously addicted. Whenever I pull them out of the cupboard, he starts running around in circles and barking like a crazy person. In short, he's a fan.<br /><br />I, however, cannot recommend them. Sometimes he can eat them just fine...but other times, he vomits them back up. We're also city dwellers, meaning I have to pick up his waste on the streets. I know this is gross, but the bacon treats are in his poo...um, unprocessed. He'll often even pass the bacon treat on its own, just dropping the little hard centers on the pavement while we walk.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing these again.

review/summary: DO NOT FEED YOUR SMALL DOG THIS!!!!!
review/text: After hundreds of dollars on x-rays, urgent care vet visits, etc - we finally found out the source for all my pup's pain were these treats.  The centers DO NOT dissolve in their stomach, and if they do not vomit them back up, they get constipated and cannot excrete, which leaves them in tremendous pain.  I have a Pomapoo (1/2 Pomeranian, 1/2 Poodle who is 10 months old) and he has been in pain for weeks because of this treat, and it broke my heart to know that I was the one keeping him in pain by feeding him these treats!! Maybe bigger dogs can digest them, but PLEASE PLEASE do not feed this product to your pet if you have a small dog! I thought it'd be a good alternative as he likes to chew and there is no rawhide in them, but the center does not break down, and he had one part lodged in his small intestine and another stuck in his stomach.  I cannot express how awful it is to see your pup in pain, and it is not worth the risk to try these products.  I hope in some way I can save another pup from having to go thru the pain and experience mine went thru - and the owner lots of spendy vet bills.

review/summary: Made both my dogs sick for a few days
review/text: Pur Luv Mini Bones for small dogs, peanut butter flavor, 2-pound bag from PetsMart. Looks like batch info is 2761SKC101 BEST BY SEP 2014.<br /><br />Just bought these in the middle of Feb 2012, and started by giving my two dogs one each in the evening. The next day my Maltese threw up her food twice. The next day the same. The third day my toy fox terrier (who can eat and digest ANYTHING) threw up in the morning on the bed, and the vomit was entirely pieces of these Mini Bones. Way too coincidental. After five days and each dog getting five treats total, I've stopped with these. And now a few days later my dogs appear fine.<br /><br />The bag says there's a website ([...]) but it suspiciously doesn't work. And I cant find a phone number, only a some consumer response P.O. box. Shifty.<br /><br />Don't risk it, stick to something else like Greenies.

review/summary: Good Price but My Dogs Didn't Love Them
review/text: For the money, this is a good deal.  You get a big bag of X-large 'bones'.  And compared to other brands like Busy Bone where they charge you five dollars for two bones - this really is a good price!<br /><br />Oddly enough though, my dogs didn't just love them.  Now don't get me wrong, they ate them - but that's not really saying much since they eat just about anything.  But they didn't snarf them down and beg for more like they have with some other brands.  It could be because this is the first time I've given them something peanut butter flavored, or it could be the brand - unfortunately, I really can't say why they didn't like them - I can only report my observations.<br /><br />For only $9 to $12 a bag, it's certainly worth the money to give them a try...and who knows, your dogs could love them.

I took one to my vet, and I DO NOT know if it's related to this product, but he said her feces had some kind of spores in it and they're all on pills now. He said the spores are passed around by eating dog poop, but they've been together for over a year and never came down with anything like this. As I said, I do not know if the spore thing is related to this product, but the vomiting definately is, and I'll be returning this large bag of "treats" today.

Since the grinder bottle is refillable I just ordered a large jar of it. I didnt give it 5 stars because I found one thing quite annoying.  The label information, except the Faerie's Finest logo, disappears as you twist it to grind the salt. I have never had any problems like that with other grinders.  So I hope the company reads  comments and come up with a label that will withhold the use.  As of now, when I refill the jar I need to somehow mark it with what type of salt it is.

review/summary: Perfect size snacks for Dog Toy
review/text: Until recently I was purchasing these snacks at my local Pet Supermarket. They no longer carry them so I went to Amazon.com. The reason they are perfect for my two dogs ( a Lab and a Chow mix) is not the size obviously but because I have a dog toy that is one of those toys that you pull out the center and fill the different layers inside with treats. After putting the center piece back in you shake it around and the dog has to learn to push it with his nose or paws to get the treats to lay just right to fall out. Well my Lab learned in one day and just loves this toy. The ONLY treats that I have found that fit are this brand and he loves all the flavors but especially the cheese flavor and the yogurt brand. There are quite a lot in one bag and reasonably priced. Yes, I will buy more!<br />Buddy Bits Rocks!

review/summary: Buddie Bits Review
review/text: My three chihuahuas (4 lbs, 8 lbs, 9.5 lbs) love these little treats.  The treats are small so that they are easy on their little mouths and teeth and they are small enough not to contain way more calories that I want them to have (have to keep them trim and healthy).  They are also lightly crispy rather than hard and crunchy (many chihuahuas have dental problems), so I don't have to worry about gum  or tooth damage or pain.  From the response that I get whenever my chihuahuas just see the package in my hand and the way they dance around until they get their treat, I have no doubts about how much they enjoy these little crispy treats.<br /><br />I first purchased Buddy Bones (a bigger treat but same recipe) from my local Pet Supplies store and broke them into smaller pieces because they were larger treats and my little dogs had some trouble chewing them.  Pet Supplies quit carrying these treats so after checking Petsmart and Petco, I was getting a little discouraged.  Then I had the (its seems to most non dog lovers I'm sure) thought to try on Amazon and here they are. Not only did I find the treats my dogs love, but I found a much smaller version and I do not have to break them up into smaller pieces.  Now when it's treat time, my three little dogs don't look at me with disappointment any more.

review/summary: My Dog Loves These Treats - Far More Than Any She Has Ever Had In Her 12 Years As My Companion
review/text: I received these Best Buddy Bits for my dog about 6 weeks ago - and she absolutely loves them.  At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats.  That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one.  She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling.  However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats.  I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me.  I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.<br /><br />My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds.  However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats.  Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats.  I am certainly glad I purchased four bags of these Best Buddy Bits.<br /><br />I will have to tell you that until I received my shipment from Amazon, for some reason, I thought these treats were named Best Buddy BITES.  I do not know how I made such a blunder.  Imagine my embarrassment (in front of my dog since she was the only one around) when I realized that I had been wrong this entire time. Oh well, at least I am certainly straight on the name now!<br /><br />One last item, the Crude Fat (min) level of these treats is 13%, it is a bit more than I usually like to give my dog, but I will overlook it on these treats because she absolutely goes bonkers for these treats.  The things I do for my dog.

review/summary: Yeah  for Best Buddy Bits
review/text: Our dog Callie loves these treats.  Her Auntie from Connecticut sent her these for her birthday and she loved them so much that after she ran out, we found them at Amazon. (of course)  We bought 2 more bags.  Callie sniffed the box they came in and got all excited.  She has the nose of a lab.  She is a 60 pound dog and these little treats go a long long ways.  They are small in size but get so much reward for the bite.  One bag will lasts for several weeks because you choose how much to give.  You can give 1 or 10.  The bag never seems to finish.  There is a lot of enjoyment out of one of these little bags because you can teach your dog tricks and reward them with like I say 1-10 little bits.  We love them also because they are healthier than other treats.  She loves them because they are good.  That's all that matters.  By the way you can't beat the price.

review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/summary: Crazy Jerky
review/text: Ok, to preface this, I AM A VEGETARIAN. With that being said, I haven't had REAL beef or turkey jerky in quite some time and I have been missing it dearly. Having tried many vegetarian jerkies I can honestly say that this is by far the best! Most soy based jerkies are strangely on the oily side and the flavors are usually off. Being a "dry style" jerky fan I am pleased with the chewiness of Stonewall's and the WILD flavor. I have tried most of the other varieties of Stonewall's but none seemed to please me as much as the WILD. I'm also on Weight Watchers and have found that they are fairly low on points (4pts per bag) and are a great source of protein for vegetarians (14g). Be warned, the WILD is quite WILD, spicy spicy but in a good way!

review/text: The Hot Pastrami flavor is divine!  I like spicy things and just ordered another shipment of these because I went through them faster than I had anticipated.  They are moist and chewy, but not so chewy that you're still chewing to make it swallowable after all the flavor's gone.  I think they struck a nice balance.<br /><br />A caveat: If you're used to Tofurky Jurky or Primal Spirit, these will strike you as a little bit airy.  Also, these are a bit higher in fat than the other brands: 8 or 9 grams per 160-calorie package.  These ones don't really feel too oily in your mouth, though.

When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome.<br /><br />Stonewall's is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. If you don't like your jerkey hot, I suggest you try mild or teriyaki. Otherwise, this is the stuff for you!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully!

review/text: My local health food store started selling these 10 years ago and then stopped to focus more on vitamins instead of food!<br />So now I order these directly from Lumen and usually get the case of "over and unders" which contains packages that they can't sell to stores due to the weight being off. This is your best bet since I read reviews on here of receiving them stale off amazon.<br />The best flavors are the original mild, bbq beef and the teriyaki beef. I HATE the Cajun varieties, they are so dry and tough to chew.<br />They are high in fat so I usually have to make my husband hide them from me since these are a rare treat for us in the house, I could eat 4-5 bags in a row!<br />Caution if you eat too many bags over a period of a few days, you may experience gas!<br />Try ordering direct and you'll be enjoying the BEST veggie jerquee there is in the US!!!!<br />PS These are made in Louisiana, could you ask for anything more authentic besides the real thing (meaning meat)

Stonewall's original and stonewall's original mild are some of the best tasting jerkey you'll find. What's best, is that this product is meat free. So for all you vegans out there this is especially a great treat idea. The package here is a store display container.  I keep them in the closet and when we remember we have them, it makes a perfect snack.  I think we'll be working on the box for about 2 month and that's with two jerkey freaks eating them.

review/summary: Airy and oily.
review/text: The texture on these things is all off.  For one, they're incredibly airy.  I am a huge fan of Primal Spirit and Tofurky Jurky, and had been used to denser vegan jerky when I first tried these.  It felt like I was chewing air.  Also, because these are higher in fat (8-9 grams per 160 calorie package), they are a bit oilier.  Coupled with the airiness, when you bite down on these, you can feel the oil oozing out of the little nuggets into your mouth, which isn't too pleasant.<br /><br />I don't think the flavor is anything special, either.  To be fair, I'm not sure what chicken tastes like or is supposed to taste like, but there are plenty of wonderfully flavorful vegan and vegetarian products out there.  This is not one of them.

review/text: I've tried two flavors - Pepperoni and Original Wild - and have enjoyed them both.  The texture's pretty good - nice and chewy.  The moisture level is okay, but it could be improved by being just a tiny bit more moist. There's also a little bit of an aftertaste (which I didn't find to be unpleasant, but some might).  The spice level on the Pepperoni and Original Wild flavors were perfect. The Original Wild was medium hot, so it might be a little too much for some.  I loved it though.  I recommend that people try to buy this locally before spending a lot of money on it.  I bought mine from a local vegan store online, then discovered that a large grocery chain carries it in their health food section.

review/summary: My Fave Veg Jerky
review/text: The "Original Wild" is a bit spicy for me, but "Original Mild" is spectacular, and Teriyaki Beef even better. Also like the spicy chicken one. I've tried all the veg jerky products and bewildered that none of the others come even close to this one for quality of flavor and texture. The others are loaded with sugar and taste more like candy than jerky; a couple of them are outright slimy; one was hard as a rock and flavorless. But the only time Stonewall's Jerquee ever displeased me was when the Poulsbo Market used a paper-punch to create holes along the top edge and hung them on a peg to dry out -- which I didn't realize until I got them home and they'd all been turned into hard lumps (which I ate any way). So now I have to buy them on amazon. I'll still get the fresh sushi at Poulsbo Market, that stuff's a dream, but what possessed them to poke holes in packaged foods???

review/text: I have always liked these but I haven't had them in years.  Today, I was hungry and saw them at the natural market checkout counter.  I got the flavor "spicy 'chicken'" and LOVED it.  It is clear that this is a love or hate product.  I buy Primal Strips when in need of a snack I can eat in the car and they are just ok...oily and get stuck in my teeth.  Flavor is just OK.  Stonewall's are drier and puffier and chewier but somehow, don't get stuck in my teeth.<br /><br />I am on a low-carb diet and these are only 7 g of carbs for 13 g of protein.  I am getting a case of the original mild since it is Prime.  Would like to see more flavors available on Prime.<br /><br />Definitely suggest buying a small pack first given the love/hate aspect.

review/summary: Horrific Flavor and Terrible Texture
review/text: I love other brands of vegetarian jerky. This one, I hate. It is spongy instead of chewy and smells and tastes like concentrated, stale, off-brand dog food. I could not get this funky crap out of my mouth fast enough. I should also mention that I'll eat just about anything, including bugs and grass. If it came down to it, I'd turn to them before ingesting another piece of this food-like substance.

review/summary: Terrible. Couldn't finish bag.
review/text: I just purchased this jerky from a local store because they recently quit carrying the kind I like in my town. I ate a piece and thought it was disgusting. I wanted to give it a chance, so I ate a couple more pieces. It has a grainy, nasty texture and a terrible burned BBQ sauce flavor. For some bizarre reason it's made out of soy flour instead of strips of soy.<br /><br />The best soy jerky I've ever had is Tasty Eats jerky, since it's chewy and had a wonderful flavor. Flavor is of course subjective, but personally I thought the taste of Stonewall's is terrible, and the consistency is nasty. It tries too hard to look like meat, which I feel is pretty irrelevant to the demographic of people that will be eating it in the first place. Luckily it's Gluten-Free, so hopefully I can pawn the leftovers on my boyfriend...

review/summary: Best veg jerky
review/text: I think its interesting how spread out the reviews are on this product.  I guess its one of those love it or hate it type things.  Personally, I LOVE this jerky and cannot get enough!!  My favorite flavors are the hot pastrami and teriyaki. You do have to chew quite a bit but its not the same weird chewy texture some other veg jerkys have, like primal strips.  I hate primal strips but I had them about 10 years ago and never ate once since, so if the formula has changes on those then disregard...  So maybe try a small bag of this before ordering in bulk.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: I picked these up at Natural Grocers because I used to really love jerky, but am now vegetarian for four years, and I didn't like the Primal strips enough to re-purchase. I purchased the Original Mild and the Teriyaki flavors.<br /><br />The texture of these is spot on if you like toughier jerky (I do), although the outside has a weird sort of clumpy coating. Unfortunately, the taste is TERRIBLE. Both varieties honestly tasted like dog food. I also had two friends (one recently vegetarian, the other not) try them, and they said exactly the same thing. My friend's toddler-aged son loved them, though.<br /><br />I liked these even less than the Primal strips, and would not recommend them.

review/text: The overall flavor is pretty good (esp. for being vegetarian) and the texture was fine but, the one I tried, "original wild" was just TOO (spicy) hot! I don't mind a little heat but this was rediculous.  My mouth was burning for an hour afterwards.  This may be "fun" for some but not for me!  And I will give the "mild" a try - just to be fair).

review/summary: product was moldy, but company willing to fix problem
review/text: I think the jerky would have been good, but...<br />The packages I received contained jerky that had fuzzy white stuff growing on it. None of the packages had a read-able expiration date. The clearest packaging shows Aug 2011 (which means the product still had 6 months left in its life). When I contacted Lumen, however, I did get an email and phone call from them expressing their concern about my complaint. The man I spoke with was genuinely interested in investigating the problem. The company directly sent me three free packages to replace some of the moldy ones.

review/summary: not my favorite.
review/text: The seasoning is good, but the texture is not to my liking; it's almost spongy, and microwaving did not improve the texture for me. It is a little too dry and chewy, and has a weird aftertaste. I have not tried the other versions of this jerky. If you prefer a dry and chewy veggie jerky, I would go with the Vegan Dream brand. They have a sampler pack, with 6 different flavors. Also, as I follow weight watchers online, the 1.5 oz package has 4 points, with 8 grams of fat, 152 calories, 3 grams of fiber. There are lower calorie veggie jerkies available, if that is a concern for you.

Through Amazon, I get 16 nice one-serving packets & free shipping.  I use it in rice or noodle dishes (shred it & add near the end of cooking). This is terrific stuff!!  I prefer the Hot Pastrami, but try a few of the others to see which you like best.

review/summary: Addictive and Actually Gluten Free (despite label)...
review/text: This stuff is like crack.  There's no other way of describing just how delicious it is.  If it gets old, it gets a little hard, but they never sit around long enough to get old at my house.  I order this constantly and sometimes they run out, which leaves me craving it and miserable-- or begging my local health food store to dig in their back room for stray bags.  It's THAT good!!!  The only catch on Amazon is it's ingredients list wheat (in the soy sauce) as an ingredient, but the kind I've been getting are also labeled gluten free on the front.  I'm fairly confident it's a typographical error, because I've been eating it for a year now and no gluten reaction!  Enjoy!!!

review/summary: not like jerky
review/text: i had high hopes for this stuff. i have tried several types of veggie jerky, in search of the tough, fibrous, highly seasoned jerky of my old meat eating days. granted, my memory is likely hazy as i haven't eaten meat for about 20 years. however, this stuff is NOT like beef jerky. true, they are a bit hard and chewy. and they are very flavourful, but....in my opinion, not in a good way.<br /><br />if you have ever had those dehydrated soy slices made by "so soya" (and others) then you know what these are. take those slices, marinade and fry or bake, and you've probably got something like this jerky. they have a distinct flavour - i really can't pinpoint exactly what flavour it is, but it is consistent in all of the varieties and it is not too pleasant. i found the tofurky jerky to have a better flavour and nicer dense texture, but i think my search for the ideal jerky shall continue.

review/text: I like all the Stonewall Jerquee products. The fat content is somewhat higher than I'd like for very frequent consumption, but if you have an active metabolism/don't diet, it's a great higher protein veggie snack. Very tasty and satisfying to chew. Easy to pack, toss in a purse, travel bag, etc. Helpful for vegan's/vegetarians on the go, looking for protein away from home.

review/text: As with all foods, your mileage may vary with this product depending on freshness and all that. I didn't much care for it at first, but I found it to be an acquired taste and I actually do like the product now.<br /><br />It can be a bit greasy, but word has it that if you let greasy 'jerky' products sit out overnight in the open air that it helps with that. I've never had an issue with it, so I don't know for sure, but I suppose it'd be worth a try if you like the taste but find it a bit oily.<br /><br />All in all, compared with some of the gross real-meat jerky products I've tried, this stuff is pretty good. But don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself.

review/text: As truffle lovers, we took a truffle hunting trip with Truffle Hunters, the makers of this oil. We returned with several bottles of their truffle oil and I can say that this is the best truffle oil on the market. You can tell it is authentic, not flavored with artificial, chemical flavors, because you can see actual truffle shavings in each bottle. We're so pleased to know that we'll be able to replenish our supply on Amazon, rather than having to contact the company in the UK. Now if only they would also sell their wonderful truffles on Amazon!!

review/summary: Great seasoning mix
review/text: I used to buy this in my local Whole Foods and then they stopped stocking it. It's much cheaper buying it this way, and I know I always have some by me for an easy chili (not necessarily vegetarian), or for using to season other dishes. It's just right; not too hot, so that you can still taste all the other flavors. Buy a pack and share with your friends and family!

review/summary: One of Zoe's two top favorite treats
review/text: My 14 year old Aussie(ZOE)goes nuts over two different treats and this is one of them. She is almost deaf, but I swear she can hear a ziplock back opening from 30 feet away and through walls.Until her "ARF-ritis" got so bad, she would chase these like a thrown ball and snatch them out of the air. To my nose, they don't smell too appetizing, but, chase them or not, she loves them.

review/summary: Bad Batch?
review/text: We have bought these from a variety of sources over the past 2 years.  This bag came and the chicken meatballs seemed to be an odd texture with pink centers and a lot harder than any of the others - we ended up tossing most of the bag.  All in all, our dogs really like these.  We put them in their kongs and it takes a little while for them to get them out.  One of the dogs has figured out if he throws the kong in the air it will bounce and knock the meatball loose.  He gets exercise as well as being entertained for a while. So the 3 stars are for either poor quality control or a bag that sat in storage for way too long.

review/summary: Milo Kitchen Chicken Meatballs - Great treats for training
review/text: Just got a bag of these for my two shepherd dogs for training treats.  I chopped them into smaller pieces to feed as rewards. My dogs' enthusiasm greatly increased after they tasted these new treats.<br />I took these meatballs to my dogs' agility classes. Many of the dogs belonging to other people were very interested in what was in my waist treat pouch. So, I ended up passing out meatballs to other people in the class for their dogs.<br />Many of the dogs had become somewhat tired in the heat of the day.  After their people gave them bits of the Milo chicken meatballs treats, suddenly they all perked up and seemed to have renewed energy. So I am saying each of my dogs give this a "Two Paws Up" and it seems the others in their classes agreed.<br /><br /> I normally only buy food or treats without artificial ingredients, fillers, preservatives, or nitrates. There is a preservative, BHA, a synthetic antioxidant. It is used as a preservative for fats and oils in many foods containing meat and fish.<br />Good news is they are made in the U.S.

review/summary: Dog loves them!!
review/text: My dog absolutely loves these meatballs! I'm not sure what the sodium content is as they seem to make my dog very thirsty, but when broken into little pieces and used for training, they are VERY motivating. They even smell delicious!

review/summary: sick as a dog
review/text: no stars-my dog got so sick from these and after reading of all the illnesses and even deaths of other dogs that ate them I'm glad I found out when I did but hope I can spare someone else the misery by beagle and I experienced and Im glad he lived through it but it cost a lot in terms of lost sleep and vet bills

review/summary: chicken flavored doggy snacks
review/text: You know how it goes with dog snacks- sometimes your dog will eat them right away and wag his tail- other times he'll be really stubborn about it so you have to leave the treats on his plate by his water bowl.  Eventually your animal *will* eat those treats however, despite being unnecessarily stubborn.  Anyway these chicken flavored treats are a real blast for your dog.  Let him have them!
