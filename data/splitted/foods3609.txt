review/summary: Where were these grown? They won't tell you.
review/text: I buy organic cranberry beans in 25-50 lb lots. They are a staple in our household. I had hoped to buy some from Barry Farm, and assumed - from their name - that they grew them. After all, they are a "farm," right? Understanding that some "organic" beans come from China, I thought I would call Barry Farms to confirm the country of origin for their beans. The female who took my call told me that they don't know where these beans come from since they get them from a distributor (so much for the "farm" in "Barry Farms"). I asked if she could give me the contact information for the distributor so that I could ask them directly. Her answer: "no". I asked if THEY could find out from the distributor where these beans come from. Her answer: "no". Thanks, but I'll do my business elsewhere.<br /><br />UPDATE: I ended up buying from Italian Harvest - a dot com.<br />SECOND UPDATE: Italian Harvest no longer has an organic Borlotti/Cranberry bean, so this year I purchased from Purcell Mountain Farms, and am very pleased with their product.

review/summary: Awesome quality, beautiful presentation
review/text: I purchased this for my mother, a tea lover, as a Christmas gift.  Since it was sealed up inside a cardboard box, I did not open it, and wrapped it as is.  Inside the outer cardboard box, was the  boxed chest, wrapped in light paper.  The chest is gorgeous! It is made with honey color - cut bamboo, and closes with a bamboo toggle.  Inside is the tea pot and the tea, packed in some type of packing straw.  The tea pot is on the small side, but this is what I wanted, and expected.  After you place a flower pod into the tea pot and add the hot water, the pod opens gracefully and flowers out.  It is quite beautiful, and the tea is delicious.<br /><br />The packaging, product and the presentation of this tea set is top shelf.  I was very happy with my purchase, and my mother loved her gift.

review/summary: The tea actually tastes good, in addition to good looking
review/text: I love everything about this gift set. Most importantly, the tea flower looks fabulous, and actually tastes fresh and super. As a Chinese, I grow up drinking tea and I am picky about the taste of tea. I have tried the Primula tea flowers as well, but I like the Numi one a lot more. Other than that,  the tea pot is a good match for the tea flower. The bamboo boxes are adoral as well, and I actually keep the boxes for tea bag storage after finishing the tea.

review/summary: Beautiful gift, delicious tea
review/text: I bought this set as a gift for a friend with whom I share a love of tea. She loved the bamboo box that contained the set, and the tea we shared together (Dragon Lily) was delicious. Although I believe that you could use each blossom three times, I would imagine that it would need to be done all in one setting, since I am not sure how well the flavor would translate once the flower has been steeped and then dried before a subsequent use. The glass tea pot is quite delicate, but should be fine with careful handling.

review/summary: Great gift and fun little luxury for yourself!
review/text: I bought two of these in a Friday sale for $12.50 each, and it was the deal of the century! I read the other reviews first and decided to get one for a friend and one for myself, so I could try it before giving it.<br /><br />First of all, the box: Yes, there is a very sticky glue that holds the label in place and mars the outside of the box. However, I peeled a glob of the glue off of the label and used it to lift the rest. Every bit came off fairly easily without damaging the box at all. The box itself is a little flimsy, being tied together with dried bamboo leaves, but it's perfect if all you intend to use it for is to store the tea set. Inside the set is a matching box to store the tea. I'm happy with the box because it is handsome and does what it's supposed to do (store the tea set).<br /><br />Second of all, the teapot: The teapot is clearly marked as having a 14 oz. capacity, which is a little over 1 cup (12 oz.). I suppose if you were expecting a full-sized teapot, you'd be very disappointed, but it's clear in the specs what size it is. It's a delicate little thing, being all glass, but the glass is thick enough to do the job. I guess some people didn't anticipate how hot an all-glass teapot can get, so I advise putting it on a trivet or potholder while it steeps, and holding the lid in place with a potholder while you serve. I read in other reviews that some people had trouble with the pot cracking when they added boiling water, so I brought my water to a boil and let it cool for 2 minutes before adding it to the teapot to prevent this. The teapot is pretty, strong enough to do its job, and is as advertised, so I'm happy with it.<br /><br />Third of all, the tea: The tea itself is quite ordinary tea. The brewing is more entertaining than the drinking. If you read the description of the tea, it clearly states what type of tea leaves are used in each flower, so you shouldn't expect anything but the taste of that tea. From the reviews, I think people were expecting some sort of miraculous-tasting magic tea. It's just tea, but it's decent tea. Some reviewers said that their tea was stale, but mine wasn't. You definitely CANNOT get three full-strength brews from a single flower---that just isn't true. I managed to get two full-strength brews from the Midnight Peony tea flower, but it's a strong black tea, so I imagine that you may only be able to get one full-strength brew from the lighter tea flowers. I brewed the tea for a full five minutes, poured, and added more water immediately in order to get the second brew. I attempted a third brew using the same method but you could tell just from the color that it wasn't full-strength. Next time I will try steeping the second and third brews for a little longer than the first one. I imagine that if you attempted to dry out the flower from the first brew and re-brew it at a later date, it wouldn't work at all. So, decent tea, you can't get three brews from each flower like they say, but I was skeptical of that claim from the beginning, so I'm still happy!<br /><br />I suppose I'd be less happy if I'd paid $30 for the set, but at $12.50 in the Friday sale, this is the best deal I've gotten all year!

review/text: I love Numi tea and this tea set makes a perfect way to try a variety of flowering teas they have.  Get together with a friend or just spend time alone resting and enjoying the next perfect cup of tea.  My favorite for taste, I must admit, is the beautiful black peony.  Some of the other's are more beautiful if it is the flowering teas you like best. Each person I've sent these to have enjoyed them very much.  The only con is the price.  Buying Numi is a little hard on my pocket book.

review/summary: "Super Cool Present-I Looove It"
review/text: Sent this to my sister for her Birthday--she just called and said how much she loves it. She has transitioned to water and tea due to an illness and needed a fun thing to play with-to make the mandatory transition more FUN. She talked about it for a good 20 minutes. "Super Cool Present. I Loooove It!" The description doesn't say the tea comes in another lidded bamboo box. I read the reviews complaining about this set referring to it as not being 'perfect tea'. Anyone who has made their own herbal teas would know that. I don't think the idea is to obtain a 'perfect cup of tea' with this set, but to explore the colors, textures and scents of tea. May help someone understand the 'nature of tea' and where it comes from. Plants. Herbs. Nature. To me, that has been the side of tea that keeps me exploring and learning about it since I was a teen. Am getting one for myself.Have to, now! Gotta compare notes with her!!!

review/text: My husband and I ordered these for Mother's Day for each of our moms. They are beautiful! Sure, the pot is only big enough to make about one cup of tea at a time, but that's about what our mothers would have time to drink! The shipping was extremely fast (and was free through Supersaver shipping) and the packaging is exquisite. I feel like they'll be very impressed with their gifts this year.

review/summary: Drink and a Conversation Piece
review/text: The only thing stopping me from rating this as a 5 is the quality of the teapot itself is slightly lacking.  Mine arrived chipped and the lid doesn't sit very well which makes pouring it a bit difficult, but for the price it's hard to argue.<br /><br />After I've brewed each tea flower about 4 times, I will re-fill the teapot with cold water, and this works as a centerpiece on my counter for about a week!  Guests will notice and ask about the teapot, at which time I empty out the old flower, and voila! Instant entertainment and a great cup of tea.  I also feel better about the price of the tea flowers knowing that I have ended up with over two months worth of enjoyment of looking at the blossoms.<br /><br />The tea itself is pretty decent.  I liked the jasmine green the best, but was pleasantly surprised by the rose flavored one.<br /><br />This is definitely not recommended for your daily cuppa' because of the increased price, but it makes for a great pot to share with a friend.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I bought this product partly because I love tea and mostly because I had high hopes for re-using the bamboo box pictured on the website. The informational material that seems to be "gorilla glued" to the front/sides of the box does not come off easily so there are unsightly patches of paper once you pry off the outer wrapper. Maybe they should have used "elephant snot" or a rubbery type of glue that actually comes off.<br /><br />While the flowering teas are visually stunning & different, I disagree with the claim that each one makes 3 pots. Are they talking about the small/flimsy pot that comes with the teas (which does not hold more than 8 oz)?  That doesn't constitute a pot of tea to me. I tried making a 2nd pot (16 oz) & it turned out to be so weak as to be undrinkable. Also, even with looking at the provided photo "legend" of each tea, it is still hard to distinguish some teas from another.<br /><br />I enjoyed the 2 black teas, but mostly was unimpressed with the flavors of the green & white teas. This was not what I expected & given the chance, I would not re-purchase this in the future. Such a disappointment.

review/summary: best tea I've ever had
review/text: I just got this item and I absolutely LOVE it! I had my first tea today and it was the best tea I have ever had. I should have only had one cup of it (diabetic and use honey in my tea) but it was so very good, I  had to have a second cup. It was hard to resist a third one.<br /><br />I also sent a set to my cousin and she loves her's. She shared a couple cups of it with her mother-in-law (who is a fanatic about hot tea) and they both loved it. Now she is going to buy her mother-in-law the set. And she is thinking of buying other sets as gifts for family and friends.<br /><br />I too will be keeping this in mind when it comes time for gifts for my family and friends. It is a great item as a gift. I love being able to share something this good!

review/text: It's such a neat set!!  I received it in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised at it's presentation!  A lot of reviews complain about the quality or that the tea isn't labeled.  The gift box and tea box come in great condition, and would be really cute on a designated "tea" table. The teas aren't labeled but come with an insert that shows the pictures of each bud and talks about the flavors.  It's very easy to identify which tea you are drinking from the pictures!  Have fun with it! I ordered 4 in total and can't wait to give two of the others as gifts!!  I wish it was July already!!

review/summary: Bad smell for first "flower"
review/text: I got this gift box of Nami flowering tea leaves for Christmas.  Sat down to my first cup this morning.  No labels on the "flowers" so I decided to choose the darkest leaves as it might be the best morning tea.  After pouring water over it a horrible smell came off of it.  I had to pour it down the sink.  I give 3 stars for a great bamboo box,but so far the tea is not drinkable.  Also without labels you don't know if you pour hot water on delicate green tea leaves or boiling water on the black leaves.  I wouldn't buy it again.

review/text: Flowering tea is a nice gift idea, so I bought five of these based on the ratings here. Big mistake. What you get is a cheaply made, garish box that is stuffed with a lot of cardboard shred. This all comes packed inside an outer cardboard box. Somewhere in the middle of all this cheesy packaging is a Dollar Store quality glass teapot and a small box of flowering tea. I am embarassed to give this as a gift. I took the tea out of the box and put it in a small gift bag. I will recycle as much of the pile of packaging junk as possible. A complete waste of money and even though it is mostly packaging, Amazon calls it "grocery" and I cannot return it. Please don't waste your money on this one.

review/summary: Fantastic gift set for any tea fan
review/text: The beautiful thing about giving this box as a gift is that so many recipients will appreciate it: the tea afficionado, the casual sipper, and the tea newbie will all delight in it. Aside from gifting, it is ideal for entertaining and makes a lovely conversation piece.<br /><br />The set comes packaged in an attractive bamboo box that can be reused. Inside is another smaller bamboo box holding each of the tea flowers. I love a reusable gift, and this beautiful box is something that will find multiple uses. Also regarding the packaging, I was concerned that the delicate glass teapot would break during shipping, but it was snugly nested in a bed of shredded paper that left it completely intact upon arrival. Everything about the appearance is wonderful; it is a gift you can be proud to give to someone and does not feel like a bargain "couldn't think of anything better" gift set.<br /><br />The box includes nine different flavors of tea; green, black, and white teas are all represented. The tea comes in the form of bundles in varying shapes that, upon contact with boiling water, unfurl into splendid flowers of leaves. The delicate glass pot allows for a great view of the blossoming. Each pot makes three small teacups, and each flower can brew three times without losing flavor. This tea set simply demands to be used with company, both because of the amount each flower brews and also because of how entertaining it is to watch. Drinking alone is definitely not the intent of the Numi set.<br /><br />I have only sampled the Jade Fortune green tea so far, but it is fantastic. Though I'm not much of a tea connoisseur, I greatly enjoy the flavor. The best was I can describe it is "earthy"-- very natural and leafy. It has character, unlike the monotonous tea bags in the grocery store.<br /><br />The only drawback to this set is that the tea flowers are not labeled; you have to refer back to a picture guide to try and guess which tea it is you are about to drink, which in some cases can be difficult to discern. Labels on the packages for the flowers themselves would be more helpful.<br /><br />This set has me hooked, and once the nine flowers are gone, I will go to my local Asian market and pick up more of these, because it is truly a fantastic experience. If you or someone in your life has even an iota of interest in tea, this gift set comes highly recommended.

review/text: This gift was a big hit.  It has a cool look to the product as well as the actual tea.  The shipping box arrived in a little bit of a beaten up state, but the glass pot was packaged very well and was in perfect condition.  The only two issues I had with this was the chest is pretty cheaply made and began to come apart as I spent almost a half and hour picking off the glue residue (the second issue).  If you know a tea lover, this is overall a pretty nice gift to give.

review/summary: Decent
review/text: The best thing about this tea is that it is unusual. I received it as a gift as I am a tea lover. The tea tastes pretty good, but no better really than your average box of tea and not as good as many of the loose leaf teas I have tried. I would possibly gift it to someone who is beginning to like tea only because it is a unique gift, not to those who might be "tea connoisseurs" of sorts.

review/summary: Very pretty.
review/text: What is so great about these teas is the novelty. They are beautiful to watch flower, which has a very calming effect, which is something I enjoy about tea in general. So the beautiful appearance is a bonus in that area. However, these are not the best tasting teas I've tried and I love Numi teas. They are not bad, they are worthwhile soft flavors, but if I were buying simply on taste I probably would not purchase Numi flowering teas again. Also, the actual glass teapot is very small, maybe makes enough for two people at the most. The box the flowering teas are sent is reusable, but poorly constructed. Not really worth keeping if that sort of thing matters to you. In short I would buy again, but mostly for aesthetic reasons.

Between the wooden box that it comes in and the different flavors this is something that someone who truly appreciates tea (especially if they're just getting into it) would really appreciate. The flowering tea itself is beautiful and it really adds another dimension to the act of taking tea. I was impressed with this set, I just wish it had come with more teas!

review/summary: Looks nice.
review/text: I bought this as a gift and opened the box to make sure everything was presentable due to other reviews. I wanted to be sure nothing was cracked and the lid fit. Everything was ok. It was packed for shipping well. Yes, the pot is small, but it is for one person after all. There is a hole at the top of the lid designed to let steam out. That might have been what someone was calling a bubble in the glass. It felt pretty sturdy, but the handles could have been made a little thicker. I was hoping to be able to see or smell the teas, but they are sealed in a box. I am pleasantly surprised that this doesn't have a weird chemical smell to the wood as other mass produced, cheaper items are prone to have. The inside of the gift box is nothing special, just the pot, the box of blossoms, and a bunch of brown confetti-like strips of paper stuffing. The box has this orange/red "leather" stringing it together. I think they could have put in a little more effort and used a natural looking leather or even twine, and displaying the blossoms in the gift box instead of hiding them in a box that looks at home on a grocery shelf. But I am picky. Even though I haven't tried the blossoms, I drink Numi tea myself and I think they are great quality teas. I will probably buy a set for myself soon.

review/text: I received this charming flowering tea set as a gift and am totally pleased with every aspect.  The clear glass teapot is the perfect vessel through which to see the tea flowers open. The whole process is a peaceful, Zen-like experience.  I've tried three of the teas so far, and each has been aromatic, gentle tasting, and even the removed flower (saved for more steeping) is attractive to sight and touch. (Oolong is my favorite). I will purchase several of these sets as gifts for some of my tea-sipping friends, and will also enjoy serving these flowering teas to my guests.

review/text: I first discovered blooming tea at a tea store at a mall in my area. I was very intrigued by the tea, as I have never seen this kind before. I decided to look on here for a cheaper alternative and found this Numi blooming tea set. It was the perfect Christmas gift for my parents. They love tea and were also very fascinated by this unique gift set. The little tea bundles opened up in about 5 mins and made 3 great tasting pots of tea as promised. I would highly recommend this gift set to anyone! I really liked the packaging it came with, and you can reuse it when you are done with the tea to store other things.

If you like exotic flowers and tea you will love this. I bought this set as a gift for my mother in law cause we both enjoy tea. We tried the jade jewel first and it was wonderful. The flower was very pretty and the tea itself was very relaxing. Now I have to buy one for me to try.

review/summary: Great tea set
review/text: I absolutely love this tea set and the variety of tea flowers!  Granted it is a small pot, but perfect for one typical size cup of tea (as in standard coffee cup).  Plus each tea flower can be used 3-4 more times/steeps and if you want to get the full use of each, but cannot drink it all, it makes great iced tea!  The one downside would have to be the storage box it comes in and the matching tea flower box.  I wish when you removed the labels from the box, that the entire label came off.  Such a beautiful and decorative addition, just a shame that glue and paper stay stuck to it!  Regardless, at $12.50 which is what I paid for it a year ago, it's a great set.  If I didn't still have the pot, I would purchase again in a heartbeat!!!  Thanks:)

review/text: This is truly my favorite tea. Numi tea has replaced all the tea in my house and I offer tea to any friend  that visits. Numi tea is more than tea it is a whole new experience, especially the flowering teas which are so fragrant and delicious as well as healthy for the body mind and spirit. If you have loved the scent of flowers wafting in the air then Numi's flowering teas take it to the next level delighting the senses and offering a new way to improve health and uplift you mood. Numi's Bouquet Bamboo Gift Set with nine flowering teas is the very best gift set I have ever seen. I love to watch the tea flower in the clear glass tea pot right before my eyes. I keep the beautiful bamboo box out on a tea table with the tea pot and cups as part of my decor.

No labels on the flowers so I decided to choose the darkest leaves as it might be the best morning tea. After pouring water over it a horrible smell came off of it. I had to pour it down the sink.

review/summary: NIce presentation but label takes away from the appearance
review/text: I am disappointed with this purchase and I am keeping it for myself because I am too ashamed to give it to my mom. I thought this would be a great birthday present. I was wrong. My mother loves wooden boxes, well this one turned out too ugly to present to her. When the label was removed there was damage to the box, real damage. Looks like water damage to wood.

review/summary: Fascinating & fun to brew....blase to drink
review/text: Although fascinating and fun to brew - watching the flower develop, the tea itself is very bland.  People at work were fascinated by the flowered pot on my desk, curiously asking questions.  However the fascination ended for me once the steaming cup met my lips and the tea itself passed over my taste buds.  To be fair, perhaps I am not discerning enough or just not attuned to the nuance and subtlety of white tea, but I found the taste to be washed out & weak - even on the first pot.  I suppose it is unique enough to warrant a try if you are so inclined, especially if you can get it on sale.  I paid less than $15 for the set of nine flowers and pot.  The pot does not have an infuser, so without a screen, expect bits of tea in your cup.  Emjoy!

review/summary: Pretty and functional, but small
review/text: I was excited to receive this, and it is very pretty, but very tiny. It stated how many ounces it was, I guess I just didn't put that into relative terms. It makes about one cup of tea, and the first one is a pretty strong one. Because it is so concentrated, it's hard to see the little bloom once the tea steeps.<br />For a pretty decoration, it's nice. If you have one cup of tea a day, it's nice. I, personally, am going to purchase a bigger one.

review/text: Bought it to be part of a large gift basket I am making for Christmas so I don't know how it tastes and what the contents of the box look like but the box is cute and everyone else who has seen it has already called dibs on it if the recipient doesn't want to keep it. The box alone would go for what I paid for the set at somewhere like Pier 1. Also; the recipient has a young daughter, knowing how my niece reacted when we brewed our Primula flowering teas I imagine (even if it doesn't taste that good) both mother and daughter will be delighted.

review/summary: Tasty by a little snag
review/text: I've had some Numi tea before at a family get-together once before and remembered it tasted really good (and looked awesome). When I got this in the mail I was very excited. The boxes that they come in are really cute and I don't want to throw them out! I made my first batch exactly according to the directions because I was afraid of ruining the flowering part (even though I drink tea daily).<br /><br />Parts of the "flowers" tend to break off and float around in the jar I've noticed with every one that I brew. It's a little daunting at first, but you can remove them -- it just sometimes messes things up. I didn't have any flowers look exactly like the pictures on the box, but the flavor is there and yes, you can brew it three times with the same flavor each time. I would definitely buy again.

I didn't expect much, though; and was pleasantly surprised by it. Almost feel like it deserves 5 stars, but I can't vouch for the taste of the tea (didn't try it).

I was amazed at the teas blooming! My whole family enjoyed the show, and I liked the taste. The box it came in was unique, though I won't use it to store any heavy items.

review/summary: Very beautiful and delicious
review/text: I've waited a long time to get this set as it was very expensive when it first came out. It was well worth the wait, actually would've been well worth the cash had I spent it earlier. Amazon has a really low price on this.<br /><br />The clear glass teapot holds about 16oz when full. Each tea flower will make 3 pots. The 3rd pot of tea is as good as the first, the 4th is weak.<br /><br />The tea itself is excellent. Some of the best I've tasted and I'm very particular about the tea I drink. I've been enjoying the variety that came with the pot - haven't found one I've disliked yet and it is fun trying them all.<br /><br />Since you will get about 6 cups of tea with each tea flower - they are all beautiful, I put the teapot on the table while the tea steeps so every can enjoy it. You will want to drink this with family or friends.<br /><br />The whole set comes packaged nicely in a bamboo box that looks handmade. The box is pretty enough to be re-used for something else. The variety of tea is in a smaller bamboo box.<br /><br />If you are looking for Christmas gifts, this would be an awesome one.

It's a great starter kit because it comes with 9 different kinds of tea--all of which are beautiful to watch and delicious to drink.

review/summary: Excellent Gift
review/text: I got this set a few weeks ago, and have tried most of the teas that came with it.<br /><br />The teapot itself is somewhat fragile (especially if you are used to Beehouse brand), but is well worth the extra care. After the novelty of flowering tea wears out, you will still be able to amaze your guests with the beautiful sight of tea leaves unfolding into a gorgeous flower.<br /><br />This is not your every day after-work-relaxing experience for several reasons. Cost, for one. The flavor of the tea itself is also not what you are used to. If you are a serious tea gourmand, you might be put off by the exotic experience, and you might have a better teapot for your cherished first flush darjeeling (or silver needle, for that matter): the glass looses heat very rapidly, and the strainer that comes with the teapot is a joke at best.<br /><br />For what it is, however, this is an excellent addition to any kitchen (an especially good gift for a tea lover who has everything). I ended up buying Bodum glass teacups to match this teapot, and using it more for decorative purposes.

review/summary: I went looking for a tea pot .. and found this gem
review/text: I had no idea what to expect when I purchased this item. I was looking for a nice tea pot and strainer combo. I figured I'd give it a shot for the price. I was in for a surprise. What a joy to the eye, soul, and palate.<br /><br />Now, if you are looking for a large, sturdy tea pot - keep looking. This is a very delicate, small, 16 oz pot. I didn't get a strainer. No big deal. I don't need another one. What I did get for this tiny price is the most remarkable visual and sensory experience that lifts my soul after a long, hard, stressful day at work. From the moment I opened the Amazon box and saw the lovely bamboo box, I was sold. Then when I opened the box and found the tea in a mini bamboo box, I was very pleased. How beautiful is this presentation!<br /><br />When the tea blooms in the pot, it is a beautiful site to see. The small tea pot then makes sense. The size and rounded body are the perfect showcase for this unusual product. Besides, it is the perfect fit for my large glass latte cup. I've had no problem pouring the tea, and my lid fits perfectly. It is delicate, so I am extra careful.<br /><br />I've had no problem with the tea blooming using boiling water. I temper it with a metal spoon as a pour it into the pot. I don't want to chance cracking the tea pot. The tea tastes delicate and delicious. I get 3 pots from each bloom. I like my tea strong, so I brew it longer than recommended, but it never gets bitter. The second pot tastes best to me, but the 3rd pot is still excellent. And the colors of the brewed tea are beautiful also. They seems to glimmer with multiple hues. Don't ask me how or why.<br /><br />I will be reordering this tea! You can't put a price on the relaxation I get from this experience. As a matter of fact, I'll be ordering a second gift set for myself - my boyfriend and I are fighting over who gets to keep the bamboo box! Besides, if this pot breaks, I want a back up.

The actual amount of tea in the individual small plastic baggies in the small bamboo box in the shredded paper padding within the larger bamboo box within the paper wrapping within the cardboard box within the plastic air packets within the shipping box was miniscule.  The bamboo box that it came in that houses the teapot and box of tea is cute but not the sturdiest thing ever.  I hope I never drop it.  It's also a lot bigger than I realized it would be.  As for the teapot, it's cute but a good glass teapot doesn't have the sort of imperfections you can see in this (unless I'm just unlucky in getting the one with the bubbles).<br /><br />Lowest price I've seen this here: about $18

There was no strainer included, the lid of the pot, does not even fit on the pot!  It's very dangerous to pour hot tea when the lid does not want to sit on the pot!  Yes, it was cool to see the flowers unfold, but it ends there.<br /><br />The color & the flavor is just not as impressive as what I had expected.<br /><br />I wanted to return the item, but LATER found out that as a "grocery" item, it is NOT returnable!

review/summary: What a wonderful gift set!  5 Stars PLUS!!!
review/text: This is a great way to try the teas before you buy them in any type of quantity.  The pot brews about 3 cups of tea.  I don't drink the tea often - I prefer to have it as an infrequent treat to keep the experience special.<br /><br />The dragon lily tasted wonderful, but the flower was really ugly.  However, I did buy a box of this tea and when I brewed it, the flower was more colorful and appealing.  I was able to steep this flower 4 times for 12 cups.  Although I admit that the last three cups didn't have as strong a flavor.<br />Starlight rose was disappointing.  The flower never changed appearace, just got bigger.  The flavor was strong and left my mouth feeling pasty.<br />Flower Jewel was a lovely bloom and the jasmine smell is wonderful, but the taste was weak.<br />Lavender Dream is similar to Dragon Lily.<br />Emerald Sun's flower didn't change.  Flavor was okay, but nothing special.<br />Jade Fortune was nothing special.  The bloom looked like a sea urchin - kind of interesting.  There was no real scent to it, and there was nothing special about the taste.  It was stronger with the second pot, which was unusual, but the tea wasn't tasty enough to brew the third pot.<br />Jasmine Pearls unwind to become long, thin leaves.  The scent is heavenly.  The taste is not quite as dramatic, but still good.  I used approximately 1 pearl for each cup of tea to brew it (3 pearls per pot).<br />Black Beauty looked like a sea urchin, and had a mild flavor and aroma.  It brewed 3 nice pots of tea, but was nothing special.<br />Midnight Peony's flower remained the same.  The flavor was like a light black tea.<br /><br />So, the winning tea is definitely Dragon Lily - I highly recommend it!

review/summary: What a gift!
review/text: Perceptions about this innovative box of flowering teas and accompanying teapot range from "Buyer Beware" to "Gift of the Year."  Here's my take:<br /><br />The Good: 9 tea selections that are unique in bloom, taste and fragrance.  Each bloom yields 3 pots of tea. Lidded Glass teapot to view the spectacular blooming.  2 attractive, reusable and sustainable bamboo boxes (1 containing the individually wrapped flowers and a larger containing the whole kit and caboodle.  Amazon's price, which at wholesale is a steal for this type of handmade, artisan product.  And the sensory experience itself is priceless (though many a tea salon now have put a price on it).<br /><br />The Bad:  All selections do not quite yield 3 pots, and speaking of the pot, yes you may want to invest in a back-up.<br /><br />For the price, I haven't seen a better gift.  The nay sayers are looking for a product that would have to retail at twice the full retail value of this set.  And you don't like the flavors?  Isn't that a matter of personal taste?  It certainly isn't a reflection of the tea quality, which is very good.  To add to your experience, enjoy with friends and afterwards flip through The Tea Box by Gilles Brochard.

review/summary: Dry aftertaste dulls appreciation
review/text: I was really excited about ordering this set and thrilled when it came.  I have noticed something unexpected about the teas, however.  With the teas I have tried from this set I have noticed an unpleasant dry aftertaste.  Another taster noticed the same thing without my mentioning it.<br /><br />I really like the glass tea pot.  It is very nice to watch the tea fill the glass orb with color and flavor.  Whether the flowers are beautiful or look more like sea urchins will be a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the Starlight Rose Tea (white tea leaves with rosebud) and found it far inferior to Rose Petal Black Blended Tea by The Republic of Tea, which is excellent.  On the other hand, Numi's Moroccan Mint is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted, superior to an old favorite of mine- Stash Tea Moroccan Mint.<br /><br />After tasting this tea I am surprised by the number of reviews rating the tea that comes with the set as quite good.  Maybe I got a bad batch or have strange taste buds- but there it is.<br /><br />The bamboo box is quite charming.

review/text: Great price, when I purchased it for about $15.00. No need to use a strainer with the tea-pot so far, since the two teas I've tried, one black and one green, have both been whole-leaf. I was able to steep both teas multiple times with consistently good flavor, though each pot makes a small amount of tea barely enough for two, but then I use coffee mugs, not tea cups, so I'm probably not being fair. One of the teas, a black tea, was probably the best black tea I've ever tasted, and I've purchased black teas before. I'm unimpressed with the flowering concept: it's not really pretty when it grows out like some alien life form or spider, but I'm drinking it, not saving it for a photo shoot. Also, I haven't bloomed all the teas yet.<br />No problem with the lid coming off the included glass tea pot. Teas and pot came in a fine-quality bamboo box that could be used for storage of other household items, for people who wish to re-use boxes.<br />I'm pleased with the great quality of the teas, and the product over-all.

review/summary: maybe it is not MY cup of tea!
review/text: The product is exactly what it is stated as.  The flowers bloom and are beautiful.  The little pot is the right size for two tea cups.  You can put more hot water in and the next cups are as good as the first.  My only problem is that the tea tastes like boiled grass!  I am thinking that this is just not 'my cup of tea'!  I like a more full bodied tea.

review/summary: Great Gift for a Tea Lover
review/text: I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend as a Gold Box special.  She's recently become a "tea snob" so being the sensitive guy that I am, I figured this would get right in on her good side.  This gift set was 100% successful with that.  The bamboo box is unique and reusable.  The small tea pot is the perfect size for brewing a couple cups of whatever her favorite tea is that day.  The real gem however, are the flowering teas themselves.  They're basically dried tea leaves and dried flowers hand sewn together so that when you pour hot water over them they magically bloom right before your eyes.  Pretty neat even to a stilted coffee drinker.<br /><br />She says the tea tastes great too so I guess that's a plus.

review/summary: it's bloomin' wonderful!
review/text: I have purchased many of these from this seller to give as gifts. This seller provides fast delivery and a great product. Most of my family & friends hadn't heard of flowering tea before. They love the fragrance and the taste... and.. the beauty of this tea.  It is also very relaxing to watch the tea bloom.  We use a tea-light candle under the small glass tea-pot, to keep the pot warm. In the evening it looks so relaxing all lit-up through the glass. Also the beautiful bamboo box gives this a special presentation.  Everyone just loves it!

review/summary: Perfect gift for a tea lover or anyone who likes fancy looking presents
review/text: I got this gift set for my mother in law last year. She loved it, mainly because of its fancy packaging, multiple items in the box and the mysterious teas. But, I dont know if she used it or not. See, she is a regular black tea drinker, so most of these flowering teas might have been alien to her.<br /><br />So I think this might be an ideal gift for a tea lover who likes to explore or someone who likes natural/organic food products in general.<br /><br />I am definitely buying one for myself next time, just coz I love tea pots.<br /><br />Oh.. the sticker on top holds fast to the bamboo...and hard to get out.

review/text: I bought this set recently for a friend of mine who is a tea lover.  She raved about it, telling me how much she loved watching the tea/flower "bloom" and how great it tasted.  She had me over and we enjoyed a cup together.  It was indeed a perfect tea experience, entertaining as well as delicious!

review/summary: excellent gift
review/text: This was the perfect present for a friend who loves tea (and already has a lot of favorites to drink). And the lovely box is an excellent extra. I saw similar sets elsewhere that were much more expensive. I hope Amazon gets more in because this is my new favorite gift to give!

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I wanted to buy a flowering tea set, and settled on this one because it came with a teapot, a case, and a lot of tea. The teas are great quality, and each flower lasts through several pots of tea. Each set comes with four types of white tea, three types of green, and two types of black.<br /><br />The teapot is small, light, and feels delicate--I'm worried I'll break it by accident sometime, so I treat it carefully.
