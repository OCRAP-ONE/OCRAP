review/summary: Tastes like medicine
review/text: I bought the peach flavored tea, because I'm a huge fan of the passion fruit one.  I tried it unsweetened and sweetened.  I couldn't find a way to make this drinkable.  Either way, it was awful!  It tasted like some awful medicine.  I threw the rest of the pitcher and box away.  This was a waste of my money.

review/text: I have a deep and abiding love for almost all of the China Mist iced teas. But, this peach tea has a dreadful, medicinal taste to it that is just awful. I am loathe to throw things out just because they aren't my favorite, but this tea was virtually undrinkable. I poured the entire pitcher down the drain. Get the orange blossom ginger or the blackberry jasmine tea instead. You'll thank me, I promise.

review/text: I bought this salsa at the grocery store on a whim, and I am glad I did!  It is a very sweet salsa, just so you know, and I am looking forward to using it to cook with as well as using it with pita bread slices, or as suggested here, poured over cream cheese with some crackers.  A little sidenote:  I got this same size at my local grocery store (Freshway) for $3.19, so you may want to check around.

review/text: The salsa itself is very tasty and if you are looking for sweet salsa without much kick, this is definitely for you.  However, despite the webpage saying this is a 12 pack, it is NOT; it is a single jar!  I can buy this in my local grocery store for $3, $2 when it is on sale. I thought I found a nice bargain here on Amazon, but alas, no.  I will not buy this again from Amazon (overpriced) but will continue to buy from my local vendor.  Salsa gets 4+ stars, ad gets 1 star.

review/text: I'm baking whole wheat bread, using a recipe from Cook's Illustrated Pastry Recipes. I use a bread machine to make dough, and then bake it in the oven.<br /><br />They suggested using Graham Flour. I tried it, and found it OK. Now I use King Arthur's flour, and get great bread. I use a bit more water, and bake it at 350 deg instead of 375 deg. The bread is moister and delicious. You can buy graham flour if you wish, but King Arthur's Whole Wheat is excellent.

review/summary: A Really Nice Coffee.
review/text: I enjoy whole-bean coffees from all over the world. Costco is my major source for beans and they usually come in three-pound bags. Kirkland Signature is the most common brand, but a few other brands appear from time to time. A problem with Costco is that at any particular time they may have only two or three varieties. But if you come back a month or so later, they still may have only two or three but they will probably be a different two or three. It's something of an adventure and a good way to exp[ore the coffees of the world. Plus, if you find some variety that you really, really like, you may find it available on line, as is this one.<br /><br />Well, here's an excellent coffee. It's a Guatemalan Whole Bean Coffee. Nice aroma, but relatively mild compared to other bagged coffees. Excellent taste, but it's a quite lighter roast than I'm used to. That's OK. I like variety. This one has an excellent coffee taste and is smooth and delicious. It goes down easily, that's for sure. Smooth and mellow. Nice lingering aftertaste. I would think that any coffee lover would find it excellent, but some may expect a deeper, darker roast in a whole bean coffee. For me, this is a really nice coffee.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

The instructions are clear and fun to follow and the sense of accomplishment, when those cookies are baked, is huge.<br />I am an avid baker myself and was a bit hesitant about eating cookies that weren't made from scratch,- but I have to say that they truly tasted homemade, thanks to all the natural ingredients.<br />I recommend this toy for all kids who love science, reading, math, and cookies,- alone or with friends and family!

review/summary: Zebra Mix- total fun in the kitchen! and no mess!
review/text: My boys love to bake and I had almost given up because their baking turned my kitchen into a zoo! Plus, I never really found any mixes or kids kits that tasted good and had any redeeming factors.<br /><br />But, I have to say I love Zebra Mix. They have taken baking and somehow weaved reading, math and science into the process. My 10 year old made these cookies and then told me he learned how to read a scientific formula and found out their was acid in the mix (molasses). Plus they really taste great, these cookies are even better than my traditional M&M cookies because they do not have ANY artificial ingredients and they have oatmeal and lots of good things.<br /><br />I also bought the cupcakes because both my kids want one of the cool lunch tins. I just  saw the kits at Borders and the people at the store they sell really well. I had never seen them before.

It seems to have been a fun activity and the boys were proud of having "made cookies."  But having tried them twice, I have to say, these are some of the yuckiest cookies I've ever eaten. The soft texture is nice, but they taste like some off-brand cookie you'd get at the dollar store.

review/text: Product is crushed Cacao beans, not whole as in picture.  So, you will get nibs not beans.  Flavor is complex, dark chocolate start with a fruity finish.  Texture is interesting, a little chunkier than I expected.  Some parts are hard to chew-as if some shell or similar material is in with the nibs.  I sprinkle it over my cereal for an added kick.  Overall I like it, but may try using a grinder or mortise/pedastal to make a little easier to chew.

review/summary: Excellent product, great price...
review/text: I bought these cacao nibs to make chocolate. I actually considered buying already roasted nibs but this product's price is way better so i just ordered this product and roasted it myself (it is easy). This product makes great chocolate. Like another reviewer said 1 serving of of these nibs contains 314% of our daily need of iron, however as far as I am aware of, according to FDA there is no health concerns associated with iron consumption. In short this is a great product for anyone who wants to make their own chocolate. One small problem is the amount of bean shells, I needed to pick them by hand (to make smoother chocolate), if it was possible to put them in water most of those shells would float on surface I believe, however I wasn't sure if it was okay to wash nibs before roasting so I just handpicked...

review/text: Sunflower kernels are getting hard  to find at the supermarket, so I thought I'd try out some Amazon offerings.  These Habanero seasoned seeds are the best of the bunch.<br /><br />At about 7 kernels, the amount of heat is too high for me, but 2-4 kernels is quite tasty, with a spicy aftereffect lasting several minutes.  That makes it a really nice snack for anyone watching their diet.  I have a small saucer next to me here with a few pinches of these seeds while I write out some reviews, and I've barely dented them after half an hour.  A similar amount of the cracked pepper seeds wasn't quite as tasty, and lasted about a minute.<br /><br />I think these will now be my #1 snack. They aren't messy or greasy at all. At the<br />rate I'm going, it'll take me about a day to go through a half ounce of these.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

As I devoured the sweets, I used to think that I was the luckiest kid in the world.<br /><br />Unlike so many things from my childhood, these haven't changed a bit.  They still come in five colors with amazingly fresh fruit flavors. These little packets each contain about nine little bears, and are just the right size to stick in a pocket or purse for a surprise pick-me-up. I keep them in the house to comfort a boo-boos reward an unexpected high test score, or to celebrate a sunny afternoon.  This large package contains 75 little packets in a sturdy plastic box that the Haribo people encourage you to reuse.<br /><br />If these treats were a part of your childhood, you can buy these without the fear that they've changed - they haven't.  If you haven't experienced the bears that started the current craze of all things gummi, they're well worth trying.  But please, save the white ones for me!

review/summary: Good coffee, but not a "9 Pound Box"
review/text: The coffee was decent but not outstanding. Very similar to most grocery store "bought from bins" coffees. Like Market District, Millstone or Howe's. Some were better than others & all seemed fresh & well packaged. The cups are nice too. But the "deal" isn't as good as it looks. There is only 5.5 pounds of actual coffee in this box. (The box WEIGHS about 9 pounds with everything in it.) I did receive a partial refund after complaining & Amazon said they would change the description to make it clear what you were buying. However it as been 2 weeks and this has not been revised. Hence, the sketchy review.  :O)

review/summary: Good value, well packed
review/text: The assortment is a large box---the individual 8oz bags are much larger than they look in the photo.  With the bonus bag, the assortment comes out to 5 1/2 pds of coffee for $40 (subscription price at the time of this writing), which works out to a an economical $7.27 per pound--and that doesn't even count the mugs.  The mugs are well-designed, light and fit nicely in the hand.  Yeh, I know they are just mugs, but I have dozens of mugs, many of which are unnecessarily heavy and/or hard to hold.  But these are above average, in a functional sense.<br /><br />Although the bags look like kraft paper, in fact they are metalized-plastic inside, sealed air-tight, and re-seal air-tight easily and securely.  They even have a valve so you can squeeze out excess air, which is a good thing to do.  The presentation box is utilitarian but nice---the sampler would make an excellent gift for any coffee lover, even a wedding gift.<br /><br />The selection is SUMATRA MANDHELING, COSTA RICAN TARRAZU, COLUMBIAN SUPREMO, BREAKFAST BLEND, FRENCH ROAST, DARK HOUSE BLEND, ITALIAN DARK ROAST EXPRESSO, FRENCH VANILLA, HAZEL NUT, and DECAF COLUMBIAN.  Unfortunately, not the selection I would make if I had a choice.  The full 8-oz "free sampler" was CITY ROAST COLOMBIAN, but presumably other varieties may be substituted for the "free sample".<br /><br />Honestly, I'd prefer another bag of coffee rather than the mugs, and I wish I could have the option of a "no-decafinated no-flavored" sampler.  But, the French Vanilla and Hazelnut are not too objectionable, and one can always save the single decaf bag for evenings.  Ironically, you CAN purchase an all decafinated sampler <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWFB40">Coffee Bean Direct Assorted Whole Bean Decaf Coffee Sampler, 9-Pound Box</a>, or an all flavored sampler <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWHE1I">Coffee Bean Direct Assorted Flavored Whole Bean Coffee Sampler, 9-Pound Box</a>, so why can't they offer a "no-decafinated no-flavored" sampler?<br /><br />If you are a real coffee lover, I strongly suggest purchasing a Mellita manual cone system, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFLCT">Melitta Cone Filter Manual Coffeemaker 6 Cup, 1-Count</a>  For some reason I cannot link to the "10 cup" system, which I recommend.<br /><br />I'm working my way slowly though the coffees.  I'll add updates as I go through them.  Note that such evaluations are strictly a matter of personal tastes, and quality may differ between batches. In general I prefer light roasts, and loath flavored coffee.  Based on C being "typical American coffee":<br />SUMATRA MANDHELING C+ glad I didn't buy the 5pd bag I was considering<br />DARK HOUSE BLEND B<br />COSTA RICAN TARRAZU B<br />BREAKFAST BLEND B<br />CITY ROAST COLUMBIAN A<br />FRENCH ROAST B+<br />COLUMBIAN SUPREMO B+<br /><br />Be careful grinding the FRENCH ROAST---it has alot of sugar as a glaze (not enough to taste).  If you overgrind the coffee you apparently melt the sugar, and the powdered coffee and sugar sticks, like a turd, in your grinder.  I use a wooden popsickle stick to scrape it out, but still it's annoying.  I do not know why sugar is added to dark roasts during the roasting process, but it is common.

review/text: This is a great way to sample some very good value coffees<br /><br />As other have mentioned, it is not 9lbs of coffee. That said, it is still a lot of very good coffee for the money, a very good value. Plus they throw in a couuple decent mugs. There's Italian, House, Columbian, flavored, decaf, a good mix of products.<br /><br />We have enjoyed the various brews, experimenting with different brew methods as well. We are not really coffee snobs, but like something a little better than Maxwell - this is a good value and great to experience different flavors and brew methods. Recommended. I knocked off 1 star because the description is a little misleading...

review/text: I thought I was buying 9 lbs of coffee. the Title reads.. "Assorted whole bean sampler, 9 Lb box"<br />So any sane person would think your getting 9 lb's of coffee. To my surprise there was only 5 1/2 lbs of coffee and one bag was marked Free Sample. No where does it state the total coffee weight clearly. Classic misrepresentation. So I read the other reviews and someone else told Amazon about this problem a year ago! How can we trust the product pages?

review/text: I bought this sampler because I wanted to try their flavors before committing to a five pound bag.  I'm glad that I did.  I have concluded that overall, CBD roasts a bit lighter than what I'm used to, but that their full city and dark roasts are very tasty (even if not as dark as I'm used to).<br /><br />The coffee cups were unnecessary and, in my opinion, unattractive.  The sampler would be better without them.

review/text: First review for this was written April 2010. As that person mentioned (and all others to follow) the title is misleading.  I too understood there to be 9 pounds of coffee in this sampler, but that is not the case.  You would think that after 1.5 years and multiple bad reviews, Amazon would clarify this issue. This purchase is now much more expensive than I had expected. I couldn't care less that there are a couple of silly mugs in the box. My opinion is that they know this is tricking people and they don't want to change it. Very disappointed!

review/summary: Not much flavor
review/text: After watching a popular health show on TV recently, I decided to order cactus jelly for its health benefits. I did not find much flavor in it. Perhaps the actual " cactus" flavor IS super sweet, or maybe cactus just has little flavor.  I have not compared this brand with any other, similar product, so I cannot say if this is a good or bad representation of what cactus jelly is like. I read an article that described the flavor of prickly pear cactus to " cold green beans", so maybe sweet and bland is better than a green bean taste on my toast! I also doubt that there is as much healthy stuff in this once it is turned into jelly. I will seek a different product in the future.

I'm not worried about taste, but this tastes good and more importantly for me it is healthy and chews well.

review/summary: Good Sugarfree Option w/o Unhealthy Additives
review/text: I purchased this gum after an exhaustive search for sugar free gum that didn't contain aspartame, which is an additive that is bad for people with sensitive GI tracts (and may have other negative health consequences). Almost all gums contain aspartame and it's very difficult to find a product that doesn't.<br /><br />This gum met all the basic criteria I needed. I tried a few other brands that didn't contain aspartame including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB0QSQ">Glee Gum Triple Berry, 18-Piece Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>). Between was the best, primarily because the taste lasted and the gum doesn't harden after a few minutes of chewing. Granted, the flavor of this gum won't last as long as standard commercial gum found at the grocery store. But that's the tradeoff for purchasing a more healthy product.<br /><br />As a "healthy" gum product, Between gets 5 stars. Even as judged by commercial gum standards (flavor, longevity, etc.), this product would get 4 stars.

We have been enjoying it for a couple of years now and I am just so pleased it is now available through Amazon so others may learn about it's TENDERNESS and the WONDERFUL FLAVOR. Offer this to friends just like Granny did at work and yours too will be gone in an instant! I will continue to give this for gifts, our friends in England LOVE IT! And I am sure had Oprah tried this, she most certainly would have put it on her list of favorite things!

review/summary: Amazingly true-to-life flavor for a candy!
review/text: I can't stress how much this really tastes like melon (either cantaloupe or honeydew, they're both similar, but recently I've eaten lots of honeydew, so that's what this stuff tastes like to me;  however, it could pass for cantaloupe, too).  It's so amazing that if I were to eat only one candy for the rest of my life, this would be it.  Mango used to be my favorite but this one just surpasses mango by more than a mile in terms of accuracy and pleasant aftertaste.  In fact, I just ate the last one out of a pack (and belched melon, LOL) and am about to crack open the next pack....

review/summary: The Best Chewy Candy
review/text: I used to get HiChews when I was little from my cousins. Since than, I was unable to find them anywhere but World Market, and they are kind of expensive. So I was really happy that Amazon has this as one of their featured products. HiChews are the best, and I have not had a flavor I did not like. Although the shipping on these seems like a lot. IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! it comes out to be like $1.15-$1.30 for a bar, but I am not complaining for I used to spend $2.00 for one pack of these. Melon is by far my favorite and was happy to receive them in the mail 4 days after ordering! Awesome candy! will be ordering again.

review/summary: Great candy, not so great flavor
review/text: As all Hi-chews are, the melon flavor is very chewy and juicy. However, if you do not like melon flavor, this is not for you. It actually tastes like a mix between honeydew and cantaloupe, but more honeydew than cantaloupe. I knew I wasn't going to like it when a friend gave me some, but I tried it and it tasted exactly how I thought it was going to taste. So just a heads up to those exploring new flavors, this one may not be fore you.

review/text: These definitely taste delicious.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 Stars is because the chocolate had melted in and when I open each bar, most of the chocolate is stuck to the inside of the wrapper.  So be careful when you order this item, don't order it in the summer months as these bars melt easily.  Otherwise, these are super yummy!

review/text: This Oskri Coconut and Dark Chocolate bar is far too sweet. The dark chocolate is more like milk chocolate, and the coconut is so sweet that it overpowers any chocolate taste and leaves a very unpleasant aftertaste. The same thing happens if I eat a Mounds bar, so I can only conclude that if you like Mounds, you will like this Oskri bar. I am not a fan of either!
