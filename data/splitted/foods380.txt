review/summary: Quaker Soft Baked Bread Bar
review/text: I love these bars. They are great snacks for those who are on the go, or even a part of a breakfast while rushing out the door. For something so small they are extremely filling. So far I've tried the banana nut and pecan, and both are fantastic. I carry these to work almost every day for my mid morning snack. I've taken to microwaving my bars for about ten seconds for that fresh out of the oven taste.

review/text: This taste like heaven on earth. When I first got it in a voxbox it was very amazing. All u have to do is when its in the plastic cut the other half of the the plastic wrapper. Put it in the microwave for 10 seconds and take it out... Then its chow time. It taste really good with orange juice. So I highly recommend trying this. Especially if you love banana nut bread.

review/text: I love all things Quaker, so I knew as soon as I received these Quaker bars, I wouldn't be disappointed. These are a great go-to snack when you're hungry, but not enough to eat an entire meal. I like that these are filling enough to be an on-the-go breakfast when I need it, and it actually tastes like homemade banana bread. I've also tried the Cinnamon Raisin flavor, and those are also to die for. Such a great product, will be re-purchasing!

review/text: I received a trail size of this snack bar through Influenster (check them out, Influenster.com !) and it is SOO tasty. It absolutely reminds me of my mom's banana bread, only a little crunchier. I like the slight crunch of this product, it's a nice little surprise. I popped mine in the microwave for a few seconds, and I think there's no other way to go than eating this warm. Reminds me of the fall, and this seems like the perfect little snack and a cool, fall day! I'll definitely be on the hunt for these. I can't forget, they are rather healthy too! Fiber and protein and 20% daily value of 5 B Vitamins! YUMMY, DELICIOUS SNACK!

I prefer all natural or organic bars like Kind bars or Think Thin bars.

review/summary: A Healthy Option for the Person On-the-Go!
review/text: When I received a sample of this bar from Influenster I thought, "Hmmm...Banana Nut Bread..." I was a TAD skeptical BUT ONLY because fake banana flavoring tends to be a little, well, fake. I was SO pleased when I broke a great big piece out of this bar and the taste revealed REAL BANANAS! REAL NUTS! REAL! Yay! And Yummy! I decided to try it heated up as the package suggested and it got even tastier! So when I then went to the store and purchased a box of the Cinnamon Pecan variety, that's how I chose to eat those. And talk about a box of scrumptious!! Especially with a morning cup of coffee!<br /><br />I'm often on the go in the morning, having lazed in bed for about as long as I absolutely possibly can, so it's a rush for me to get it together and rush out the door- Which makes bars like the Quaker Soft Baked Banana Nut and Cinnamon Pecan Bars a real life saver. I am always on the lookout for something inexpensive, but tasty that is packed with fiber and protein to pair with my travel mug of coffee that will SATIATE- And these do just the trick!<br /><br />5g of fiber, 6g of protein per bar and low on fat! I notice that with this more balanced nutrition these bars don't nearly effect my blood sugar levels like so many other alternatives that are currently on the market. I am one happy consumer! I hope you will be too. :)

review/text: Okay, I like banana bread and my family will eat it on occasion, but that's not the case with these.  I received a free sample from Influenster.com and couldn't wait to dig in.  My daughter was the first to grab it, took one bite and passed it to my son.  My son took one bite and passed it to me.  I took one bite and gave it to my husband.  He finished the last bite and said, "Not my cup of tea...". Needless to say, we might try something else because we love Quaker products usually.  It will be either a hit or miss depending on how much you like banana bread flavored foods. @Influenster<br />(I was not paid for this review.)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006H34CUS">Quaker Soft Baked Cereal Bar, Banana Nut Bread, 7.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: I received this in my Inluenster Summer Vox Box to try. I was running from meeting to meeting this morning, and had a very early breakfast with plans on a late lunch. I saw this in my bag and decided to try it. The Banana Nut Bread was delicious. I'm very conscious about limitng my carbs, so it was a concern but with the good amount of fiber, low sat. fat, and low sodium content I figured it was okay for a day. I wouldn't have one every day, but I would love to have an emergency stash at my desk for long mornings and late nights at the office. The flavor was right on point too!

review/summary: Nice Taste, Lots of Carbs
review/text: This is a nice, moist bar that has a very distinct banana bread taste. The bits of nut are decently sized, and add good flavor. I didn't find the bar particularly filling, but its 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein will probably make it a filling snack for some people.<br /><br />I probably would not buy this again, however, because of the high carbohydrate content.

review/text: A Quaker Soft Baked Cereal bar in Banana Bread was sent to me as part of the Summer Beauty VoxBox from Influenster. I have never been a big breakfast eater, so these light bars are perfect for me to grab and go with. I did not have the bar warmed up, but it's nice to have that as an option if you have more time than just grab and go. Will for sure buy these!

review/text: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and sad to say, it's probably the one I miss the most. I'm always on the go -- running around, doing errands, taking the kids here and there. I was so glad when Quaker came out with these tasty little treats. Not only are the easy to take with you when you don't have time to sit down to breakfast, but they are healthy--loaded with protein, fiber and essential B vitamins. And they are oh, so tasty! Finally, an easy breakfast that's not *yawn* boring!

review/text: I really enjoyed this Banana Nut Bread bar from Quaker Oats!  I put mine in the microwave for 10 seconds and it was nice, warm and soft.  It smells like fresh baked banana bread when you heat it in the microwave.  It has a nice banana-packed flavor to it and the crunchy nuts on the top are the icing on the "cake."  It doesn't have the consistency of banana bread, but for a healthier alternative, I'll take it!  I need to pick a box of these up to have on hand.

I love the health and quick snack to it. I do recommend it but it's not a big deal to get it, well atleast to me.

review/summary: Quaker Soft Baked In Banana Nut Bread
review/text: The Quaker Soft Baked In Banana Nut Bread is actually of the last flavors I would choose, but I have to say these were really good.That two weeks ago, I actually went to purchased more of them while doing grocery shopping.I liked that they were soft and chewy, and had just the right amount of crunch added by the slices of almonds sprinkled across the top. These are quite nice for the go and a quick snack. The package suggested warming them up for 10 seconds in the microwave which made even more soft. Which is a good thing in my opinion. Aside from Banana nut it also come in another flavor which is Cinnamon Pecan Bread. I have yet to try this flavor but seem to not be able to find it. A box of these run around 3 dollars for five bars and can be found almost in every grocery store. So far I have seen them in costco, walmart and Target.<br /><br />* I had received a sample to test out from influenster.

review/text: The flavor was really good, which is why I gave it 3 stars, however I found the bar to be on the dry side. It's so unfortunate because these would be really great as a breakfast bar or snack bar. It was filling and satisfying! It's packed with nuts and didn't have a faux banana taste. If they can find a way to put some moisture in the bars, I'd purchase them.

review/text: In general, I liked these bars. I think it would have been better if I had heated it up in the microwave because it had a crunch and chew to it that I don't think would have been there had I microwaved it. I'm not sure if the nuts caused the crunch but I can't explain the chew it has. I guess I expected a softer bar, but it was still good. The flavor reminded me of the homemade bread I used to make which was nice.

I love banana nut bread and whole grains. The only thing could use a little improvement is it's a little dry, but that comes with high-fiber, whole-grain products ;) The serving size is great, also--it's big enough to be satisfying, but small enough to take with you on-the-go. Quaker is a staple in our home. We can't go one week without purchasing something from Quaker--grits, oatmeal etc. I'm always excited to see new Quaker products in stores and I love to try them out! This is definitely worth a taste, so check it out!

review/summary: Tastes exactly like banana nut bread
review/text: (I received a free bar to review through Influenster's VoxBox program.)<br /><br />When I received my complimentary bar, I was too hungry to warm half of it up and thus compare the Quaker Soft Baked Banana Nut Bar heated up and not.  But it tasted fine room temperature.  In fact, it tasted just like banana nut bread.  It was a touch dry, but no more than other cereal bars.  At 3.29 for a box of five (standard retail price), the bars seem a touch price to me but are probably good for someone needing a quick, filling snack.  The bars are a good source of B vitamins, which can be hard to incorporate into your diet.<br /><br />What is there to say about a cereal bar, really?  If this sounds like something you'd enjoy eating, it probably is.  If you hate bananas, then don't eat it.

It was moist, chewy and not overly sweetened.  It had just the right amount of everything.  I had it as an afternoon snack along with a cup of coffee and it was awesome.  I'm looking forward to finding them at my local supermarket and having this as a treat every so often.

review/text: I'm loving these Quaker soft baked bars. I've tried the Banana Nut flavor and it has a real homemade taste and is a good addition to a meal. Real banana taste with the right crunch of nuts. I really enjoy the taste.

review/summary: Just Like Homemade..Only quicker!
review/text: I received a Banana Nut Bread soft baked bar in my Summer VoxBox from Influenster.com.Quaker is a brand that I grew up on and trust till this day. I new I was going to get something amazing and something that tasted great, but this went beyond my taste buds. I heated it up in the microwave for 10 seconds. It was sssooooo good. It's my new breakfast and sometimes my evening snack. It was soft, warm, and it was just so full of flavor.The are great for on the go snack and meals. They are very filling. When you open the box, it's gonna hit ya. It's smells so good and it will make your mouth water. It's really a great all around bar. Now if they come out with some other flavors that would be fantastic!!

review/summary: Perfect Snack for Grazers
review/text: I am a snacker. I nibble. I get peckish for tastes rather than volume. I have been looking for healthy snack I can take on the go for a while and have been disappointed in most. Until now. These Quaker Soft Baked Cereal Bars are the perfect thing for me! Low in calories, but high in taste they satisfy the craving, but leave much of the guilt behind! I throw several in my bag at the start of the week and munch on them as needed. I have only tried the Banana Nut flavor and loved it, but am super amped to test out the other varieties. The one nag I have is there isn't enough variety (but I feel like that will soon change!)<br /><br />*I am an Influenster and received this product gratis provided I review (honestly).

review/text: This taste almost exactly like a banana muffin. The only thing I didn't like about it is that there is an after taste that I hated. The texture of this is great. Chewy but crunchy as well. Very moist! I would definitely purchase these again.

review/summary: Won Over A Non- Banana Bread Lover
review/text: I received one of these to review as a member of Influenster. I was hesitant to try them because I actually detest  banana bread. I found myself famished one day and went ahead and took the plunge. I couldn't believe how delicious they were. Nothing like your standard banana nut bread. These bars are soft, chewy, yet have crunchy bits of nuts and crispy soy rice as well as oatmeal. I was really pleasantly surprised.  They make a perfect snack when you're trying to maintain your weight. Lots of protein at 6g per serving!

review/summary: Delicious in a bar
review/text: From the second I opened the packaging, I knew I would enjoy eating this product. It had a very nice and sweet aroma. Although I was a little apprehensive about the nuts, the product tasted great. It had a nice mixture of the banana and nut flavors, plus the texture of the bread was very soft and chewy. This product was very delicious and would go great with milk.

review/summary: Excellent light breakfast!
review/text: I received a sample of this product from influenster's summer beauty voxbox. I don't usually eat much in the morning and I don't like to have anything too sweet. I've tried numerous granola bars and soft fruit flavored breads and by far this is the best I have tasted. It has the right amount of sweetness and the right amount of crunch. This was perfect with my morning green tea soy latte and mixed fruit. I didn't heat it up because I don't like my bread warm. I like to eat it just the way it is. It is very convenient and I bring it to work every morning and I snack on it as well. I bought a box of it the next day after eating the sample. The downside of it is the product is a bit pricey. Although, I find that the Quaker products are worth the price you will pay for.

review/text: I received this as a sample for testing from Influenster.  I LOVE it! It's so convenient.  You just pop it in the microwave for 10 seconds.  It's delicious, and I love the texture and moutfeel of the bar.  It doesn't taste and feel like a convenience bar.  The warmth of it after microwaving is just right.  I'm definitely going to buy more. =)

review/text: Its not too often that people take the time out to write a review about a healthy snack bar. This was so yummy and didnt taste bland at all. I was expecting it to taste weird, not be very filling but low and behold I was totally caught by surprise! Quaker has done it again, this was a snack for me on a summery hot day. It was very light, flavorful and I cant wait to purchase a whole box of these! Kids will love them too!!

review/summary: great warmed up
review/text: I received the banana nut bread flavor free for review from Influenster.  I love oatmeal and I love banana nut bread so this seemed like something I would totally be into.  I saw on the package it said great warmed up so I tried that.  Oh boy it was delicious!  It was like having dessert for breakfast!  The flavors are terrific and while it's not exactly like eating a slice of banana bread it definitely has the banana bread taste in there.  This is a great little snack to carry with you for those I feel like having a snack moments.  It's also good to keep handy at work and avoid the dreaded vending machine.

review/text: I surprisingly enjoyed this. Surprised because these kinds of bars are usually so sickly sweet and unnatural tasting. But the Quaker Soft Baked Banana Nut Bar was tasty and hearty and perfect for breakfast or a afternoon or late night snack. Looking forward to trying other flavors. I received a complimentary sample in my Summer Influenster Voxbox.

review/summary: Premium snack for those in a rush!
review/text: I hate bananas, and because of that, I'm not a big fan of banana nut bread either. I didn't expect to like this much. I was so wrong! I loved it. It's good both cold and warmed up for 10 seconds, but I prefer it warm. My favorite part is the fact that it can be microwaved for 10 seconds in the plastic bag it came in, so you don't have to worry about finding another plate or something to heat it on. The "nuts" on top don't seem like nuts at all to me, but in a good way. The rest of the bar is very moist and soft, so the nuts add a nice contrast of crisp and crunchy texture. We often sacrifice taste and/or texture with snacks that are easy for on the go, but that isn't the case at all here. I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for a convenient snack, or even the kind of person who is lazy in the kitchen but craves the taste of homemade banana nut bread. This will quench your craving in a big way.
