review/text: We have been unable to find Product 19 in any of our Tucson grocery stores. I ordered this cereal and surprized my family at Thanksgiving with Product 19 cookies, it was a nostalgic moment for our grown kids (and their kids).  Of course, they wanted to know where I found this cereal...Amazon, of course.  Sandy, Tucson, AZ

review/text: I've been eating this cereal for many years and while it's virtually unknown, it's so tasty.  For a healthy cereal, it has a lot of flavor and nice crunchy flakes, unlike many flake cereals.  I highly recommend it as a cereal you'll never get tired of.

The cost has doubled since my last order!!  I love this cerealy, but I cannot pay $8 - $10 for a 12oz box of cereal. I can't EAT a bowl of cereal that cost that much!  I don't know if Kellogg's is doing away with the cereal or what's going on, but it's very hurtful that I am now loosing this option as well.

review/text: This has been my favorite cereal for years! It's much better than corn flakes or wheaties because the flakes are bigger and crunchier. It makes a great snack too--we eat it like it was popcorn. Unfortunately, I just got an email saying that Amazon wasn't going to carry Product 19 anymore, so I'm not sure why I was asked to write a review.  I hope they bring it back because we can't buy it in stores in our area!

Periodic searching and questioning grocery store stockers didn't help.  Imagine my delight when an idle search of Amazon showed that I could order Product 19 online!  Hooray!<br />I alternate with a brand that is easier to find, but it is wonderful to be able to enjoy this great oaty multigrain again!

review/summary: Online Grocery Fears Allayed
review/text: I have always said I would never buy groceries of any type over the internet.  It's one of those things where I have to lay eyes on it before I buy it.  This has become the only exception, as P19 is no longer available anywhere near me.  It was an act of desperation, and Amazon has come through once again.<br /><br />The cereal arrived promptly, and (my biggest concern), the expiration date was waaay off into the future.  I dare say it was far fresher than what I can get at my local grocery store.  The cereal was as crisp and fresh as I'd ever had.  I've purchased several times now, and will continue to do so as long as it is still made.<br /><br />The one negative:  The four boxes come shrinkwrapped in a bundle, which is fine.  The (very minor) problem:  someone in packaging has taken to wrapping the boxes with packing tape before shrinkwrapping, which tears the boxes apart when trying to extract a box.  Someone in packaging needs a whipping.<br /><br />Not going to try and convince anyone on the cereal itself, just the idea of buying it online.  In my opinion it's the best around, but most likely you wouldn't be here searching for it if you didn't love P19 already.  Who the heck would be browsing Amazon for new food to try?

review/text: I have used Kellogg's Product 19 Cereal for many years and it's always been my favorite, but it is usually the most expensive cereal on the supermarket shelves meaning that they don't stock a product that doesn't sell well. We rarely find stores who stock this product anymore and finding it available on Amazon.com has been a godsend. I can select the quantity shipped to me and select the time period. I get the product delivered to my door tax-free, shipping-free in a timely manner at a cost that is better than supermarket price per box. This service to date has been fantastic.

review/summary: Cult of Product 19
review/text: If there is a cereal better than Product 19 out there, I haven't found it.  Nutritionally, it is superior to nearly every other contender out there.  It keeps its shape and firm, crunchy texture in milk; many others here have attested to this.  And the taste, to me, is like manna from heaven.<br /><br />So, why can't stores keep it in stock?<br /><br />The local stores near me just stopped selling Product 19 out of the blue.  Poof!  Gone!  Why?  Who knows why?  After recovering from the initial shock, I scoured the internet seeking relief for my Product 19 itch.  Like a good friend, the internet did not let me down.<br /><br />Enter Amazon.<br /><br />Having just ordered a 4-pack of Product 19 and chowed down righteously on a bowl of my sweet, sweet fix, I can tell you that I highly recommend ordering Product 19 from Amazon.  Amazon ships fast and ships well.  The box was well padded, and the four boxes of Product 19 were tightly wound together in green wrap.  The careful packaging lasted mere seconds as I ripped into the box, apprising my beautiful purchase before none-too-graceful chowing.<br /><br />The verdict?  Even with the cost of Express Delivery on top (Seattlites, you may want to consider this type of shipping), this baby is Worth Every Penny.  Amazon, I'll be back!

review/text: The first time I ever had Product 19 was in 1969 when it was fairly new.  I loved it from the beginnng---the flavor can't be beat!  I had eaten this for  35 years and then kaput!----all my stores quit selling it about 4-5 years ago.<br />I went on a trip to see my aunt in Hot Springs, Ark, and WALAAA-----Walmart had it!!!  I bought 4 boxes last year to bring home.  Went back up a few months later and they didn't have it anymore.<br />After going 5 years without and sending Kelloggs's e-mails telling them I needed my fix and getting no reply, I happened upon this amazing cereal on Amazon--of all places!!!!  I'm so excited and set up a regular delivery, and have been pigging out on it so much (to make up for lost years) I've had to accelerate my shipping schedule.<br />Some of us are fanatics for this stuff, and with good reason.  I can't imagine any other cereal to take it's place----- Special K just doesn't cut it---sooooggy!<br />My heart will die if Amazon quits carrying this great product (19) :)

review/text: I have enjoyed Product 19 as my number one breakfast cereal for several years. It's great stuff!!! Somehow Kellogg's has never been able to market this properly (what's their latest campaign....17 really equals 19?? ) which is is shame as I find is vastly superior to Total, and other low sugar MDR vitamin requirement cereals. It doesn't get soggy and has a good taste. Unfortunately my local supermarket has recently ceased carrying Product 19...I was so happy to find it available through Amazon, and at a reasonable price. Shipping was very fast.  Try it!!!

review/summary: Difficult to find, why?
review/text: Why has this very good product become hard to find in the local market all of a sudden. It is an excellent cereal for breakfast. It does not get soggy in milk. The flavors mix well with fruits such as banana, peaches, and berries. It has 100% of several essential nutrients. I do not get that all of a sudden hunger slump mid morning. I can use it as a light supper and it carries me over until morning. I feel good when I eat it. I think that is the most important of all. With all of these important positive points why is it not to be found in the market in this area? I was ecstatic when I found that it is carried by Amazon and I know that I can order it on line with free shipping because I will order enough products at one time. Thank you Amazon so very much.

review/summary: Oldie but a Goodie...
review/text: Grew up on this stuff as a kid.  It was Mom & Dad's healthy cereal from the early 70's, but I acquired a taste for it.  Sure, I had the usual Lucky Charms, Fruit Loops, and stuff, but I preferred this over any corn flakes cereal that I ever tried.  Even Tony the Tiger's Frosted Flakes.  Anyway, now in my 40's and I still prefer the taste, just that it is near impossible to find.  Wal-Mart's been the only local place that normally carries and now starting to find it hard to find there as well.<br /><br />Wound up comparing labels to some of the uber expensive, mostly au natural, healthy stuff that my wife buys for the kids and good old Product19 was better in a lot of ways.  I was shocked that I was eating the cereal that was better for you just out of luck.  And Yes, it tastes better than those cereals too!<br /><br />Having been a long time Prime member, Subscribe & Save user, and now Amazon Mom's member, this is a no-brainer to get via Subscribe & Save here.  Cheaper than buying locally and no wasted time running around to find it or missing it when you do find a place that still carries it.  I highly recommend all three of those programs if you have no time to waste running around to different stores for those sometime hard to find items.  Likewise, I recommend this cereal.  I love it when my 2 and 5 year old ask for "Daddy's Cereal" because they like the taste, just as I did growing up.

review/text: I love Product 19 and am happy I can buy it here.  After finishing my last box of a recent order, I returned to another brand made by Kellogg's that is available in grocery stores, and it was like the time on a long drive when the turnpike ends and the regular interstate begins--the dropoff in coffee quality from Starbucks to fast food places.  Product 19 is that much better.  Once you get used to it, nothing else will do (of this type--I still enjoy Grape Nuts and some other cold cereals).<br /><br />If you like traditional crunchy, really tasty, not-sweet flakes in your cereal bowl, and you haven't tried it yet, treat yourself.

review/summary: P19 rocks! Snake-oil theory debunked!
review/text: I have been a loyal fan of Product 19 for at least seventeen years. It is the only really healthy thing I eat, but I eat about four boxes of it a week. There was a number of years when I could not easily find Product 19, and in that span of time I gained almost seventy! pounds, had my BP jump to 180/110, my sugar to 260, and my triglycerides to almost 800. Now that I am back on the wagon, my weight is dropping about 1/2lb./week, my BP, sugar, and triglycerides are dropping, and I am beginning to feel human once again.<br /><br />YMMV (Your mileage may vary), but P19 is a Godsend for me.<br /><br />Props to Amazon too, for providing. I used to have to drive about thirty miles to get my twice-monthly supply, and then even that store stopped selling it. Faced with the prospect of a fifty mile supply line, I turned to the Net for surcrease, and found it here. Thanks Amazon, and thanks to you too Kellogg.

review/text: If you're looking for a healthy morning cereal, you should give this one a try.<br /><br />It's got a pleasant, hearty flavor that isn't over the top or too sweet.  It's got superior texture to corn flakes, Wheaties, or Total and it's also got a more impressive nutritional content.  My wife loves this stuff.<br /><br />The product is shipped safely and always arrives undamaged and very easy to open.  And it's a good value via Amazon.

review/summary: Great Service & Price For A WONDERFUL "Product"
review/text: This cereal has not been sold in our area for years and Amazon makes it so convenient and easy to order it from them at a great bulk rate price.  My wife can't take vitamins and eat many foods due to some unusual sensitivities, so for her this cereal is a life line.  Thank you Amazon for making such an incredible difference in my wife's well being and offering this important product for sale.

review/summary: Best Cereal Ever
review/text: I was upset when my local store stopped carrying this cereal, but I found that it is actually cheaper to buy it through Amazon.<br /><br />Product 19 cereal has a great taste, is more nutritious than any others, and stays crisp in milk longer than others.<br /><br />Why is Kellogg's pushing Special K when this is a much better cereal?

review/summary: One of my all time favorite cereals!
review/text: I am appalled that Kellogg's would discontinue this from the grocery stores, I don't get why.  It's been around for years and years!  While I haven't eaten it since I was a kid or anything, I have been buying it for several years now and was really disappointed when I couldn't find it in the stores anymore.<br /><br />This cereal is awesome, it tastes really good and the selling point for me is that it doesn't get soggy in milk!  Any other cereal I eat that has flakes is another story.  Not much else to say aside from that.<br /><br />I am very grateful to Amazon for carrying this in 4 box packs, I have been buying it from here and will continue to do so!

A store there had Product 19 so we flew home with half a suitcase of the stuff. Since then I found it on Amazon, and my wife is now a happy camper. The cereal is fresh and the price is similar to what we paid in stores.

review/text: Taste, I'm told is blah compared to imported butters.  The issue is it's full of water. I threw a dollop of Plugra into an oiled saut&eacute; pan which was a bit over coasting. It literally exploded.  People actually came in from then living room 2 rooms away wondering what was going on.  I removed the pan three times for long periods until all the water had finally cooked off. We only use imported butter in this house and this European "style" butter appears to be no different, if not worst, than any cheap American butter.<br /><br />Either Plugra's quality control is poor or the butter is full of water.

review/text: I must admit, I never liked iced tea. However, I had some of the China Mist Black Currant at a local restaurant in lieu of the usual soft drink. Since my husband and I kept going back to the restaurant more for the tea than the dinners, I had to ask what brand and bought it online through Amazon! Brew it like regular leaf tea and then cool in refrigerator (this is not a sun tea and doesn't taste as good that way). Wonderful, delicate currant taste, not overbearing, and even better with just a little sweetener added. Highly recommended.

review/summary: I like it!
review/text: I'm a long time tea and lover and only rarely do I buy packaged teas, preferring loose leave teas instead. But I bought a bunch of these new pyramid tea bagged teas because they just looked so neat.<br /><br />This Lipton truffle one is the second one I'm trying.<br /><br />Packaging: I love the pyramid tea bags. I think they really work well, at a minimum they allow bigger tea leaves because there is more space inside the bag for the water to swirl the leaves around. The negative about this is that the bags are not individually wrapped (difficult to wrap a pyramid shape) so I try to use up all 20 bags as quickly as possible lest the flavor escapes.<br /><br />Flavor: Not usually a great fan of flavored teas because sometimes the flavor overwhelms the tea taste and you end up drinking flavored water with tea. This one is not bad. It's hard to mix all 3 flavors together and taste all 3. On smelling it, it smells strongly of caramel. On tasting it, the vanilla and caramel flavor is rather weak, the truffle flavor is stronger and you end up with a coffee-ish tasting tea, which isn't bad. After reading the other reviews, butterscotch, musty or even musky come to mind.<br /><br />In the end, all taste is subjective so you really have to try it yourself (and just buy 1 box first). In my humble opinion, I would summarize this as a coffee-ish tasting desert tea. I add sugar to my tea, so with the caramel or butterscotch and coffee taste this is definitely a desert tea. I wouldn't drink this everyday, but I would buy it again.<br /><br />N.B. Make sure you rinse your teapot or cup quickly after drinking this as the caramel flavor can remain quite a while.

review/summary: I have mixed feelings about this flavor
review/text: The first few times I tried it I thought it tasted "musty", but I decided to try it again.  With vanilla creamer it is very good. When it is brewed at least 5 minutes makes the caramel taste "come out".  I tried it last night as an iced tea and it was exotic. It is not a flavor for everyone, and I recommed buying a single box, before making a case commitment.  I drank it in the middle of my night shift for desert-like, calorie free boost.

review/summary: Best suited for those who like black tea blends.
review/text: I really LOVE this tea. I drink a LOT of black tea each day since I don't drink coffee. I rarely drink fruity, sweet flavored or herbal teas. I drink strong black teas like Early Grey, Irish Breakfast and English Breakfast teas. That said, I LOVE this blend. It's hard to find a flavored blend like this using black tea (typically always find it as an herbal blend, green tea, etc).<br /><br />Those who prefer herbal teas, green teas, etc., over the stronger black teas may not enjoy this flavor as much. It has a taste that's hard to explain. It's not super sweet at all (not a fan of anything sweet in my tea). The aroma almost reminds me of when you walk into a coffee shop and smell the sweet caramel/toffee coffee blends, but the taste is still the great black tea flavor.<br /><br />Highly suggest getting just one box the first time you try this tea. Recommended for those who enjoy black tea blends.

review/text: I love flavored teas and am usually a little worried about trying new ones, but this one was great. It's a shame that they have to be boughten in case lots instead of individual boxes but I gave 2 boxes away for others to try and kept the rest for myself...now off to try the others.

review/summary: Lovely Tea
review/text: Love this tea!  I drink tea all day.  Need the caffine, and don't like coffee.  I like mostly black teas.  This is very good, not excedingly bold or overtly flavored, just a little nicer than the your ususal English or Irish breakfast tea.  I have a ton a of flavored and regular tea in the pantry and keep coming back to this.  You can drink this every day and not get tired of it.  After a few cups of red velvet tea, or blueberry tea, or rasberry something or the other it gets boring.  This is just a step above the basic  morning breakfast tea and never gets overbearing, just really good.  Serve it to all my guests and they can't tell the taste difference between regular tea other than "this is really good"

review/summary: Great morning drink.
review/text: I have been trying to replace my morning coffee for quite some time; anyone struggling with this may know that when you quit dinking coffee you have some undesirable side effects...  Black tea is a good morning alternative with less caffeine than coffee but the flavor is not always 'great'; I really enjoy flavored coffee!  Let me just say if you have never tried the pyramid tea bags, you should just for the sheer awesomeness of the new bags... They are much smaller out of the box than normal tea bags so there appears to be quite a bit less tea, however when you put it in hot water the tea and bag expand!  Well, I found it an exciting bonus to a great tasting cup of tea.  Not sure about Lipton's actual purchasing practices but their spiel above makes me feel good about buying their products, with Amazon's current sale the boxes are about 1.50, putting my cup of tea at about 7-8 cents per cup, comparable to the low cost of coffee.  I enjoyed this with some sugar and soy milk, very sweet, which is how I like my coffee.  Cannot comment on the individual truffle or caramel flavor, as I am not familiar with truffles and do not detect a strong caramel flavor.

review/text: I am a fan of Lipton pyramid tea bags.  Not only do they look pretty, but I haven't found a variety I didn't like yet.  I don't often see the Lipton pyramid teas offered in the grocery store where I shop, so it's a great deal when I find it online for about $12 shipped!  That's less than $3/box. The Vanilla Caramel Truffle is a great flavor when combined with honey and milk.  It's not a strong tea, so this may not be for you if you like something with a kick.  Make sure you let it brew for a few minutes to get the best taste.

My best friend got me hooked on it by brewing it in half milk,half water, with a tad of sugar and pure vanilla extract. Unbelievable! You could keep it skinny by using skim milk and your favorite sweetener. It's like having a fancy Starbucks drink at a fraction of the cost and much lower in caffiene than coffee!

review/summary: I guess I must be spoiled by Stash & PG Tips Teas!
review/text: I guess I must be spoiled by Stash & PG Tips brand teas.<br /><br />This Lipton Black Vanilla Caramel Truffle tea is a very *scantly* filled teabag.  2 of them barely make the same strength as 1 PG Tips tea bag, and for a fuller richer 12 oz cup you should use 3 bags.  This brings the price up significantly for this tea versus other brands.<br /><br />If you enjoy a stronger cuppa' then you may want to add a bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1KNK">PG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZPG">Stash Premium Super Irish Breakfast Black Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> tea for strength.  I find that using 3 Lipton bags by themselves makes the caramel flavor too strong for my taste.<br /><br />So I use 1-2 bags PG Tips (or alternately 2 bags Stash Irish Breakfast) plus 1 bag Lipton Vanilla Caramel.  Then after the tea is done steeping I add some stevia or raw sugar, and a good dash of whole milk.<br /><br />If you just enjoy a light cup of tea with a decently strong caramel flavor, then this tea on it's own should be sufficient.<br /><br />Just my experience. To each his own.<br /><br />If this happens to be your very favorite tea, then all I can say is that we must agree to disagree :0)

review/text: This tea is absolutely amazing.  It's like drinking candy.  Doesn't have that 'tea' flavor which is good since I don't care for normal teas.  Think of it as hot cocoa, such instead of a cocoa flavor it's a mix of vanilla and caramel.<br /><br />I recommend making it using all milk.  Then add sugar to it to the desired sweetness (very important in order to get the flavors to taste good).  Very enjoyable.<br /><br />Can also take it and pour over a glass filled with ice for the iced tea version.  Also quite good.

review/text: I love caramel tea, having discovering it in Amsterdam a few years ago. I was disappointed in this one, though. It has a slightly "flowery" taste to me, and not enough caramel or vanilla aftertaste. I've tried other brands and love them, but this one just left me flat. I'll keep drinking it, of course, since I bought a large supply, but will add my sugar free caramel syrup to it to get the extra kick I need.

review/summary: get Bigelows Vanilla instead! Much better.
review/text: I bought this thinking it would be a sweet treat. I am glad others liked it. I made one cup even after smelling the tea. It smelled rancid or putrid. Musty dirt like others said. MAYBE we all got a bad batch or something. But something is off. I took these to work and wrote "Free! Please Use or take home!" They are still sitting in the cupboard. My Bigelow French Vanilla Regular AND Decaf and the Caramel Vanilla by Bigelow is sweet and scrumptious---and my coworkers are always 'borrowing' a tea bag or two. I am not a tea drinker till this year. I liked Constant Comment by Bigelow too---my mom had a sampler kit at home and I had just started trying tea. My baby girl beagle Daisy died at age 14 and I was in tears. Later that night my mom brought in to me a cup of the French Vanilla Bigelow tea and it was so nice! It has been my favorite ever since. Great all year round. Although like I said the orange spiciness of the Bigelow Constant Comment is perfect for Fall and Christmas time. SO if you want great vanilla go for Bigelow. Like I said maybe I got a bad batch but I had bought two boxes at one time. If they improve this I will try it again. NOW For Liptons French Vanilla in regular bags THAT DOES TASTE GOOD----runs a close second to my Bigelow...but this,,,this no!
