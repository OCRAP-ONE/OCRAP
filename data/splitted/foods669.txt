review/summary: Takes a few batches, but keep at it...
review/text: The first batch was a little disappointing, but as the batches progress, they keep getting better.  The grains are now large and healthy (4 batches) and the kefir water is greatly improved.<br /><br />I want to note that that while there are no guidelines on the box as to how much of this natural probiotic to drink, you are not limited to amount per day.  Also, note that the kefir water, if placed in the refrigerator, will keep for up to 2 weeks.  I use a small jar (about 1/2 gallon) at a time.  I use organic sugars--palm sugar, coconut sugar, etc.  Experiment, because all of the different sugars will give you different flavors.  One idea (that I haven't done yet, but will) is to add dried fruit for flavor.<br /><br />There are some sites online that will help you with the process.<br /><br />Handle the kefir grains with care.  They are living organisms, and will replicate and grow if you take good care of them.<br /><br />Keep the kefir water in a cool place while it "grows", preferably in the dark or under a towel.<br /><br />This is good for you--and the flavor grows on you :)

review/summary: Not Cultures for Health. Shame on Amazon and the Seller
review/text: One star because you can not indicate no stars, which would be my rating.<br /><br />I ordered this product because I trust "Cultures for Health" products. When I received the package it was not in the Cultures for Health package but rather in a plain bubble envelop in zip lock bag. I contacted the vendor to ask what was going on. The vendor responds: "You have ordered and received kefir grains from Fermentation Cultures, we have no association with Cultures for Health."<br /><br />So I say, "If you have no association why does the the product description say: Water Kefir Grains by Cultures for Health LLC."<br /><br />He responds, "That is how amazon works, if I have to sell things similar to those that are already on amazon, they will place it this way."<br /><br />What? Fermentation Cultures???<br /><br />I wrote to Cultures for Health and they were aware of this fraudulent use of their name and had contacted Amazon with no results.<br /><br />I have ordered many products from Amazon and this has never been the case. This drastically reduces my trust in Amazon. I asked Amazon to please explain what the seller means by "that is how Amazon works," wanting to know if what he stated is true in any way.<br /><br />Amazon wrote: "I'm sorry this has been a disappointing order experience for you; this doesn't normally happen." What is it that doesn't normally happen? I never received a satisfactory explanation regarding this false advertising.<br /><br />Amazon did provide a refund but that is not my concern. I ordered frequently from Amazon and until this occurrence I was under the impression that sellers were offering products as advertised. I wanted to know if this is a routine practice of Amazon. And if not, why wouldn't Amazon have the faulty association removed from the product description? No answers. The seller's page is still up and the product description still proclaims it's by "Cultures for Heath."<br /><br />I have not purchased anything from Amazon for six months. I have found other sources for many routine items; this equates to many hundreds of dollars. I may consider a purchase here and there but Amazon failed big here.<br /><br />You can find the authentic product by doing a simple search; they do not sell on Amazon.

My husband thinks the water should be more carbonated, but I'm not sure if that's us doing it incorrectly, the grains themselves, or him being too picky.<br /><br />Make sure you have lots of glass bottles.

review/summary: Very good cultures
review/text: I have bought from Cultures for Healthy (directly from the site) several starter cultures; buttermilk, water Kefir, Filmj&ouml;lk, greek yoghurt, and kombucha. All the cultures came in sealed pouches in dry form. They need to be hydrated first before doing the first batch of the medium. I didn't activate as soon as I got them; got to do it last Friday. The kombucha "mushroom" is triving; I can see it getting thick and as they say in the enclosed instructions it make take up to 28 days for the culture start to create another "mushroom". The buttermilk starter took 48 hours to culture one cup of organic milk (it is delicious), the Filmj&ouml;lk also cultured in 48 hours (it lookd a little disgusting and I though that I had made a mistake, but I took a tablespoon of the stuff to culture a cup o milk and it did look a little like spoilled milk with a "cheesy" smell, but after mixing it and tasting it, it tasted fine, a little sour but not tangy new taste for me, but I ate it with some diced mango; delicious). The water kefir is still going, and I am waiting. The Greek yoghurt starter I didn't use it yet. Overall, the packaging is fine, the product is good, time is needed to let these starters come to live; now, I decided to warm the milk to "lukewarm" before adding the cultures because I though the milk from the fridge was too cold. Overall, I am satisfied with the products from  Cultures for Health.

review/summary: Nice strong ginger flavor
review/text: Prince of Peace Ginger Honey Crystals<br /><br />Unfortunately I got these on the last day of a local tea shop -- and I say unfortunately because I became instantly enamored of the product.  A single packet produces a decidedly strong 10-12 oz cup, very nice and gingery, reminiscent of the hot ginger tea sometimes served on cold winter days at a Haitian restaurant I know.  The honey adds a nice complexity to the cup, but I'm also looking forward to adding a few cloves and cinnamon stick.  Many other uses for the crystals come to mind as well as simply dissolving in water -- I've been using it to sugar tea, both black and green, and I'll definitely try another reviewer's recommendation for strawberries or other fruit.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish the packet had somewhat less sugar (but with the same ginger and honey strength).  One packet, at 17 g, is getting a bit close to typical desert levels (I checked some sorbet in my frig, 23 g).<br /><br />That aside, I prefer this to the ginger tea I've been getting at a local Korean market, a kind of marmalade or jelly with ginger slices in a jar.  Not only does this product have a stronger, hotter ginger flavor, but it can be used in place of granulated sugar.

review/text: I love this product and I share it with my family and co-workers.  JVS by way of Amazon is the best there is for online purchase and I will definitely continue to buy from them.  I am currently preparing for my third order in as many months.  Great for upset stomach, sore throats, stressful days and cool nights.Make it hot with water or milk to take the chill out!

review/summary: Best Cure for an Upset Tummy!
review/text: I discovered this product years ago at a local asian market.  This is a miracle cure for an upset stomach, car sickness, seasickness, etc...My husband uses it when his IBS acts up.  When I go on a cruise, I bring one dose a day and I do not need to get the behind the ear tabs that I had used before.<br /><br />Before I found this, I would have to go get the ginger root, peel, slice, and steep to get a good tea for my stomachache, but this is tons more convenient.  Besides, who wants to do all that work when you are sick.<br /><br />The flavor is very strong so I found that I like it a little more watered down than it recommends but 1 or 2 "doses" when I am feeling queasy and it is gone.

review/summary: Good but too much sugar
review/text: The first time I drank this tea I almost gagged. I'd prepared it according to the directions but it was too spicy. I then had the good sense to add more water and a chamomile tea sachet to break down the spicyness...and it was wonderful. I then discovered that eating the ginger crystals by themselves was quite pleasant as well. I know it sounds weird, but the crystals are tasty, probably because they're so sweet...which leads me to my next point. Although sugar TASTES good, im not a fan of consuming too much of it. It's 17 grams per packet, which I think is too high for a cup of tea. It makes my teeth feel all gritty afterwards (no bueno). If they made a sugar free version I'd be sold :)

review/summary: delicious and practical
review/text: If you're into hot, spicy gingery tastes, you'll like this drink. It's intense, also because of the honey. I find it delicious, and I know some people who dilute it (using half a package per cup) to make it milder. Either way, it's yummy and satisfying. Very soothing on a winter day, and also if you have a cold or are suffering from nausea or stomach upset. It's also versatile. I dissolve a package into plain oatmeal--what an easy way to add unique flavor. I like that it's instant, and also that I can take along the sachets to work or on a trip. Highly recommend this!

At first I was hesitant to drink because of the strong aroma, but at FIRST SIP & INHALE, it immediately went to work!!  Instantly cleared my sinuses & soothed my throat so much, I knew I had to have stock at work & at home!  I also noticed I had improved enegy & just felt better all around!  I now drink these packets daily, if not twice a day, it was recommended that I drink one before bedtime & I did & woke up feeling FABULOUS!  It is hard to find these packets, I only found them at the mall's vitamin shop and I "think" at GNC, but Amazon has a great price & saves you the trip!!!!

review/text: I have been drinking this ginger tea for years, and can't live without it. I have IBS and digestive upset is a way of life unfortunately; however, this ginger tea is strong enough to provide a digestive tonic and it tastes good too. I wish it were a little less sweet, but I don't eat a lot of sugar normally. I am pregnant now, and have been drinking it throughout. It settles my belly and helps with the IBS symptoms as well. I have driven 2 hours before to get this from Chinatown, so I'm super happy that I can get it here when I need it as well!

review/summary: Ginger Honey tea granuals
review/text: These are a staple in my pantry.  I make a two litter bottle of green tea with one or two packets of the ginger honey tea added.  I love the flavor and I don't get acid kick-back anymore.  I drink the honey ginger tea hot for a sore throat. It is wonderful in apple juice or other fruit juices as it give a punch to the drink.<br /><br />I also make a drink from green veggies and some fruit. This ginger honey really livens it up and makes it delicious. When I make shortbread cookies, I sprinkle this ginger on top before baking. I won an award for the cookies at a Scottish festival.  I buy 3-4 of the large bags at a time. It doesn't last long around here.<br /><br />It is great to sip on the front porch with neighbors and can be served hot in the winter and iced in the hot summers.

review/summary: I was looking for Jamaican Ginger Beer
review/text: I found lots of spicy ginger beers at Amazon, but the best price in the lot was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB04N8">D & G, Soda Ginger Beer, 12-once (24 Pack)</a>; while $30 [$45 shipped] for 24 hard-to-find sodas isn't the worst pricing in the world,  it's still not going to be in my budget as an everyday beverage. This stuff is plenty affordable in the 30-count bag, and the flavor is exactly the spicy & sweet combination I remember from my youth in the South.<br /><br />It just arrived today, so I've not had the chance to try it with club soda in place of water, but I expect adding some fizziness will make this drink perfect! Look for an update to this review.<br />UPDATE: almost finished  with bag one, ordering more. Mixing the bag with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBRS12">Blue Sky Natural True Seltzer,  12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> does make a nice refreshing drink (I mix in a little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WX5J9I">Tang Orange Powdered Drink Mix (Makes 22 Quarts), 72-Ounce Canister</a> for a citrus-ginger soda), but it's not as close to the Jamaican Ginger beer that I remember as I'd hoped.<br /><br />However, if I add it to store-brand ginger ale, it IS the flavor clone I'd been looking for! Five stars!<br /><br />Further update: There are many recipes foe home-made ginger ale on the web, and the process looks very simple...I'll keep a stock of these packets anyway, but I think I'll try fashioning my own brew this weekend!

review/text: I was drinking another brand of tea which is not sold in any of the stores where I live or on Amazon. I decided to give this brand a try after reading all of the positive reviews.<br /><br />I am very disappointed in this purchase. The tea tastes like sugar water. The ginger flavor is not strong at all. Even the crystals are lighter in comparison to the other product that I was drinking. Luckily, this product was very reasonably priced so I won't feel too bad about tossing the remaining bags if I can't find someone to give them to.<br /><br />I can't fault the seller here. The product was reasonably priced and arrived on time. I would purchase another item from them, but not this one.<br /><br />Just my two cents.

review/text: It's great stuff. Really simple to use, and really good tasting -- I only sweeten it with a spoonful of honey or two as far as additives go. I used it all throughout my pregnancy as an all natural solution to my all day sickness. Sometimes it was all I could keep down.<br />I've recommend it to a LOT of my friends, pregnant and not, who are tea drinkers like myself, and I continue to thank the person who introduced it to me. It's good and soothing, not too harsh, like other ginger products I've tried, and it's good at any time; hot or cold. Hell, at the first sign of a cold, I start guzzling it down like nobody's business , an more often than not, it keeps my cold (especially sore throats) from getting any worse. It's something I'll swear by for life, I'm sure.

review/text: As Ginger is good to settle a stomach and, when I eat a Larabar Ginger Snap or a few Ginger cookies, it seems to satisfy my hunger, I had great expectations! I tried this cold and hot. I got a BLAST of Ginger heat in the back of my throat (expected) but no residual Ginger after taste,just an odd taste from the sugar (we use very little sugar so maybe just me). I had hoped to satisfy hunger but it doesnt seem to do that at all & seemed to MAYBE upset my stomach a little. Packaging quality & content uniformity is very good & dissolved quickly. I will be throwing the rest away partly because it is made in China and I am nervous about food items from there.

review/summary: Too much sugar
review/text: I have been making ginger tea by grating fresh ginger, mixing it with honey and lemon and adding boiling water. The qualities and effects of ginger on the body are quite remarkable. My husband and I have been battling the flu for 10 days, and the ginger tea really helps. It was getting tiring doing that by hand, so I found this product and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts:<br />Pros:<br />It's quite tasty, although very sugary. For me, as I love the taste of ginger drinks (ginger beer, ginger ale) I like the combination of ginger with sweetness, although I would prefer it to be artificial sweetener. I found that I need more than 6 to 8 ounces of water due to the concentration in each of the packets.<br />It's very nice that each packet is individually sealed, which keeps it fresh for quite a while.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's very high in sugar. It's a peppery, sugary drink. I believe it will supply you with the necessary amounts of ginger to affect your health in a positive way. Here's the but though, because it's high in sugar, it's something that someone like I, who have higher than normal cholesterol would not want to consume too much off.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I liked the taste, but would prefer less sugar, or artificial sweetener. Perhaps sweetened with honey?

I found this when I came across it somewhere on clearance once and althoug it's very strong (I only use 1/2 packet per cup); depending on how strong you like ginger, you might use more :)  For winter or fall this is a wonderful thing to have around.  Remember how I said it's strong, well, I get 2 cups per packet (I like my tea very strong, but I like this the way I described). The value here-wow, you just can't go wrong.  And no, I am not getting any compensation here for saying all this, I just found a product I like and it's hard to find for such a great price. I can't do dairy either or much coffee, so haviing things like this just make life a little more fun.  Plus, it's so much better for you and chepaer than a drive-through drink :)

review/text: I was so looking forward to enjoy this tea and was imagining how wonderful it would be to have a cup of hot sweet ginger tea in the coming winter....unfortunately my stomach was not up to the `task'.  I have a sensitive stomach and get heartburn and acid reflux if I drink coffee or most of the over-the-counter orange juice.  I thought it's safe to drink this ginger tea but I ended up having mild heartburn every time after I drank the tea (even use just half bag of the powder).  And the same condition occurred after all three attempts, so I had to give up...  I did find out that I am ok with drinking the home-made ginger tea (three slices of ginger in boiling water and some sugar).  I would still recommend this to people with no stomach problems!!

review/summary: Strong, but good
review/text: I ordered this product after a friend of my mother's told her about it. My mother's friend uses it because she gets nauseous on a regular basis and ginger, which this product has in spades, helps a lot.<br /><br />I have a brain tumor which causes me to experience vertigo, dizziness, and nausea - all on a fairly regular basis. I have medication, ONDANSETRON HCL 8MB to be exact, which works, but gives me an incredible headache as a side effect of making my nausea go away. As a result, I need to take Aspirin at the very least, with the medication to offset the side effect. NOT a pleasant experience to say the least.<br /><br />I've had ginger before as part of juicing, which I do from time to time after watching the movie FAT, SICK, AND NEARLY DEAD (available via Amazon Prime streaming video and Hulu). However, I don't have the energy to make juice as often as I would like.<br /><br />This tea allows me to get some ginger into my system much easier. The ginger doesn't have the side effects that the aforementioned medication does, so it's my first choice. This tea is WAY too strong as is though. Instead of using a whole packet in a large cup of water, I use a teaspoon, and go from there if I need more ginger to relax my stomach. At least this means that the tea will last much longer.<br /><br />If you have chronic nausea for whatever reason, I'd give this stuff a try, just beware of the strength and be prepared to adjust the amount you use, unless you want your throat to burn from the high concentration of ginger.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I bought this for the benefits of ginger and honey, and based on the high reviews. I enjoy hot teas and drinks in general. When I first tried this drink it was a little too spicey for me. I tried cutting it in half and that worked ok. The best solution for me is to add in a little cream or vanilla soy milk. It makes it creamy and just a little spicy like a chai tea. VERY enjoyable and soothing when not feeling well. It's also come in handy for morning sickness recently.

review/summary: I love Ginger any way I can get it.
review/text: One day my mother in law sent me over some of these packets.  I was hooked with the first Packet.  I have a hard time with hot things.  The rest of my family could not tell the burn it gives.  They even like to just pour them into their mouths and let them dissolve.  The more of It I drank I finally got to where I can drink the whole packet now.  My doctor has taken me away from cream so my morning coffee was just horrible.  I now put one packet of this in my cup then put in a K-cup of my favorite coffee and wow what a wonderful spicy wake me up.<br /><br />I am a diabetic, and someone who does not like to eat.  So getting that little boost of sugar and honey first thing in the morning gives me time to get my breakfast ready.  I have low sugar and my doc is trying to get me to eat at least 1000 kilo/calories to 1400 kilo/calories.  Which is hard to do when you mainly eat raw vegetables and fruits. So for me.  This is a fast way to get my blood sugar up and stay up long enough for me to get some food in me.<br /><br />I know one person complained about the calories.  It does have 18 carbs per packet.  But the Ginger is good and very strong which works very well for settling my stomach. I used to have to take phenergan for nausea now a cup of this and I am good.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this as much as we do.<br />Atheena

review/summary: Not limited to hot beverage
review/text: The Prince of Peace Instant Ginger Honey Crystals originally didn't impress me because the first ingredient was cane sugar, followed by honey and then ginger.  Because we don't drink many sweet beverages, the 70 calories and 17 sugar grams seemed outrageous.  We also were not thrilled with the biblical proverbs imprinted on the packaging.  After opening the first pouch, however, our family was hooked on the spicy sweet crystals.  Each pouch contains 12 grams of ginger and it is very, very spicy, just what we like around here.  We empty a packet into a little jar and always have some accessible in the kitchen.  I use a little binder clip on a packet in my bag when traveling, so I can slip a few crystals on my tongue even when there's no water available.  I add this to white or green tea, mix it in my chai and add no other sweetener, sprinkle it on yogurt, fruit and fiber cereal in the morning, and even have used it to tone down an overly spicy seafood stew I made last week.  I don't know how, but throwing in about a half teaspoon worked a miracle.  The hot beverage is great when we're nauseous or just feeling less than perfect, and when chilled, is a perfect complement to one of those clear beverages we may drink for relaxation.  If you like ginger, think about taking a break from the ginger chews/candy and try these little delectable crystals instead.

review/summary: Spicy and satisfying, but not the best
review/text: The packets make an easy and quick way to make a spicy and sweet ginger tea. However, I prefer using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029JDDE">Ting Ting Jahe Ginger Candy (5.25oz)</a> to make my tea. Every packet has 17g of sugar, yet doesn't taste as sweet as Ting Ting Jahe in my opinion, which has only 3g per piece of candy. I also think that Ting Ting Jahe has a cleaner ginger flavor, but isnt as spicy as this product. This product also takes up more space and isnt as good a value as ting ting jahe. If you are looking for the quickest way to make a drink, these packets are the way to go. However, if you are willing to stir around the ginger candies until they dissolve, the ting ting jahe candies make a much better tasting drink, with less sugar and a cleaner finish. Plus, you can eat them as regular candies if you wish!

review/text: I got this because I am pregnant and experiencing nausea.  I had never had anything like this, so I was not aware of what it would be like.  I did read the reviews and most people seemed to really like this product, so I gave it a try.  I did not like it!  It is very spicy, which to me did not seem fitting for a drink.  I was only able to get down half a glass of this.  If you are pregnant and looking for something to ease your morning sickness, try ginger tea instead.  I got some lemon ginger tea... it is very good!  Also try ginger hard candies.  I got some of those as well.  If you are just a lover of all things ginger, go ahead and try it!

review/text: One of my most frequent purchases from Amazon is this delectable sausage. It's made with lamb and Moroccan spices.  It has some heat in it.  We use it when we make spinach pizza, but there are other recipes in which it can be used, particularly in a Julia Child recipe for braised lamb shank, found in Mastering the Art of French Cooking.  It lends a delicious flavor of North Africa to whatever recipe you use Merguez in.  This is the only brand I've ever found for merguez, and I recommend it highly.

I will say, though, that well into the "expected delivery" window the product hadn't shipped, and I emailed the seller to cancel the order. Miraculously, I was informed by the seller (but not by Amazon) that it had already shipped and was too late to cancel. It did end up arriving a couple days later, but it took over a week from the time I ordered it until it actually shipped. I was frustrated with the experience.

review/summary: Very versatile!
review/text: We bought this with a coupon at our warehouse grocery store wondering if we'd ever use it all, but here we are on our second canister now! Let me tell you, this stuff is very versatile! I know Nestle just advertises it as a chocolate milk drink mix, but we've found many uses for it.<br /><br />I use it with milk to make hot cocoas (and it's become my preference over Swiss Miss packets and the like), we've used it to add chocolaty flavors to baking projects, we obviously make our toddler the occasional chocolate milk for a treat, but my favorite thing to do with Nesquik powder is to make myself an iced mocha! (Although you could certainly make hot mochas as well). My husband has recently been on my case for spending almost $5 every day (sometimes twice) on Starbuck's iced mochas. I have a newborn, you see, so I'm sleep deprived and my coffee consumption has gone up. I'm addicted! But we realized the Starbuck's charges were adding up quite a bit, so as an alternative, most days I turn to Nesquik instead. It doesn't taste like Starbuck's mochas, but it does make for a tasty coffee drink if you like them chocolaty. I use one shot of espresso (or strong coffee if I'm away from our espresso machine), two spoonfuls of Nesquik, and fill the glass up the rest of the way with about 1 cup of milk. It's yummy! You can add ice, or keep it hot if you like. In the long run, we've saved money for sure by using the Nesquik.<br /><br />Finally, I have to say that as a mom, the ingredient list is satisfactory. This obviously isn't what you'd call health food, and certainly not advertised as organic or anything - but as far as the ingredient list goes it's pretty mild. No scary sounding ingredients I can't pronounce on the label - mostly minerals, vitamins, and sugar. There are no artificial sweeteners, as advertised. I absolutely expect us to remain regular buyers of Nesquik, it fits in nicely with my family!

review/summary: Excellent source of formula for babies who cannot have milk based blend...raised two my own three on this formula.
review/text: Similac travel bottles are an excellent, convenient way to travel with your child without the worry of keeping your formula fresh and ready for use. Just undo screw on top, replace with a nipple and ready, at room temperature, to use.

review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE these!
review/text: So very convenient and easy. I take these where ever I go with my baby. And I also use them when he wakes up in the middle of the night. They are quite wonderful. Only thing I don't like is the price. But you pay for convenience. Definitely recommend. My son has acid reflux and the powdered formula doesn't help that at all and the others you have to warm up after first use. These you just shake up poor and give to your baby. love them!

review/summary: So convenient!
review/text: I just love how convenient these bottles are! I keep one in the diaper bag in case the baby wants to eat when we're gone, and we're planning a trip out of state soon and I will be taking these with us.  So easy!  You only need a nipple and collar.
