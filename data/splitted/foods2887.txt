review/text: I have been eating Hemp Seed Hearts for breakfast since Aug. 15, 2011. I love them!! I've lost 15 pounds because my appetite is significantly reduced and my energy level is great. I eat a big salad in the morning with 2oz. Hemp Seeds, with plain yogurt and Mrs. Dash spices. Since August, I've not had a salad in the AM about 6 times. After a weekend of eating like a 'normal person', I can't wait until I can go back to eating my salad for breakfast. My acid reflux is GONE, I'm no longer bloated and gassy. Hemp Seeds are full of nutrition and I plan to eat them for the rest of my life (I'm 52).

review/summary: Nutiva hempseeds
review/text: I'm very happy with the shipment of Nutiva hempseeds. They arrived fast, and were vacuum packed, which preserves their freshness. Nutiva's hempseeds are high quality. And vacuum packed nuts and seeds are the best!  I will order these again, when I run out, and I have recommended them to family and friends. Hempseeds are very nutritionally dense and make a great addition to smoothies and salads. I have a nice tabouli recipe for hempseeds in my Little e-Book of Raw Holiday Recipes.

review/summary: HORRIBLE STOMACH PAIN!!
review/text: I have Celiac Disease and heard so much good stuff about Hemp Seeds.  I purchased this 3lb. bag and was excited to try it.  The first time I became very nauseous and I did not connect it to the Hemp Seeds.  The next time I sprinkled it on my salad.  Approximately two hours later I got horrible stomach cramps and uncontrollable vomiting.  It was so awful!  I was in pain the whole night.  I was afraid to eat anything the next day.  I just had Gatorade and a banana.  I don't think I could ever try Hemp Seeds again.  I don't know if this was a bad batch or if they share equipment with a wheat facility. I will never buy this again.

review/text: This is a great product and I highly suggest it.  It's the best price you will find for a quality product.  I was buying the trader joes hemp powder protein mix but when I found this I switched.  This has more protein, less sugar, less calories and less fiber, it was a no brainer.  More expensive but worth it.  Its great to mix in any smoothie for a little more protein.  Hemp is the best possible protein you can get.  I recently started to make hemp milk with this and its great.  The recipe is simple: 4 cups of filtered waters, 3/4 of cups of the hemp seeds, put into a highpowered blender until white and creamy.  Its delicious!

review/summary: Healthiest addition ever
review/text: I absolutely love these hemp seeds. They come vacuum-sealed and I just transfer them to a large freezer bag when I open them, and store them in the freezer.<br /><br />Hemp seeds are a perfect protein, supplying your body with all the essential amino acids. In just 3 tablespoons of these seeds, you're getting 11 grams of protein! They are also super high in other minerals and vitamins, as well as omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />We sprinkle these on just about anything - oatmeal, yogurt, pizza, you name it. I mix them in with all types of food for my now 15 month old son. They are SO good for babies and young children with all the omega-3 fatty acids, protein, minerals.<br /><br />I subscribe to this item and only pay $50 with free shipping - can't beat the price for such a healthy item.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I really enjoy these hemp seeds on salads.  They have a slightly nutty flavor, so it is a perfect compliment to a crisp, dark green salad.  One word of warning, though, toss the salad well, and sprinkle the seeds on after you put your dressing on your salad.  The reason is because I once put them on my salad before the dressing and I ate a large cluster of seeds in one bite, and they got caught in my throat.  I coughed a bit and was fine, but it was something that could've been avoided.<br /><br />I highly recommend these little seeds as a dietary supplement for the omega-3's and 6's.  NEVER, EVER heat them or cook with them, or they will lose their nutritional value completely.  No hyperbole, just fact.

review/summary: I like its pine nutty taste
review/text: Hempseed flavor reminds me of pine nuts.  Hempseed contain all nine essential amino acids, which makes them a complete protein, like egg whites and soy. One ounce of hemp provides 45 percent of daily magnesium requirement. Studies show that a diet rich in magnesium can slash diabetes risk by almost half, because it increases insulin sensitivity.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat hempseed is as a dip or a spread on a sandwich.  I use the same recipe for both.  I puree 1 Tbsp. ground hemp seeds, 2 Tbsp. store-bought pesto, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 1 can cannellini beans.<br /><br />Hempseed are easy to spill from the plastic bag they arrive in, so when I am ready to use a new bag I pour the bag into a plastic container designed for cereal, this allows me to pour the seeds out of the container's spout without spilling the seeds on the counter. To make it easier to move the content of the bag into the container, I cut a small hole in the bag and use a funnel to direct the seeds into the container.<br /><br />In case you find it useful here is a taste comparison of other seeds I use in my diet.<br /><br />FLAXSEEDS<br />Nutty-flavored seeds that provide the most nutrition when ground.<br /><br />HEMP SEEDS<br />Similar in taste to sunflower seeds and pine nuts.<br /><br />BUCKWHEAT GROATS<br />Soft seeds with a sweet, earthy flavor when toasted.<br /><br />WHEAT GERM<br />The flaky center of wheat kernels.

My most recent order, however, while still received promptly, was rancid and inedible. I was so disappointed. I sent an email that evening, detailing my concern and asking for a new shipment. I didn't receive a reply to my email. What I did receive, however, was a new order of Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed, delivered to my doorstep just two days later! Since this new seed had the same packaging date as my initial order, I cautiously sampled it. The seeds were fine. Phew! So -- not only do I have a good supply of a good product, I got excellent service from Amazon!  Thank you!

review/text: It's my first time trying hempseed and I'm amazed. You can eat directly from the bag! It has a texture similar to cooked couscous (soft and smooth.) It tastes like sun flower or pumpkin seed. It has a light omega-3 fishy oil after taste. Just when I have a thought of going to supermarket getting some ribs to do slow BBQ, I just tried four spoons of hempseed and my craving for soft tender ribs disappear in my head. So I guess it has all the needed stuff you can get from tasty meat with less required cooking time. So Nutiva hempseed is pretty fresh based on the taste and texture of the seeds. My bag was packaged 45 days ago. I separate 1/4 lbs into a smaller ziplock bag leaving in the fridge and the rest went to a bigger ziplock in the freezer.

I read these hempseeds control the sugar and carb cravings for those who follow those diets. Although I am not on the paleo diet or the anti-candida diet; I am eating mostly meats, fish, vegetables, fruits and nuts. These seeds are appetite filling and do control food cravings for sugars and starches.  Many times I will just eat a spoonful. I also add them to home-made smoothies and yogurt. These hempseeds taste similar to sunflower seeds, which I also love eating by the way.<br /><br />I will most likely be a customer for life.

review/text: 6/5 stars for the seeds, 1 star for the seller (false advertising).<br />I bought the 3lb version that had the resealable bag as pictured, paid the extra money for it, and still received the cheaper bulk transparent bag version... Was looking to conceal freshness, but just ended up overpaying, and the shipping was very much delayed.

review/summary: love the hemp seeds
review/text: I am a new convert to the hemp seeds.  They taste delicious raw.  I eat them right out of the bag.  They look similar to sesame seeds, but taste more like raw pine nuts.  I also like the fact that they are higher in Omega 3's and have more protein than the chia seeds I had been using.  Nutiva has the best price for the amount I purchased.

review/text: These hemp seed are very good tasting. They are kind of nutty yet buttery in the same sense. These are very good for you also. Since they are small you can mix them in about everything like salads, shakes, put them on eggs, just about anything. I enjoy these very much and would recommend them to anyone who likes healthy natural foods.

review/summary: Quite a surprise!
review/text: This hemp seed reminds me of finely chopped black walnuts in appearance and to my taste buds, it has a much milder black walnut taste. I really did not know what to expect for a nutty flavor, but was pleasantly surprised. I plan to use them as a nut substitute when I make banana bread. I was concerned since we were having such warm weather this past week that they would turn rancid during shipping, but they arrived fully sealed, fresh tasting, and thus far I have no shell complaint. I have also started using Nutiva's organic hemp oil for salad dressings and Pacific' hemp milk to decrease my use of diary. All products have proven enjoyable winners.

The quality is no different from the smaller bags, (all the products I have tried seem to be identical to me in terms of shells/seeds).

review/summary: horrible product
review/text: This hemp seed made me and my family extremely ill.<br /><br />I ordered the 3 lb bag. I do not know if this was a fluke or just a bad batch but this was TERRIBLE<br /><br />I received the product in great time. It arrived in about 3 or 4 days and i gave half of the bag to my daughter. I used hemp seed mostly in my protein shakes. I've been taking hemp seed for about 4 months now. When I got this product, i used it in one of my shakes and 2 hours later I had horrible stomach pain and threw everything up. My stomach continued to feel horrible all day. I really didn't even think it was the shake, but a stomach virus at the time. Then 3 days later, my daughter called me and told me she got very sick, with similar symptoms. She had mentioned that it was a couple hours after drinking a shake she made with the hemp seed. At that point I was afraid to use to product, unsure if it was the hemp seed or my family had gotten a "bug" (by the way, my daughter does not live at home). So a month just passed and today I decided to give it another try. I made a shake and put 2 tablespoons of hemp seed in it (the recommended dosage is 3 but i only use 2 in my shakes). And then, like clockwork, 2 hours later i threw everything up and my stomach still feels horrible and i still feel nauseous. The expiration date of this product is December of 2012 so its not expired but there has to be something wrong with it.  To date, we've used about 6 tablespoons of this stuff and we haven't thrown the rest away in hopes the company will contact us and want it back for testing and give us a refund. I'm not saying the company acted maliciously but I do believe this may have been a bad/tainted batch.

review/text: We always order organic shelled hemp seeds from Nutiva and we love them but the last order we received was horrible.  There were a ton of shells mixed in with the product which made it very bitter and hard to eat.  I don't know if Nutiva is using a different process to remove the shells or if this was just a bad batch.  We are going order a new bag; if it is the same we will have to find a different vendor to order from.  Had this been our first purchase we would have just assumed that this is how the product is and would never have ordered again.

review/summary: Antioxidats, omegas, protien
review/text: This is a super food make no mistake about it. It is high in antioxidants, hight in essential omega fatty acids, and high in easily digestible plant protien. A tablespoon of this on your yogurt, cereal, smoothie, or stir fry will go a long way. I eat them by the spoonfull and would equate it to eating sesame seeds. They say that when the buddah was fasting he survived on just one hemp seed a day.<br /><br />These seeds do not have THC as hemp is a different viriety of plant than cannabis. The seeds are sterilized upon import into the US, by law. These seeds are grown in Canada, whos food safety standards are at least equal to the US. These are also USDA certified organic.<br /><br />A geat product. Nutiva is a good brand whos consistent quality I have come to trust. I love their 50%-protien hemp-protien too.<br /><br />Hope that helps.

review/summary: Sweet. Salty. Nut Heaven
review/text: Nuts in moderation, especially almonds, have nutritional and healthful benefits. This blend of honey peanuts, cocoa roast almonds, and glazed pecans has enough added sweeteners to perhaps mitigate the nutty health benefits, but the taste is soooooooo good that the snacker doesn't really care.<br /><br />Peanuts is the first listed ingredient, followed by almonds and pecans. There is a generous inclusion of the cocoa coated almonds nonetheless. Finding a scrumptious glazed pecan or two in a poured handful is a special treat. The flavors of the three nuts as well as the saltiness and sweetness blend perfectly for a fabulous snack treat and palate satisfication. After buying one container of this new variety, I bought three more "cans" while they were still on sale locally.<br /><br />Like Emerald nuts like I do? Then you should really enjoy this Emerald offering. I highly recommend giving this selection a personal taste test.<br /><br />WARNING: Controlling one's portion with an open cannister nearby isn't easy.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE (THIS IS THE REAL DEAL)
review/text: As a connoisseur of grape juice, I must say that this is the best! Most juices are cocktails. This product is 100% real grape juice. Cocktails are blends of other juices like apple, pear and the like. Don't get me wrong, the cocktail blend is good, however, don't you buy grape juice for the juice. This product taste better, and it has the some of the same properties as wine in regards to your health. So you can't go wrong with this product!

review/text: I think these are most likely the world's most perfect cookies.  Wonderfully delicate, just crispy enough, buttery inside without being overpoweringly rich, coated with a flawless just-sweet-enough smooth dark chocolate on the outside.  I'm telling you, when the world is kicking my butt, and I want one little thing in my life to go right - when I want one simple but really indulgent pleasure - this is exactly what I want.

review/text: If you are thinking about buying these, you could probably just get away with going to your local grocery store and picking up a bag of Chips! Ahoy cookies instead. Yes, these are a bit more substantial, but the taste is almost exactly the same. There is definitely nothing "luxury" about these cookies. I bought these because I loved the Cadbury Oatmeal and Chocolate Chip cookies. Sadly, these did nothing but disappoint.

review/text: This is truly a good coffee for those bothered by the acid in standard coffee. This one also does not have a decaf after -taste, either. The reason I gave it a 4 star was that it was not robust in flavor, but one shouldn't expect that with the lower acid/decaf combo.

review/text: These cookies are delicious. No one would EVER know they're gluten-free. I'm used to giving up taste, texture or both when I buy or make gluten-free foods, but these are as good as any packaged chocolate chip cookie. In fact, they're better than most I've tried. They're not dry and hard like a lot of packaged cookies. I highly recommend them.

review/summary: These cookies make going gluten free a bit easier.
review/text: I am at the beginning of my gluten free journey and have largely been dismayed by the taste of most gluten free foods purchased to date. But these cookies are AWESOME!  I love the strong gingery flavor and while they feel quite hard to the touch, once you put them  in your mouth and chew, they break apart very easily and practically melt in your mouth. I wanted to eat the whole bag during the first sitting and enjoyed them so much that I nibbled on them throughout the day until the bag was empty.  YUMMY!<br /><br />I didn't order these through Amazon, I purchased them at my local supermarket.  I always worry about the age of mail-ordered food and the conditions in which they were stored.  Plus, I can see that given the hardness of these cookies, if shipped they probably would be mostly crumbs upon arrival.

review/summary: These don't really resemble chocolate chip cookies
review/text: I know allowances need to be made for being gluten free, since it's hard to get good texture and taste from gluten-free, but these chocolate chip cookies don't compare at all well with their namesakes.  There's a weird flavor that overwhelms everything else--not sure if it's the rice syrup or what, but whatever it is, that plus the texture which is pretty gritty and chalky at the end makes these cookies a one-time purchase.  They're so bad I'm throwing them out instead of eating them.  The gingersnaps are tolerable.  Not great, but definitely more edible than the chocolate chips.

review/summary: Pamela's Products Ginger Mini Snapz
review/text: I use Pamela's pancake mix and my family loves it, so I was eager to try her ready-made cookies as well. Have to be honest and say that I don't really care much for the Simplebites Ginger Mini Snapz. They are so HARD! Way beyond "crispy". I think part of the problem is they're just too thick. A thinner, wider cookie would have been better. On the plus side, though, they are very gingery.<br /><br />I'm going to try to soften them up a bit. And perhaps they'll be good as a pie or cheesecake crust, but just for snacking, no, I wouldn't recommend them. Now to think of what to do with the other 5 bags. :/

review/text: This is coming from a chocolate lover.  I ordered the "extreme chocolate" cookies thinking I was up for a challenge.  Well, they are good but not great.  I can't believe I'm saying this but the chocolate is actually overwhelming.  I'm saving the rest of the bags to make a chocolate crust for my cheesecake but I won't order this type again.  I do agree that it almost tastes like the top part of an oreo but with more intense taste.  My husband hated them and my 3 year old wasn't fond of it.  On the other hand, I have been ordering the chocolate chip flavored ones.  They are awesome!  It has a perfect balance and a hint of vanilla.  My family loves it and even my co-workers too!

review/summary: Tasty for a "cookie-free" cookie
review/text: I've been struggling with food intolerance lately, and by far the worst offender is sugar. Be that as it may, for some reason I don't have a problem with these cookies although they do contain sugar in the form of evaporated cane. They taste wonderful with just the right amount of spice and taste great dipped in coffee or milk if you can have that. I'd never know I was eating wheat-free gluten-free, or as my husband calls it, a "cookie-free cookie," had I not read the package first. I like ginger snaps to begin with, and these taste great. They are a bit larger than a quarter, are crisp rather than soft, and have 130 calories per 4-cookie serving. No trans fats; 10g sugar.

review/text: I have recently been put on a gluten free diet and have been nosing around at my local health food store for cookies that I could eat which did not contain wheat/gluten nor nuts/seeds.  I happened upon this bag of ginger snaps and was leary - I have not had much success in finding comparable substitutes for the real thing.<br /><br />These cookies blew me away!  They are crunchy, spicy, sweet and all around as close to "the real thing" as I have encountered in a long while!  I would recommend that you try just one bag first from your local health food store to see if it will work for you before committing to a case - but I LOVE them!
