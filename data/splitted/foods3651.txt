review/summary: Mixed feelings...
review/text: I originally tried this product because the "oil-free" caught my eye.<br />Having an acne prone skin, I thought this moisturizer would be perfect!<br />But after using this product a few times I noticed a few things...<br />CONS:<br />  -This product doesn't sink into your skin but rather stays on top and leaves your skin feeling oily and greasy.<br />  -My acne continued to break out, even more! :(<br />PROS:<br />  -Made my skin feel softer :)<br />  -Very long lasting, don't let the 3oz fool you!<br /><br />OVERALL: I stopped using this product after using about 1/4 of it. But hey, everyone has a different type of skin.<br />  If you feel that this moisturizer might be the one for you, go on and try it!

review/summary: Very nice..mild
review/text: Finally a product in a price range that I can say WoW about!If your looking for a product that delivers positive results that isnt 80 to 100$, I swear this is it. I have combo skin and some light scars around mouth/chin area from acne. The results Ive had from using this is diminished scars (not erased scars), clearer skin. It keeps there appearance down. However this product is mild if your just starting masks or have perfect skin already...recommended.

review/summary: Alba Toner - great for sensitive skin!
review/text: Love this product because I have rosecea on one side of my face and it is gentle enough for that buut strong enough to get rid of any remaining traces of makeup or oil, leaving a nice fresh feeling on the skin. Along with the price being very reasonable, you only use a little on a pad so the product goes a long way.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I purchased this product to use during a weight loss program, to eliminate unnessary oils in my body. I am very happy with this alba oil-free moisturizer. At my age "over 50" I wondered how well a moisturizer without oil would work. Surprisingly well. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I used it a few times as a body lotion as well; until I found something more practical.

review/summary: Great cleanser...but watch the eyes!
review/text: I have very sensetive skin (and very hard water!) so it's hard for me to find a cleanser that doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. Albas Pinapple face wash is gentle, cleans my face very well and has a wonderful, refreshing pineapple scent to it. A small amount worked into a lather in your hands will do the job. Why only 4 stars? It's VERY thick and needs a little extra time to wash off. I've opened my eyes in the shower a few times thinking this was rinsed clean only to find excess pineapple enzyme wash in my eyes...and it stings! This is the only face wash I've used like that which is very odd. I attribute it to its thick texture and the fact that I have very hard water. Be careful with this! Make sure it's rinsed really really well before you open up your eyeballs. Other than that, it's a great product and my favorite facial cleanser :)

review/summary: Green Tea Moisturizer
review/text: Feels great on my skin. The only thing about it that bothers me at all is the smell. It's not a bad smell and it's not that strong but I'm pretty sensitive to scents. It probably wouldn't bother most people at all but you might want to be aware if you have allergies or are really sensitive to smells.  I only mention it because I suffer from migraines and scents can be a trigger for me. The product works wonderful for my skin and I love the way green tea makes my skin feel so refreshed.

review/summary: Alba face cream
review/text: I have always like Alba brand products from the standpoint that they use plant-based ingredients which are far better for the skin than the other more expensive brands found at Macy's and the like. One only needs to use about a peas-size for the face as it can be a bit oily. Overall, it's a good product that I can use right before applying my make-up and use again after washing my face. This jar will last me quite awhile, so I can appreciate that. Pleasant smell too, not overwhelming with fragrance like most facial creams.

review/summary: the best lip balm on the market hands down
review/text: I love this lip balm and have been using it for around 10 years. It is the only lip balm that thoroughly quenches my dry lips and doesnt taste like soap! Inevitably some lip balm is going to get inside the mouth when using it, and this is fine as it tastes like coconut which I love! Not only that but the ingredients are safe - its not loaded up with chemicals like most.  Its the perfect lip balm and I hope it never gets discontinued.... I simply cant go without it, and have never found a lip balm as awesome as this one!

review/summary: It's alright
review/text: It smells nice, and has a thick consistency, but rather than call it a scrub, I'd call it a cleanser ; the particles meant to be scrubbing your face aren't big enough to do much scrubbing; if you want a very,very,very gentle scrub then this may be for you, but for those of you who have used the St.Ives Apricot scrub, and want something more effective then you should look elsewhere. On the plus side, it is partially organic, and natural, and as I mentioned earlier it smells nice. I just saw a review about how it smelled like rotten pineapples, and how it caused a pimple outbreak on the reviewer-I'm guessing it was either expired, or had gone bad so don't let that scare you away from trying it-you might like it. As for me,I need something with bigger particles so maybe I'll just do a homemade scrub with sugar-or better yet, I can add a little sugar to the scrub to make it more effective. Oh, and before I forget, my face did look a little brighter after I used the scrub. It isn't allthat bad, but it's just not what I was looking for in a scrub.

My giving of only 2 stars for this product is due to the fact that, as a jam, it was very much too thick.  Cranberries have so much natural pectin that adding more was a big mistake.

review/text: Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel. It's not as good as freshly made espresso but it's not bad at all. I do prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo cappucino</a> as a treat.

review/text: This are NOT white chocolate chips since they don't contain any cocoa butter in them, that's why they're labeled "Classic White" instead of "White chocolate".

review/summary: Ghirardelli changed the ingredients and the product name
review/text: I used to buy Ghirardelli white chips specifically because they were the only ones that I could find that contained cocoa butter.  A few years back they changed the formulation to not include white chocolate/cocoa butter, and removed the word "chocolate" from the product name (Amazon needs to update their title too).  Recently I was able to find "real" white chocolate chunks (not chips) at Whole Foods and I buy them for my cookies instead now.  Ghirardelli, if you are listening, the only reason I bought your brand instead of your competitors is because you used to use cocoa butter in your white chips.  The White chocolate chips are what introduced me to your brand and now I buy your baking bars, your milk and semi sweet chocolate chips, your candy, your hot cocoa and more - easily spending $200+ annually on Ghirardelli products.  If these chips were on the market without cocoa butter 8 years ago, I wouldn't be buying anything from your brand today.  Please reverse the bad corporate decision that was made and restore cocoa butter to this product.  Having no cocoa butter in your white chips changes your image from a premium brand to just a regular brand.

review/summary: Subpar Taste
review/text: I bought these chips elsewhere, and not from Amazon.  Once I opened the package to taste them, I was very disappointed.  Ghirardelli chocolates aren't the most expensive out there, but not cheap either, so I was surprised by the subpar taste.  It tastes like powdered milk, and definitely not very smooth, either.  I thought that I had accidentally grabbed a bag that was past its expiration date or that I had left the bag sitting out in summer heat, but there was nothing that I had done wrong.  After I did an online search to see what others had to say about about these chips, I found that I was not the only one who did not like these.  Sure, they may be all natural, but for about $5 a bag, I would probably settle for Toll House morsels for a bit less if I didn't have any other choice.<br /><br />Next time, I will have to make sure that the next bag of white chocolate chips I buy contains cocoa butter, which these do not.  Cocoa butter really makes all the difference, and if you're aiming to bake gourmet quality goods with white chocolate, you might want to pass on these.

review/summary: Think butterfinger layers with Baby Ruth taste.
review/text: Baby Ruths have always been one of my favorite American chocolate bars, so when I saw this crisp bar I figured I would give it a try, well I am glad I did it has that Baby Ruth taste, but also a bit of Butterfinger stemming from the crisp layers.  I also like that the bar comes in two pieces rather than one whole bar, this makes it a little easier to only eat a half and put the other piece down for later or share with a friend. As far as what kids might think well  I included somet in our child's soccer team's end of the game treat bag  as the sweet item.  Let me just say that wow,  they weere a big hit with parents and kids asking about them.  I only hope Amazon puts them on sale again.

review/text: I enjoyed these a lot, but they aren't an improvement on the real Baby Ruth.  I found both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013TO440">Butterfinger Crisp Candy Bar, 5.64-Ounce Snack Tray (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013TR8R0">Nestle Crunch Crisp Candy Bar, 5.36-Ounce Snack Tray (Pack of 24)</a> to be better than the original, but these are missing the nougat so they don't exactly taste like a Baby Ruth.  They are still very delicious, but again it is missing something.  The crispy wafers are layered in chocolate with peanuts and carmel on top to make a great treat.  They are two smaller bars per package, so you could be good and just eat one, though I can't see why you would.

review/summary: Maltodextrin impacts blood sugar!
review/text: Please note that Sweet 'n Low sugar free frostings are "sugar free." However, if you're diabetic, you are going to ingest something that has a higher impact on raising your blood glucose than does a regular sugared frosting! Maltodextrin is the first ingredient listed on Sweet 'n Low frostings. Athletes use maltodextrin in energy drinks and foods to give them a *BURST* of glucose. My diabetic family members' postprandial glucometer readings were incredibly high after eating this. I've written the company about the impact of their product & to stop touting it as a "must for diabetics," but they never responded. PLEASE, please, please realize that if you're a diabetic, eating maltodextrin is worse than eating sugar as it has a quick, rising impact on blood sugar--unhealthy for diabetics. It's your job as a consumer to be informed. I hope this helps diabetics out there who are enjoying this product not testing afterwards to see their blood glucose skyrocket.

review/summary: Ohhh ick!
review/text: This frosting is sweet, and it is low in calories.  Whenever I come across the term &quot;cloying&quot; I think of this frosting.  It is sweet and sticky and has an obvious chemical taste.  I also have had difficulty obtaining a frosting like consistency.  I enjoy using the Sweet 'N Low cake mixes so the first few times I used this product I assumed I had not followed the directions properly. (Okay, so the directions were basically to add water and beat.)  If you have to have sugar free frosting on your cake I suggest using the Sans Sucre brand dessert mousse mix and spreading it quickly on the cake as you would a whipped frosting.

review/text: I had gastric bypass surgery last year and I am not able to eat sugar.  In fact, there are very few "sweets" that I am able to indulge in at all. This frosting reminds me of the butter cream signature icing that my favorite bakery has!  All you have to do is add very cold water and beat it for five minutes.  I use the power boost button I have on my hand mixer at the highest speed and it works perfectly.  The final product is extremely thick, smooth, and creamy.  I highly recommend this frosting!

review/text: There are many diabetics in my family, so I like to prepare sugar-free desserts.  ALL my family members who are diabetic (my mother, 2 brothers, my son, etc.) have eaten my sweet,N Low cakes AND frosting with NO elevation of their blood sugar (which they monitor closely). They love the taste and so do I. I'm not diabetic, but I still limit my sugar intake for weight reduction and it's healthier. I like the vanilla frosting and chocolate cake mix the most. As with anything you eat, MODERATION is the key (although it tastes so good it's easy to over-indulge).  It works for us!!!!

review/summary: A Big Disappointment!
review/text: The title I have chosen for my review pretty much says it all.  I was expecting the item shown in the picture, however the mints that I received weren't white (as pictured) but instead a butter-yellow color, which made even wanting to taste them unappealing.  I thought that because they were yellow instead of white that they must be OLD.  I checked the date on the package and was pleasantly surprised to see that they were indeed reasonably, "supposedly" fresh stock.  Next came the disappointing TASTE test.  It too was a failure!  Where was that MINTY taste I was hoping for, when I placed my order?  The worst part is that when I finally got around to complaining or "attempting" to return the disappointing mints - the time to do so had expired 5 days ago. Keep this in mind - if you are not happy with the product, DO NOT procrastinate in sending the item back. Do it right away so this doesn't happen to you. My review: Appearance=POOR, Taste=POOR.

It does taste good... but calling it 'spicy' is a HUGE stretch, it is probably only 10-20% as spicy as regular Tabasco or Sriracha at best.

So, after a long day at work, I found myself rinsing and inspecting cans of cat food.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. At least there is turkey in it, but other than that its all nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Other Friskies flavors are even worse than this one. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

review/summary: Good Cat Food
review/text: My cats love this food, and it is much better than dry food.  Several things to note about the poultry platter:  it has turkey as its first ingredient, it is very high in protein content, it is very low in carb content, and it does not contain corn, wheat gluten, or soy products.  Yes, meat or poultry by-products are not as good as regular muscle meat, but what do you think the guts, brains, and eyes are of a cat's natural prey?  Not everyone can afford Wellness or Evo (3-4 times as expensive as Friskies) and even many of the more expensive brands have a higher carb content than Friskies pate or use vegetable products (for example peas) to raise their protein numbers.  This product certainly should be considered in a food rotation for someone who wants to feed their cats something other than kibble and is on a budget.

review/summary: Mediocre Candy, But a step in the right direction. I refuse to call it "Healthy"
review/text: I did a little research about these candies because I was invited to try them free. On their website you're able to compare a bag of Peanut M&M's, their #54's, and an Orange.. (or compare regular M&M's to the #41's in this review, and fruit). I was glad to see the list that they don't use partially hydrogenated oils (Trans Fats)...which I strictly ban in our house (but so do most candies nowadays, Corn Syrup is not a big priority for me as I don't consume much of it (and candy is a rare treat), ....GMOs (i'm not sure if the M&M's do (the side by side comparison should have shown us what they were up against. What I didn't like was that they failed to mention the saturated fat (which is at least around 3-4 grams...), AND the threw fresh fruit into the comparison. Why are you comparing candy and fresh fruit? This makes consumers think that your product is "Healthy" when in fact it is still candy, and should still be enjoyed in moderation, like all sweets that are heavy in fats, saturated fats, and sugars.<br /><br />Also, the #41 candy mentioned was 8 grams less per bag, which makes up for some of the lower amount in calories per bag, among other things. I'm glad to see the lower amount of overall sugar, which is a plus. But really, as someone who has struggled with weight all their life, this is still candy, not health-food. Moderation is key, regardless of GMO's, or high-fructose corn syrups.<br /><br />As a taste test, my husband and I decided to start with the #54's first. Ultimately these became our favorite. But we only each had a couple pieces and decided to call it quits. The #41's were fine. We just didn't feel like the candy was worth finishing. And we didn't finish it. This candy might satisfy someones sweet tooth, but if i'm looking for a sweet treat, I know plenty of other things worth the splurge!<br /><br />Please, please, please Unreal, stop comparing your candy to fresh fruit!! :)

review/text: A while back, I ordered one of each of every tea-tree foot/body powder I could find, to try them all out. I was looking for a natural alternative to the various anti-fungal medicated powders I'd been using for athletes-foot and jock-itch.<br /><br />On first glance I was unimpressed by this product. It's rather plain looking, and the label is even kinda wrinkled up like it was badly glued onto the cardboard tube.<br />HOWEVER, after evaluating all of the powders, this one is BY FAR my favorite one!<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice is that it doesn't poof clouds of powder everywhere. Secondly, it has a pleasant tea-tree oil scent - not too strong - just right. It does an excellent job of cooling, relieving itch, and healing and preventing chafing.<br /><br />It is labeled as foot powder, and it does that job well, but it's great for an allover body powder - not too strong even for the "sensitive" areas!

review/text: Usually I skip writing reviews for my purchases, but this time I was really impressed by the great service.<br />I've ordered this tea as a Christmas gift for my mom, I've paid standart shipping and recieved my package the next day of my order.<br />I found it really cute that the sticker on the packaging said "Hand Blend Irina" ( Irina being my mom's name)<br />I haven't tried the tea yet, but it passed the sniff test, and it has real black currant berries and leafs in it.<br />Lately it was really hard to find Black Currant loose leaf black tea, and I was really glad to find this seller who has it and provides such a wonderful service.<br />Great Job!!!

review/summary: Our dogs like it
review/text: We've made the switch from Sojo's (oat based) to Honest Kitchen. We've got two dogs 40lbs & 61lbs so these 10lb boxes of food don't last too long. Also it doesn't mix the same as the other flavors (chicken, fish, plain), maybe because the beef flavor is almost a powder comparatively. Anyways, the dogs slop it up just the same. We add other vitamins and nutrients in with the mix so they get the broad spectrum. We also add a 1/4 cup of regular kibble (Blue Buffalo) just to make it go a little farther and bigger in their stomach so they're aren't whining for food in a couple hours.<br /><br />We also buy from a local shop because their price is spot on, plus it's good to help the local places.

review/summary: Good food - best price I've found
review/text: Amazon had the best price for Honest Kitchen dog food.  We were recommended to try this food because our dog has allergies.  The food was gobbled up quickly, but unfortunately didn't have much affect on the allergies over time.  We've since switched to another food for the next several months, and will hope to see a change.  But Honest Kitchen is good food, human grade quality (but made for dogs) - and the ratings with most dog food rating companies show this food is very highly rated.

review/text: This almond paste is a great product, it just that there is a lot of it.  I wish they would produce a 1 or 2 pound can.  One good thing is we can make a lot of almond cookies with it.<br /><br />The paste works well in recipes and turns out without being gritty which was a problem trying to make our own past.  Good flavor and no noticeable difference in finished product from home made.  this will work with just about any recipe that calls for almonds in a paste or even in some cases a powder form.

review/summary: A life saver!
review/text: People who are used to our typical American high-salt diet would complain as did another reviewer,<br />because what they don't recognize is that to them, ketchup tastes like SALT, and so does much of the rest of their diets.<br /><br />As you reduce your salt intake, you become more sensitive to the taste and actually need much less for food to taste good.  In other words, you begin to be able to actually TASTE again, instead of having over-loaded salt-burn-out taste buds.  And you become more healthy.<br /><br />This product is a lifesaver for my husband, who has been placed on a very restricted diet.  Millions in America are going to be forced into this postion because so much of what they eat is fat, salt, sugar and corn syrup.  Keep this up, and you end up having NO ketchup, mustard, gravy, sauces of any kind including tomato, etc.  Everything is just straight up plain and boring.  This ketchup is one of the very few things that work (this product, and Kens Honey Mustard (regular version) which has only 130 mg sodium in a serving instead of 270 and up like most dressings.)

review/text: You know that first sip of coffee you take? You can feel the warm liquid go all the way down. There's nothing like it. I loved flavored coffee but do not like hazelnut. I cannot find french vanilla decaf in any store. I got a Keurig for Christmas and I can now drink french vanilla decaf in the evening. I love me some coffee! Beware of of Amazon selling it as a pack of two. It's cheaper to buy two individually (2 units) than it is to buy together (one unit). My only "complaint" is that this only comes in a light roast. I prefer full, deep bodied coffee but I will take what I can get in decaf for evenings.

review/text: I'm not a big fan of decaf anything but I decided since I had been so happy with the Green Mountain French Vanilla "Real" Coffee then I would give the decaf a try.  I really rather enjoy it so at night I have switched over to decaf, makes my wife happier with me and I probably do sleep better.<br /><br />I find the Green Mountain to be very smooth and the French Vanilla has just enough flavoring to add some interest.  I drink mine black so I don't add any flavored cream or anything.<br /><br />I know it's psychological but I still prefer the real coffee, but as decaf goes this has been among the best I've had.

review/text: I'm a vegetarian that likes real food that tastes good.  I found this along with the No Chicken base a few years ago and love it.  We use it in our cooking all the time.  It is great with chili and fake meat or really anything that uses fake meat that you want to taste a little bit more beefy.  I make a variety of different soups with it too and my meat eating friends say it tastes very authentic.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for a vegan alternative for those who still want that "meat" taste in their meals, particularly in their soups

review/summary: Beautifully packaged gift item!
review/text: I purchased this item to give as a gift.  I was a little wary of purchasing based on the photo alone, but when I received this item, I was extremely pleased.  First, the item comes shipped in its own ready-to-ship Amazon box; if needed, you can simply apply a label and ship to your recipient.  I wanted to view the product itself, however, so I opened the box.  Inside, the individual food items were neatly arranged on the cutting board, with the cheese knife placed across the top.  The entire thing was wrapped in plastic to hold it together and then encircled by a very nice quality red bow accented with gold.  This excellent presentation definitely makes this product a gift I am proud to give!  Since my recipients have not yet received the item (it's a Christmas gift), I can't say anything about the quality of the food products that are included, but I will try to update my review with more details.  Based on appearance alone, however, I would definitely recommend this product.

review/text: I'm glad I didn't actually gift this to someone.  The food was mediocre at best and the cutting board split right in half.

review/text: This gift package surprised me when it arrived.  The little cutting board was the perfect size for its intended use.  The food products were of very good quality and just the perfect portions for a great snack time. I was very happy to give this as a gift to a relative who has everything, but enjoys good food.  It arrived in quickly and in perfect condition.
