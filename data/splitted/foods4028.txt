review/text: We love these buns. They should be toasted for the best taste  but they are by far the BEST G/F, C/F, Soy Free, Egg Free bun we have tried (and we have tried alot!)<br />I purchase them by the case thru Amazon. Free shipping and because of the way they are vaccuum packed, they have in incredibly long shelf life (6 months to a year!!! SERIOUSLY !!!)<br />It is wonderful to be able to enjoy bread again!!!

review/summary: The gift of a real Hamburger
review/text: I gave these buns to my brother in law as a gift. My sister said his eyes were as big as the buns when he saw his first hamburger on a bun in years. They said the wrapping was difficult to open but it kept the buns quite fresh. They BOTH loved the taste and she's going to start shopping at Amazon for her gluten free products.

review/text: As with most of the reviews here my tins arrived with 75% or more of the wafers crushed. We ended up using a spoon to eat the crumbs of the 1st tin we opened. Outstandingly delicious but I cannot imagine serving these to guests as the chocolate had also melted and you cannot avoid getting chocolate on your fingers as you pick at the small remaining wafer tubes that are available. What a mess. If these had arrived whole they would get 5 stars instead of just 2.

review/summary: These Contain Milk
review/text: I bought these at a specialty store before ordering them from amazon.  They did not contain milk at that time.  I loved them, and decided to order a case.  Milk, as of the writing of this review, is still not listed as an ingredient on this website.  There are stickers over the ingredients, which include milk powder.  I called the company and was told the recipe had changed.  They were very nice and offered a refund.  Unfortunately, we opened one and ate some before I noticed the sticker.<br /><br />Even if you don't mind the milk, please be aware that they will arrive in crushed bits, not in wafer rolls.

review/summary: My Dog loves these treats
review/text: I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that loved the Busy Bone Chewbone treat. He has some separation anxiety and they can help keep him calm. It takes him about 15-20 minutes to eat but it is long enough for him to calm himself down. I just make sure he keeps it off white stuff. The red  center bleeds a little if he drops the wet side down or a piece gets broken off and falls on a light surface.  My dog will chew on one end then leave it if he gets distracted then come back and chew on the other end and the wet side dies surface he is on. I have been able to clean it out of stuff easily enough but it is a little bit of a annoying that I have to. I also wish they were cheaper.

review/summary: Another Product Ruined by Improvement
review/text: I was dismayed to find the "King Size" Snickers bars are now two small pieces with an anemic layer of chocolate, and half the flavor of the former King Size Snickers bar.  Always bought the king size; the chocolate was thicker and the whole thing just had more flavor, because it was loaded with peanuts and caramel. Really felt like you got your money's worth, which is becoming increasingly rare. Unfortunately, it appears Snickers has jumped on the bandwagon of charging more for less, and now is trying to pass off an inferior item as a "king size" candy bar, hoping the customers will play along. Another terrific product bites the dust.

I like convenience but not enough to pay out twelve additional dollars for it.

review/summary: Delicious Alternative to Regular Potato Chips
review/text: The Good Health Humbles product line of their Natural Products is an excellent, tasty, potato chip alternative for consumers interested in eating more consciously to maintain good health.  I tried a single bag, purchased at a natural foods co-op, before deciding to splurge the 12-pack offered here on Amazon.com, and I was deliciously impressed by the taste and flavor of these chips!  This line of all natural snacks offers three taste sensations: Sesame Garlic, Olive Oil Lemon & Feta, and Roasted Red Pepper, as offered here.<br /><br />As soon as I bit into one of these chips, I knew there was no going back to regular grocery store offerings.  As someone who is trying to improve my diet, while also leaving a little wiggle room for eating healthier versions of the foods I love, Good Health Humbles fits in nicely, offering me a snack with 60% less fat than ordinary potato chips, with no cholesterol, and 3 grams of protein per serving!  When a crunchy-food craving hits, this product is something you can feel good about eating.<br /><br />For those concerned specifically about the nutritional value, I assure you this line of products is a healthier choice than your typical bag of chips: with only 4 grams of fat per serving, and 120 calories with no saturated or trans fats, this product also offers 1 gram of fiber per serving, with a only a small amount of sugar (1 gram), and a low amount of sodium (125 mg).<br /><br />Amazon.com offers a great value on these products.  As compared to the Good Health Natural Products website, Amazon.com's price is a huge enticement to shop here, when you compare it to the $30.95 you would pay for the same order directly through the company.<br /><br />After trying multiple so-called "healthier" chip options, I feel I have finally found one I fill good about eating, even when I devour the whole bag in one sitting!  ***Warning - this is  a likely occurrence once you've tasted one of these chips!***

review/text: I had purchased these hummus chips, sesame garlic, at a health food store and loved the true flavor of garlic and sesame.  I purchased a whole case from amazon the next week.  They are not like the typical snack chip you find in the grocery store, the humbles brand is healthy yet has intense flavor, you can tell right away with the first taste that they don't have that heavy salty oily taste like some chips have. I will purchase these chips again.

review/text: My husband and I are big fans of hummus, so when we saw hummus chips we had to try them.  Little did we know they would become our favorite crunchy snack. The Olive oil, lemon, and feta combo is perfect - and amazing with dip, cheese, hummus, and just by themselves.<br /><br />Even better - eating a whole bag (as we often do) isn't even that bad for you.  We are both gastric bypass patients and this is something we can eat without feeling any guilt - we just enjoy it.<br /><br />In fact, we just finished off a bag of these delicious chips with a combination of sharp cheddar cheese and Greek yogurt ranch dip (another amazing guilt free alternative).<br /><br />Highly recommend giving it a try - you'll be hooked just as we are.

They are NOT that good for you. yeah, there's no saturated fat, or cholesterol, BUT, the serving size is 3 Chips, and in that serving size, theres 4 grams of fat, and 17 grams of carbs. So I might as well be eating Frito lay chips. They market it like its health food just because they are hummus, but it's just as fattening as potato chips. I probably would not buy again....

review/text: These chips are unlike any other similar ones that we've ever tried. For starters, they are generously seasoned and taste great! There's no hunting around in the bag for the seasoned ones because every chip in the bag tastes great. The texture is crispy and is more like a traditional fried chip than a baked one, in my opinion.<br /><br />Finally, I wanted to mention that my daughter and I have j-pouches and if you have one you know the struggle it is to find foods that work with the pouch. These chips are well tolerated by both of us and don't causes any of the usual problems that we experience with most other snack foods. So this may be one snack food you might want to try if you have a j-pouch.<br /><br />Yum!

review/text: Ugh, again ordered 12 pack of snack I never tasted, was hoping save time going to stores shopping for things like this, wanted to stock up, read all the great reviews figured I can't go wrong, but of course I ordered the weirdest sounding of the flavors, maybe I'd have been somewhat better off choosing the garlic whatever it was flavor than this one.  I tried eat a bag, now I don't touch em, another snack I've been contemplating bringing few with me whenever I go into city to see if homeless might want it rather than just throwing it out, at least for a snack it's on the healthier side.  But I'd kinda feel bad knowing it tastes bad, but if they're hungry they still might want it. I didn't like the crunch/texture of them, the taste, nothing really.  Just my honest opinion, I can't really say it would have been a lot different if it were one of the other flavors, but I don't think I want try them after not really even liking these a little bit. Maybe snacks can't really be too healthy and taste good.

review/text: There was no chocolate.  There were twelve bags in the order.  There were no pieces of any kind of chocolate in any of the bags.  There were raisins, but no chocolate.  Obviously these bags were factory seconds.  For shame Amazon.  Let the customer know they're getting the product that didn't pass quality control.

review/summary: absolutely delicious!!
review/text: I had tried this tea in the little sachets when I found it in a grocery store. Being able to buy it in bulk means I can enjoy it without spending a fortune! I put the tea in the kitchen at my office for convenience and all the women in the office started drinking it. We now have it on the "subscribe and save" plan for delivery every two months. The tea is not overpowering - the coconut is subtle, add just a hint of different flavor to a typical chai tea. Even people who don't like coconut like this tea. The whole tea is fairly mild, so if you like strong chai's this may not be the tea for you.

review/text: It's heavy on the cinnamon.  Sometimes I add a little black tea to make it more caffeinated. The taste is outrageously good.  It's just a hint of coconut despite the name.  Draw out the coconut flavor by drinking this with warm almond milk and a dollop of real maple syrup.  This is a nice afternoon or evening tea.  It's a bit fur-fru for first thing in the morning.

review/text: As the other reviewer pointed out, there is no coconut listed in the ingredients of this tea (not sure why the name?).  Thus the 4 stars, would be 5 but I think the name misleading.  "Does it taste like coconut?" (you might wonder), hard to say... but it is delicious!<br /><br />Previously a cream and sugar coffee drinker, I prefer this with just a bit of milk.  I now choose drinking this most days instead of coffee.

review/summary: Hard to find this product in the south!
review/text: I've been buying Cream of Wheat from Amazon for a while now because here in the south, where I live, you'll find an entire row dedicated to grits, and if you are lucky, one dusty overpriced box of Cream of Wheat.  The sad part about that is Cream of Wheat is much healthier for people than grits are.<br /><br />Cream of Wheat is so easy to cook, just boil some water and stir in some Cream of Wheat, stirring slowly for a minute or two.  A little goes a long way and you'll want to start with less Cream of Wheat, as it thickens when it cools.  I like it thick, but sometimes I make it too thick, and it's not palatable that way.<br /><br />I just put a bit of sugar on mine.  No milk and no butter.  A bowl of Cream of Wheat not only tastes good to me, but it fills me up, satisfies me, and keeps me full for hours.  I can't compare Cream of Wheat to any other kind of cereal.  It's just that good.  I have been eating it since I was a child and I'm 48 now, and will continue eating it!  An added bonus is that it is high in iron and also adds lots of fiber to your daily diet.  It's just the best!

review/summary: Good stuff, but NOT ready in 2 1/2 minutes!
review/text: I recently switched from the original to the whole grain version of this product. This cereal is just as good if not better due to the increased nutritional value, however it does NOT take 2 1/2 minutes to cook like the original refined grain version. This stuff takes a good 7-8 minutes to reach desired consistency, and thus burns to the bottom of the pan even if using super low heat. This won't keep me from going back to the original refined grain version though. I'll deal with the longer cook time and such to obtain this healthier version. When fully cooked, I cannot tell one from the other.

review/summary: Lower glycemic index = better for you
review/text: I'm on a diet and a couple of tablespoons of Cream of Wheat is pretty low in calories and filling.  I make mine in low sodium chicken broth or homemade when I have it.<br /><br />In comparison to regular Cream of Wheat, this whole grain product should have a lower glycemic index and be healthier for you.  I can't tell any difference in the taste as compared to the bleached version.  This is a new product that I will regularly stock in my pantry.<br /><br />My 24 hour chicken broth recipe is:<br />  1) 2 lbs chicken bones with some meat.  Roast in the oven first if you want a richer broth.<br />  2) 1 large onion<br />  3) 3 carrots<br />  4) 2 stalks celery<br />  5) 2 fresh bay leaves<br />  6) 1 tbs corriander seed, 1 tsp peppercorns, fresh thyme, fresh rosemary, fresh dill<br />  7) sea salt to taste after cooking<br /><br />Bring to boil and reduce to low simmer for 24 hours.  Add water as necessary.  Strin through cheese cloth or a fine mesh strainer.

review/text: I was sceptical about these, but my sister brought me home a pack from Germany. Fake banana is not one of my favorite flavors, in fact, I have to pick out the banana pieces from Runts or it makes me gag.  Still, I tried one of these.  The first was decent, the second was good, and before I knew it I was halfway through the bag.  It's not really a banana flavor per se, more tangy fruit with just a hint of banana. Delightful actually, and the texture is great, just chewy enough, but also with a tad bit of crunch.  Like the circus peanuts, but better.  enjoy!

review/text: This spicy tomato rasam style soup is a pleasant change from bland canned soups.  The MTR line of soups in shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality and this one is my favorite.  It is made with typical Indian spices and definitely scratches the itch for the flavor of Indian food.<br /><br />I make it with water as directed without milk but enjoy a dollop of sour cream and chopped scallions on top.  It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the paste, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, red gram dal (red lentils), salt, tamarind, coconut, coriander, edible starch, red chilli, ghee (clarified butter), cumin, fenugreek, jaggery (raw palm sugar), mustard, coriander leaves, curry leaves, turmeric and asafoetida.<br /><br />The spices are authentic and sometimes I have found a whole curry leaf in the paste.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian but not vegan as it contains ghee.  Note that the label indicates five servings per packet but two or three is much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup.  Note that the nutrition information is for 5 servings per container, which would be a little over half a cup per serving which is not realistic.<br /><br />Calories 45<br />Calories from fat 15<br />Total fat 1.5g<br />Saturated fat 0.5g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol less than 5mg<br />Sodium 900mg<br />Total carbohydrate 6g<br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br />Sugars 0g<br />Protein 2g<br />Vitamin A 2%<br />Vitamin C 4%<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 4%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 4.5g of sodium.

review/summary: The perfect sugar-free treat for kids
review/text: I must warn you that I'm one of those moms who is constantly wiping off their kids' hands and faces. I don't do sticky, or messy, or drippy. So this was hard for me. But I gave in to the begging and pleading of my children and sat them down at the table (work with me here) for a yummy little treat. My oldest son loves Ring Pops, but this was a first for my 3 year old. Both of my boys gobbled up their Sugar Free Ring Pops, slurping all the way. And my oldest, who can usually tell when something tastes different, didn't even notice they were sugar free!

review/summary: my favorite tea
review/text: I love tea and I drink at least 8 cups a day of various teas. I really like the flavor of this tea. I have tried other Bonkers teas and none compare to this Ginger Peach. It tastes so natural with no artificial flavor at all. I cannot taste the ginger but only sweet peach. It curbs my appetite and it tastes so good I love it! It never leaves me with a caffeine buzz nor does it dry out my mouth like green tea can. Combine this tea with 3 ballerina slim capsules and you have the perfect diet aides. Highly recommended except for the price.

review/summary: Amazingly, this actually seems to effectively curb appetite
review/text: I recently began drinking this tea. First, I was surprised that it tastes good. Most teas that are supposed to have health benefits don't taste all that great. But I am finding this tea to be very appealing. I like drinking it. I like it hot (plain), I like it hot with milk and honey, and I like it iced.<br /><br />Second, while not a miracle appetite suppressant, I am certainly noticing a reduction in my appetite, which is making it easier for me to stick to my diet. Yay!<br /><br />I've experienced no side effects (that I have experienced with other so-called "diet" teas in the past). It has had no laxative effect, and has not caused stomach upset, has not caused me to have difficulty getting to sleep after drinking it in the evening, and I have not had any major caffeine buzz related to drinking it.<br /><br />I'm drinking two or three cups per day.  I'm not being particularly careful about drinking it 20 minutes before each meal as the instructions suggest. Rather I just drink it when I feel like having a hot or cold beverage, and that is working out well.<br /><br />After limited but successful use, I can recommend this tea as useful for appetite management.

review/summary: A Really Great Old Product
review/text: My grandmother taught me how to make her locally famous fried chicken.  Her secret? Dixie Fry.  Like most people, I'd stopped frying my own chicken and resorted to take-out.  I hadn't seen Dixie Fry in the market for years and years.  Then one day as I bit into a piece of take-out and was squirted in the cheek by a stream of grease, I thought about how delicious home made fried chicken used to be.  I knew that if Dixie Fry was still available, it would be at Amazon.  I looked, and there it was.<br />The following weekend the whole family was coming over for dinner.  I bought three fresh chickens and fried them in Dixie Fry.  You should have heard the mmmms and ahhhs.  Some of these kids had never had home made chicken with gravy over real mashed potatos.  There wasn't a crumb or a drop left.  Try this product.  Sure it's a little more trouble than the drive-through window, but you're family will make you feel like a genius, and what's that worth?<br />Gabrielle

review/summary: With this seasoned coating, it can't get any better
review/text: Dixie Fry is a seasoned coating mix that I have been using for over 15 years. I was looking for something different for coating my pork chops instead of using the Shake 'n Bake mix. I saw this product, read that it was good for coating not only pork chops but also chicken and fish. I decided to purchase a box on a trial basis. My family became hooked on Dixie Fry immediately. My husband and I have not changed up on the coating mix. We love the crunchiness texture on the pork, chicken and fish. It also has the right amount of seasonings. We would not buy any other seasoned coating mix, but this one - the best in the market.

review/text: A few years ago I happened on to Dixie Fry in my local grocery store here in So. Cal.  Gave it a try and my family went nuts!!!  "The best fried chicken I ever tasted" was what my daughter-in-law said.  I made a batch for 4th of July, fed 7 adults and 6 kids.  They all loved it.<br /><br />FYI, I think it is cheaper in the local stores than what I have seen on the web. I used 5 packets, so I need to restock.

Her secret which is no secret anymore is Dixie Fry.<br /><br />We visited Cali last August and I forgot to buy some. Thank goodness my mother in law put 2 boxes in our going back home goody bags.<br /><br />I've tried all different ways of frying and baking chickens, Dixie Fry chicken is one of my fav recipes.<br /><br />I am really contemplating now to order this outside Amazon.

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

I started with juice since it's a regular in her hands outside of her favorite ice cold water bottle. She took one sip and said it was gross. She didn't even get half way through the juice pouch. I took it and tasted it later and it tasted like they started with a spit of juice and added so much water to it that the taste was unrecognizable. No sweetness, no flavor, just gross.

review/summary: Don't go by me -- I don't eat red meat or poultry --
review/text: ...I bought these because Amazon was running a "buy $59, get $25 off sale" -- which made these Jack Link products cheaper than the geletan-bound pre-fab dog treats available at the pet store.  About 1/2 the price per ounce, actually.<br /><br />And of course the pups think they've been run over by the "Good Dog Truck."  Before you write angry rebuttals telling me how these are not good for dogs, let me assure you they really are "treats" for especially good (and sometimes rare) behavior-- and I snip each stick into button-sized rounds with my kitchen shears so they go a long way.<br /><br />It's the smell that gets them.  Actual meat that was once on an animal.  Mmmmmm-mmm-mmmm.<br /><br />And for me -- like walking by a bakery.  The smell is more than enough, thanks.

review/summary: Great Organic Flour!!
review/text: This flour is phenomenal!  I purchased this variety as well as the oat bread flour and the seven grain bread flour.  I have had no problem with any of them that were not  baker related.  I followed previous advice from another review and divided the 25 lb bag into 5lb gallon freezer bags and it works great.  Make sure you do that with any flour you won't use in a few weeks to a month because the fat in whole grains can go rancid and and make your flour taste funny.  I make sandwich loaves (13x4x4) with pan de mie loaf pans for my children and this flour comes through every time!  The wheat in particular is very smooth and makes a great textured bread and my children have never complained like they did with store bought wheat bread.  I very often combine wheat with either the seven grain or the oat for a little texture, depending on what flavor of bread I'm making.  This was the best purchase I put on subscribe and save.  I jumped right in and purchased a 25lb bag my first try and it has worked for my family but if you are skeptical, try a smaller bag, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

So far I've made a whole wheat with flax and sun flower seeds and a honey-oatmeal whole wheat. Both are absolutely delicious! The loaves bake up big and beautiful with a wonderful texture.  They are light, not at all dense and  slightly chewy with a very pleasing flavor, no bitterness at all.  I don't think I will ever buy bread at the store again!  I bought the 25 lb bag and transferred to huge gallon+ size spice containers that I got at work and store in my freezer.  I will definately buy this again!

review/summary: Miserable in a bread machine, unless you blend it.
review/text: If you have a bread machine, and use this by itself as the flour, you'll end up with a bread that rises poorly, and would be turned down by a goat.<br /><br />I tried adding more molasses, adding more water, adding more yeast, adding sugar, using less wheat flour and all combinations of these.  It's still a brick.  Just awful, but my chickens don't seem to mind it.  In fact they like it.  They like bugs too though ...<br /><br />Outside of feeding this to my chickens, the only way I could make it palatable was to cut it with other flour.  If you use it at 50/50, it comes out really good.  Even 2-1 favoring the wheat flour lightens it up enough so that if you like a heavy bread, it's excellent.<br /><br />I'm going to try vital wheat gluten next to see if that helps this bread.  If I remember, I'll update the review at that time with whether it works well or not.

review/text: I've taken to making our own bread with my bread maker and i had  great recipe but using regular whole wheat flour just wasnt making great bread. I have had trouble finding whole wheat bread flour in any of my local grocery stores including places like sprouts so when I found this I was really excited! Not only is it ORGANIC nd whole wheat bread flour but it's a very decent price. I've made SEVERAL loafs of bread and have barely even used up a 4th of the bag. It really fixed the issues I was having with my whole wheat bread being too dense and not tasting very good. This makes fantastic whole wheat bread that's not too dense and doesn't have an over powering flavor but a very good one. I will definitely be using this flour for my bread making from now on. =)

review/summary: Great Bread Flour
review/text: This ww bread flour makes a loaf that is much moister that I got with my other regular whole wheat flours. Now, I just need a way to make it rise up a bit more so it isn't so dense. That is not a complaint about the flour, though, since that is the nature of ww bread.  I am VERY happy with it, and look forward to continuing to use it in my kitchen.  I ordered this item, the whole wheat pastry flour, and the organic cornmeal, all from Great River.  The two flours are replacing my King Arthur White Whole wheat that I used to buy so much of at my local grocery.  The flavor of these flours is definitely superior to the KA (which I also liked).  But now, I know I am feeding my family organic.

review/summary: This is my go-to bread flour
review/text: Love this flour!<br /><br />I still use some white bread flour. But I've been reworking a lot of my recipes, adding a bit more vital wheat gluten and water/liquids so that I can use more of this wonderful healthy flour instead. Usually, I swap the ratios, so that I use more whole wheat bread flour and less white. And the bread is even more delicious.<br /><br />This flour really can't be beat. I store some in ziploc bags in the freezer and I use  food-grade plastic dog food kibble holders that seal air tight -- which  Amazon also sells -- to store the rest in my pantry. While we can't let whole grain flour sit around for months and months and months, I haven't had any problem with my various whole grain Great River Organic Milling flours going rancid storing them this way.

review/summary: help with bread problems with this flour
review/text: I need an advice because my bread, that I make with the bread machine, dosen't rise and its very hard and horrible after using this flour.<br />I did 100% whole wheat bread before with the same machine and different bread flour with excellent results so it is a little bit of a mystery. Any suggestions? THANKS

review/summary: The Sweet Stuff
review/text: In so many ways, this is a really good jerky: low in fat from the buffalo, a nicely thick natural slab cut, slightly moist so that it has a nice bite without the toughness of leather, and a sufficiently peppery kick from a nice black pepper crust. Plus the assurance of no hormones, preservatives, or msg as shouted on the big green sticker on the package. The quality is there, no doubt.<br /><br />So what's wrong with it? It's right there, second on the list of ingredients -- SUGAR! This jerky is too sweet! I ordered the Peppered flavor and I was expecting a savory treat, a nice snack for the afternoons. Instead, this stuff is as sweet as maple syrup and not really what I wanted.<br /><br />Too bad, as I'm now stuck with 8 of these packages. For now, I'm going back to the SnackMasters brand. The quality is not as good but the flavor is many times better.

review/summary: Good quality - good taste
review/text: I was a little wary about ordering jerky off the internet since I have never tried this brand before.  Not to worry, this buffalo jerky is good quality and tastes great.  I will be ordering this again.
