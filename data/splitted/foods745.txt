review/text: This pre-ground coffee's roast date was two months old when it arrived. It tasted stale, nothing like the rich, fresh taste of the beans I'd purchased at the coffee bar in Venice Beach. I see another reviewer complained about the same thing. What's up Intelligentsia, using mail order to "move" your older product??  Well, I won't be duped twice, I can tell ya that! :(((

review/summary: amazon needs to ship based on roast date
review/text: I have been buying this coffee for a couple years and love it.  Recently I started buying from amazon for convenience.  One thing that I have noticed is one week I will get a package that was roasted January 30.  The next order will be January 30.  And then the next order (received March 30) was roasted on January 16th.  Since this is ground coffee some people would say we have crossed the line on freshness.<br /><br />The coffee is still great but shipping first-in, first-out is something to strive for on items that have shelf lives.<br /><br />Adding to my review:<br /><br />I just received my April 30th shipment of two bags of Black Cat.  One bag has a roast date of 2/23/12 and the other was roasted on 1/16/12.  Based on this new information it is clear that amazon has no system to ship based on first-in, first-out or they are buying spot market unsold coffee to sell at full retail price in a venue they call Grocery & Gourmet Food.<br /><br />I love amazon, so it concerns me that they cannot manage something as simple as Grocery & Gourmet Food.  My next stop is Intelligentsia to see what they think about ground coffee that is roasted in January and sold to become a cup of coffee in May.<br /><br />One more addition:<br /><br />I finally got the answer - the coffee is roasted for espresso - when it passes the acceptable date to be ground for a good espresso they grind it for drip and sell it via amazon.

review/text: The herb in this tea is VERY strong...so if you are sensitive this is not for you. If, however, you have trouble going to the bathroom regularly, this is amazing. I was too sensitive to take it...I was in the bathroom right away...so I gave it to a friend and it is the only thing that she has ever tried that has worked on her constipation. Not sure how good it is for dieting, but I bet if your body can tolerate it, it would work well.

review/summary: After comparing half a dozen, this is one of my faves
review/text: I first encountered Balsamic Cream in England a few years ago. When I was in Italy March 2008, I bought Mazzetti Balsamico Cremoso at a grocery store, which was wonderful and reasonably priced. Earlier this year I bought a couple varieties on Amazon, and I just bought a few more for holiday gifts, not all of which are making the cut! Here are my personal views of the ones I bought:<br /><br />#1 Casa Rinaldi Crema di Balsamico Blanco (white). This is not the dark Balsamic Cream I have had before, but of all the ones I've now tasted, this is my favorite. It is the perfect balance of vinegar and sweet, the texture is thick, but the flavor is light. Wonderful! ($11.95 for 8 oz from [...])<br /><br />#2 De Negris Balsamico Glaze - also a great flavor, balancing vinegar and sweet, but much thinner texture. Fine for dipping bread etc. ($11/7.3 oz) ($10/13.5 oz on Amazon)<br /><br />#3 (this product) Da Magreta Acetaia Real Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modena (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena): second best flavor and thicker ($23/16.9 oz)<br /><br />#4 Modenaceti Balsamic Gkaze: thicker, good flavor, but more grapey than the others above. (3x13.5oz for $28)<br /><br />I also tasted Earthy Delights, which was thick and more tangy/vinegary than the others above. I'll use what I have, but probably not buy more. $14.50/500ml<br /><br />For my taste I would not again purchase Mussini Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modeno (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - sweet, grapey, caramel-y" and don't know what to do with Roland Balsamic Glaze (thick, but very, very vinegary - ugh).

review/text: I love balsamic vinegar and wish I had the budget to use the expensive ones for all of my cooking.<br /><br />But this reduction is great for cooking fish, salads, and lots of other recipes.<br /><br />It has a fine taste, goes a long way, and is completely worth using.<br /><br />postscript (many months later):<br /><br />I've had the opportunity to try Balsamic Reductions from DeNigiris and Trader Joes and they are not in the same league as this one at all.(in fact they are pretty bad.)<br /><br />This is the best balsamic reduction by far and since you don't have to use a lot, it is incredibly inexpensive, too.

review/text: Crema di Balsamic "Regular", imported from Italy (promptly too!), is a sublime, thick, sweet/sour balsamic vinegar. It enhances the Armenian and Syrian foods that are a part of my family tradition handed down through recipes which I enjoy cooking whenever possible. It's also wonderful if you're doing Italian, Greek and Spanish dishes. And if you just want to add a dash to a tuna steak or some quick mozzarella sliced into a garden tomato - amazing! This is a bit pricey but worth every penny!

review/text: This is my favorite hot sauce. It is actually mild as far as heat goes and hence I use it often as a dipping sauce for poultry, fish, baked potato skins etc. In sauces and marinades it is often the perfect something to kick it up a notch. Make your own spicy ranch dressing, make your own marinades. Brush it on fish with a little sesame oil, garlic and basil before baking. A truly wonderful and versatile product.

review/summary: Made a neurotically picky brother happy.  Or as close to happy as he ever gets
review/text: To say that my brother is "picky" is the most extreme of understatements.  His finicky culinary mandates are the most outrageous, unreasonable and demanding of almost any human I've ever known.  His love of nuts is extremely persnickety, and he has been known to turn his nose up at some of the most expensive gourmet nut selections available.<br />Sunflower Food and Spice Co Honey Toasted Cashews gave me a first ever accomplishment in my gift-giving history with my sibling.  This year, instead of the usual  "eh, not really that good actually."  or the one time in 1996 when I got a "meh, they're ok I guess."  He said this:<br /><br />"Best cashews I've ever had."<br /><br />Truly, I can not tell you how significant a statement that is.

review/summary: Perfect cuppa tea
review/text: The ONLY reason I give this tea 4 instead of 5 stars is the price. For most of the real world, the price makes this tea something for special occasions only. However, that being said, it is my FAVORITE tea. Each bag has enough to make a very generously sized mug of flavorful tea. The added Earl grey flavoring is perfectly balanced with the Rooibos tea...and the whole thing is naturally caffeine free. Red tea has an earthiness, almost a smokey flavor that is worth trying a couple of times before dismissing. I highly recommend this product, despite the price! An aside...if you have ever read The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency novels by Alexander McCall Smith<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307261581">The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency 5-Book Boxed Set</a>, the bush tea that Mma Ramotswe is always drinking is Rooibos, or Red Tea...so brew a cup for yourself when you sit down to read these wonderful stories!

review/summary: Good spread
review/text: My son survives on this stuff. It's very chocolaty. I agree it is very sweet. I like the hint of hazelnut and I like it as a spread on crackers or toast. My son will eat it with peanut butter in a sandwich. It's good, especially for chocolate lovers.<br /><br />_______________<br /><br />UPDATE:  My son brought this to his childcare center and he was prevented from eating it because they are a peanut-free facility.  When I told them it was hazelnut spread, they said it smelled like peanut and it was processed in a factory that may have processed peanuts and it's a nut.  So, for those moms whose children go to schools where they are paranoid about nuts (not just peanuts but everything nuts and stuff processed at facilities which may have processed nuts), Nutella may not be acceptable.

review/summary: Fabulous!!!!!
review/text: I promise this is a real review, first of all.  I bought this to make Jambalaya with.  The flavor blew me away.  I use a large can of crushed tomatoes and chicken stock in my Jambalaya.  The creole seasoning couldn't be more perfect with those flavors.  In fact, the first time I made Jambalaya with this, I tasted the broth after it had cooked for a while to assess the spiciness and almost couldn't put the spoon down.  It's that good.  By the way, for a nice big pot of Jambalaya, I use two level tablespoons of this seasoning plus a nice sprinkle.  It's definitely spicy without being atomic.  I know there are recipes that call for two small teaspoons.  Ignore them.  Two tablespoons are better.  Oh, I don't like my food screaming hot, so, that should give you an idea of the heat level.  If you want more heat, though, add a third tablespoon after it cooks for a while.  Enjoy!

These blue gummy sharks by Farley and Sathers are none of the bad, and all of the good that I find in gummies. They're soft with just the right consistency, and sweetened to the perfect level. It's sad that not many grocery stores carry them anymore, but luckily there are plenty of bulk distributors here on Amazon to satisfy those with gummy needs.

review/summary: Earl Grey in Bulk
review/text: My husband and I drink ice tea daily and appreciate the ability to make more or less and adjust the strength of our tea. Which is why we choose bulk tea over bags. When we opened the bag, the aroma was fragrant and gave promise of a flavorful brew.  And it is. Using a coffee filter, our tea brews up, smells delicious hot and cools to a brisk, refreshing drink.

review/text: We were looking to replace the Twinnings Earl Grey that we bought in the store in the tin and found this one on Amazon's site.  This is a very nice Earl Grey.  It is very fragrant and is not bitter at all.  The leaves are whole or close to it.  It is a little lighter than Twinnings (although that may due to the quantity of leaves used).  A terrific black tea!

review/summary: Earl Grey with a Little Difference
review/text: As far as teas are concerned I am partial to the black teas. I have 2 pounds of the Earl Grey and 1 of them says that there is lavender in it as well. When it is in the cup a slightly sweet lavender smell greets my nose which is very pleasant and tasty. I have not noticed a smokey essence as has been reported by other reviewers just a full bodied tea that has great aroma, terrific taste and comes at a very affordable price. And, if you purchase your teas on a subscription basis from Amazon and are a Prime member there is free shipping and a 15% cost reduction for your following purchases. To me all the Davidson's teas we've purchased are first class and organic. I highly recommend them and purchasing them through Amazon.com

review/text: I got this at the same time I got Davidson's Assam tea. While I love the Assam and would recommend it, I cannot say the same for this Earl Grey. There is a lemony citrus taste, not the smooth Bergamot flavor I am used to in a good Earl Grey. It is way too bitter because of this. I wish I could like it a bit more as the price was great, but nothing is good about the price when you cannot enjoy the product at any level.

review/text: Not the best Earl Grey I have tasted but certainly acceptable for regular drinking.  The exceptional price makes it a great value.  Stronger Bergamot than other Early Grey's I have tried.  I didn't find the smokiness other have described.  Perhaps the quality varies from batch to batch.  I stick to the instructions and use one rounded teaspoon per 8 ounce cup or it gets bitter for me.  Makes for a lighter cup than other Earl grey's but that is what I like about it.

review/summary: Light on the black, but nice and fruity!
review/text: We purchase this tea primarily for keeping our fridge well stocked with iced tea year round, and for that it is really quite tasty.  This particular brand/blend really seems to emphasize the fruitiness of the bergamot -- it's oddly reminiscent of lychee, which we rather like.  The "black"ness, however, is quite mild, so if I'm drinking it hot I brew it a bit longer and it still comes out pretty well.

review/text: We have previously had Davidson's English Breakfast tea and stored it in a plastic clear container.  We bought the Davidson's Earl Grey tea and within 3 days the clear plastic container has been chemically etched where the tea had touched it.  The container ultimately became totally opaque and now permanently shows where the tea level was.  The tea tastes good but one has to ask 'Is this good for you?' - I doubt it and will not be buying the Earl Grey again.<br /><br />I have since been in contact with Davidson's.  They believe that the oils in Earl Grey may be the culprit (never heard of oils affecting plastic before!).  I have since sent them the container and they have sent it to their management for review.  Davidson's have also said they are going to send me a glass container in return.

review/summary: Quite awesome, just the way I remember them.
review/text: I used to love these "suckers" in middle school, and somehow through the years just lost track of where I could buy them.  They used to be sold very commonly in gas stations and convenience stores where I grew up, but as time went on, candy manufacturers strayed away from such items.<br /><br />Anyway - out of the blue I decided I wanted some more, and was lucky enough to find these on Amazon (and eligible for Prime).<br /><br />No real complaints about the way that these taste or hold up - it's a facsimile of what I remember as a child.<br /><br />The only comment I would have is that if you get these from Penguin Caffeinated Mint company, they "may" send you some chipped ones.  I was a little surprised at the gauges in the ball, and thought it may have happened during shipping, but upon further inspection, there were no chipped off pieces of candy in the individually wrapped jawbreakers.  (see my pic).<br /><br />Not anything to really complain about if you don't mind a little help getting it started, but perhaps Penguin sells the ones that no one else wants?  Doesn't bother me, but I thought I'd mention it in case someone out there was wanting to purchase these as a flawless gift.

review/text: I don't know why they are like this, but these are NOT the jawbreakers that I remember as a kid. The ones I had as a kid were sweet, sticky, and tasted like actual candy, and they had a neutral sugary taste throughout.<br /><br />For some reason, these jawbreakers don't get sticky. I don't know what they are made of, but it couldn't be sugar because If you lick it and watch it, it forms this "powdery" coating on it that feels like some artificial chemical, and you can actually taste the powdery stuff it forms and it's disgusting.<br /><br />Unfortunately I'd already eaten one trying to figure out if it was just the first couple layers, but the entire thing was disgusting and strange.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing from Penguin Mints in the future. $15 dollars gone to waste. DO NOT BUY THESE!

And even though the medicinal qualities are evident in most chinese/japanese green teas (especially the soothing after taste), I wouldn't describe your typical green tea as a flavorful experience.

review/text: This Green tea blend is SERIOUSLY smooth and delightful.  It is my favorite tea ever.  Ever.<br /><br />The blend of Tulsi and Green tea is a perfect example of something being greater than the sum of its parts.  Plain Tulsi (Holy Basil) tea tastes like grass to me; plain green tea is bitter to my taste (yes, I prepare it properly).... but when you combine the two you wind up with a wonderfully mild, slightly sweet, yet still undoubtedly green concoction that is nothing short of addictive.  I almost can't help but guzzle it.  I got my mom hooked on this tea as well and I have to buy her a bunch from my local Co-op every couple of months and mail it to her!<br /><br />Try this tea.  Then hate me for getting you addicted.  Then stock up if you find it on sale!  Then try the other Organic India teas... they are ALL wonderful... and you will be supporting an environmentally responsible product and the farmers that produce it.<br /><br />But seriously... the Green tea blend... buy it.  As fast as you can click your way through checkout.

I am not a regular tea drinker and I dont have any other tea to compare to. I simply love this tea. Besides Tulsi with honey is a great natural remedy for cold and cough. so this tea with honey may also do the trick in winter. I got to try that.

review/summary: Perfect for adding flavor to dry food. Our little dog loves this stuff
review/text: I don't know a lot about dogs but I thought they ate anything. The dachshund we had growing up would eat banana peels if you left them out. We rescued a Maltese (5 years ago now) and while he is healthy, he eats when he's hungry and leaves the rest.  He's never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I've read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn't lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I've found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don't mind making it tasty.

review/text: This is an o.k. product for wet food for my Chihuahuas & I love the size & price.  The subscription process gives me a lower price & I don't worry about running out.  My dogs are now on a really good dry food for small dogs but the almost 2 years I used this wet one, I was happy.

review/summary: We're both happy at long last!
review/text: I have two dogs, but only one of them eats Cesar chicken "in meaty juices" (it HAS to be the "in meaty juices kind!) and she GOBBLES IT. after years of searching for a food she'll eat to enjoy, not just eat to survive, we've finally found a winner!<br /><br /> Gigi is a 9-year-old Papillon mix who is both dainty, firecely independent, and plain fierce when she's disturbed, while 1-year-old Mini-Dachshund Sophie is a happy, bouncy, and utterly addicted to attention. Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the p�t&eacute; kind, I.e. "in meaty juices" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based "in meaty juices" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft p�t&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar "in nearby juices" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have.

NOT a healthy diet for anyone interested in good nutrition for their pet. BUT...our 18+ tiny rescue mutt isn't long for this world and has taken a liking to this doggie junk food above all else. It was either cave in and buy it, or she was going to starve. But don't get your healthy young pet hooked on this slickly marketed product, designed by Mars to use up the waste products that aren't good enough for human consumption. There are much better choices that will provide better nutrition at the good pet specialty stores!

review/summary: Terrific for picky dogs
review/text: I have a 5 lb Maltese who eats more like a cat. He eats until he is full and walks away. Dry food is best, I am told but it so.... "dry". I don't want to give him human food because I'm told I shouldn't - but also because he eats so little, I want to be sure he's healthy. My solution has been to buy Cesar by the case from Amazon (auto shipment) and mix it with his dry. I buy dry food for small adult dogs, mix a scoop (1 cup?) with 1/4-1/3 container of Cesar. I mix it with a for or my hands (so he doesn't just eat the Cesar and walk away). He gets the benefit of dry food for his teeth etc and the tastiness of Cesar's wonderful flavors.

On the plus side, it never got bitter either. So if you drink your tea in fairly small cups and don't like it too strong, this might be the one for you. On the other hand, if you're looking for a strong, flavorful cup of chai, I'd keep looking.<br /><br />For me, I'll finish the package but I might not buy it again. I'll also be trying two bags per cup. There are other Tea District flavors that are amazing, so I'll keep trying others in this brand.<br /><br />Also, this price is about half the price of my local retailer.

I liked Emeril's Big Easy Bold for a while and still like Green Mountain's Espresso Blend but neither have the richness that this one from Starbucks has.  Right now though the Amazon price for 30 is 48.98!  For a pack of 16 it is $9.99 at my local grocery store and Bed, Bath and Beyond carries them for $14.99 but you can use their $5 off or the 20% off coupons which are everywhere.  So until the price here drops some, I will pick it up at my local store.

I found these Sumatra K-cups at Amazon Warehouse and got them for an average of $.65/cup, which I think is fair.  I had never tried the Sumatra, but glad I did because they are very good.  Very bold, very smooth, not so bold it tastes like you're drinking from an ashtray.  Amazing how Starbucks gets their K-cups to taste pretty dang close to the real thing.

review/summary: It is definitely dark roast
review/text: I love dark roast coffee, served with or without cream/sugar, and this Sumatran k-cup is most assuredly a dark roast, but I found the flavor and aroma of this product to register as slightly bitter/burnt.  It did not overwhelm my senses, and it was easily alleviated and made better with the use of creamer, but it still wasn't my favorite of the K-Cups that are available.  I thought it was "okay".<br /><br />My husband didn't enjoy the Starbucks version of Sumatra, stating that he felt it had a somewhat chemical-like aftertaste even with cream and sugar.  We used over half of the box, to make sure that our opinion wasn't perhaps based on a faulty serving or two, but ended up giving the remainder to our neighbors; unfortunately, this Sumatra just didn't work for us.

review/summary: The best K-cup coffee!
review/text: This is the best K-cup coffee I have found yet.  The Pike Place is a close second, but the Sumatra holds up well to a larger cup (either the mug or large mug size).  If you're using a travel mug, stick with the dark roasts.  Wish it came in decaf - I love my Keurig, but I can handle only so much caffeine!<br />Also, I have found the Starbucks K-cups disassemble easily (more so than some of the other brands), the foil removes very cleanly, you can compost the grounds and paper filter, and recycle the plastic.

review/summary: Bold, and full of flavor, good flavor
review/text: My husband loves the Starbucks Sumatra K-Cup. Of all the samples of bold coffee for the Keurig he has tried, this is by far his favorite. It has just the right amount of flavor and strength for his taste.

review/summary: Best K-Cup yet.
review/text: I prefer grinding my own coffee and using my Aeropress to the K-Cup for single serving brews. When I heard Starbucks was coming out with a K-Cup I was genuinely excited! For two years I've dealt with weak "dark" roasts. Iced coffees with a K-Cup are a joke. While nothing will come close to espresso out of a Keurig (I recommend the Mypressi Twist V2 if you are on a budget), the Sumatra Dark from Starbucks is the best K-Cup yet. It is smooth, dark and even brewed with crema. This is not acidic like many of the South American blend K-Cups. It is slightly more expensive, but it has made me start using my Keurig again.<br /><br /> I would have given it 5 stars, but one cup of the 5 I've made so far came out a touch weak.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor if you shelled out the cash on a Keurig. Get the Sumatra!!!

review/summary: Very good
review/text: So far, I've only tried this one and Pike's Place (see my review for that here) and I have to say the Sumatra is superior to Pike's Place, with a satisfyingly rich, bold flavor. In the coming days I'll try their House Blend and French Roast to compare and post quick reviews on them as well.
