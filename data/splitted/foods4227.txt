review/summary: 5 seconds flat
review/text: I sat the toy on the floor and he immediately opened one flap and used it to rotate the toy and get the treats in every chamber. It wasn't much of a puzzle and he finished before I could log in to write this review. Less than 2 minutes. I'm not sure I would buy too many more of these products. In theory the product is a good idea. I gave this two stars instead of one because he did enjoy himself in those two minutes.

review/summary: Cool Toy for Dogs
review/text: Cool product with a great concept.  My dogs love it.  The material on the outside is well made and perfect for chewing.  After fetching the tennis ball the dogs are excited to try to get it out of being hidden in another ball.  Got dirty real quick but very easy to wash.

review/summary: Fun distraction for my toy poodle
review/text: My toy poodle is 4 years old and he is pretty smart. He loves learning new tricks and seems to enjoy being challenged mentally. This product is great for him because he loves playing with tennis balls. Basically, this "toy" is really a puzzle for him to try to get the tennis ball out. It helps that my dog has small paws which can easily get inside the toy. Another benefit is the rubber is soft and is easily washable. It is particularly challenging for him to get the tennis ball

review/text: When I got this product for my 4 year old Chihuahua, he immediately loved it! It's a stimulating toy that challenges him unlike his usual squeaky toys. I really love the fact that this item is washable and the material doesn't rip easily like his furry toys! Very durable even for my destructive Chihuahua!

review/summary: Cattledogs love it!
review/text: This is one great toy!  My busy, mouthy Cattledogs like it so much they will ask to play with it, sitting and staring at it on the shelf where it's stored.  When they first got the toy, it took them just a minute or two to get their mouths around the squirrel, but it took a couple days of play periods for them to figure out how to pull it out of the hole (it's a tight fit).  I let them play with the squeaky squirrel for a few minutes, then put it back in and say, "Go find".  They love it, and will throw the "stump" around and thrash it back and forth, extending the game.<br /><br />While the toy is very durable, it is suitable only for observed play, as the chewy rubber of the exterior could be ingested.  All the  Kyjen toys are made for interactive play, but it's a point that must be stressed: these are not chew toys.  The other thing to keep in mind is the amount of dog slobber all that "Go find" spreads around.  You may want to confine the play to a room that is easily mopped.

review/summary: Too easily tipped
review/text: While I have been pleased with some of the Kyjen toys, this puzzle was a disappointment.  My Mensa-smart Cattledogs figured out the game immediately, opening the flaps just fine.  But after a couple good retrievals the older dog looked at me as if to say, "Are you kidding me?", inserted a toenail into the top hole of this thing, and flipped it over to get the treat.  I'm going to try gluing it to a board so he can't cheat.  But overall, I'd say this is for very small dogs or slow ones.

Whenever i have guests i let rocky play with the moon ball and the rover. It keeps him occupied for hours. Its perfect for little dogs with lots of energy. Rocky has little paws that way he can stick his paws in the moon ball and retrieve the rover. Its easy to clean unlike other squeaky toys just wash with water and let dry and its ready to keep him occupied and lets me entertain my guests.

review/summary: My dog seems to like this puzzle
review/text: I have a beagle and we have never bought a doggy puzzle for him before, so I was looking for something easy and also something that would make him use his great sense of smell. This puzzle is perfect! Although he figured it out in about 10 seconds, it is something that can be reused over and over again due to the 4 treat chambers. He never knows exactly where the treat went and sometimes I sneak one in while he's not looking, so later he will catch scent of it and retrieve it. It's very entertaining for both of us and I will definitely buy more dog puzzles in the future.

review/text: I have purchased this coffee for years (and years) and have always enjoyed it. The trick is NOT to brew it full strength. I have always blended it half-and-half with Maxwell House French Roast coffee. The result is a robust and very flavorful coffee that doesn't overwhelm you. By blending it with another coffee it allows me to not have to purchase it as often.

review/text: I really like Millstone coffees ...... they have great flavor.  The Hazelnut Creme<br />is my favorite... followed by the French Vanilla and Chocolate Velvet.  The flavor<br />is a bit on the strong side, so I usually mix the coffee half and half<br />with a Millstone (non-flavored) decaf.  I find this is the perfect combination<br />of caffeine and flavor for me.

review/summary: Great Coffee!
review/text: I bought this regularly at the local Sams club for a long time. Every time I brewed up a batch when we had guests over, everyone raved about the coffee. Then, someone gave me a huge amount of Starbucks coffee, and for about 6 months there was no Millstone in my house. And each time I ground and brewed up the Starbucks, nobody said a word. After 6 months, my Starbucks ran out, so I went to Sam's and bought more Millstone hazelnut. Being curious what would happen, I purposefully said nothing about the coffee, and the first time I made it  . . . . everyone raved.  Undoubtedly my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately Sam's no longer stocks this, but nice to know I can get it Amazon.

review/summary: The best Hazelnut Cream
review/text: As usual, taste is a very individualized preference.<br /><br />This coffee tastes exactly how I like it. I have compared with Folger's brand and Dunkin' Donuts (mixing Vanilla Cream with Hazelnut to get the same effect) and other "house" brands because I'm a tightwad. Anyway, I like Millstone the best even if it costs me a little bit more.<br /><br />I've been asking family members to bring it to me from Oregon, since Northern California stores don't carry it anymore. But now that I can get it with free shipping from Amazon, I may buy it here instead.

review/summary: Mediocre coffee
review/text: I'm not a fan of this coffee at all. It has a harsh flavor, and the hazelnut flavor doesn't even seem very accurate to what hazelnut should be like. It makes me think of chemicals - like they mixed together a few artificial additives and hoped it would come close to hazelnut. When I throw the used grounds in the garbage, the smell permeates the entire room with a weird buttery smell for days. I know that's not really relevant to the coffee's taste, and I could empty the garbage every day (yeah right), but thought it a funny odd note worth mentioning.<br />I've compared this coffee with Starbucks Espresso blend (brewed from grounds, in the same device I use with the Millstone grounds) and the Starbucks espresso is leagues above this. I'm not saying Millstone is terrible - it is still drinkable - just that it's like a 4 on a 10 point scale; and when there are other coffees in the grocery store that are 8 or 9 on the taste scale and only cost $1 or $2 more per pound, I don't see a reason to buy the Millstone hazelnut cream.

review/text: Thought I'd try this since it was similar in price to our regular coffee. Don't like the taste much, it tastes like fake flavoring. The grounds are very fine and it makes it darker and more dense - not in a good way like Starbucks coffee. I end up having to use more cream. We went back to our regular brand at Giant since we grind it fresh and a little more coarse.

review/text: Mix Durkee's Sauce with real mayonnaise (NOT Miracle Whip!) in roughly half-to-half proportions (I use a little more mayo than Durkee's); then add curry powder to taste.  Absolutely wonderful as a dip for raw vegetables!  I've made this dip for more than 25 years and I've never had anyone say that they didn't like it.  If you make it the day before, the flavors meld together really well; just give it a stir before serving.  But you MUST use Durkee's Sauce--that's the secret ingredient.  I've also used Durkee's instead of mayo when mixing canned tuna fish for sandwiches; it adds a great zing to deviled eggs, and it's also good over grilled salmon.  I wouldn't be without it!

review/summary: Fatal Flavor Flaw
review/text: Roland Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce have a strange and unpleasant, vaguely chemical taste that is hard to describe, slightly metallic, perhaps an artificial smoke flavor or dried spices.  Roland doesn't generally manufacture their own products but private-labels those from other manufacturers and I have to wonder who cans these.<br /><br />Other brands that I have tried like San Marcos and Casa Fiesta are much better and cleaner tasting.  My advice is to buy one of those brands or at least try one can before committing to a case of these if you haven't tasted them.<br /><br />Besides this fatal flavor flaw they are pretty much the same as any other chipotle in adobo, nice whole peppers swimming in sauce, smoky and addictive to people who like to eat hot peppers.  They will squirt when you bite them so I usually cut them in half in the kitchen.<br /><br />Bottom line, I have been using them in recipes where they lend heat and the flavor will be buried but I can't eat them with chips or use them as a sauce on top of anything because of the flavor and I won't be ordering them again.

review/text: I love all things hot and Chipotle peppers are on the top of my list.  I usually buy pounds of dried Chipotles during the Hatch, New Mexico Chile Festival.  The heat of Chipotles are not overbearing (they are, after all, smoked Jalapenos) but the taste is warm and full of flavor.<br /><br />I had been buying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011T8XGW">La Costena Chipotle Adobo Sauce</a> and liked them fine.  I recently tried the Roland brand and found them to be even better.  The sauce seems richer and the peppers hotter.<br /><br />I often chop these up and mix them into ground beef for Chipotle burgers or, if I include to Adobo sauce, I can make Chipotle meatloaf with it.  I keep several cans of both this and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046LCJZ8">Roland Chipotle paste</a> on hand and I use them often.  They taste great to me!

review/text: it does not taste like banana, and more grease than I thought, so if you want to find a real banana tast chips this may not be your choice. Even though it is not too sweet, but it contains huge calories, so if you are on diet this should not be on your list either.

review/summary: Very good Olives, dented cans
review/text: These are very good olives with pits. If you like a real olive taste then these are good. They are not the most wonderful, but they are far better than the seedless pickled olives in jars and cans that have no olive taste really. These have a great taste and are for the true olive lover. I am talking about people who love a real olive taste, not just vinegar and bland. By the way these are not in vinegar, which is a big plus.<br /><br />I was disappointed though that when I ordered 12 cans, 5 of the cans were severely dented.<br /><br />But the olives are very good, and the price is excellent for what you get.

review/text: We've been big fans of the regular non-organic Zoe EVOO in a can, but always wanted an organic alternative.  Unfortunately, the organic Zoe in the red can is quite peppery and grassy; a real contrast to the non-organic that we were used to.  Thank you to Zoe for creating this organic version for kids, with its fantastic, mild, fruity flavor, and in a BPA-free can to boot!  We ordered this when it first came out, and didn't realize we were paying almost $20 for such teeny little cans.  Thank you Amazon for realizing the size difference, and halving the price.  This is our new Subscribe & Save EVOO.  We love it, drizzled on salads, avocados, and for marinades.

review/summary: Good Tea but Pricey
review/text: I had my first trial of teavana stuff in the mall in Houston, TX. The tea was very good. I didn't like the prices they were charging there (with a minimum of 4oz purchase!)<br /><br />This set had the youthberry blend and the chai blend that I tried in the mall, while giving me two other flavors to try (and their famous rock salt.)<br /><br />The teas are very yummy. However, they can be hard to strain. I almost always end up with a few little peices of tea leaves or petals in my tea cup.<br /><br />The teas don't need sugar, really, as they are all flavored so well. This particular set doesn't come with a kettle or glass of any kind. (But, had the flavors I wanted.)<br /><br />Very good tea to try if you are trying to kick soda or coffee. :) Overall, good purchase. Knocked a star off for price and straining difficulties.

review/text: I have to agree with Mr. Haschka. The banana is virtually nonexistent. That's too bad, because I REALLY wanted these to taste like banana bread. However, they are awesome, as usual. Really, they don't even need any added "flavor", like the banana, apricot or coconut. The dense, wonderful feel of oats and sweetness is great all by itself (well, adding a little layer of peanut butter on top doesn't hurt!). They are filling, great tasting and good for you. We will continue to buy Bobo's Oat Bars in a variety of flavors.

review/summary: The emphasis is on oats
review/text: BOBO'S OAT BARS, named after the oldest daughter of entrepreneur and bar's creator Beryl Stafford, are "baked from the heart in Boulder, Colorado" and should prove to be a delight for oat lovers. The fact that the bar comes in several flavors - almond, apricot, banana, chocolate, cinnamon-raisin, coconut, cranberry, original, peanut butter, strawberry - may be irrelevant for reasons I shall mention.<br /><br />At 3.5 inches x 2.25 inches x 1 inch, the bar is a dense, heavy, and pleasantly sweet treat with a strong oat flavor. Each bar is defined as two 180 calorie servings, which is absurd because nobody's going to eat only half the bar. (As a matter of fact, I'll thumb my nose at the Food Police and eat two before I go to the gym. So, there!) Each serving also has 6g fat (2g saturated), 20mg sodium, 9g sugars, 3g fiber, and 3g protein. But no cholesterol or trans fat.<br /><br />The ingredients list for the banana version contains some things I've never run across before:<br /><br />"Organic rolled oats, brown rice syrup, earth balance (expeller-pressed natural soy, palm, canola, and olive oil blend), filtered water, pure salt, natural flavor, soy lecithin, lactic acid (non-dairy) and annatto extract (color), organic sucanat (non-refined cane sugar), dried bananas (bananas, fructose), xantham gum. Contains soy. May contain traces of tree nuts and peanuts."<br /><br />The ingredient "earth balance" sounds meaningless but very PC. These days, that's inordinately important.<br /><br />Annatto extract is derived from the tropical achiote tree.<br /><br />And "pure salt"? Does any ingredients list on a foodstuff include "impure salt"?<br /><br />"Sucanat" is derived from "SUcre de CAnne NATurel", which is dried sugar cane juice that retains its molasses content.<br /><br />When it comes to familiarity with common ingredients list components, I need to get out more. Perhaps they offer a night-school class for aging boomers at the local community college.<br /><br />The reason I'm not awarding five stars is that the ostensible banana taste was so subtle as to be virtually non-existent. The only other Bobo's version I've tried was the apricot, and that also seemed minimally flavored. The muted essences were unexpected in something so dense, especially as the oats come across so strongly.<br /><br />The high points of the bar are, for me, the oat flavor and the "mouth feel." It goes great with cold moo juice. Despite their high price at local outlets - $2.69 per bar - I'd buy more, and make an effort to sample the other flavors to see if they're better presented.<br /><br />P.S. 8/9/11: See my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZH04KY">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Chocolate, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/summary: Calories and Oat Health
review/text: I love the taste of these bars and the oat health that goes along with eating them! I do purchase these items on a semi regular basis. That said, two things hold me back from buying and eating them more often: 1) The calories are high (but the texture and taste make it worth it) and 2) The price point is still a bit high. I feel like for the cost of a handful oats as the primary ingredient that paying over $2.30 per 3.0 oz bar is too much.

review/summary: My Dog loves this stuff
review/text: I wanted to switch to a higher quality food for my dog, a 2.5 year old german shep mix.  She had stomach digestion issues as a pup, and although she is past that she still tended on having loose stool quite often.  Consistency varied often, as did her regularity.<br /><br />I mixed with her old food (Hills Science Diet) and she had no issues with digestion during the transition, which I did gradually over about 3 weeks until she finished her old food and was completely on the Hi Tek.  I have just started on our second bag of this and she's been fine, with much more regular, and solid stool.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />* She seems to like it!<br />* She appears to have better digestion and elimination<br /><br />Additional comments - not necessarily a con:<br />* Food pieces seem small for a mid-large dog.  It does not seem to bother her, and perhaps that too can help her digestion.  Just be cautioned that it is NOT the same size pellets or balls as the mid to large dog food that I had been used to.<br />* While it in no way affects the quality of the actual product, the packaging is very plain and very unremarkable so it does not catch your eye if you were buying in a store.

review/text: I have two dogs, and one of my dogs had no problem with this food as he doesn't with anything that he puts in his mouth. But my other dog is a picky eater, so he wasn't to fond of this food. He also began getting 'hot spots' and digging at his paws shortly after feeding him this food. I switched foods after that he has since stopped itching. Could be coincidence but other than that... it seems like it has good ingredients and grain free is always a plus. I won't buy again simply because one of my dogs had a bad reaction but it's worth a shot if you can get dog food delivered to your front door through Amazon!

review/summary: He loves it!
review/text: My dog has had a very poor appetite lately and refuses to eat the hills science diet dog food he's been on for the past 2 years.  I figured i'd try something new, to get his appetite back and also try a probiotic to see if maybe his stomach was acting up. He did well on the probiotic and started to eat again. As soon as I poured this dog food in his dish he started eating it very quickly like he used to like it was his last meal or something lol. As soon as he hears me in the kitchen he starts scratching at the door for more of this good dog food and jumping around and excited like he used too. I've read about how grain free products are better for your dog because they decrease gastric discomfort and I believe that too be true. I'm sticking with this dog food even though it's kind of expensive. I give the product 5 stars and 3.5 stars on the price.

Was looking for a high quality, grain free dog food and dogfoodadvisor.com does state that it is quality. Even one of our dachshunds, which has always seemed a bit thin, has put on some bulk (not fat) due to the protein content. And, all the dogs breath does not stink - especially the dachshunds, which always tend to have stinky breath.

Sometimes they will eat another type of treat but after 1 or 2 days, they refuse to eat anymore. These are the best!<br /><br />ps: when your cat gets bored with a favorite toy, don't throw it out. Put it away in a closet for a few months & one day when they seem bored again, bring it out of the closet and give it to them. They will be excited about it again. Cats are like kids so rotate the toys and everyone will be happy.

I got these because my cat went crazy over the cheese puff treats I bought at Target, I think they are call crispies or something. They literally almost ripped the bag apart when it was left closed sitting on the counter because they can smell it through the bags. I have 2 kittens and they fought each other whenever I grab for the bag, no other time do they act like this it's almost as if it's drugs or something. I was hoping for the same effect with these, but my kittens both treat these like it's slightly tastier dry food. P.S. I have 1 himalayan and 1 orange tabby.

review/text: My wife and I retired to Panama last year and we haven't been able to find Friskies Party Mix at any of the stores here  We tried other cat treats but the cats just stuck up their noses and walked away.  Now I have to send away for Party Mix to make the cats happy.  I just wish there would be a box with all the choices mixed in.

review/text: This is a must treat for cats who love seafood (most do). Besides being tasty, its crunch can also help with teeth cleaning. My only concern is the price. At times, I paid no more that $12 for a ten pack. Now, the price is over $15. Its fluctuated like this since I've been purchasing them.

review/summary: Only one of two she will eat.
review/text: Oh my goodness, I have the most spoiled cat. She loves her treats and there are only two products she will eat. I ordered this on the subscribe and save and this morning I cancelled it. Reason being it takes much longer to get, it comes via the<br />USPS which means I had to walk to the other building in our apartment complex, to my mailbox to get this. Would be no big deal but I am disabled so it is very difficult for me.<br />This subcribe and save is a very good deal if you don't have the problems that I have.

review/text: My elderly friend's cat loves these treats. We've tried several other brands and he won't eat them. The Amazon price is better than the price at my local Publix store. I've ordered this four times now.  It is usually delivered in a timely manner. One shipment didn't arrive. I notified Amazon and they sent another one the same day. I will purchase this product again.

review/text: My cat can be a bit fussy about his food and treats but he absolutely loves Friskies Party Mix.  He's almost addicted and he even begs me for his treats and shows me where I keep them.  If I let him, he would eat an entire bag at one sitting. I often give my dog a few morsels and she also likes the taste.  I like the easy open pouch too.  It's a great product and I highly recommmend it. We are giving it 4 paws up :)

review/text: I've given my cats a few different kinds of treats daily & these are by far their favorites.... They love them more than any of the others and come running as soon as they here me get the package out. Really helps clean their teeth so it helps get rid of that bad kitty breath from eating other soft chewy treats. I won't buy the soft treats anymore as thier breath is so bad from it & they love these the best & so do I. They cost $1.50 a pack in the Walmart store so they are even cheaper here to buy & no sales tax, at least not in Iowa on these. I haven't tried the other flavors because these give them a variety so why bother with just one flavor.

review/summary: Party mix is now one of my cat's favorite treats
review/text: The various Friskies "party mix" flavors of treats really appeal to my cat's taste buds. They are his new favorites. Especially the Beachside Crunch version. He used to be a treat fanatic, but lately he hasn't been eating as many treats because he's been filling up more on wet food; that's sort of replaced his "dry treat" routine. However, he usually will still eat the party mix if I give it to him, even if he shuns other treats.<br /><br />And one other great thing about party mix - the price is cheap, but you get a lot for your money, since it is a good-sized bag. Great taste, great value - what's not to like?

We also didn't realize that it was not meant for yeast, until we got the delivery and saw on the package.  So you can't make bread with it.  We also tried things like pie crust which is pretty simple and it did not turn out either.  Will definitely be going back to Pamela's products.  They are much better and easier to switch to!!!  Buyer beware of this one.

review/text: I have tried this product in four different recipes: Banana bread, oatmeal cookies, biscuits, and communion wafers. The banana bread took a little more time to bake than the usual flour recipe but it turned out scrumptious! My family couldn't get enough of it, along with the cookies and biscuits. I did find the oatmeal cookies were a little dry but probably needed less time than the recipe called for. But they are really good with milk! With GF cooking/baking, everything is different than what you were used to. It's all trial and error. I will definitely purchase this again.

review/summary: This product has been a life changer...
review/text: My 11 year old daughter was diagnosed with multiple food allergies last August.  After years of eating "normal" food, I struggled to find adequate replacements.  I laid awake at night trying to figure out how to feed my child.  This product is a Godsend.  I tried many blends (my own and other mixes), but this is the closest I can find that does the trick.  Is it a perfect replacement for the flour?  NO!  How could it be?  It is what it is... a substitute for people who can't eat the real thing.  I make pancakes, biscuits, doughnuts, muffins, etc. with no problem.  I am able to use this as a thickener also.  I search websites and cookbooks for recipes that I can utilize and I experiment.  That is all you can do.  I also recommend the waffle and pancake mix from Namaste.  I use it to make waffles, which I freeze.  Namaste also has a cookbook they will send you if you contact them.  It has been a great resource.  Good luck to all of you out that who suffer with allergies and I hope you find luck with this product as we have!  :)

review/summary: Good for general use
review/text: As the name suggests, it's good for all purpose use. I use in in gluten free recipes that call for "all purpose gluten free flour." There's xantham gum included in the mix, but it doesn't say how much. From my experience, the mix doesn't seem to have a lot. I usually add 3/4th's of what my recipe calls for. For example, I have a pizza dough recipe that includes 3/4 cup all purpose gluten free flour and 2tsp of xanthan gum. Since the mix already has some, I only put in 1.5tsp of xanthan gum. This rule seems to work well for me and give me consistent results.<br /><br />I wish it were ground a little finer since the resulting baked goods are a little gritty, but it's not nearly as bad as Bob's Red Mill brown rice flour (which has a texture similar to fine sand, blech.)

review/summary: works very nicely
review/text: I have experimented with different flour blends. I was trying to find something to use for pancakes without having to buy a mix. This blend makes great pancakes. My recipe called for 1Tablespoon of baking powder. We were getting an aftertaste until I finally cut the bp back to 2tsp. Now it is hard to tell the difference between wheat ones and these. I also use it for other baking, and it works alright. It doesn't have the wheat flour texture/taste because it is not wheat flour, but it works better than some other blends, and is healthier than some that have hard-to-pronounce ingredients that I have no idea what they are. Keep up the good work Namaste! And thank you for making gf living a little easier.

review/summary: Best Banana Bread ever....
review/text: My 15 year old Grandson was diagnose with a gluten alleregy in July 2010. Since then I have searched to find great products that help creat good tasting food for him.  By reading reviews I decided to order and try Namaste Perfect Flour Blend.  He and his entire family love the Banana bread recipe on the side of the bag.  I change it up from time to time by adding Choco-chips or Butterscotch bits and black walnuts and sometime add pumpkin.  This is a never fail flour and a winner of a recipe.
