review/summary: Even the envelope was aromatic!
review/text: My vanilla bean order arrived today and you could smell the beans through the sealed plastic wrap and padded envelope!  The whole kitchen smells like vanilla beans.  I can't wait to do some serious cooking this weekend.  My order was fulfilled quickly, the product is really fresh, and packaged properly to make it through the mail system intact -- I'll definitely be trying more products from this vendor.

review/summary: Good, fresh, pliable beans
review/text: These were not my first purchase of vanilla beans but are of the same quality and freshness that I am accustomed to. I am pleased. We make our own vanilla extract and the beans, when split and inserted into the bottle of high quality alcohol, (Everclear cut with good quality Brandy, for example) begin to release their essence right away. We use 3 to 4 beans per bottle...more beans, stronger extract. If the bottle is clear, you can see the dark chocolate color begin to ooze from the beans right away. We seal and date the bottles and don't open them for at least a year. Talk about delayed gratification! It is such a delight to cook with this heavenly extract, and when you finally uncork the bottle the aroma will transport you. Great beans, excellent price.

review/text: My only previous experience with vanilla beans was purchasing McCormick brand, which included two small and rather anorexic-looking pods in a small jar for $8.19. When I received the beans from JR Mushrooms and Specialties, I found them to be extraordinarily large and plumpy.  They are moist and have the most delectable aroma.  Forget purchasing anywhere else; this purveyor is fast and provides super excellent quality Bourbon-Madagascar Vanilla Beans at reasonable prices. You'll be pleased!

review/summary: A lot of bang for the buck
review/text: I saw a spot on Food Network (I think) that featured this place that sells little bites of creme brulee inside a chocolate shell.  Does that sound like a little slice of heaven or what?  But I digress....I decided to play evil genius in the kitchen and figure out how to make my own.  The trouble is, to make good creme brulee, you have to have vanilla beans and at the grocery store, the little suckers are ten bucks for only two.  AMAZON TO THE RESCUE.  I was able to purchase a quarter pound (27 beans) for what three beans would have cost in the grocery store.  They arrived promptly and were excellent quality.

review/text: I could not believe the price on these. I told a friend how much I bought them for and she said that they'd probably be all dried up if I bought them for so little money. Nope! They got to my house in a few days and they were VERY well sealed with a tear off strip in a resealable package...so 2 airtight seals. They were plump and fragrant, and I used them to make ice cream the next day. They smelled AMAZING and made my ice cream taste divine. I don't know how they can afford to sell vanilla pods at such a steal (my local store sells 2 beans for $12, what a rip off) but I'm not complaining.

We use our scraped and dried pods to flavor a small jar of vanilla sugar (mix with Dutch process cocoa for a fabulous mocha), and we split a couple of new beans and throw them in vodka for our own homemade vanilla extract (just keep adding more pods and vodka, and  you'll never run out!). So easy, so delicious, so cheap... and your friends will be so impressed. What's not to like?

review/summary: beautiful, moist, FRAGRANT vanilla beans!
review/text: I have purchased vanilla beans from another seller on amazon before. A very small packadge of only five beans. They were my first experience buying beans, and I did not want to purchase a large amount if I was unhappy with them. They were okay, somewhat moist, and they smelled of vanilla, but they are NOTHING compared to these beans!<br /><br />I opened my mailbox, and the scent of vanilla came wafting out! All of my mail smelled of vanilla THROUGH the padded paper envelope and plastic sealed bag these beans came in. The scent is so powerful, and so tasty! I did not have time to unseal the plastic bag before I had to leave the house, but even so, the glass jar that I placed the beans in smells strongly of vanilla upon opening the lid.<br /><br />After I opened the bag, I removed a bean to test the moist-ness(is that a word?) and flexibility. They are very very moist, and give readily to gentle pressure. After placing the bean back in the bag, my hands smelled very strongly of vanilla.<br /><br />Compared to the last beans I bought, and my only perspective on vanilla, these beans are exceptionally easy to split and scrape. I am thrilled. I wonder if these beans will make a better home made vanilla extract than the last batch...

review/text: I was skeptical about buying Vanilla beans, or any packaged foods, over the internet. After reading the great review about these beans and the company I purchased a pack, to test the waters and to see how reputable this company was. WOW! The beans arrived very quickly and in a vacuum sealed package. And the aroma. My goodness! The package it self was left very aromatic for days. The beans were very juicy, very plump and the smell very potent. I am happy to say, I now have these beauties resting in vodka, so that in a few short months I will have my own pure vanilla extract. I can not wait. I highly reccomend this seller, their service and their product. Thanks!!!

review/text: These are very tasty and the shape holds sauce best of all others I've tried. Spiral grooves let your yummy garlic, cheese, tomato and olive bits be nicely dispersed among each bite. You get the idea.<br /><br /> Not too gritty or chewy as some whole grain pasta can be. Not mushy (unless boiled too long in the water). The three colors also make pasta dishes look very pleasing on the plate. Stands up nicely to reheating, so large amount can be made then stored in freezer or fridge. Doesn't become gooey or unrecognizable on second warming.

review/summary: Unique Sprouted Pretzel Split ingredients & overview
review/text: What is "Sprouted" you ask? Well, these Splits are made with a wheat flour that digests like a vegetable... because the wheat was "Sprouted" or germinated. Amazingly, when whole grains are sprouted, they are converted into a living food with more vital nutrients. The nutrients are now in a form that the body can more easily absorb. Think of a sprouted whole grain as a plant. Plants digest in the body as vegetables and are some of the easiest foods to digest.<br /><br />Our organic Sprouted whole grain flour is made by Essential Eating and tastes absolutely wonderful as it has not been bleached, refined or overly processed. We also use an organic extra virgin olive oil.<br /><br />Our Sprouted "Splits" are one of the very few snacks that are not bad for you AND tastes GREAT!!<br /><br />Here is a list of "first and onlys" in the pretzel industry:<br />This is the only Sprouted Flour pretzel in mass production<br />The only 100% Whole Grain Sprouted Flour pretzel<br />The only pretzel made with Olive Oil... and it is organic, extra virgin at that!<br />The only pretzel to naturally provide 4 grams of Fiber per serving... no additives needed<br />The only pretzel with over 35% whole grains that doesn't use any sugar or malt additives.

review/summary: Great cat food.  It's a keeper!
review/text: All 3 of my cats love this food.  They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.  I really can't smell it once I stand up after putting it in the bowl.

review/summary: Excellent choice for my finicky feline!
review/text: Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her. I've been ordering on Amazon since it's been difficult to find it in my local pet stores lately.

review/summary: Cats are obligate carnivores
review/text: Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go.

review/text: After my cat was diagnosed with renal failure, he refused to eat any of the canned versions of his vet prescribed food for kidney disease although he would eat Hill's Science Diet k/d dry food, but he was vomiting it up regularily. Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot's Stew. My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken, turkey and salmon varieties. Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots, peas and green beans, but he does eat them. I really like that Spot's Stew is an all natural cat food with no by-products or fillers, and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys.

review/summary: Dog Food Masquerading as Cat Food
review/text: My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally "stew," with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer.

review/text: I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed.

Before deciding for or against this product, try just a couple of flavors from Petco or Petsmart first. My cat goes ga-ga for all of this product, including the vegetables. Every cat's different. I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh! I wouldn't ever want my furry loved one to eat skin - that's like feeding a human infant McDonald's, no offense to McD's.

review/summary: Wow! Cat Food That Seems Yummy!
review/text: Wow! I have the pickiest cats in the whole universe.  The only wet food they eat is Spot's Stew Chicken.  I can get them to eat the Chicken/Beef flavor if I add some shaved Bonito but with three cats Slinky, Jester and Regal, only Slinky and Jester scarf the food down.  They will eat the chicken without the Bonito but Regal is another story.  She won't eat it at first but might come back later and eat some.  She will ONLY eat the Chicken and does not like Bonito so with her, it gets a little more tough.  However, this food is a wonderful consistency, smells good (to me the human) and I assume to the kitties as well because they LOVE this stuff.  For the vegetables, I don't know if cats really need them however, I mush them up with the meat and they don't notice.  If I miss mushing some, then yes they try to eat around the peas/carrots.  All I can say is thank goodness for this food.  I spent lots of money and time trying to find something they would like.  I also feed them a mix of Halo dry Sensitive Formula Turkey and Purina Dental Health.  In order to prevent urinary symptoms, I give my cats only fresh bottled water every day that I put in bowls all over the house.  With the good water, the good food and lots of petting, I have the happiest cats in Arizona!  Thank you Halo!!

review/summary: Chicken and Beef
review/text: I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe. Whenever I put it out at feeding time, there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot's Stew in them. With 5 kitty mouths to feed, the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot's Stew, so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied. Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting, those poor things that had to "settle" for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew. I have been so pleased with it, that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners.<br />But, at our house, WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines!

review/summary: Picky felines love this canned food
review/text: My two cats somehow never figured out how to use their teeth to bite into their food--given dry food, they'll just use their tongues to lick it up and swallow the kernels whole, with an occasional bite with the teeth to crunch on food that's already been delivered into their mouths.  For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.  Anyways, thank goodness for Spot's Stew, otherwise my teeth-challenged cats would never have been able to enjoy wet food!

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.

review/text: I used to buy this at Whole Foods, which seems to have discontinued it.  Glad to find it at Amazon!<br /><br />This is one of the few foods all 3 cats will eat.  And none seem to pick out the veggies!  The soft texture, and good nutrition, is excellent for (1) the elderly cat (2) the cat who's sick and (3) the cat who will literally eat anything, but you'd prefer he eat something healthy!<br /><br />This is "human quality" cat food, meaning the ingredients are pure enough for a human to eat, and it smells a little like chicken pot pie filling!

review/text: I have a kitten that just LOVES this stuff. The breeder I got him from didn't give me any of his old food, and I had heard that switching food quickly causes stomach upset... but I read about Spot's Stew being great for problem tummies and it's true! My kitten has never had any problems on this food since we brought him home. Also, from the human perspective, this stuff smells like chicken/turkey/fish and not like dog vomit, like certain brands of cat food. Big plus for me.

review/text: The texture of this food is like cooled pea soup.  It's not as stiff as some of the pate style foods and my cat likes it.  All but the veggies that is.  So she leaves not only the veggies, and there are a lot of them, but also a good bit of the chicken surrounding each veggy.  This makes for more waste than I am willing to tolerate so I won't be buying any more Spot's Stew.

review/summary: So disappointed that this didn't work for my kitties
review/text: The first time I served this they both chowed down on it...except for the veges as everyone seems to complain about...but then a little while later they both came back and finished up the veges too!  So I thought this was the greatest thing...but the next time I fed them the one cat decided the novelty had worn off and wanted nothing to do with it.  The other one though continued to chow down, and again left the veges, but came back later and ate most of them.  The next serving -what do you know -neither of them wanted it anymore.  I don't get it -I've never had cats like something so much one day and the next day be turned off from it.  I'm very disappointed, I wanted them to like it, knowing how good it is for them.

review/text: My cats love this brand of food, especially the salmon and turkey flavors. However, they leave the peas and carrots behind. Which makes me feel like I'm not getting my money's worth! However, I've started squishing the carrots into the food, and they seem to be leaving less in their bowls. After trying many brands of canned foods, this is one of the few that they eagerly eat, and it doesn't smell as bad as some.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: Pu-erh is in its own category, if you have never tried Pu-erh, try it before you buy. The best way to try Pu-erh is to request it when you go to Dim Sum, since you would typically get charged for tea anyway (if it is an authentic Cantonese Dim Sum restaurant). What I love about Pu-erh is that you can brew it for as long as you want and it will not turn bitter like green tea, and it does help make you feel better after a heavy, greasy meal.<br /><br />I purchased this product from the Spring Tea group, the wrapping paper on the cake said 'unfermented', the actual cake had another layer of wrapping paper which has a Chinese word for "ripe tea" (fermented) so it was the right product.<br /><br />The fragrance and taste are exactly what I was looking for, the tea has a beautiful dark golden brown/red color which looks so nice in my glass cup. I highly recommend this one.

review/text: My physician has suggested that I try to use more decaf and less regular coffee. Indeed, I have experimented with a number of decaf products over the past several months. Some are good, some aren't. Some have a nice coffee taste; others are pretty bland.<br /><br />I have tried some of Newman's Own K-cup flavors and have generally found the whole line pretty satisfying. This decaf is no exception. It has a nice coffee taste (it is labeled "extra bold). It isa organic, to the extent that that has value for the person wishing to try a cup out. For me, though, the key thing is that it has a good coffee taste and I like starting the day off with a decent cup.<br /><br />So, if you'd like to trey out a decaf, this isn't a bad starting point.

Good decaf isn't that difficult to obtain, but it was apparently a cup too far for this brand.

review/summary: Typical Great Newman's Product--K cup Coffee
review/text: As usual with Newman's Own Products, I found his Special Blend Decaf K-cup coffee to be great. Strong enough for me, without being very acidic.  I continue to be a K cup lover, despite my feelings of overpaying for "home-brewed" coffee.  The K cups are just so darn convenient and easy to make.  I keep my K cup cooker right on my bedroom lavatory shelf.  Turn it on when I get up and the coffee is ready to brew before I have finished with my morning tasks.  And the Special Blend is oh so good.

review/text: I like that it's not too bitter, but like a bunch of other reviewers, I find that the coffee comes out a bit too watery.  My cups are 12 ounce.  I use creamer, but it's the powdered kind, not the liquid, so it shouldn't water down the coffee.<br /><br />I will probably not buy these again.  I think I'm going to try the eco filter cups, or whatever they're called, with regular decaf coffee grounds from the grocery store.

review/text: pros: organically processed organic beans<br /><br />cons:  very light - tastes light a very watered down cup of java, even when brewed using 8oz setting.  I'll have to try a smaller setting, but really, it feels like it'd just be a waste as I'd like more than just a 6 or 4oz cup.  It's is quite lght however that I'm not optimistic that I would make much difference.  *FYI : I drink my coffee black.<br /><br />Good news: I purchased these for my teens who sometimes like a cup of creamy coffee, and... this satisfies their coffee cravings.  So three stars because it's not what I would usually purchase again, but the teeners like it.

review/text: I recently got a Keurig coffeemaker and tried out different brands of Decaf to come up with a favorite. Newman's Own is definitely not among them. Taste very much like a cheap restaurant coffee, watered down with hardly any coffee taste. I happen to like robust coffee taste, and this one doesn't even qualify as "medium".<br />If you like good coffee taste in your decaf coffees, I would highly recommend the Green Mountain Robust Magic and for a little lighter touch the Donut House Decaf or Tully's.<br />Also, of all the different brands I tried, the Newman's Own was the only decaf that gave me an acid stomach reaction.<br />NOT recommended!

review/text: Okay, so it wasn't one of my proudest moments.  I didn't check my order or I would have realized I had ordered Newman's Own "DECAF", when I meant to order Newman's Own Extra Bold!!!  My bad!!  Needless to say when I got the order I was very upset.  That being said, I kept the DECAF and found that now I can enjoy the awesome flavor of Newman's coffee late at night while I read or watch TV, and I can still go to sleep when I'm ready.  It is a double edged sword though.  I am disabled, and therefore I can't afford to order what I intended to, which was Newman's Own Extra Bold.  It is absolutely THE BEST coffee ever.  Add a little Bailey's Creamer and what a great way to start your day.  Those 80 decaf K-Cups are going to last me well into the cold weather, which is great.  Lord only knows when I can get my Newman's Extra Bold.  I love ordering from Amazon though.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LSM98O">Newman's Special Blend Extra Bold (24 K-cups) Keurig</a>

You can only imagine my dismay when I tried one of each and found them not only to be NOTHING like the original but having a bad flavor as well. I can not even eat the black ones as they are just not edible. I threw the black ones out as no one could tolerate the taste and the red ones are tolerable by a few so I have given them out to those who do not know of the original.  These should not be passed off as the original and if they could not duplicate it they should not have tried. Very dissapointing!

review/text: I've become a big fan of the S&B Japanese Curry Sauce Pouches. Needless to say, when I see these selling for 12.00 bucks for a 10 pack, I buy 2 cases.<br /><br />The curry- it's better than good. It's near restaurant quality and goes great with meat and rice. The hot is very spicy. I've had the mild version before, a definite difference in spiciness.<br /><br />The packaging- laminate/foil retort pouches that are easy to carry and easy to store in a kitchen cabinet.<br /><br />The price- when you see these on sale for 12.00 for a 10-pack, but now! The prices on this brand fluctuate greatly; you'll likely see this and other S&B products listed for 20.00 or 30.00 bucks with a few weeks of my writing this review.

review/summary: Tasty but bland and overpriced
review/text: At $10 for a box of 15 tea bags, I figured this stuff must be great. And indeed, the testimonials on the Mighty Leaf website would seem to confirm that. But, while the tea does have a very good, natural flavor, it is significantly blander than any other chai tea I have ever had. I find Tazo and Stash (especially the Double Spice) both to have a much bolder flavor. Were the prices comparable, I would probably give this 4 stars, as it is really not bad at all, but for the cost, it is not worth it. I get the feeling I am paying more for the fancy cloth tea bags themselves, for the cach&eacute; of the sachet as it were (sorry, couldn't resist), than for what comes inside them. I managed to pick it up on sale at Whole Foods for $6...had I paid full price, I would be sorely disappointed.
