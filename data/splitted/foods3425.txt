review/summary: Wolf is so far past the rest
review/text: Grew up in Texas on this stuff. After my folks moved us to Washington I never saw it again. All the other canned Chili's have nothing on Wolf. Just read the other comments here. For a canned Chili it is awesome. Makes for the best Chili Cheese dogs you will ever have. This really should be the only Canned Chili. The others are kind of embarrassingly bad in comparison. Just do it, buy some Wolf and then go buy some others, grab some buddies and do a blind taste test. Here is another good example of how good it is, there is a review on here giving it One Star, when you read their comments, they are pissed off at how it was delivered to them, not the chili itself.

review/summary: Wolf Brand Chili, No Beans
review/text: Being a native Texan and Wolf Brand being a Texas product, I had eaten Wolf Brand for many years. After moving to Utah a few years ago, I had tried every brand of chili available in the stores here, only to find that none of them is as tasty as Wolf's. In addition, all the brands available here are with beans. I like beans but I like my chili pure, without beans. Then I tried my hand at home made chili. My home made is good but no amount of tinkering with the recipe produced chili equal to Wolf Brand. When I found Wolf's No Beans at Amazon, I ordered a case (24 cans). The chili arrived in perfect condition (no dented cans)and I am once again enjoying my favorite chili.

review/summary: Pretty good- has TVP (soy)
review/text: I was happy to find this brand of chili without beans and since the product description says "Unique blend of seasonings and good hearty beef" I thought it would be a simple meaty chili. Unfortunately, the ingredient list above was (and still is as of now) for some other product and I didn't do any research. There are things I consider to be fillers- oats and textured vegetable protein (soy) along with ingredients you'd expect to find in a chili. For those who would like to know, the ingredients are: meat ingredients (beef, pork), water, tomato puree, rolled oats, tvp, chili pepper, & less than 2% of the following: salt, sugar, spices, garlic powder, soy lecithin, caramel color, and sodium tripolyphosphate.<br /><br />The taste of the chili is pretty good. It is very saucy- much more saucy than I thought it would be and I think it's best to serve over pasta, beans, or rice. The meat is of a very fine texture. I would have liked slightly larger pieces. The couple of times we ate it we had it over pasta with grated cheddar and it was very satisfying. (By the way, a can has two 1 cup servings of 400 calories each. Good if you want calories for your buck, bad if you're on a diet. I could easily eat the whole 800 calorie can if I didn't serve it with something.)<br /><br />Shipping was great. All the cans arrived without dents and had an expiration date of Jan 2013 (order date April 2011).<br /><br />Overall, I was fairly happy with the value and taste of this chili and I may order it again to make sure there's protein in the pantry. I'll be looking at some other brands though to see if there's one I like better.

review/summary: ALL-STAR TEXAS CHILI!! HOME ON THE RANGE!!
review/text: Anyone who is from the Lone Star State, or has spent appreciable time there, will know WOLF BRAND (Original) CHILI. Here in California, I have always had to order it directly from the factory. Now, thanks to Amazon.com, I can buy a case, shipping included, for the best price on the Net. This is not a weight-watchers' delight, but the quality and original flavor of WOLF BRAND CHILI remains at the top of my menu list. Great as a side, a full meal, or in any Tex-Mex themed recipe when you want some authentic flavor. This is the "mild" style, and other types of WOLF BRAND products are available if you want more heat, spice, larger chunks of meat, or beans. Cans arrived with no dents or dings, well packaged, and shipped immediately.

review/summary: First Rate Chili!
review/text: When I first encountered the Wolf brand chili, here on Amazon, I thought to myself: "Well...here we go again...another canned chili product, that might be passable as a dog food substitute." As it happens, I went with the stellar reviews on this site and was not disappointed. The old-style Wolf label actually conjured-up visions of man's best friend, but the contents revealed a truly first-rate chili base. Armour, Hormel, Castleberry, and all of the rest, should just fold and get out of the game! Though this stuff was great straight from the tin, I look forward to tryin' it all doctored-up, as well. At two dollars a pop, delivered to your door, this is definitely bang-for-the-buck.

review/text: I started making truffled tater tots (tater tots, parmesan cheese, truffle oil, chives) and bringing them to parties, so over the past year or so, I've tried a number of different brands of white truffle oil. Most of them really don't have a good, strong truffle taste, but this one always does.  I realize that it's a lab process, but I definitely can't afford to mess around with real truffles, and this really does taste great.

Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny [...] bottles of "truffle oil" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called "Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles." Read it and weep: [...]<br /><br />And if you see "truffle oil" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes...

review/summary: WICKED SALTY!!!
review/text: Normally I'll make my own rib rub, but being that I dug Emeril's "Bayou Blast" on pork chops, I figured I'd give it a shot.  I've been working on getting my ribs cooked just right for a long time with much trial and error.  I finally get it right and BAM!!!, Emeril's rub totally ruined my perfectly cooked ribs.  This rub totally overpowers the meat, the sauce, and even it's own spiciness with saltiness a couple ribs into it.  A rub should complement a meat and not make it like a spicy salt-lick (It said there was sweet in there too but I couldn't taste it).  Thank goodness I only left it on a couple hours before cooking and not overnight like I (and most people) usually do.

review/text: I have two cats and with the price of cat food going up like everything else, I jumped on the opportunity to buy this food during a lightening round offer. Unfortunately I should have consulted with the cats! One cat eats everything quickly and ravenously. The other is only anxious to eat Wellness Healthy Indulgence and Fancy Feast Gourmet Wild Salmon. Expensive tastes, so when this healthy variety was offered at 1/2 price I took it. I was truly surprised to see the good eater turn around from the bowl and leave. The slow eater did stay and work on it. I may end up donating these to the local shelter in my area, hopefully some cat there will enjoy it.

The only complaint I have about this product is that it tends to clump a little in the shaker and gets hard to get out of the container sometimes.  I fix this by sticking something in the pouring hole and trying to break up the clumps (a barbeque skewer works well here).  Anyway, great flavor, great product.

review/text: We haven't found something that is a must have for burgers before.  This is my favorite spice for hamburgers.  It makes them taste better than 99% of the burgers you can buy even at great restaurants. Just use fresh ground beef and the burger rub. It makes burgers taste like what you imagine a perfect burger would taste like.  Its too bad, it seems like it is being dicontinued 'cause we can't find it anywhere but here.  I guess it just didn't catch on.  Yes, it comes out clumpy(when it gets old), but sometimes even the ones from the store come clumpy.  Break the canister open, break it up, and store it in a baggie; its just spices.

They remind me a lot of Teddy Grahams, but if you look at the ingredient list you can actually recognize the ingredients instead of just a laundry list of chemicals and additives.

I love the starting flavor, nice cinammon and sugar blend, good crunch like teddy grahams, however after you've been chewing for a few bites, you notice a markedly gritty or sandy texture to them. For me it kinda ruined the appeal. I don't know if this is typical of the manufacturer or because it's gluten free but I won't be purchasing this again.

I give them free choice, and they eat out of the same bowl. Neither dog is overweight.

review/summary: The BEST dog food....EVER!!!
review/text: I have been breeding and and showing dogs ...of several different breeds for over 30 years. This is the absolute BEST I've ever found,although I've always fed top quality  dog food.<br />Currently , I have 3 Chows, 2 Sussex Spaniels and 5 Brusselsl Griffon.(downsizing, as we age)  All the dogs , but one Brussels Griffon, are now retired from showing, and I have not bred any dogs in several years. They all live with my husband and me as pets. (We're  slightly nuts, but have a good setup for the dogs,  so although many are AKC Champions, they can all be "pets" , in retirement.All are housebroken and well trained...none will ever leave our home.)<br />I came to this dog food a fairly short time ago, but I'll never look back.<br />It's not inexpensive, but the smaller portions needed because of the high quality of the ingredients, bring down the cost per dog. Weight control is amazing, and the lack of "fillers" makes every bite a healthy one. One of my Griffons is about to turn 15 , and the Chows... a breed inclined to bloat and stomach cancer, are all healthy at ages well past youth. One  Sussex Spaniel  and one Chow had been a little overweight , but are improving visibly on this food, and are also more active.<br />You need to check your home area to see who carries it, because it's not currently found every where, but you can find it on-line  and it can be shipped.<br />It comes with full instructions on how to judge quantity by size of the dog and it's much less that you would expect. Best of all, every single one of my 10 dogs LOVES it.  (I use the Lamb version)

review/summary: Mmm... Mars bars! :-P~
review/text: I'm guessing you probably already know what a mars bar is, so let's just assume you like 'em. Not a whole lot else to say. If you haven't had an English style mars bar before, I would say that they're one of they're one of the nicer candy bars out there. Well worth trying for anyone who considers themselves a connoisseur of fine junk foods! Do be aware though that judging by some of the other reviews posted, they're NOT quite the same as the mars bars that some buyers may have been expecting.<br /><br />While prices do fluctuate, as of the time of writing this package of 12 will wind up costing you just a fraction over $1.42 a bar. Amazon does sell these bars in packs of more than 12, and bigger the pack you buy, the better deal you get. So if you are able to find a deal that translates as good value from where you sit (and especially if you qualify for free shipping), this seems as good a place as any to buy your chocolate fix. If not, hey, look elsewhere.<br /><br />I took a star off because... Well, just the obvious. Mars bars are bad for you, duh! So please, enjoy in moderation ;-)<br /><br />Theo.

review/text: While it's impossible to find Mars bars in the US, I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  The shipping process occurred in a very timely fashion.  I was a little surprised as to how the bars were packaged - all loose inside the box.  And while the taste is wonderful, the candy bars were quite stale.  So, I guess I will have to get my Mars bars fix when across the ocean.

They brought samples to class, which happened to be right after I had completed a strenuous workout.  It is not sugary, not watery, all round an excellent product.

Not only is the drink delicious (all 3 flavors taste great!) but the re-hydration was immediate & very effective.

review/text: Tried this drink because it was on sale here at Amazon and decided to buy it after the two 5-star reviews.  There's a reason why there is only 2 reviews.  It's horrible.  There's nothing natural tasting about this stuff.  Stick with the natural coconut, it's organic, it's much better tasting, and it's cheaper.  I brought a bottle to my tennis match.  Was winning the match until I cracked open this bottle.  It was so horrible that I ended losing my match because I rather get dehydrated than drink this stuff.  Had friends try it for second opinion and they agreed.  Buy at your own risk...

The large grains of salt and turbinado sugar do not overwhelm the chocolate. Instead they combine with it to make an excellent twist on a fundamental indulgence in life.<br /><br />This offers great rewards to the adventurous chocolate eater.

This is not another snake oil fix-it-all.<br />It contains grounded corn with herbs, not processed sugar. Yes it is full of carbohydrates and natural sugars, but it is not candy or a magical elixir. The Tarahumara Indians use it to fuel their ultra-runs, but that does not mean that you should gobble it up for a quick pick-me-up in the morning. You wouldn't eat running gels, protein shakes or Michael Phelps's lunch and then not do the work. If you want an alternative to GU or energy bars try this, if you are trying to get healthy by simply ingesting something; don't.

review/summary: Fantastic natural organic almonds in right-sized packs
review/text: I really like these as they are not over-roasted which destroys the Omega-3, rather they are "tender" i.e., not rock hard but just crunchy.  The flavor is wonderfully natural and refreshing, and not drowned in salt or Tamari sauce as the ones in the store are.  They do not hurt my teeth like the hard ones in the stores do.  I don't think that there is a better product, and it's organic!  The right-sized packs mean you won't overeat.  I like to enjoy about 10 nuts with a couple of pieces of dark chocolate for desert every night.  I never get tired of it and it stems my appetite for the evening while providing antioxidants and Omega-3 essential oils.  Also, almonds are said to be the only alkaline nut.<br /><br />I think Dr. Weil says that you should have a handful of nuts every day, and almonds are about the healthiest nut, I've heard.  I also happen to like these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IEC6YQ">Klein's Naturals Raw Cashews, Organic, (Pack of 6)</a> because they are sweet, not salty and quite fresh.  Again, saving the value of the essential oils in them because they are not over-roasted.

review/summary: Great to be able to buy this out-of-season; happy with shipping
review/text: I buy fresh pomegranate seeds as often as I can.  I have a Vita-mix blender and I make fruit and veggie smoothies every morning.  I was almost out of pomegranate seeds that I had frozen in the fall and decided on a whim to search the internet to find where I could buy them.  I was so happy to find that I could purchase them at Amazon.  Even after I ordered them, I was still a little skeptical.  My pomegranate seeds were shipped immediately FedEx and they arrived the next day packed in dry ice.  There were two buckets of still-frozen seeds.  They were not sticking together; it was like a bucket of frozen pebbles.  I just had to scoop them out into small zip-lock bags and put them in the freezer.  I am so happy to have enough seeds to last another 2-3 months.

review/text: I am addicted to pomegranate seeds. When they were in season, I bought lots just so I could enjoy and freeze half for when the season ended, but alas, I ate them all before Februrary.  These are superb quality and come in 5 lb bins.  They are actually cheaper than Whole Foods and I am just so pleased I can feed my addiction in the off-season. I eat them frozen and I actually prefer the large bins. The shipping is expensive but I still think it is worth it.

review/summary: I am unable to Split these capsules for a half serving ;-(
review/text: My family is very sensitive to everything.  Lots of allergies, overly sensitive to prescriptions, etc.  So, we regularly cut the dose in half of most things we use as a precaution.  In fact when I drink juice, I dilute it 60-75% with water - just becuase the flavors are so strong to me.<br /><br />So, I purchased these and planned to split these into smaller servings.  I was going to use my empty gel caps which I keep at home to be able to split them.  But, they do not use standard size gel caps!!<br /><br />I have always been able to use standard O,1,2 or 3 size capsules which I get from my local pharmacy.  But these Dehydrated Water Capsules must be imported, since they do not fit any of the standards US sizes.<br /><br />I am afraid to use the entire capsule all at once due to my very sensitive nature, so I can't really comment on its strength or it's flavor.  But if you are interested in splitting the serving size down I recommend you find an American source for these - as these can not be split.  jk  :-)

review/summary: PG Tips - My Daily Cup'a
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MREE4Y">PG Tips Loose Tea Jumbo Pack 1.5KG (3.3 LB) (England)</a><br /><br />I was introduced to PG Tips several years ago by an Englishman (now a citizen of the U.S.) who was quite insistent regarding proper brewing of the tea. He pointed out that brewing PG Tips too long would result in a bitter brew. His technique, which I follow, is to brew the loose tea, after warming the pot, for two minutes then immediately pouring up into cups. I like mine with a nice bit of milk but no sugar.<br /><br />I had great difficulty getting a good brew until I was given a 2-cup, Brown Betty. I initially used my father's tea pot in which he brewed Lipton's every after noon. It was too big (4 or 5 cup) and had the spout with pierced plug at its base which made it difficult to clean. Then I bought a tea pot and cup set put out by one of the greeting card companies. It was very cute and, hence, did not have the optimum shape to make good tea easily. It was a little smaller than my father's pot and the spout was clear. The spout did not rise as high as the lid so I had trouble keeping it from spilling before I could get it aimed at the cup. The two cup Brown Betty solved these difficulties.<br /><br />As to timing the brew, I at first attempted to keep my eye on the clock with a sweep second hand. I would get busy and miss the two minute point. I got a wind-up kitchen timer with a very loud bell. I warm the pot, put in one level tablespoon of tea, add 15 oz just boiled fresh filtered well water, put on the lid and cozy, then set the timer. When the bell sounds, I remove the cozy, place the strainer on my 16 oz travel mug, and carefully pour up the brew. Success every time! I add a couple of ounces of whole milk and enjoy my afternoon tea.

review/summary: A OK Tea ... There are better options though
review/text: If I had to say anything about PG Tips, compared to its main rival, Tetley, is just a feeling of something is lacking. My tea background is mostly one of drinking the amazing thing called Barry's Tea Gold Blend but I have been looking to branch out a little bit lately. Having ordered a few brands, I taste tested PG Tips using boiled Pur Filtered water; when drinking PG tips after brewed for 4 to 5 mins, the flavor just drops out. British tea is traditionally a little bit lighter than what the Irish prefer to drink so I was expecting a lighter and little less complex taste..<br /><br />There is no real finish to your sip, it just stops about midway through the pallet then then it's just nothing. Rather disappointing.

review/text: These dulse flakes add a "taste of Maine" to Japanese miso. To make a wonderful miso broth, boil water.  Put a very generously rounded teaspoon of Roland white miso into a mug or cup and two teaspoons or so of dulse.  Pour the boiling water into your cup or mug, whisk the ingredients together and enjoy! To make an even more authentic miso soup, add small cubes of tofu and the chopped green ends of scallions (and a little of the white part if you want).<br />This makes a wonderful soup and a tablespoon of dulse contains 330% of the DV  of iodine.  This is a good thing, since popular sea salt often contains no iodine - a necessary nutrient for thyroid health.

review/summary: Limited usefulness and strong fishy odor
review/text: I bought the huge quantity (4 bags) required and it is more that a lifetime supply. The reason I bought this is I had read in a book that it is a perfect salt substitute and has lots of potassium and magnesium, which are helpful as a natural remedy for high blood pressure. What I learned is that a "serving" of dulse (what you need to have to get the minerals promised) is something like two teaspoons. Believe me, when you see and smell this stuff you won't be eating two teaspoons in ten sittings, let alone as one serving. So far, I have put it in clam chowder because it's already fishy tasting anyway.<br /><br />If you are interested in getting more potassium and magnesium, I suggest Naked Juice or Bolthouse Farms Banana-strawberry juice. It has a ton of potassium and tastes pretty good. Also, you can just eat lots of fresh fruits and veggies and accomplish the same thing.

However, the pieces are quite big for a small puppy, and it took him a while to chew it up. He must not have been able to chew it up small enough, though, because he later threw up and there were large pieces of the sweet potato chips in his vomit! I would recommend these for an adult dog, or a puppy who is a better chewer and doesn't have a sensitive stomach. I guess I can hold on to these till he gets bigger, or when all his adult teeth have grown in.

review/text: These cookies are great and this is the best value I've found after searching around. I first had one of these cookies at Smoothie King and was impressed with the taste, lack of dairy, and the protein/calorie content (high for muscle building/increasing to a healthy weight).  Great for a protein boosting snack or boosting protein to build new muscle after a nice workout.<br /><br />The cookies are large--about 4.5 inches in diameter and look/taste very similar to the more familiar Alt. Baking Co.(ABC) lemon poppyseed cookies you can find at most health food stores.  I learned that the L&L cookies have way more protein, and more iron and calcium with a smidge less sugar.  Perhaps L&L don't have as high quality ingredients (???), but they are over a dollar cheaper per cookie when you compare the bulk prices to ABC. Thought that'd be an easy comparison that could save someone else some time.  `<br /><br />As I'm looking at the packaging for the cookie to write this review, I am noticing several typos in the ingredient list--seems there are still some kinks to get out, but hey, the cookie itself can't be beat!

We just buy them all now. :) We are vegan and there is no sign of animal products that we can find. These need to be split in two, but we love to share in our house anyway. I sometimes split mine in two and eat 1/2 with my coffee and then half for dessert later. They have so much fiber and protein in them, I'm surprised at how good they are.

I has previously tried their peanut butter cookie and liked it, so it was no surprise that I enjoyed this flavor as well! I love the idea that it's healthy while being a really tasty treat - it almost feels wrong! It is more dense than what people would be used to for a cookie, but it shouldn't alarm you since it's not a snack, but rather packed with protein, nutrients and vitamins. You won't be disappointed with its flavor or its purpose to be a complete cookie.

review/text: I'm surprised there aren't reviews about these yet! I first came upon them at Whole Foods and am happy to see them offered as a subscribe & save item here. I haven't tried the other flavors, but I can definitely stand by the lemon poppyseed cookie -- it's not too sweet, not too lemony tart, and soft and chewy -- really tasty. Bonus that they are vegan, but what I really like is the amount of protein packed in. I stick to having half a cookie at a time since that amounts to about to the same amount of calories as a Luna or Zone bar (which average 9 or 10g of protein). Still, for 15g of protein in the entire cookie, 360 calories isn't horrible, considering it's really a dessert, too. I'll venture out to the other flavors soon!

review/summary: Highly Recommended!
review/text: I ordered this pack after reading reviews of many other products as well and happy to say I wasn't disappointed at all. I love white chocolate so naturally I loved that flavor the best. Although I don't like dark chocolate, that too was not bad! I mean I would drink it and like it even. I wish we could customize what we wanna have in the pack though. If so I would order most of it (if not all) to be white, being the white choc fan I am. But in no way that means other flavors are bad.<br />It is sweet and true to the label (no need to add anything else other than water).

review/summary: convenient hot chocolate
review/text: I first found these a few years ago in a local store but they are only available around the Christmas season so I was very pleased to find them on Amazon who never fails me.  Obviously at this price they aren't gourmet but they all do have a good taste and it's so convenient to just open up a packet.  They also aren't that high calorie for those counting them.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: My family loves this cocoa!  We have purchased this selection before and will do so again.  Usually this is a treat we enjoy in colder months but we ordered this in July.  The flavor selection is excellent-there is truly something for everyone and not an "off" flavor in the bunch.  We highly recommend.

review/summary: Hot Chocolate Lovers watch out! :)
review/text: I don't drink tea or coffee so hot chocolate is my go to warm-me-up drink! I have always been happy and satisfied with Swiss Miss or Nestle as long as I used a packet and a half to make it a little more chocolaty but after this I don't know if I can go back! I got this pack as a Christmas gift and it is so delicious and rich that when I finished the last of these packets off I was ultra disappointed with my cup of Nestle's (even with two packets in it it tasted too watery!) I even mixed flavors for fun like rasperry with vanilla or graham with artic white and they turned out great! Fun variety pack to find your favorites and the best packet hot chocolate mix I've ever tasted!

review/summary: DO NOT BUY
review/text: You will not receive AT ALL what the product describes! I got only 35 packets, and I had about 25 tiramisu flavored, which is not very good! It should not say you get six of each flavor, that was a blatant lie.

review/summary: Great with hot milk!
review/text: The different varieties are all good. I enjoyed all the flavors. Mixing them with hot water was very tasty, but they're even better with hot milk.<br /><br />The only downside is each pouch is only good for 6 oz. That's a pretty small cup.
