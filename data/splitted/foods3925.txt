review/summary: sugar and its origin now..
review/text: taste great and a good buy.  Sugar is all gmo from my understanding now.  We are now moving away from all gmo products.  They contain roundup poison in them permanently and carry it to the next seed.  This will destroy<br />your intestines.  Thoughts of concern for those who want to listen.  Even if organic if not labeled no gmo or heritage it is gmo.

review/summary: Delicious flavors!
review/text: I ordered these little organic lollipops to have on hand for my grandchildren when they are here.  I don't think the 4 of them can eat all 500, so I decided to share some with others including each one of their classes at school.  All the children loved the flavors.  They are not just the regular strawberry, grape, lemon and so forth.  Once you try them, you have to have another because they are really good.  I feel good about giving them to the children since they are organic.  Thanks for offering these!

review/summary: A big hit with my customers!
review/text: Based on the reviews, I purchased these lollies to give to my customers even though I had never actually tasted them.  I sell natural beauty products so, I thought they would be a good fit for my boutique.  Well, they are very yummy and my customers can't get enough.  I swear I've had a couple of customers come back in just for these.  Because of popularity, I had to increase my subscription from three months to one month just to keep them on hand.  What I like about them is that they all have full flavor which is unexpected from candy that does not have any artificial flavors.

review/summary: really yummy AND healthy enough
review/text: I am so very lucky to get this bag full of yummy treats for my family and friends at such a great price (only ~13 bucks!) Unlike some other reviewers, my bag was better in terms of the ratios of the flavors (amounts ranging from 25 to 50) The only flavor I didn't like is Very Very Cherry. But I never liked this flavor anyways. When we had a large picnic, I brought some of these and they were a hit! Everyone was asking about where I got them and commenting how tasty they were, etc. The kids were thrilled and they kept coming to ask for more. All in all, I am very happy with the quality and the features of this product. I'd recommend and buy it again.

review/text: I bought these to give out to my students at school for rewards, and they love them.  They always ask where I got them because they want to go buy them.  I have always given out candy, but used to give out those little Dum Dum pops.  With those I always had the yucky flavors left at the end of a bag that no one wanted.  With these I never do because there are no yucky Yummy Earth flavors!  They are delicious and the kids love them--plus I don't have to be concerned about allergies to food dyes or anything.  My own kids at home love them, too.  The 5 pound bag is a great deal for the quantity I give out!

review/summary: Lollipops
review/text: These are the only lollipops that my youngest son will eat or ask for.  I like them too!  Flavors are very good and I appreciate the organic aspect.  Had previously purchased these both individually and in a smaller (150 ct) pkg size at my local whole foods store, so I already knew the quality before purchasing this bulk package.  Good flavor assortment, although as in the 150 ct pkg, the grape and cherry flavor pops seem the least common.  Thankfully, my kids are not grape obsessed - they prefer the sour apple and pomegranate.  I am most impressed with the blueberry flavor, since that is not a common lollipop flavor in general and the flavor is very true to real blueberries.  Will definately purchase again - if I ever find the end of this bag!

review/summary: lolly pops for the kids
review/text: YummyEarth Organic lollipops are the best thing that we could have done for the kids that come to see Dr.D.  We treat lots of kids with behavioral issues and learning issues and the whole spectrum of autism and most of them have food allergys and they can't have so many of the treats that most people take for granted.  These are not made with oils from nuts or wheat or corn. So the kids who never get treats get a treat. I use to get them at the organic stores here in Dallas but they stopped selling them in bulk where I was at so I decided to see if you could get them on Amazon.  Not only did they have them but they had them at a great price so I get them in 5lb bags and my kids love them and it makes them feel like someone is thinking about their needs too.

review/text: I love these lollipops.  Every flavor is great except for pomegranate pucker it has a slight medicine taste.  Besides that these suckers are delicious.  I got an even amount of each flavor in my bag.  I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about when they say you get like 5 of one flavor and 100 of another.  My favorite flavor is wetface watermelon.  With the 5-pound bag and the super-saver shipping you end up paying like $0.07 a sucker.  What a deal!  I highly recommend these suckers.

review/text: There are over 300 small lollipops in this bag, and each one of them is a sweet little treat.  Mango Tango, Blueberry Tooberry - excellent flavors.  The kids we handed them out to for Halloween loved them, and I certainly enjoyed the twenty or so I squirreled away for my fellow employees and I.  I honestly couldn't tell you what was (or wasn't) in the lollipops that made them taste great, but I can tell you I didn't feel like I had been sweetened out after eating one of them.  If you like fruity candy and not feeling like crud after eating some, these are good way to fulfill a craving and deny some sour stomach.

Yummy flavors, that's surprisingly all natural & organic (how can anything so delicious be so organic?).<br /><br />Not too sweet, and really intense flavors, as well.<br /><br />CONS: Packaging needs heavy improvement, as some of the sticks protrudes on the thin plastic packaging. Also had 2 opened pops, and 2 sticks (without the lollies) inside.<br /><br />Varieties were inconsistent, had way too many watermelons, and too few blueberries.<br /><br />...but who's complaining anyways??? :)

review/text: UPDATED 09-02-10 - We hear you loud and clear, amazon lolly lovers!!! We have changed to an almost even assortment of flavors per 5lb bulk bag and Counter Bin EXCLUSIVELY FOR AMAZON so make sure you are buying from Amazon directly (it will say "Ships from and sold by Amazon" under IN STOCK).  Sorry, the assortment is still random when buying this item via a 3rd party, such as DAB Nutrition "fulfilled by Amazon". Please note that the assortment is ALMOST even as compared to a completely random flavor assortment. Your feedback drives this company from ingredient requests and allergy needs to flavor requests to flavor ratios. We appreciate your feedback and hope that you know that we are listening. I am truly sorry for posting this note here with a 5 star review since I do not want anyone to think that we are trying to mislead anyone with a "fake" product review, but I could not really figure out any other way to communicate this to our Amazon friends.

review/summary: Over-enthusastic Reviews Strike Again
review/text: If there is a great sale on an Amazon product and I have amazon gift certificates, invariably I will make a purchase if the reviews are up in the sky.  And just as often, when the product arrives, it does so fresh from it's crash back to earth.<br /><br />And so it goes with Yummy Earth's Organic Lollipops.  I am now the owner of 700 of them, and while they aren't disgusting, they definitely aren't deserving of the praise received.  Most reviewers have given them 5 stars, a constellation I now refer to as "Ignoria-Major."<br /><br />The flavors are OK, ranging from the avoidable Grape and Strawberry, to the sparse but good Sour Apple and Blueberry.  And despite the photographs, these lollipops are relatively small; more like small pieces of hard candy thrown on a stick for lollipops sake.<br /><br />For the reviewer who claimed they lacked sugar, the primary ingredient is Evaporated Cane Juice.  That's sugar, just not refined in the way sugar usually is.<br /><br />So my suggestion is simple, and one I address more to myself than perhaps you:  Don't be afraid of missing out on the sale, because it might actually be a good thing.  Find the item at a local store, buy a small amount, and go from there.

review/text: I bought this product after reading the reviews.  And I must say they are sooo good.  I thought Jolly Rancher flavors were great, but these are by far better than ranchers.  They don't burn your tongue, and the size of the lollipop is perfect - not to little, not too much.  I took it to my workplace and folks loved it.  I also shared it with a friend who's a teacher and she passed it to the kids in her class as treats.  She told me the kids loved it as well.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because there is room for improvement - I wish they add more flavors.

When I found them on sale on Amazon (a little over $0.04 per lollipop), I bought 2 bags for us and more for our friends.  Everyone I've given some to LOVES them.  It's great to see even picky kids who normally eat the artificially flavored candy, saying that a pomegranate lollipop is delicious! :)<br /><br />In the latest bags I ordered (and my friend found the same), I'm sad to see there are no ginger or lemon flavored lollipops.  I love the ginger and she loves the lemon.  I hope they haven't discontinued them!  I am excited to see more blueberry ones now, though.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE!

She loved the sour apple; although, it's not really sour...more applesauce taste.<br />Everytime someone tried one of the Lollipops, they would say how good they were.<br />I loved every flavor but wasn't too hot on the watermelon.  Not that it didn't taste good, it just wasn't very "watermelony".  All other flavors were true to their name & flavor.<br />Highly recommend!

review/summary: Yay, we can eat the red ones!
review/text: My step-son is extremely sensitive to artificial dyes.  I was so happy to find a hard candy that we could give him and not have any behavior problems for a week.  I also like that they are dairy free as my youngest has a milk allergy.  Some of the flavors are not what you might think of to give kids, but all three of mine love them.  The only one I personally don't like is the Wet Face Watermelon, but I generally don't like watermelon flavored things.  My kids like all of them, though.  We got the large bag when it was the deal of the day since I couldn't find it cheaper elsewhere.  Usually the canister is enough to last all year for us, but with the large bag we could give some away at Halloween, I could take some into work for my special needs clients, and still have plenty left.

review/summary: The Best Lollipops Ever!
review/text: Our family loves Yummy Earth lollipops! This 5-lb bag lasted us over a year, and I used them everytime my oldest son needed to bring a treat to preschool for a party favor bag. I knew that the kids were getting an organic treat with nothing artificial added, but the kids just loved the cool flavor names and yummy taste. Some of the more unique flavors that I wasn't sure my kids would like (such as Mango Tango and Pomegranate Pucker) turned out to be their favorites. Yummy Earth makes excellent quality products that will make everyone happy from the foodie to the kid looking for a sweet treat. We're ordering more. Enjoy!

review/summary: Sweet mother of all pops!
review/text: As always, Amazon shipping was super fast.  The YummyEarth Organic Lollipop 5 pound bag came up as a Gold Box item.  For less than $10, I gave them a try.  For all the great things that this company publicizes about these pops, I figure they can't be worse than other regular candies.<br /><br />The flavors are all pretty spectacular.  These are definitely not super sweet and don't cover the insides of your mouth with a thick gooey coating like other standard lollipops made from HFCS.  The package I received has this distribution of flavors:<br /><br />TooBerry Blueberry = 71 (21.8%)<br />Strawberry Smash = 66 (20.3%)<br />Mango Tango = 50 (15.4%)<br />Googly Grape = 38 (11.7%)<br />Wet-Face Watermelon = 36 (11.1%)<br />Pomegranate Pucker = 28 (08.6%)<br />Apple Tart = 20 (06.2%)<br />Very Very Cherry = 15 (04.6%)<br /><br />I'm giving it only 4 stars out of 5 because my 5 pound sack contained only 325 pieces of candy.  That's only 93% of the advertised count.  It contained a few missing wrappers, a few bare sticks, and a few errant wrappers.

My husband takes some to work, I keep them in my purse and even my parents have taken to them. The variety pack allows you to try all the flavors, I really like the mango and the pomegranate. Try them I'm sure you will be pleased with these sweet suckers without all the junk of other lollipops!

The candy has a lovely, smooth mouth-feel, perfect amount of sweetness, and complex, wonderful flavors. The wholesome organic ingredients & lack of chemicals & HFC is a fantastic bonus, but even if you're buying strictly on flavor, these are hands-down winners. We get a lot of guests with special diets, so I'm also psyched that they're safe for almost any wacky food allergy. Yum.

I'm not a big sweet eater, so when I do eat sweets, I like the idea of having no "junk" or "chemicals" or "altered" food.  THESE POPS ARE DELICIOUS AND I FEEL NO GUILT WHEN EATING THEM.  I'll be handing out these delicious and natural candies to the neighborhood kids during Halloween!  Oh, I think my favorite flavor is the pomegranate.  If you're going to eat sweets, why not eat the kind that are colored using carrots and beets and other natural fruit and veggie extracts instead of things called "Red 50"?!  With this candy I get the natural color AND the side benefits of the concentrated nutrients in fruit and vegetable extracts!  Thanks Yummy Earth Goddesses!

review/summary: Great tasting but not evenly distributed
review/text: As I had gotten older, my taste for sweets has dimished.<br />I now find most American made candy to be too sweet.<br />Jolly Ranch, which was one of my favorites from my Jr. high days, are now a bit too sweet.<br />I found these to be at the right level of sweetness.<br />I think some people complain about the taste is because they prefer the artificial sweetness found in most candy.  Nothing wrong with that (except for the health thing. :D).<br /><br />The one minor complaint I have with the 5-pound bag is the flavor distribution.<br />As several people had already mentioned, they are not distributed evenly.<br />Unlike one of the commentor, I don't believe the "to get rid of their overstock.".<br />My uneven distribution is different than other's.<br />(20%) Wet-face Watermelon<br />(20%) Pomegranate Pucker<br />(18%) Googly Grape<br />(10%) Tooberry Blueberry<br />(12%) Tart Sour Apple<br />(12%) Mango Tango<br />(6%) Very Very Cherry<br />(2%) Strawberry Smash<br /><br />Not a big deal to me because I like all of them, but my kids are more picky.<br /><br />[soapbox] Although these are organic candy, they are still candy, which are bad for your teeth.  Please watch your (and your children's) intake of these delicious lollipops. [/soapbox] :D

review/summary: Yes, they really are good!
review/text: I am a mom of four, who tries to balance a limited grocery budget with the healthiest food that my family can eat.  I keep making more and more changes as I gather more information and products like this become so readily available.  Anyway, I have been concerned about food dyes lately but still wanted my kids to be able to have some kind of a candy treat.  I thought I would give these a try.  I just got them yesterday.  I haven't given any to the kids yet (I am saving them for Christmas), but I also didn't want to wait until then and find out from the kids that they were horrible.  So, I performed my own taste test of three of the flavors, and I found them to be delicious.  I know the kids will love them!

review/text: The taste of the candies were okay but I don't see a reason to buy a 5 lb bag of these candies again, unless there is a ridiculous sale lol. They were tart and sweet in flavor; I liked all of them, especially the blueberry, apple, and strawberry. The distribution in flavors were not even and less than the quoted 325 pops were in the bag. I counted 312 give or take a few. They were mostly the same thickness, though some were thinner or thicker than others. When I get sugar cravings, I think I'll just eat an airhead or gummy bear lol.

review/summary: A healthy SWEET alternative to a sucker treat for your child!
review/text: I was really happy when I found this item for my son. I've used suckers in the past to treat my son but the fact that I was allowing such trash to enter his body really wore on my mind. When I found these organic suckers, I was so excited. Amazon delivered these quickly and securely. My son and I tried them when they arrived, and to my surprise, they tasted REALLY good. My son seems to enjoy them too, not quite as much as the 'regular' suckers I suppose however. The only thing I would have to say that is negative would be that these suckers are maybe a little too sweet! Yes, an organic item that is sweeter than non-organic. It's only the sugar that is naturally found in the fruits used to make the suckers, but they are SWEET. Overall I would really recommend this to healthy-minded moms as a treat for kiddos!

review/summary: Much better than expected
review/text: I gotta say that as soon as I saw organic I almost passed this item over. Since it was on a special sale and my wife is an organic freak and my daughter loves lollipops I decided to take a chance. I have tried both the cherry and the grape flavors and I can honestly say these are the best tasting lollipops I have ever had. I havent tried the other flavors yet because I am generally afraid to try new things, but I also tend to stick with something when I know I like it. I will eventually try the other flavors when I run out of cherry and grape. My wife loves the mango flavor. I initially thought this 5 lb box would last over a year but I think I will eat 5 of these a day at my office if I am not careful. Soooo tasty!!!

review/text: I just got them today and sampled a few of the flavors. I was expecting more variety in the flavors but they mainly have that same sour taste to them. It's a bit disappointing but I can always leave outside my dorm for Halloween. Still a good snack for someone with allergies, but I feel like they'll get tiring fast. Definitely can't have too many at once, since they're so sour.

review/summary: Yummy Lollipops hardly assorted
review/text: I was disappointed because I wanted to make up party favor bags containing each of the flavors but whereas there were tons of cherry there only a few - 13 to be exact - of the sour apple lollipops which of course is everyone's favorite. I had to buy more of the sour apple from a local organic store.  Typically when a vendor bags an assortment they make sure there are equal amounts of each flavor but not in this case.

review/summary: Good, but flavors are hit and miss--uneven distribution of some flavors
review/text: I for one like that they're smaller--It's by weight, not by lollipop, and if you really want you can have more than one anyways. Who wants their kids eating such big candies anyways? The flavors tend to be hit or miss.<br /><br />Pomegranate Pucker tasted like cough syrup, Too Berry Blueberry tasted exactly like blueberry, with a hint of creaminess. Mango Tango tasted like dehydrated mango pieces that they put in organic cereal--it tasted stale, like dried mango that has been on the shelf for far too long. Strawberry Smash tasted like strawberry Fig Newtons which if you haven't had before don't really taste like strawberries. On the plus side, Very Cherry tasted like any other cherry lollipop, Sour Apple tasted like a fresh pear (probably sweetened with pear juice) and Wet Face Watermelon comes close to Jolly Rancher's watermelon with a slightly muddled flavor that isn't as crisp as Jolly Rancher's.<br /><br />I've gone through the entire bag and sorted them to find out approx how many of each there are in the bag. Note that I didn't count each one (sorting them took long enough as it were).<br /><br />Sour Apple Tart- 25%><br />Very Very Cherry- 20%&lt;<br />Strawberry Smash- 20%><br />Pomegranate Pucker: 10%><br />Mango Tango: 10%&lt;<br />Wet Face Watermelon-10%><br />Too Berry Blueberry: 4%&lt;<br />Googly Grape:1%><br />Blood Orange Cocktail- 0%<br /><br />I'm not sure why I didn't get any Blood Orange Cocktails but the following flavors seem to have been discontinued and will not be included in future bags (unless you get an older bag)<br /><br />Googly Grape (being phased out, only got 8 in the entire bag--tasted like any other grape candy)<br />Mango Tango<br />Ginger Zest<br />Cheeky Lemon<br /><br />Star for Star explanation:<br />+1* for organic ingredients<br />+1* for invested founders<br />+1* for cherry, apple (just call it pear!) and watermelon flavors<br />-1* for mango and pomegranate<br />-1* because premium gourmet lollipops still take the cake in terms of flavor. It's hard to beat the cherry/strawberry/blueberry cheesecake and raspberry lemonade flavors other brands offer.<br /><br />Looks like most of the grosser flavors like pomegranate are going to the neighborhood kids this halloween. The best part of these is that they don't splinter or cut your tongue like a razor blade and don't leave a chemical aftertaste that some lollies do. Hopefully my kid nieces will enjoy these tremendously, as they're the ones I originally bought them for.<br /><br />Notes to the founders of Yummy Earth:<br /><br />I'd like to mention that the naming of Wet Face watermelon is very unfortunate as it reminds me of an offensive racial slur in case the owners of the company happen to come across this review.<br /><br />I'd love to see the following flavors added to the line: cinnamon, lemon and a true sour green apple (add a citric acid to the apple recipe). Keep pear and reintroduce it as "Perfectly Pear", or whatever wacky name you guys like. Create a cheesecake line and I'll single handedly keep you in business!<br /><br />Now if you excuse me, I'm going to brush my teeth furiously and eat some saltines to calm my stomach after taste testing everything.

I didn't expect an equal assortment of each flavor, but the disparity is ridiculous.  These 5-pound bags appear to be how Yummy Earth gets rid of their overstock.

We do what's called a "Fluoride Varnish" treatment to the kids teeth from 9 months to 3yrs of age, and at times have to give vaccinations, and as a treat for their bravery, and to stay true to their dental care, I was looking for a candy that was sugar free and dye free but taste great as well, because everyone knows that kids are our best critics. So I Bought these yummy suckers and tried them out. They were a huge hit, as well as with the parents, that were diabetic, everyone wanted to know where I got them from. Most couldn't believe that there wasn't any sugar in them, and that this product was all natural. These are fabulous, I can't say enough about them. I have given the web address to so many who have asked about them. There's a lot that comes in the bag, more than I was expecting for the price, but I was very please, well worth it. Now I find myself hiding the suckers so the staff and parents won't eat them all. I am now a repeat customer<br /><br />GOOD WORK YUMMYEARTH

review/summary: Organic but NOT allergy-free!!
review/text: I ordered these lollipops because I have numerous food allergies. As with most Amazon food items, it was virtually impossible to figure out what actual ingredients were. I was very excited at the thought of being able to be able to enjoy "candy" again though so I went ahead and ordered them. After getting them, I ate a couple the first night and woke up the next morning congested and with a sore throat. I thought nothing of it other than that it was spring-related allergies. I ate a few in the next few days or so though and had the same reaction. I then read the ingredient list and discovered brown rice syrup on it. I am really tired of companies that market themselves as "organic" and "all-natural" sticking GRAINS into everything! Rice is not good for you - and if you have an intolerance to grains like I do - DO NOT buy these lollipops. I have Celiac disease and my body does better without grains and these lollipops!

review/summary: Our family, all grown-ups, really likes these candies
review/text: I bought the 5-pound bag of organic lollies on a whim; I hardly ever buy candy. But I know my son and my DIL do like to eat sweets, and so I gave them a bunch of these, thinking that these candies might be less toxic than most. Best of all is that there is no high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in them. (They are sweetened with cane juice). HFCS is linked with diabetes and it is in virtually ALL the sweets in the US. I'm also glad that here are no GMO's--another ubiquitous "yucky" thing we have here so much. Also, none of those artificial dyes which anyway come from petrochemicals, so why should they be "edible"? They made all the colors and flavors from PLANTS! Of the flavors I have tried so far, I like "sour apple". Tart and tasty, and not too sour. The strawberry tastes nice and fruity. The grape tastes basically like every other grape candy. There's lots of flavors.<br /><br />Here's a list of the ingredients, in case you want to know: Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Rice Syrup, Non-GMO Citric Acid (from beet sugar-not corn), Natural Flovers, may contain Organic Black Carrots, Organic Black Currant, Organic Apple, Organic Carrot, Organic Pumkin, Organic Alfalfa.<br /><br />Recommended. Enjoy!

review/text: So, I bought these to suck on during my natural labor.  Boy were they tasty!  They are delicious and organic, what could be better?  Also, I have used them for my baby when she gets her vaccinations.  The hospital staff dripped sucrose (sugar water) into my newborn baby's mouth to distract her while taking blood samples from her heel. I was shocked at how she didn't make a peep, but focused on the sweet flavor in her mouth.  Now, any time she gets a vaccine, I put one of these into her mouth for 10 seconds and she doesn't even notice the shot.  Then I get to finish the lollipop.  It's amazing!  And, for those that are wondering, I do exclusively nurse my baby and the sucker hasn't affected that at all.

review/text: I found the 45% off deal on a "daily deal website" I check often and after reading that they were Organic...the only thought crossing my mind was GROSS!  I am big into fruits & veggies but every time I try some food that is labeled as "organic", I am almost always disgusted by the taste OR the texture.  I read the reviews on this product on Amazon as well as the other site and pretty much everyone RAVED about how great they were!  I watched the informative video and figured I'd give them a shot.  I figured that if they were horrible, I could always give them out at Halloween (yeah...I'm mean like that sometimes...sorry!)  I just received my lollipops today and I've already tried four of them!  I was absolutely FLOORED by the taste, smell and texture of these lollipops!  Not only did they smell great and the texture wasn't funny...they taste FANTASTIC!  I HIGHLY recommend these to ANYONE that is looking for an alternative to the "big box retail/dollar store" candy that you often give your children.  I plan on sending a bunch of these to my husband and his unit that is currently in Iraq as they will go nuts over these!  The ONLY thing that I can find to "complain" about (and it's really not a complaint...it's more of the single, minuscule difference between these and regular lollipops) is the fact that they opaque whereas regular lollipops are more clear.  Again, that's REALLY nitpicking and it doesn't bother me in the least but I thought it was worth mentioning.  Even the variety of flavors is amazing!  I highly doubt there is a child on this planet that won't be able to find at least one flavor they like!  Another great thing is the fact that the expiration date isn't until January 2011 so if I really stretch out the two bags I ordered, I have the next two years of Halloween covered!  SHORT VERSION: JUST BUY THESE AS THEY ARE FANTASTIC!  YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL THAT THEY ARE "ORGANIC" AS THEY TASTE BETTER THAN THE INORGANIC ONES WE USUALLY BUY!  Thanks YummyEarth and keep up the great work!  I can't wait to receive the Candy Drops I ordered along with these :)

review/text: I am very pleased in the quality of your suckers.  I am a big fan of organic foods.  I had to try one sucker even tho I purchased them for Halloween.  They do have a lot of great natural flavor.  I purchased three 350 count bags, they arrived in excellent condition too. I would  purchase them again.

review/summary: Great Lollipops but bad variety
review/text: While these taste great, I can't give it 5 stars due to the fact that I got mostly  blueberry flavor. I was expecting more of the mango but I only counted 7 of them, a bunch of the sour apples and cherry.<br />Once they do a better job at the variety, I will buy more but not for now. They should probably sell them by flavors.

review/summary: Wow these are good!
review/text: I decided to try these out after seeing a promotional price, and I am SO glad I did.  At first I was wondering what in the world I was going to do with FIVE POUNDS of lollipops, but I now realize that won't be much of a problem around my house (expiration date is two years from now, so there's another plus).<br />The flavors are very unique - not too sweet, not too tart.  My children love them!  I also like the size - I don't feel too guilty giving these to my children when three lollipops (serving size) is 17g sugar.  They're the perfect size.<br />According to the package, they are organic, no artifical dyes or flavors.  I've started taking them to work and they go fast - much, much better than your run of the mill store-bought treat.

review/summary: the best!
review/text: These are the greatest lollipops ever! I wrote to them regarding the variety of flavors and the fact that they are made in Mexico. Here's the feedback from the company:<br /><br />The standards are set by our co-founder, Sergio Bicas, who proudly grew up<br />in Mexico City.  We have very high health and quality standards and proudly<br />have over 60 fair wage workers as well.<br />Thanks for asking!!!  Every assortment is packed randomly.  Those are surely<br />extreme, but probably real, examples detailed on Amazon as they have sold<br />zillions of bags.  after seeing those reviews, we have worked hard to make<br />our flavor ratios more predictable, but the assortments are still random.<br />Otherwise our cost and the retail will go through the roof.<br /><br />Sounds good to me!

review/summary: Great, flavor ALMOST perfect
review/text: Like many reviewers, I bought these when they were on a gold box special. I thought not only are they a great item to give out on Halloween but the company sounds great. I am eating one right now as I am even typing this review! (Mango Tango)<br />I think the flavors are great, but not every flavor is for everyone. One reviewer said he liked the blueberry but hated the strawberry, well I love the strawberry and hate the blueberry. The one reason I am not giving this product 5 stars is because of its sourness. Every flavor seems to have a small level of sourness to it, maybe its because of all the organic ingredients but it does not ruin the flavor of the lollipops.<br />Now I do not have any allergies, nor do I have anyone close to me with allergies but I bought these anyways just to give it a shot. For those who have children or are allergic to corn, glucose etc. themselves, this is the PERFECT treat.<br />(oh and I did not realize how big a 5lb bag was until I got it in the mail, HOLY CRAP! a lot of lollipops!)<br />And in contrast to what another reviewer said, I like the small size of the lollipops, makes me eat less =)

review/text: Ok, so now these are the latest and greatest thing around our house. We LOVE these suckers! The size is perfect and the flavors are delightfully simple and fresh.<br /><br />I went through and counted every single lolly after I opened the bag and they contained exactly the right count.<br /><br />I enjoy introducing them to people while telling them that they are 100% natural. They're always surprised!
