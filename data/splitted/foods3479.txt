review/summary: Quite impressed...
review/text: I wasn't sure if I was gonna care for this or not but I'm pleased to say that i actually like it quite a bit.  I only drink plain water.  I can't stand flavored water.  I don't even like lemon in my water.  I've tried crystal light before and didn't care for it.  This, I really enjoyed.<br /><br />I'm dieting and basically the only thing that I drink day in and day out is plain water and black coffee to save on calories.  I like sweet tea quite a bit but for whatever reason, every time I make it at home over the past few years it seems to give me a sore throat.  This little bottle has now given me another option.  It tastes great.  It actually tastes like a jug of sweet tea that I would purchase from the grocery store but it has no calories.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that I'm not big on the way that it squirts out.  You have to really give it a good squeeze and make sure it's at a tilted angle to avoid squirting it out of the cup with it's powerful blast.<br /><br />Overall I really like this sweet tea flavor and I would recommend it to anybody who like sweet tea and especially if you are watching your calories.

review/summary: Useful, but...
review/text: I've tried three flavors of Mio Liquid and really like the product, but I don't think this flavor is very good.<br /><br />The bottle works very well and is unlikely to accidentally leak.  My routine is to fill the glass halfway, squirt, and then finish filling, at which point the drink is self-mixed.  Unlike powders, there's no residue in the glass, making these particularly convenient for flavoring water in a canteen of some kind.<br /><br />This flavor didn't work for me.  I don't mind the sucralose (aka splenda) and acesulfame k sweetener, and personally do not detect any unpleasant aftertaste (though you may disagree), but the ratio of sweet to tea is tipped too far over on the sweet side.  You can barely taste anything but sweet.<br /><br />However, if you like your tea that way, this is a good value when compared to alternative soft drinks.

review/summary: A good idea
review/text: I love sweet tea (my favorite is the Chick-fil-a, just to give you an idea of the flavor I like), so I thought I'd give this a try.  It's a really neat idea and the bottle is small enough to fit in your pocket, a small purse, or your car console.  It has zero calories, sugar, etc., so it is a diet drink and tastes like it no matter how much or little you use.  The one thing I really don't like about it is that it does not drip out in small drops, you squeeze it and the least that you can squeeze out is about a full tablespoon, which means your water really can't ever taste like water with a touch of tea, it tastes like watered down tea.  I was hoping you could do smaller drops to get more of a light flavored water taste, but it doesn't work that way.

review/summary: What's Wrong With Just Drinking Water?
review/text: I much prefer the taste of plain water or maybe water with a little lemon in it to this product at least in the sweet tea flavor.  To me just a little bit of the liquid made the water taste flat and odd while adding more made it sickeningly sweet.  It does come in a cute little container and I appreciate that it doesn't need to be refrigerated and is perhaps less messy than powdered drinks.  But otherwise I am unimpressed.

review/summary: Pretty good flavor and very convenient as a take-along
review/text: I was surprised at how good this tasted. No, it won't compare to fresh made sweet tea, but it's pretty good. I like how easy it is to use - you can put in just a touch if you want a hint of flavor, or use a lot if you want a stronger taste.<br /><br />I also like that it has zero calories. However, there is a bit of an artificial sweetener aftertaste, which knocks it down to 4 stars.<br /><br />The packaging is also a strong point. While it does use a lot of plastic, it makes it very easy to toss into a bag to take with you. For example, my gym has some really poor tasting water (strong chlorine smell) in the drinking fountains. This will be handy to have with me when I run out of my own bottled water and have to refill the bottle at the fountain. (They sell bottled water but I just can't fathom paying two bucks for water at the gym when I can bring my own tap water for next to nothing).<br /><br />Nice concept, thoughtful packaging and decent taste. Definitely worth trying.

review/summary: I love MIO, but not the Sweet Tea flavor
review/text: The Mango Peach and Berry/Pomegranate MIO flavors are absolutely wonderful; with those, 3 squirts in a litre of water produced the perfect flavor for my water.  However, with this Sweet Tea flavor, I couldn't strike the right balance. Either it tasted like tea that was flat and weak (3 squirts), or too sweet when I tried more.

review/summary: Handy, Small, Easy to Use
review/text: This is a great idea.  A liquid water enhancer that comes in a small container.  It would fit well in a purse or handbag.  It squirts out easily and mixes with water.  I put some in a glass of water from the refrigerator and it tastes pretty good.  It did not require any sugar - it tastes like typical sweet tea.<br /><br />If you want to have this handy for mixing with water, it's really convenient.  It tastes pretty good, and could be used anytime you don't have a lot of space to carry something (like hiking) but want something more in your water.

review/text: The sweet tea flavor is very tasty and refreshing without any added sugar or calories.  It is very conveniently packaged for use away from home as well.  I just pop it in my purse and I'm good-to-go.  I get to control how much flavor is added according to my taste and mood.  Because it is a liquid, there is no concern with additive powders that don't dissolve properly.  I'm a fan.

review/summary: Good to take while on the road traveling
review/text: One tiny bottle of MIO easily makes 20+ drinks, so there are a lot of uses packed into this small package. This makes MIO perfect for keeping in a bag or in the car while out. Bring a reusable bottle of water, or keep some bottled waters in the car and add a few drops and you instantly have a sweet tea drink. Each tiny drop has a lot of flavor in it, so you on need a few to get the taste you're looking for. I like being able to adjust the strength of flavor to the size of the drink as well. If I bring a big travel bottle of water I am able to add more, or if I'm home and using just have a little cup, a drop or two will do.<br /><br />However I like the fruit punch flavor of the MIO better than this sweet tea. To get a lot of flavor into such a little package, it would seem a pretty strong artificial sweeter is used, and it does tend to leave an aftertaste that somewhat detracts from the tea taste. I think with the fruit punch flavor, it's a little less noticeable.<br /><br />If you don't really notice the taste of artificial sweeteners, than MIO is the perfect way to make yourself a quick drink on the go.

review/summary: Not As Good As Original BBQ Lays, But Still Worth Tasting
review/text: Lay's Kettle Cooked Mesquite BBQ Potato Chips<br /><br />Food Review<br /><br />Grade: B+<br /><br />...Now as a big fan of regular Barbecue Lays, as soon as I saw the ads for new Kettle Cooked Barbecue Lays (specifically, Mesquite Barbecue--something I was hesitant about at first) I knew I had to at least try it once. Picking up a bag the first chance I had, I wondered if the Mesquite Barbecue would match up to the great taste of regular Barbecue. Also, I've never truly liked Kettle Cooked chips, and always eat regular or baked if I have the chance over them. What it came to was that these new type of chips only had one thing going for them: I've always loved barbecue chips.<br /><br />Putting one into my mouth, I immediately noticed the difference it had--it was more seasoned than most Lays, and the fact that it was Kettle Cooked made it crunch in my mouth more heavily than normal chips would. The extra seasoning isn't bad though--although if you eat too many at one time you do get rather tired of eating them; the crunch, well loud, is thoroughly satisfying. The bag size isn't bad either--while it is smaller (or at least seems) than normal Lays chip bags, the extra flavor and overall quality make it worth it.<br /><br />In the end, these chips should be eaten like they're cooked: in small batches, and with quality food like them. Don't eat these chips with Mexican food like I did my first time...;)

review/text: This makes some mighty good Strawberry Lemonade.  I just have to remind myself that it has sugar in it and I can't drink 6 cups a day of it... kinda hard to stop.  It would be great to have a Diet version of this, but the taste would change drastically which is probably why they don't have it in a Diet form.<br /><br />Don't breath in when preparing some of these drink mixes (depends on how small of granulation) or else find most in nose and lungs.  The cloud of lemonade powder that forms in the air in front of me is pretty remarkable.

review/summary: Middle ground
review/text: Nantucket seems to be the "default" flavor that the box stores who sell Keurig keep on the shelf, for good reason, I suppose. It is neither strong nor weak, but provides a decent introduction to the K-cup experience.<br />I started with the mid-range of coffee strengths and color, and this was my favorite of that group. However, I think it's main characteristic is that it is inoffensive... breakfast coffee types might find it strong but acceptable, and bold drinkers (me) will find it weak, but acceptable.<br />If you have company and are not sure which way their coffee tastes run, this is a good general choice that everyone can drink. Then you can pick something more suitable based on their reaction to Nantucket blend.<br />For me, it is too light, but a whole lot better than no coffee at all! If I fall behind in online orders, and have to pick up an emergency box in a brick and mortar store, I am happy enough to grab a box of Nantucket blend. It can be a nice afternoon pick-me-up as well.

review/summary: A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee...
review/text: A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee..., January 16, 2012<br /><br />This review is from: Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2) (Grocery)<br />When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors. Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!

I think some of the K-Cups make a good cup of coffee, for example, Coffee People Wake Up Call, Donut Shop, Jet Fuel and Organic are all good. Maybe Nantucket Blend is a good coffee when made in a drip coffee pot, but as a K-Cup, it just doesn't cut it.

review/text: One of the nice things about Keurig is that you don't need to have the same coffee all the time. Some k-cups are quite distinct from others. It seems that many reviewers like the bold, robust, blah blah blah. I like it too, but need some variety with a quality taste. Enter Nantucket. Smooth, a great blend of coffees, not bitter, not overpowering, just enjoyable. Unique amongst k-cups. Has sort of a nutty aftertaste. A good break from the Starbucks type of roast. Nantucket is great in the AM or PM. My wife thought it was unremarkable at first, but now she agrees with me that it is a different taste, and a good one. Add it for variety.

review/summary: decent but not my favorite
review/text: Since I got my Keurig Brewer I've been going through sample boxes of lots of different K-Cups to determine which will be my "go-to" brew. I always brew my cup using the setting for the least amount of water on the machine because I like my coffee strong. The Green Mountain "Nantucket Blend" K-cup results in a decent cup of coffee using my brewing method. It's a mild roast but at least it's not weak, it does really taste like coffee. I'll have this on hand for guests who don't enjoy their cofee quite as robust as I like.

review/summary: blahhhh
review/text: As a regular drinker of GM Nantucket I immediately ordered the K-cup version after receiving my Keurig for Christmas.  Not even close!!!  Even on the lowest flow setting there simply is not enough coffee in the K-cup to make a decent cup of coffee. I've resorted to using 2 cups to make 1.  I have a spare cup ready to catch the clear flavorless water that comes out after the first 4 ounces have gone through, then use a second K-cup and repeat the process.  Two K-cups for 8 ounces of palatable coffee.  I'm very leary about buying any of the Green Mountain K-cups at this point.  Are any of them a good choice for coffee drinkers that like real coffee???

Don't know much about them on that front.<br /><br />A friend commented that it was strange feeling to eat something marketed for babies out of a nipple like device. If that is a concern of yours I suggest a bowl.

review/text: Hmm, how do I rate this... We have two cats and they like it, each eat half a can in the morning. I can tell they like it because they stand around their bowls waiting for it. Then they eat it. So I guess they like it.  I wouldn't stand around a bowl if I knew I was going to get something I didn't like. Then again, if I only had a choice between dried lame cat food and juicy, smelly (*gag) wet cat food, I would probably look forward to my mornings more often. I wonder if the poultry cans taste like the birds they catch and partially eat while the other half flops around in my house, which always seems to happen when we are on vacation. I guess they like that too.

Alas, true to form, they don't eat what I think they might like.

I would say to make the can bigger for humans though because one can isn't even a snack.<br /><br />When I finally gave my cat some she seemed to enjoy it, but I'm ordering my own box next time.

review/text: Finally, my cat is back to eating beef again with her favourite kind of cat food. I am thrilled, and Precious is thrilled as it was sooo easy to order this item and to pick it up (declare it of course) and bring it back into Canada.  For all those Cdns whose cats love beef, this is the best and easiest way to make your cat happy - best quality, quantity of cans with content than anywhere else.  SOOOO disappointed when Friskies was stopped from Canadian stores for beef - why???  No idea.  Amazon.com you are the best and will continue to use you :)

review/text: Friskies - - the 2 felines in our house like the chicken and turkey flavors; but they have to really be hungry to eat the beef flavor. perhaps if the food were a bit more ground up, our one cat would chow it down - no matter what. but we have discovered she has only the four fangs, so it is hard for her to chew. she is 2 and we only recently discovered this. she came to us as a very pregnant cat, thus the name, PREGO. :)

review/summary: The Cat is Hungry and Can't Afford Price Hikes
review/text: Yes, the cat ate the Friskies.<br /><br />On May 2, 2011, I ordered a case of Friskies through Subscribe & Save (every two months) because it was affordable ($11) and convenient.  Today, I logged on to get an early shipment, but the Friskies 24-count cat food price went up $20.  I wont pay $1.34/can for Friskies cat food.  I cancelled my Subscribe & Save order.<br /><br />I'm disappointed with Amazon and Friskies. I realize S&S prices can fluctuate, and some of my other items have gone up or down $1 or so.  That's fine. The Friskies price hike exceeds expensive brick-and-mortar grocery stores.  Even $27 is ridiculously expensive.<br /><br />This is the fourth time we've had issues with the Subscribe & Save program, unfortunately.<br /><br />I also noticed that Amazon used a lot of the plastic packaging bags although the items sent together were not breakable.

review/text: I usually get this by the case at Sam's, but Amazon happened to have it at a lower price due to a sale. I feed my cats a mix of mainly dry with a teaspoon or two of canned food - none of them seem to care much for canned food. Of all the brands I've tried, they seem to like this the best.<br /><br />While the nutrition content is not as good as some of the premium canned foods, it's not too bad - certainly much better than most of the private label brands. Since it's not a big part of their diet I'm not too concerned about that. Plus, they really like it, especially the beef. The smell is not too bad either.

review/summary: 7 cats are rating 7 paws up
review/text: I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in p�t&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.

I'm sure if they can rate it it would be 5 meows out of 5.

And any cat owner knows what happens when you don't feed them! Price is great.

review/summary: Cats like it
review/text: We have two cats, and they seem to love the Prime Filets canned food. I know Friskies is hardly the best brand of food out there, but it sure beats keeping them feed with just dry food. They like this better than some of the more expensive brands of wet food I've given them. Beef seems to be the favorite, followed by turkey - the chicken they'll usually take their time eating.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the end result in the litterbox is noxious. Even with covered litterboxes that have carbon filters, I can definitely tell immediately when one of them did their business and didn't cover it.<br /><br />But for the price, it's great. Obviously not comparable to wet food costing $2 per can, but I'd much rather feed them prime fillets over some of the more questionable (content and appearance wise) wet foods.

But she loves friskees pate cat food so I ordered 3 cases of those... she loves all the flavors so far... she loves pate.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

review/summary: Good value, but...
review/text: I rarely write reviews, but this time I feel the product turned out to be below my expectations.<br />First - it's a really good value (at the local craft store I bought 7 pc net for $3, which is exactly twice more expensive than this product)<br />Second - the pretty bag is made out of organza in its top part, so it arrived torn, even though it was packed well.<br />Third - there's no true information about the size of coins. About 2/3 of them are large 2 in, but the rest 1/3 is smaller 1 1/4 in.<br />Fourth - they are not as neat as more expensive ones: some are unwrapped, some are smashed, letters on the coins is barely visible, which is also ok for the price.<br />Considering all of the above, the price is good, but the quality is below average. 3 stars!

review/summary: Delcious chocolate at a pretty good value
review/text: We actually bought these locally for the holidays and they've been a total hit. The bag is so huge, you can open it and rebag them or box them for smaller packages.<br />It really is a delicious Belgian chocolate - we used to live in Belgium, which made me a chocolate snob, and I think many of the gold coins are nothing more than that cheap, waxy tasting stuff or equivalent to a drug store candy bar.<br /><br />These, on the other hand, have the rich flavor of good chocolate, smooth and creamy, and the coins make them a good size for an occasional treat if you are otherwise likely to overindulge.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend them.<br /><br />There must be 150+ pieces in the bag - I took one to a huge party (about 150-200 adults and kids), spread them around on all the tables and the buffet, and there was definitely enough to go around (granted, all the kids hoarded, adults didn't eat too many). Of course, IMO, good chocolate like this is often wasted on kids! LOL<br /><br />Oh yes - the beautiful bag also makes an excellent, reusable gift bag - we used it a few times during Chanukah.

review/text: These chocolates are delicious! I bought them for a large party and we are using them for party favors.<br />It was hard to tell how many were in a bag but another review said about 150+, so that is what I went<br />on. Wow! When the bags of chocolates got here, my daughters and I counted the coins and in each bag, there<br />were OVER 200! I have to say that I was very thrilled about getting so many and the quality of the<br />chocolate is so much better than the ones you might get in the grocery store. I then realized that I wanted<br />more of them and the seller was soooo great to talk to! They had just a few more and in less than a week<br />after I ordered them, they were at my door! These are the only chocolate coins that I will ever buy again<br />and this is the only seller that I will every buy them from!

review/summary: highest quality in every way
review/text: My son has a St Patty's birthday so naturally I wanted gold coins for his party.  However, I hate the cheap and waxy chocolate I usually find and, one of my son's friends has a peanut allergy which he can't eat chocolates since they usually aren't labeled adequately.  So, I read the description really well, saw that the ingredients and allergy info were clearly listed and took a chance.  WOW!  WOW! WOW!  These chocolates are amazing!  They were a HUGE hit at the party, such excellent milk-chocolate and a beautiful, thick gold embossed wrapper.  The parent of the friend with a peanut allergy was excited that they were a safe and a special treat.  Very elegant.  Excellent quality for a more formal event.  Plus the bag is a heavy, silky, sparkly fabric that serves as a classy way of carrying and storing them.  The kids' eyes lit up when I reached into the bag and dropped golden coins into their outstretched hands.  It was almost magical ;)  I kept the leftovers in the freezer and we enjoyed them for a few weeks after the party, too!  Good to know:  I think these are a seasonal item for the holidays but they had leftovers in Jan/Feb for sale on Amazon.  Knowing chocolates keep for about a year, I figured they should be OK.  They were!  No old, white or dried out pieces.

review/text: They tasted good, looked lovely, the bag they are in was in great shape, it was all well packed, they were not stale, and were really festive as part of our Chinese New Year's table decor. It was mostly coins between the size of a half dollar and a dollar coin, with a few coins that were bigger than a quarter mixed in. Nothing was "tiny". It was a nice array. These were shipped by amazon. For what they are, the chocolate seems quite good. I mean, you don't buy these as some kind of gourmet chocolate and only about three had slipped off part of their gold covering. I would order again.

review/summary: This was really bad.
review/text: I bought a bowl of this last week because the packaging interested me and the flavors were very appealing. I wish I would have stuck to the regular chunky soups.<br /><br />My first problem was that the bowl the soup came in wasnt microwaveable. This was an immediate turnoff as I am a college student and our dorms have microwaves in them but no sinks... We have to go into the communal kitchen to clean our dishes, it's a hassle. If I would have noticed that the bowl wasnt microwaveable in the beggining I wouldn't have bought it.<br /><br />For this I kind of expected the flavor of the regular chunky beef stew, but better... but flavorwise this soup is just really disappointing, the smell of the soup when you open the can isn't very appealing. The broth is very bitter and doesn't really taste of beef very much. The potatoes are a little on the hard side... as if slightly undercooked. The mushrooms were few and far between and didn't really taste like anything so it was kind of like eating rubber. I had my hopes up for the beef because I usually eat that if I don't like anything else, but it was very dry and had a strange flavor to it. Overall a very unpleasant, overpriced bowl of soup. I would have preferred a ramen noodle cup over this any day.

review/text: I like the taste of this soup. It certainly doesn't taste home-made, but I like it a good deal more than most traditional canned soups. Actually, given the poor reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by this. However, it's still essentially canned soup, its nutrition so-so (especially the salt), and it's expensive even in the supermarket.

review/summary: There must be something wrong with me - I guess...
review/text: Campbell's Slow Kettle Beef Stew with Bella Mushrooms is not something that I partake in on a regular basis. However, I have had it twice in about 6 months. It is not my favorite and it is not a healthy alternative to much. However, for me, the two times that I had it, I made it with a side of egg noodles and I've liked it. It's not something that I yearn for or would buy unless I had a coupon - which is the only time I will purchase it. I keep a container in my cupboard for that seldom-time scenario where I really don't want to cook something because I'm either too tired or just can't decide what I want. It's a food that I'll have in the winter after shoveling the roof and clearing the deck - I'm hungry, tired, and just a bowl of soup won't do it for me. They're also fairly compact so I can toss it in my survival bag - if I can't find anything more compact and easily discarded. So - I give it three stars as it fills a niche for me.<br /><br />The best way to sell this is that "whenever I eat Campbell's Slow Kettle Beef Stew with Bella Mushrooms, my stomach doesn't get upset." They can put that slogan inside one of those yellow clouds on the front of the can - "Won't Upset Your Stomach!"

review/summary: I expected much more from this soup; packaging not easy to recycle
review/text: I saw an advertisement for this new line of soups and was really interested.  I often have soup for lunch at work and thought this would be a nice treat from my usual Campbell's Select Harvest or Thick & Chunky soups.  Considering how much more it cost than those soups, I had high expectations.<br /><br />Before I get to the taste, I want to talk about the packaging.  The usual Campbell's soup comes in a metal can that is recyclable in almost every community recycling program I know of.  This soup package will require more effort from me to recycle.  Instead of a can, it is packaged in a #5PP plastic container with an unlabeled plastic lid.  My community recycling does not accept #5PP so I will have to save it in a bag with my yogurt containers until I have enough to bring them to a local grocery store that collects it.  But even that will take work because the interior lid is an aluminum poptop and there is an aluminum lid on the plastic container.  So I will have to find a way to get the aluminum ring off before I can put it in with the plastic.  I wish Campbell's had stayed with the traditional can packaging.<br /><br />The extra work for recycling and the extra cost might be worth it if the soup were really fantastic.  I didn't think it was.<br /><br />On the plus side, the chunks of beef and potatoes are much larger than even in the thick & chunky line.  And it has portobello mushrooms.  But the carrot pieces were small and the ratio of broth/sauce (it's thick like stew sauce) to chunks of meat/vegetables was thinner than I expected for the price.  I also didn't care for the taste of the sauce.  I couldn't identify why I didn't like it but it didn't taste good to me.  This was a lunchtime "splurge" that wasn't worth the price.  I'm not sure I'd want it again even if the price were much lower.<br /><br />I won't buy this flavor again and, unless there is a coupon giving significant savings, I don't expect to try any of the other flavors.

My biggest disappointment remains that this company along with many others continues to use BPA in the lining of the cans. There are other options out there that do not contain BPA but they cost a bit more. I think if more people realized you are ingesting a chemical compound that was tested to be used as female hormone replacement therapy, more people would avoid cans with these type liners. I know there is no "definitive proof" and opinions vary on whether it actually effects cancer rates, but think how breast cancer rates have sky rocketed. Remember that the next time chug a cold canned beer down you are drinking a detectable amount of female hormone replacement.

review/summary: Where there's Smoke there is Fire!
review/text: I tried these last year at a Food Network TV roadshow in Cleveland..They were being raved about their Maple Goodness by a very famous TV chef named Michael Symon. He said it was his new "go to" snack food.<br /><br />These are not the boney nasty cheap sardines you see in a can ... These are beautiful fresh sardine fillets (NO BONES) Smokey and Delicate.<br /><br />After I tasted them I ended up buying 24 cans online because they can be very hard to find, even their online company store does not carry them.<br /><br />If you like good BBQ or Good Smoke Pit Meats you will not be dissapointed with this healthy Smoked Meat alternative loaded with good Omega 3's ... I have a friend who gave up the high fat BBQ he loves and he has been missing the full Smokey Flavor he craves ... These Smokey-Mapley sardines are his new favorite food item and good for his Heart! ... The taste is Smokey and Sweet from the Maple Syrup and it's just the right balance not too smokey and not too sweet ...My kids loved eating these when we were camping this year and wanted them for breakfast every morning, so good bye greasy sausage links!<br /><br />My favorite is to serve these with Brown Sugar Maple Baked Beans.<br /><br />My Wife had a Fancy-Schmancy party and she made a Dip using these and people went nuts wanting the recipe and wanting to know where they could buy them (Forget Trader Joes) This has got to be the New and Best Flavor combo for seafood for 2011 and a Blue Ribbon Winner in our house for sure!<br /><br />PLEASE LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE AND DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS FLAVOR!!!!<br /><br />LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!!!<br /><br />Wish Bar habor would Bring Maple Blind Robbins onto the market so we would have a dry smoked fish too, like beef jerky.

review/summary: A bit strong
review/text: I'm someone who prides myself on enjoying unusual foods, so I bought these sardines almost impulsively.<br />I won't say I dislike them, but I can't bring myself to praise them either. Perhaps they have to grow on me.<br /><br />I like sardines, I love maple syrup, and I usually enjoy smoked foods. The combination of the three, however, is a bit much. By itself, I cannot tolerate the overpowering sweetness combined with a distinct smokiness. The taste of the fish itself has taken a back seat to these two much more dominant flavors.<br /><br />It took me a while to find something that actually worked: cream cheese. Toast, cream cheese, and these sardines created a pretty good open-face breakfast sandwich. Cream cheese has a way of tempering even the strongest flavors (vegemite, smoked salmon, capers, etc). There are probably other good ingredient combinations, but I have yet to find them.<br /><br />Bottom line: These fish are very sweet and quite smoky. Be prepared to experiment a bit to find an enjoyable way to eat them.

review/summary: Wow, these are really great!
review/text: They definitely could be eaten for breakfast.  I was skeptical of whether or not I would like these, but they are great and I went ahead and bought another order to take advantage of the special this month.  These are my new favorite sardines.

review/summary: Delicious and filling
review/text: The combination of maple syrup and sardines does indeed sound a bit strange but it's delicious! And the sardines themselves are very impressive, I'm going to try the non-maple type by Bar Harbor as well.<br /><br />If you are a sardine lover, don't hesitate to try these for a twist on the ordinary.

review/summary: Smoked Sardine Fillets mildly glazed with Maple Syrup -Fabulous!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J2BEXW">Bar Harbor Skinless Boneless Smoked Sardine Fillets, 6.7-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />This product was developed to help customers new to canned fish products and looking to incorporate more healthy fish into their diets. The all-natural, wood smoked, skinless, boneless sardine fillets are mildly seasoned with pure Maple Syrup, providing a semi-glazed finish. The mild, natural fish flavor with the hint of maple makes a delicious, healthy alternative to other breakfast proteins such as bacon or sausage. These were sampled at the 2011 Summer Fancy Food Show this past weekend in Washington, D.C., and people were amazed at the flavor and finish of this product! Sure to become a favorite! Working diligently to get a product image uploaded soon!

review/summary: Remind me of Kipper Snacks
review/text: I have only had boneless skinless sardines once before, and I was expecting these to taste similar, although somewhat sweet.  They are sweet, perhaps a little too sweet, but it does have a very good flavor.  It really reminds me of smoked herring, the kind you get in the long thin can (branded Kipper Snacks at my local store).<br /><br />These are pretty good.  I purchased them on sale at a local health food store - I am not sure if I would pay full price for them, though.  One good thing about this can is the size - it has 3.5 servings at 150 calories each.  A normal can of sardines only has about 150 calories total, so maybe it could be considered a better deal because of this.  However, it is kind of a meal in itself.

review/summary: Sardines, the other pancakes!
review/text: Just tried these and enjoyed them a lot.  They taste better if microwaved for about 20 seconds to take the chill off.  I just ate a can of them, but what if they were served with other breakfast foods, like eggs or muffins or hash browns?

review/summary: amazingly, surprisingly great
review/text: I know that you're thinking "Fish and maple syrup... yuck!", but if you like bacon that has gotten into some maple syrup, this is the smoked fish version of that.  I could eat pounds of this stuff.

review/summary: Cans were soaked with Ammonia Floor Cleaner !
review/text: The 6 cans were sealed in a plastic bag.  When I opened the bag I was hit with the PUNGENT smell of AMMONIA. The paper cardboard label wrap around each can was soggy and half soaked with a peach colored liquid that smelled like toxic AMMONIA FLOOR CLEANER !!<br /><br />Then when I went to the Amazon Return page, I discovered that this item CANNOT BE RETURNED !!<br /><br />I had high hopes for this item because I was hoping to finally find a Sardine that did not taste fishy and was willing to pay $3.47 per can. ($20.84 for 6 cans, $17.71 if you subscribe). I also liked the idea of buying an American product to support the Maine fishing industry.<br /><br />Fishy taste?  I AM NOT EATING SARDINES DOUSED WITH TOXIC AMMONIA FLOOR CLEANER !  I don't know if it was packed in the 6 pack bag this way by Amazon or by the Bar Harbor manufacturer, but due to the fact that these are Pop-open cans where the metal top already has a cut thin opening so that it's easy to pull the metal lid off, I am wary of eating this because the ammonia may have seeped inside because ammonia is corrosive.<br /><br />I should be able to at least return this but I just found out that grocery items are not eligible for return. What a let down!<br /><br />***UPDATE:  AUGUST 4,2012  Amazon did refund my money, Amazon is awesome!  I washed off one of the least soaked cans under running water for 10 minutes to get as much of the smelly ammonia off to see if I can salvage one can to at least taste this product.<br /><br />The Smoked Sardines were stiff and tasteless.  It had the texture of dried fish, and there was ZERO taste of maple syrup, none whatsoever.  Not worth the expense.<br /><br />Regarding the ammonia soaking, usually any product defects such as dents or dirt comes from the product manufacturer and is shipped out by Amazon as is.  This 6-can pack was in a bag which probably came from Bar Harbor that way.

review/summary: Don't pay this shipping fee!!
review/text: A very high quality, palatable food. One of the *only* dry dog foods that all of my chis will eat. The SHIPPING CHARGE on this stuff is OUTRAGEOUS - almost as much as the food itself. Go to www.artemiscompany.com and enter your zip code. They locate a store near you where you can buy it. Most pet food stores charge about $50 for a 33 lb. bag. Save the $36 shipping fee for something else... toys and treats, perhaps. Or donate what you saved to your local rescue organization or shelter.  If you can't buy it near you, other vendors ship it for about half what these guys charge.

review/summary: Great sample food bag...
review/text: I've been feeding my cats a mix of nutro and this product (for variety) and they all seem to love it (two kittens and an adult cat).  The kibble is good sized and not too hard (so easy for the kittens to break up).  The ingredients look good but I wouldn't feed as an only food for kittens (even though marketed as an all ages food).
