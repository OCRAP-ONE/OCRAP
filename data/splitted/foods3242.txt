review/summary: Best peach tea, ever!
review/text: I have tried so many peach teas that were either bitter, pale, or off tasting.  This is hands-down my favorite peach tea.  It makes the most amazing iced-tea in the summer.  It is robust enough to handle being served iced and is sweet enough to require minimal or no sweetners.  A very refreshing tea!

review/summary: A Must For bergamot Lovers
review/text: If, like me, you find a lot of Earl Grey teas a bit weak in that most delicious and enticing bergamot aroma, this is definitely the one for you. It is not over powerful, just right. The tea itself is not strong so if you like very strong tea by all means add a bag of regular black tea to brew along with the Stash. Absolutely delicious..It will bring you to an exotic and distant land of pure enchantment.

review/summary: Over all, fairly good
review/text: I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better.

review/text: I love hot teas, and had never tried any chai before someone suggested this one to me.<br /><br />It's perfect any time, with a bit of sugar and a little milk added. Has a wonderful flavor, not overpoweringly spicy, but just right. It's also fine without milk, but milk does 'smooth' the spices a bit.<br /><br />Buy it a couple of six pack of boxes at a time. I'm pretty sure having a couple of cups (or more) every night constitutes addiction. =)

review/summary: most flavorful chai i've found
review/text: Being a fan of the creamy, spicy chai teas one can get in the coffeeshops, I've tried to recreate them at home with disappointing results -- until now.  I've probably purchased ten or twelve different brands of Chai looking for the right one.  I finally found it with this Stash Premium Double Spice.  It is exceptionally flavorful, and really able to hold the strong flavor.  The aroma is incredible.  Although it has cinnamon, it doesn't strike me as particularly cinnamony -- I think the cardamom flavor may come through a little more strongly.  Nor is it particularly spicy -- I can't handle spicy foods and I don't have a problem with this.  This tea is a little heartier than most -- I have taken to drinking it instead of coffee in the morning.<br /><br />I haven't been quite as impressed with the other Stash teas I've tried (they're okay, but nothing special) and generally prefer Mighty Leaf or Tazo -- but this tea quickly jumped to the top of my favorites list -- I'll be ordering much more.

review/summary: So Tasty in the Winter!
review/text: I usually drink green tea, straight up.  But I wound up in a Starbucks one day and ordered a Chai Latte.  It didn't taste like tea to me at all!  It was more like hot chocolate, only with spices instead of chocolate.  I thought I'd gone to heaven.  I regretted not bringing some of the Tazo tea home later.  I just started craving the stuff.  I found Tazo Chai Spice at the supermarket, but wasn't happy with the price.<br /><br />So I thought I'd try Stash.  I already buy some of their green teas.  It's even better than Tazo!  The Spice Chai or Double Spice Chai, they're both delicious.  The Double just has more spices and works better with milk.  Or cream :)  Makes the house smell good, too.  Not knocking Tazo, either, after all, I did rave about their tea.  I just think this is even better.<br /><br />If you want to give tea as a gift, spice probably won't go to waste, no matter what the tea drinker usually drinks.  Every tea drinker I know can go for a spice every now and then.

review/text: I never liked Earl Grey til I had Bentley's.  It was a gift, far too expensive for my daily tea.  This Stash DOUBLE BERGAMOT is just as good and so much cheaper.  I ordered 200 bags because I drink it every day.  It's all about the Bergamot; otherwise it's just black tea.  This product gives you that pronounced Bergamot flavot that makes it special.  Don't be afraid to buy a large quantity.  You won't be disappointed.but beware:  you may become addicted.

For those who take no issue with tea in a bag, Stash's double-bergamot offering provides a balance of floral, citrus, and earthy notes without being overly tannic or bitter. If you're in the US and you've been looking for a substitute for Harrods, this is it.

Very distinctive flavor.  Unique!  Thankfully Amazon sells the six-pack of this special tea, which we get on automatic delivery so we never run out.  Priced better than the local stores.

review/text: I really like other flavors of Stash (peach, lemongrass green and breakfast blend).  But, this has two types of cloves which I knew weren't my favorite but it also had cardomon oil which is my favorite spice.  But the cloves overpower everything else.  Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea.

review/text: Since I first tasted Stash brand Earl Grey tea, I have not purchased any other brand of Earl Grey.  The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just "scented" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash "double bergamot" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both.

When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it.

review/text: I have tried many different brands and types of chai, and this is definitely my all-time favorite.  Lovely with a splash of milk, or try the recipe on the box of brewing in a saucepan with milk and sugar for added flavor and creaminess.

review/text: I am completely addicted to my Chai- and I've gotten 2 friends at work hooked, as well.  We split the box I bought here, and it was less expensive ($2.21/box of 20) than when we get it by the single box in the grocery store ($2.59/box).  Definitely worth it, especially if you can get the free shipping!  Who needs coffee??!?

review/text: Of all the brands of Earl Grey, Stash is my favorite.  The double bergamot is the best.  The flavor is fantastic.  I have in the past had a difficult time finding it in any of the grocercy stores I shop at, and when I do the price is at least a dollar a box more than here.<br /><br />If you like a flavorful tea, you should like this one.  In my hom you can't go wrong with this one.

review/summary: it's got double the spice, but. . .
review/text: the tea itself doesn't seem hearty enough to stand up to the spices. What I mean is that even after waiting the right amount of time for my cup to finish steeping, I have a cup of chai that's spicy but not really strong enough for me. I don't like stuff toxic; that's not the problem. I think perhaps this tea is just not meant to be very strong.<br /><br />It's got a great level of spiciness, however, and it smells wonderful as it's brewing.<br /><br />Stash Company--how about just a titch more black tea in each bag? :-)

review/summary: Very good orange spice tea.
review/text: I just tried orange spice tea for the first time on a recent trip to Hawaii, and they had a tea chest of varoius Stash teas in the lobby for people to try. So I deceded to try a flavor I had never had before and I was pleasantly surprised. Now orange spice tea will always remind me of Hawaii. I bought a box of Bigelow Constant Comment, which is another orange spice tea, but it wasn't as good as Stash's, im my opinion. Stash has much more flavor, and isn't that the point?

review/summary: Steeping - the longer the better
review/text: This tea is delicious with milk. The description on the website says to brew for 3-5 minutes. While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: My mom gave me a box of this a few years ago and I had just recently gotten around to trying it. It was excellent. I bought another box and the second I opened the first packet I could smell that they had changed the recipe. Checking the back of the two boxes confirmed it. Cinnamon is about all I taste when I drink it, although the aftertaste has a hint of clove. Pretty expensive for something that tastes mixed by a child.

review/text: I love mission figs for a healthy snack when I am in the mood for something sweet.  My grocery store doesn't carry the Sun Maid brand of figs.  The brand they carry always has too many dried out figs in it.  You have to hunt around for a moist one in the package.  The Sun Maid mission figs are all extremely moist and delicious.  Not a bad one in the bunch.  With free shipping through Amazon prime it is just as convenient to order them from Amazon as it would be to get them at the grocery store.  I will not be buying the grocery store figs anymore now that I know I can get these superior ones from Amazon.

review/text: I love figs and look forward to fresh figs in the fall.  When fresh figs aren't available, then sun dried figs will do but ONLY when they are flavorful and not too dry.  I've had various brands of dried figs throughout my life and these are certainly NOT tasty in any way.  Most in the bag are too dry and the ones that are moist are almost mealy tasting and taste too bland to be worth the sugar content (even if it's from natural sugar).  I wanted to like these since they were easily accessible to make some homemade treats but I just can't vouch for this version of dried figs.  Sorry.

review/summary: From the grocery store these are too dry
review/text: This is the brand of mission figs that are at my grocery store (HEB in Texas).  I have probably bought at least 40 packages in the last 8 years (occassionally I would get a craving for them).  I always worry when I get them though, because they are often too dry.  So I started looking online for something better.  I tried the missing figs from nutsonline.  I was not dissapointed from those.  They are delicious - very moist.  I would say that the four one-pound bags of nutsonline figs I have bought so far were 98% moist, compared to the sunmaid figs at HEB being 30% moist (a lot of inedible ones). The figs from nutsonline don't have preservatives, so you have to refrigerate them as soon as you get them - but I think that's better for me.<br /><br />Note: The turkish figs are highly touted at nutsonline, but I didn't like them.<br /><br />Note 2: Another reviewer here said these sunmaid figs were moist when ordered from Amazon.  Maybe there is a difference in stock rotation / freshness when ordered here.  But they still have preservatives (I guess that might be an acceptable trade-off for some people if you don't want to refrigerate them for some reason.

They are a good substitute for the actual dry figs that I got used to but, can no longer find ANYWHERE!.  These are moist and mushy like prunes.  I prefer the dried (actual dry) figs that are chewy and flavorful (not that these don't have flavor but, the mushyness is kinda gross).  I leave the bag open to try to let them dry out a bit.  My 7 year old daughter feels exactly the same way!  I am ordering some of the dry ones on-line in hopes that they are like those I previously purchased at two different stores in the area that no longer carry them.

review/text: I discovered this tea at work one day and have been drinking it for the past 25 years!  It's just awesome - you don't even need sugar - just some hot water and voila! Instant licorice flavor.  If you're not familiar with Stash's teas, then be sure to give this one a try.  They have wonderful, rich flavored teas, not too strong or too weak.  They come in a zillion varieties and all just equally as good.  Sign up for auto delivery on this one - you'll be back for more.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Why is this tea not famous and widely available?
review/text: You used to be able to find Stash Licorice at major grocery stores, and I'm baffled as to why it has disappeared from shelves and can only be found online. It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else. Great as an after-dinner/before-bed drink.

review/summary: Licorice lovers and health nuts, this is for you!
review/text: If you love black licorice and and would like something that also has great health benefits, you'll love this tea.  I brew this tea and drink hot, but even when it gets cold, its still great.  I often just add more cold water to it and get a very mild licorice taste that is better than just strait water.  I will do this several times until I just want more of the licorice taste, and brew some more tea.  As to the health benefits, there are many.  Here are just a few: "useful for many ailments including asthma, body odor, bursitis, canker sores, chronic fatigue, depression, colds and flu, coughs, gingivitis and tooth decay, gout, heartburn, HIV, viral infections, fungal infections, ulcers, liver problems, Lyme disease, menopause, psoriasis, shingles, sore throat, tendinitis, tuberculosis, ulcers, yeast infections, prostate enlargement and arthritis."  See [...] and click on the link licorice.  That is where this health info came from, but there is much much more info there on that web site too.  It's said to be very good for flu and colds, which I'm fighting now, and it's so very SOOTHING to my throat!  You'll love this tea.

review/summary: A loyal drinker (!) for years
review/text: Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).  The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.  It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime.  Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either.  I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.

It really is very, very flavorful.<br /><br />It has a nice blend of both flavors.

review/summary: Delicious, sweet tasting tea, but...
review/text: I love the taste of this tea. It tastes exactly like licorice root and it's very refreshing. I like to make iced tea with it. However, I just read a review someone made on another licorice tea product on amazon, telling their story of licorice toxicity. I'm a fairly paranoid person, so I'm now only going to enjoy this tea about twice a week, instead of everyday like I was doing. I canceled my subscribe & save order because I don't think I can safely use up 6 boxes within the time I selected. I might be overreacting, I probably am, but better safe than sorry.

review/summary: Amazing tea!!
review/text: I will be honest and say that when a friend suggested I try this tea as I began getting sick last winter, I told her no way because I do not like licorice flavor.  She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?

review/summary: Love this when I'm sick
review/text: This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it. My local grocery is out, so here I am on Amazon, buying more.<br /><br />Note that the primary source of "lemon" appears to be lemongrass. (Ingredients, via the product packaging: "Ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, and citric acid. Contains: Soy." I don't understand "Contains: Soy", but it's not listed on the ingredients... I wonder if this is an allergy alert thing.)<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, the organic version has caffeine and doesn't have any actual lemon in it... I haven't tried that one yet, though. I'm a fan of both green tea and organic products, but I don't want caffeine when I'm sick, so I'll stick with this.

review/text: A friend introduced me to Licorice Tea many years ago by asking for a cup at a restuarant. When the server stated that the restuarant did not have Licorice tea, she took a packette out of her handbag and asked for a cup of hot water. She had an extra packette for me to try. WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf. I placed my order for the Pack of 6 to save on shipping and should now have sufficient tea bags for several months. Individually, foil wrapped tea bags keeps the flavor fresh.

I personally steep the tea for longer than advised on the package but I like my teas strong (package says 3-5 minutes, I go for 10).  I have turned some of my licorice loving friends onto it - 1 is a diabetic and she LOVES it since it gives a really sweet flavor with NO sugar or carbohydrates.  It is wonderful on a cold evening and won't keep you awake as there is NO caffeine.
