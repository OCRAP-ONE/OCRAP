review/summary: Doesn't taste like unsweetened cocoa!
review/text: After seeing the positive reviews plus having read about the health benefits of organic cocao, I decided to give this a try. What a disappointment! I am a hot chocolate connaisseur - I drink hot chocolate even in the summer. Not only did this powder not taste like cocoa, it made me feel quite ill. There are plenty of other cocoa powders that are far superior re: taste, Valrhona being one of them.

review/summary: My dog's favorite rawhide
review/text: My dog (A silken windhound) loves any and all rawhide, any and all bones to be truthful. But she injured a tooth once cracking through a beef knuckle bone, and I have since stopped providing her with hard bones. My dog has no interest at all in toys, unless there is a treat in it, then she pulls out the treat in 5 minutes and ignores the toy from then on. So I sought out rawhides as something to engage her off and on during the day. Though she'll chew eagerly on any rawhide I give her, I worry about her choking or gagging on a large hunk of it stuck in her throat, or a large piece getting stuck in her gut. This piggy twist, because it has such tight skinny strands, does not have that risk. On top of that,she'll take nearly two weeks of picking at it to finally finish it off, in spite of her persistance. I am so glad that she can have the rawhide she enjoys, that it doesn't get devoured in a day, and which allows me to feel safe giving it to her. I do wish I could get the 9 inch in a 3-5 pack.

review/summary: Let Them Eat Candy
review/text: I am one of those moms, you know the one. It takes us 4+ months to eat what they get for Halloween and Easter with some disappearing into the trash almost daily. I allow a piece a day. There is no reason for all that stuff to be eaten until you are sick. My sister and I talk about this all the time, when we were kids, there was never a Sweet Police demanding we make the pick a good one because it would be your only for the day. We were allowed to eat until we were sick which is why I think we now eat until we are sick. Hopefully, by allowing our children to partake but with limits, we are setting them up to live a life of enjoying sweets without going overboard.<br /><br />If they are going to eat candy anyway, make it the good stuff!<br /><br />Surf Sweets Natural and Organic Candy was a big hit with the kids and me. We know kids and adults alike, love candy and now you can eat all those wonderfully, fruity gummies, jellies and sours without all the sugar.<br /><br />Inspired by good, clean fun the makers of Surf Sweets, have created products that were inspired by surfing, active and lifestyles, and natural sweets.<br /><br />My personal favorite was the gummy bears and worms while my kids loved the jelly beans and my niece the sour worms.<br /><br />You can totally taste the difference. They are made only with ingredients found in nature.<br /><br />Big plus to all my Celiac Disease friends out there: Surf Sweets are GLUTEN FREE<br /><br />Need yet another reason to shop Surf Sweets? How about this, they are a cause friendly company who support the organizations committed to improving our planet (water and earth).

review/summary: Ok, I guess....
review/text: I just got my order and I think it's just ok.  I got 50 different K-Cups, sure.  I was hoping to get a good mix of coffee, tea, cocoa and maybe an apple cider.  I was secretly hoping for a brew over ice variety, as well.  No such luck.  I got mostly coffee and a few teas.  Some of the coffees were sort of doubles, even though not technically.  By that I mean that I would get a french vanilla and a french vanilla decaf.  So, there were at least 5 flavors that I got with a decaf of the same flavor.  My biggest issue with these is the expiration dates.  My K-Cups had expiration dates ranging from 3 months ago to 1/2013.  In fact, my batch had 5 expired K-Cups.  The expiration dates for them were early February, so that's not even close to being good.  I wasn't too happy to find that 10% of my order was expired.  Perhaps this is just a fluke or perhaps I'm the only one who wrote a review that checked the expiration dates on every single K-Cup received.  I may try this again in a few months to see if I get the same result.  If I do, I'll add an update to this review.

We received 51 cups actually and were very happy with the selection. We received coffees, flavored coffees, teas, and several hot cocoa varieties. K cups were packaged simply, but well, and they arrived on the same day I received the rest of my order from Amazon itself. We briefly scanned the dates on the cups and didn't notice any out of date or close to being out of date. Only problem we see is that our carousel only holds 30 cups :)

Overall, I have to say I was pleased with the variety.  I would recommend to anyone who likes to try different tastes, flavors and intensities.

review/text: I'm so glad that I tried this variety pack.  There were no two coffees or teas alike.  Also, none of the k-cups were outdated or even close to outdating.  I received about 10 decaf coffees and teas, 5 regular teas, 1 cider, and the rest were caffeinated coffees of varying flavors and strengths.  It has been a lot of fun trying the different types of coffees and teas - it feels like a different little treat for myself every morning.  When I'm finished with this, I know I will order a variety package like this again.  It was also a good value!<br /><br />As always with Amazon, the product arrived when they said they would!  Thanks!

review/text: I felt it was Christmas morning while we opened up the box and looked at each cup.  We received 50 cups with the earlest expiration date wasn't for another 3 months.  Even with that it was only for a 5-9 cups (seasonal flavors).  Most of the expiration dates were at least 6 months beyond.

review/summary: Awesome variety!
review/text: I really couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I wanted a variety pack to check out different flavors/types/brands of K-cups so I could make better purchases when faced with buying a whole box of the same kind in the future.<br /><br />I got 51 cups (I guess I got lucky) and only two of them were decaf.  Not a single duplicate k-cup.  Some teas, standard roast coffees of different brands/types, but the majority of them are flavored coffees...wolfgang puck, green mountain, donut shop, even a Kahlua coffee.  No issues with expiration dates, all seem to be well within range (earliest I found was October 2012, which is 4 months from now).<br /><br />I really think it's the luck of the draw on the type you get, but I was glad to see there weren't any duplicates.  If there were two of the same "flavor" they were at least different brands.  I'll probably buy another one of these when I run out.

review/summary: Good price for mixture of coffee flavors.
review/text: Got this mixture as the description mentioned a variety of not only coffee types but cocoas, teas, and cider.  The box arrived in great packing condition and there were actually 51 cups in the box (4 were limited edition flavors).  Overall 22 were either teas or decaf coffees.  So not a bad mixture, all were in date range and not expired, and no duplicates (two hazelnuts by different companies is not considered a duplicate, for those that would argue it is - different brands bring different tastes and experiences)<br /><br />The only reason I cannot give this a 5 star review is that we did not receive, not even ONE, hot cocoa or apple cider to try - needless to say the wife and kids were disappointed.  That was really the main purpose of getting this package, otherwise I would have just bought a coffee variety pack and would have saved me from drinking decaf...oh well.

review/summary: More Awsome Bamboo!
review/text: I brought these after buying a bundle of 6" Lucky Bamboo for my fishtank then realising that the poor lucky bamboo was way too short! (I was drowning it...) BUT! I was still able to use them and make a handful of beautiful arangements; which when these came half was added to my tank (my tank is short) and the other half went into improving the shorter arrangements I started! - Ohh! and I got a free bottle of plant food! If I ever need more Lucky Bamboo I'll know where to go!<br /><br />Side Note:<br />One thing although kinda bugged me when I got this set of bamboo compared to the last one, the center and the roots where covered with this werid clear-jello looking stuff. It kinda creeped me out, and took a while to wash off, I assume it was something to keep the lucky bamboo from drying out, but after a good wash it was gone, and it didnt kill my fish, so all is well! (and the lucky bamboo surivied the wash)

Some of the artisanal olive oils may have a more complex taste, but, this one more than serves the purpose for us. An added plus is that it's organic. Important for those of us who want to cut down on ingesting pesticide toxins.

review/summary: Makes the Best Coleslaw and Potato Salad in the World!
review/text: I've been using Marzetti's Slaw Dressing for years.  In fact, it's the secret ingredient in my coleslaw and potato salad recipes.  (Don't tell!)  Anytime my husband tastes potato salad that's made by someone besides me, he whispers in my ear, "Yours is better."  Same with coleslaw.  That's how I know that Marzetti's dressing helps me make the best coleslaw and potato salad anywhere.  My only fear is that the company will stop making it since it's been around for so long and so many companies tend to create "new and improved" versions of favorites that might be new, but they're definitely not improved.  This one is perfect just the way it is!<br /><br />I'm glad to find this product here on Amazon since sometimes it's hard to find in my two local grocery stores.  Just today, it was missing from the shelf at my favorite store and I let the manager know that I was looking for it.  He promised to try to get it again and I hope he keeps that promise.  I'm getting hungry for potato salad and my last jar is just about empty!<br /><br />UPDATE 5/5/2012:  The ingredient list from my jar of Marzetti's Slaw Dressing (The Original, All Natural) is as follows: Soybean oil, sugar, corn-cider vinegar, water, egg yolk, salt, mustard seed, xanathan gum, natural rosemary extract.  There is no high-fructose corn syrup in this.  Always read labels!

review/text: I have a personal problem with this product.. Oh don't get me wrong, I love the taste of it. I picked it up at the checkout line yesterday. It is not the delicious taste I have a problem with.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that this product seemed to have set a trend to "aerated chocolate" I had a problem with it in the seventies when this British product came out. The concept is really old, dating back to the thirties (a process patended by John Todd & Rowntree Ltd.)<br /><br />OK.. for those not following where I am heading let's think about this. A process that pump air into 50% of the chocolate bar. A 3.6 oz bar can now be manufactured with 1.8 oz worth of chocolate. That's right folks.. the air bubbles occupy space, space which otherwise could have been occupied by real chocolate.<br /><br />If you don't mind paying for two bars of chocolate and only getting one, this product is for you.

review/text: I purchased this Aero bar thinking it was similar to the now long-gone Chocolite bar that I enjoyed as a kid in the 70's/80's.  It has air bubbles in the bar and although it is tasty, it is not the same as the Chocolite bar was.  The taste was ok but hard to eat, as it kind of falls apart where the bubbles are.  As far as the shipping, there were no problems.  In fact, it arrived very quickly and in great condition.  Hope this helps.

review/summary: Works wonders for my cat plagued with hairballs!
review/text: My 10 year old cat has thick and long fur that causes him to throw-up hairballs often. He doesn't overly clean his fur, but he just has so much he ends up with in his stomach, even with regular bushings.<br /><br />Meow Mix has always been his favorite brand of dry cat food, but the Hairball Control formula has been a tremendous help with his issues. I tried the Indoor Formula first, but that actually seemed to worsen it. He went from couching up a hairball every few weeks to getting sick every few days. He has a bit of a sensitive stomach and something in the Indoor Formula did not set well with him.<br /><br />The Hairball formula however, has worked wonderfully. Now he coughs one up on every few months or so. Much better than the weekly or by-weekly hairballs he was suffering from. This works even better than the hairball medicine we bought him that we had to feed to him every day.<br /><br />He loves his Meow Mix, and always comes to let us know if his bowl has gotten low on food. He never likes it to ever totally run out, so he starts meowing to get us to add more to it once it starts to get towards the bottom.

review/summary: Addicting as MSG!
review/text: This salt is very fine -more powdery compared to other rough sea salts. This makes it so that when you cook, you might not have to sprinkle (or grind) it in as early, and you can throw some uncooked without grittiness. And it is so good. How can you describe salt? Salty? You'll have to try for yourself, but it is very fresh tasting, and sprinkle it on the worst cooked food, and it will still be edible because this fleur de sel is of such high quality. After eating any dish with this salt, it makes me seriously crave more of food in general with this salt, like what MSG does, but without the thirsty, dizzying effects of an MSG laden meal.<br /><br />The top sticker is even signed by the salt harvester, making it more personalized if you're looking to send a gift for someone. And, for those who are curious, it is not stored in very thick packaging. Just some light cardboard feeling material as the base and a lightweight lid similar to that of a wine corkscrew.<br /><br />Note: this Carmague fleur de sel is essentially the uppermost layer of the bed of sea salts laid out to dry under the French sun, and is the most clear. If you're just looking to go buying French salts in general, this isn't going to look like some Britanny sea salts which can be wet, dark grey, or light grey, but instead will be dry, fine, and whitest of white.

It's delicate flavor profile will be lost.  I sprinkle it on at the end of cooking - on top of steamed veggies, on top of a steak, on top of a salad with homemade vinaigrette.  This salt is not cheap (considering the price of kosher salt and the extra premium paid for shipping for this stuff), but it's something I look forward to using and tasting every time I pull it out of the cabinet.

review/summary: Best salt ever!
review/text: I first had Fleur De Sel De Camargue in the Camargue region in the south of France, and the Fleur De Sel I ordered from Amazon is a nice reminder of that trip. Some restaurants served the salt on the table directly from the container, with a tiny spoon.  The salt literally melts in your mouth, providing a pleasant saline flavor to the food with no chemical aftertaste.

You will never go back to harsh table salt once you experience this salt.  I carry a small container of it in my purse so I am never without it; it's that good.

I put it sparingly on most finished dishes-- tossed salad, fish, edamane, winter squash, potatoes sweet & white.  It truly is a gem...first tried it a few years ago, ran out an couldn't find it anywhere.  Bought 12 to give as gifts!  Thanks!!!!

review/text: This is these best teriyaki sauce I've tried since tastefully simple's version.  If you like to grill, you need a thick sauce to really grill on the flavor - and this is it!  I used to use tastefully simple's teriyaki sauce, but they don't make it anymore.  I tried at least 6 other ones until I found this.  It's perfect for grilling and it works well for stir fry too - just add a can of pineapples to it - the juice waters it down just enough and it tastes so good!!

review/summary: Excellent Fruit Picker
review/text: I went fruit picking the other week and the place I picked at had one of these for me to use. My friend and I LOVED it! We both were carrying babies on our backs and this made picking the apples SO MUCH EASIER. We didn't have to climb any ladders and risk falling. I loved it so much, I'm purchasing one for myself as I generally pick fruit a couple times a year. I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />One thing I loved about it was that I could pick quite a few apples with it before having to bring it back down to dump them in our bucket. It was easy to use and worked great. The telescoping pole was so easy to use as well, and we were picking from a VERY LARGE apple tree.<br /><br />Great price and great product! I purchased just the basket in the store for $13. After seeing the pole AND basket for $20, I returned the basket and will be purchasing this item which is the exact one I used at the place I picked apples from.

review/summary: Fruit & Branch Mangler
review/text: This picker will get the fruit, but it usually gets some of the branch as well and sometimes rips off a whole branch. It pulls the fruit off. If the fruit does not come off easily, which my oranges usually don't, I have to pull hard. When the fruit finally comes loose, the back snap of the branch sometimes causes other oranges to fall to the ground and get bruised or broken. The wire hooks can damage the fruit unless you are very careful.<br /><br />The wire basket can be difficult to thread through the branches. It is also difficult to grab a single fruit in a cluster.<br /><br />Get the TwisterPicker also available here on Amazon. It beats the wire basket hands down. Read the reviews there before you buy here. Here's the link:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BBCUD8">Fruit Picker, the TwisterPicker</a>

review/text: I'm 33 and I don't have the energy for my day that I did a few years back.  I work in a restaurant and am constantly moving around.  This particular energy shot works better than any other one I've tried.  $19 on Amazon is a little higher than what I've been paying.  These individual shots cost $.99 at my local grocery store (Cub Foods).  Great product though, no jitters, no skin-crawling effect 10 hours later, and a nice boost of energy.  Just a jolt of B12, that's really all it is.  Works great!

review/text: I usually get these at Dylan's Candy Bar, but it's too expensive for a small bag. I think around twelve dollars or so a pound? These are at a great price here on Amazon. These are also really difficult to find. Usually you find the strawberry ones, but not the strawberry banana ones (which is the best fruit combination ever). They arrive in a big plastic bag in a cardboard box. I put the belts into several ziploc bags so they wouldn't get hard and they lasted a very long time. I'm very happy with my purchase. I'm tempted to ordering more but they're so bad for you. But they're so good! Oh, the dilemma! Who am I kidding? I think I'll order some right now!
