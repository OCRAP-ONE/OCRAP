review/text: The cups are smaller and hold less coffee than the competitors. They also are not airtight so will degrade once the package is opened unless used quickly.  But even if used quickly they are weak and watery.  Actually, more like dishwater.  They should come with a warning label.  I would have wanted to know that they were weak and watery by design.

review/summary: horrible coffee
review/text: I bought these at the grocery store just to try them. They are probably the worst k cups ever. The taste is terrible. I tried both the fog chaser and rainforest blend. They both taste awful, like bark and dirt. There is dark brown "sediment" left in the bottom of the cup when you drink this brand. I find that the taste is strong in the dirt department, but highly lacking in the coffee flavor area. I will never buy these again. I like my coffee in the morning, but I actually dread having to use these if there is nothing else available.

review/summary: Not your average K-cup, but worth a taste
review/text: I have my concerns about this coffee's packaging, but the important part first: It tastes good. Fog Chaser is a little more robust than I like for a morning blend (I tend toward a Dunkin Donuts style coffee first thing in the AM), but is perfect for afternoon or evening. The nonstandard pods fit into my B70 and while there has been occasional sediment, it's not been a problem with the majority of my 36-pod pack; at least, not as bad as (say) Grove Square. Yes, I'd buy these again.<br /><br />Now the negatives. As has been stated, the pods aren't plastic cups with embedded filters, sealed by a foil cover, but rather filter pouches with a plastic ring and foil cover. There's no need to punch a drain hole in the plastic cup, since there isn't one. I've heard concerns about the Keurig success causing more spent K-cups to be dumped in trash tips and landfills; I'd also guess that the construction makes it a non-trivial recycling task. So a redesign with less plastic would seem like a good thing.<br /><br />However, one of the charms of Keurig is that the cup is packed in a relatively inert gas: I've heard nitrogen, which would make sense. Oxygen is the enemy of coffee. Old coffee goes stale because it oxidizes. Keeping air away from coffee keeps it fresh... but the coffee in the San Francisco Bay Coffee company's packaging hasn't this feature. The bags (containing twelve pods each) are heavy-duty plastic with a metal button of unknown purpose, and perhaps those bags are filled with something other than oxygen... but as soon as you take them out, the coffee begins to deteriorate.<br /><br />Not that this happens in a matter of seconds, or even days. After all, keeping the lid on a pound can of coffee (I can actually remember when a pound was sixteen ounces, not 13.5) kept the coffee fresh enough, assuming you were a regular drinker. If you use a ziploc bag to store the unused pods from an opened bag, I'm sure that they'll stay fresh enough in the week or two that the bag lasts.<br /><br />My concern, though, is for occasional coffee drinkers, for whom the Keurig system is a godsend. For example, I dated a woman who hated coffee, but wanted me to have some when I visited. Having fresh coffee in an inert storage container would have been great. These, though, might go bad in between my visits to her house.<br /><br />So in conclusion, go ahead and buy these if you're a frequent coffee drinker who will finish a whole 12-pod bag in less than a month. Keep a couple of ziploc bags (sandwich bags hold 6) for storage. Companies that go through a whole lot of K-cups ought really to like these, especially since they're about 10% under the cost of most K-cups.

review/summary: Delightfully Surprised
review/text: I ordered this on a whim when I received an e-mail from Amazon about new deals in k-cups. I'm always looking to mix up my selection because that is one of the true benefits of the Keurig machines. I read the reviews trying to determine how dark/strong Fog Chaser was and could not quite nail down the strength. I relied on the name and thankfully knew about the packaging. I keep mine in a canister after realizing I had an extra one to spare, which will keep the air out. I quite liked the k-cup design, it looks like it creates less waste.<br /><br />Fog Chaser clearly says on the side that it is a darker brown but does not show that it is the strongest. I will have to investigate which is stronger. This k-cup did give me a nice smooth strong 12 oz cup of coffee. It had no weird after taste and it wasn't bitter. I forgive bitter strong coffees because that is a product, often enough, of stronger coffees that could be manufactured better. I'm no snob but I also don't drink watered down coffee (i.e. Starbuck's new Blonde coffee).<br /><br />I will definitely order this again. I've never had coffee from this company before but I think I'm quite the fan. I also ordered the 3 12 packs because they shipped sooner and the idea that they would stay fresher longer was appealing. The price was slightly higher though, of course. Now that I have a canister that fits 36, I will go ahead and buy the other packaging and likely subscribe.

Personally, it's not as good as Donut Shop but it is 13 cents per cup less when you subscribe and save.<br /><br />I love the packaging where the bottom is a coffee filter and not a k cup. Since it's not the proprietary k cup design, they can probably avoid royalties to Keurig. But in the end you drink coffee not for looks or cost but taste. And while it tastes OK, there are tastier options out there.

review/summary: Great cup of coffee
review/text: I was a little worried about this k-cup since it is shaped differently from the regular k-cups. Instead of being in a fully plastic container, only the top is plastic. The bottom part is enclosed in a coffee filter type holding. While this means that when I opened the sealed wrapper I was hit with the delicious aroma of coffee, something I miss when I open a regular pack of k-cups, it also means I have to store the remaining cups in a tupperware or storage ziploc type bag to keep the remaining cups from going stale. This isn't a big deal, just something to mention. These also wouldn't fit in the normal k-cup carousel.<br /><br />I have a b60 and the cup fit perfectly, brewed up great, disposal was easy and the filter didn't tear or leak as I was throwing it way.<br /><br />Fog chaser is a bold deep brew (I brew on the middle button of my keurig) The coffee is very smooth and mellow with a terrific aroma. There is no bitter or burned taste. This is quickly becoming my favorite keurig coffee and I can't wait to try the other offerings from this company.

review/summary: WARNING - open mesh coffee pods, NOT K-Cups
review/text: I've urged Amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it, but until they do, I want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here. Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box.

This is a rich and robust flavor, with a note of nuts, one that wipes the cobwebs away in the morning.  Yes it is nice that the product uses less plastic but that is only a side note the quality of the coffee is top notch.  The only negative side comment I can make is that sometimes the top gets stuck on the upper needle of the Keurig but no problem just pull it off from the top rather than picking it up out of the brewing basket, and if you close the machine and open again it is always off the needle anyway.

review/summary: Good Coffee at Good Price (good=not GREAT)
review/text: We've ordered the Fog Chaser OneCup twice now. The first time we ordered it, I LOVED it. We are avid coffee drinkers in my house, and both love a nice bold coffee. Since the price was right and we liked the coffee, we ordered again. The 2nd shipment we received was still "good" coffee, but it wasn't as great as the first. My husband says he couldn't tell much difference, but the 2nd shipment did not have the same smooth finish and mouth-watering aroma as the original. That being said, it did not stop us from drinking it all, but I do have to wonder which is the abnormality! I rated this at a 4 since we were so impressed by the first shipment, and I really like the way the OneCup brews. As other reviewers mentioned, there is a "crema" produced by the OneCup that you rarely see with a K-Cup, which is NICE! I like the less packaging, and don't mind the occasional sediment in my cup (when we brew coffee, we generally do French Press, so we can handle that!). If I had the option of rating 3.5 I would have, since the quality of the 2nd shipment would definitely rank a 3 most likely. I do think we will try this again and see if "the third time is the charm". I will try to remember to update on what we think so that we can provide some feedback as far as consistency goes.<br />Thanks for reading!

review/summary: finally coffee for my picky palate!
review/text: Recently I have become more and more choosy with my coffee. I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.<br />For years, I have been using the same coffee brand ( med or dark, middle-of-the road priced) and it was affordable and it tasted just fine. Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more "green" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging. Now I don't feel guilty when I indulge with more than 1 K cup. For loose coffee to put into the reusable cup I choose a def. dark roast like italian or french, which is very comparable to the Fog chaser's aroma.

review/text: I was looking for a good quality coffee in a K-cup to use with my Kuerig. I have the reusable cup and love it but was looking for the convenience of the pre-filled K-cups for workday mornings.<br /><br />These K-cups were exactly what I was looking for, convenience and delicious coffee! I prefer a bolder coffee and this Fog Chaser fit the bill. I also felt this was an excellent deal considering most K-cups retail for $10.00-$16.99 for a package of 12 K-cups (and sometimes 10) and this was 80 cups for just over $30.00. The other thing I love about this is being able to have it on the subscription program.  You can set up your delivery to be delivered whenever you like beginning with 1 month intervals and you get a small discount on the price when you order through a subscription. With a quantity of 80, I've set my deliveries to come every 4 months but it may turn out that I will have to shorten it to every three months.<br /><br />If you have a Kuerig and love the convenience of the pre-filled K-cups, you can't go wrong with this product. It is a bold coffee but this company makes several types that are available in several blends. I highly recommend this product and the added  value of the subscription option.

review/text: Personally, I received this product by going down the list of K-Cups trying to find that perfect cup to put on scheduled delivery.  This is a nice bold coffee, and oddly fiscal.  I personally like the first brew, and the house mate likes the second and third, now THAT is a good deal.

review/text: I adore this coffee!!! I also tried the french roast style (which i usually drink in other brands) BUT I LOVE this FOG LIFTER roast so much better! It's simply the best K-Cup I've had! And the cost is amazing, especially if you sign up for auto delivery, which is cool because you can choose your delivery time and not just a default one!!! LOVE IT! WILL KEEP PURCHASING FOR SURE!

review/summary: Don't let the smell fool ya. It's pretty awesome.
review/text: I don't usually write a review unless I think a item deserves it but this coffee deserves it. It came in 3 separate vacuum sealed bags. Make sure you store them in a proper container after you open them or they will go bad. When I opened one, the smell was super strong. I thought the coffee was going to be bitter but after brewing it in my Keurig B130 a few times I was hooked. Not bitter at all but the smell is a little strong. But it grew on me. I brew it with 8oz. of water and the strength is good enough for me. Just a bit of creamer or milk and no sugar. I drink only a cup a day. Also, its cheaper than normal K cups and less waste. I'm not going to say that this will be my favorite forever, but it is good and if you are looking at trying something new with your K cup maker then these are worth a shot. I will keep these stocked along with other the flavors of K cups I have enjoyed.

review/summary: I'm Hooked!
review/text: I recently purchased these K-Cups, I have to admit, because of the price per cup. And now I can honestly say I will never go back to the regular K-Cups again! I usually run a K-Cup through the largest setting and then through the smallest (my coffee cup is rather large :). This Fog Chaser coffee holds up rather well. I've gotten a great, bold cup of joe every morning since receiving these. There have been no problems with grounds in the cup as sometimes happens with regular K-Cups or the refillable K-Cups.<br /><br />The 80 count box came with a reusable storage container that holds a week of pods. It's just a flimsy, clear plastic container but it does keep the coffee fresh.

review/text: First time trying SF coffee and found it to be a good coffee with a reasonable taste. Yes, the coffee smells burned prior to use but I believe thatunless you are a  connoisseur of coffee I believe most might smelled "burnt".  Good coffee for the price and the "K-Cup" new packaging works just as well as the original stle K-Cup packaging. I believe I will try another brand for taste but would stay with SFbay if the price were 5 cents less per cup.  I drink alot of coffee.!!

review/summary: Great find!
review/text: Ahhh...nothing like a good cup of coffee! I'm a bargain hunter and have considered going back to my drip coffee due to the rising prices of K cups.I read all the reviews,and feeling there was nothing to lose I debated between French Roast and Fog Chaser. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser did not disappoint (haven't tried the French Roast yet). Fog Chaser is a moderatly bold coffee, smooth, with no hint of bitterness. As for the skeptics concerned with the "netted" base of the cup affecting taste and freshness...the product is packaged in mini packs ( sealed thick plastic) of 8 cups to protect freshness. In addition, I feel the netting (not flimsy by any means) offers a better fitration system that the typical K cup. I only write reviews about products that excite me, or repulse me. Obviously, I am a San Francisco Bay Coffee fan. If you choose to try this product, I'm pretty sure you will be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Excellent Taste and More Robust Brewing with These Type of Pods
review/text: I decided to give these a try based on the price, the favorable reviews here on Amazon, and its sales rank in the K-cup store.  I was not disappointed as this is a strong, but not too strong, good-tasting coffee that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds.  This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee.  You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a "clean" look from a normal K-cup pod.  This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.  I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  Who knows, I may have found a new favorite coffee!

review/summary: Good Alternative to More Pricey "Bold" K-Cups
review/text: SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser was a nice "bold" surprise.  I am a big fan of Amazon's Subscribe & Save program and have been getting my K-cups this way for over a year.  Of course, once you find one you absolutely love (Timothy's World Midnight Magic), poof!  The Magic's gone!  Midnight Magic is still available on Amazon, though no longer offered through Subscribe & Save, and I refuse to pay $35 for 48 K-cups of any brand.  S & S now offers SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser and based on the quantity of favorable reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  The pods are far different than what we've all been used to, but they work like a charm, have less waste, and deliver a pretty bold, smooth cup of coffee.  My morning coffee always consists of two pods at the 6 oz. setting each for one eye-opening 12 oz. mug of coffee.  On that setting, Fog Chaser lives up to its name.  I have noticed some residue occasionally, but it certainly is minimal.  The pods come packed in plastic bags (12 pods/bag).  Once cut open, I just fold over the edge, clip it and store the bag in the fridge.  Strength is a personal decision, and to me, more than 6 oz. of water with ANY pod is too weak.  If you are a fan of Rev of Jet Fuel, this coffee is comparable.

review/text: Decided to give these a try based on price.  The coffee tastes great but since the 'cups' don't have the plastic bottoms (a filter element), we had to store in a sealed jar to keep them fresh and not have the coffee bean smell thru-out the house.  (or you could use a plastic ziploc - original bag was not re-sealable).  They did one thing finally right - you don't have to pay MORE for going green when buying LESS packaging.  Kudos.

review/summary: Very Good K-Cup Coffee at a nice price
review/text: Fog Chaser has a very good flavor, and it is reasonably strong especially for a K-Cup.  I like it better than their French Roast version, which seems stronger but more harsh to me; and I like very strong coffee.  Their Rainforest version has a more mellow taste that is also very good, but it is weaker strength than Fog Chaser.  The price for any of the versions, especially for the "subscribe and save", is very good.  The packaging, which is a box of 3 sealed bags of 12 is fine to deal with; once you open a sealed bag (you can't reseal the bag), just use a ziplock to seal the remainder for the week.

FogChaser is in that league: rich, deep, dark, zesty, overall INTERESTING and best of all (unlike the plastic-bottomed K-cups) brewing it makes my kitchen smell good again. I'm putting it on subscription.  A good find; a keeper -- glad I tried it.

review/text: Our nine-month-old daughter is ready for a more substantial breakfast than plain cereals.  We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.  This blend of fruit and grains (and, in some cases, yogurt) provides everything she needs for a good breakfast and keeps her full for several hours.  Plus, the flavors are not overly sweet.  One note:  at least two of these flavors include yogurt.  Some babies younger than 1-year may have a reaction to yogurt and other dairy foods, so just watch out for that.

review/summary: A well-balanced meal for baby
review/text: We feed our baby this Wholesome Breakfast at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.  We're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  We particularly like that this food contains yogurt.  When she was young (~6 months old), our baby loved yogurt but couldn't eat it plain because it would cause a rash around her mouth.  She was never bothered by the yogurt in this food, though, perhaps because it was mixed with other things.  Now that she's older (10 months), our baby can eat all the yogurt she wants without a skin reaction, but for awhile, this variety of Wholesome Breakfast was the only source of her favorite food.

I ordered another variety of "Wholesome breakfast" too: Pear, Apple, Oatmeal. Same thing there. I'm guessing they all have heavy cream in them.

review/summary: Really a wholesome breakfast
review/text: We initially tried few sample from Ralph's and our Baby started liking it .. We don't give formula to our Baby and we give only Mom's milk.<br />i think when we combine that with this wholesome breakfast you will have a satisfaction that you are really taking a good care of the Baby..<br />What's more it had got more calories than the regular baby foods and it had got 35% iron which i consider important.. It has dates in it. Very few baby foods for breakfast have dates in them.. on the whole it's really a wholesome breakfast.. Add organic on top of that what else can you ask for.. I had only one thing to complain about.. it's availability is rare.. i had to wait for a month to get it.. I don't find it in the store shelves either..

review/summary: A well-balanced meal for baby
review/text: We feed our baby this Wholesome Breakfast at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.  We're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  Also, our baby is a picky eater, so we're thrilled to find something she likes that's more substantial than Puffs!

review/summary: The Lemon Drop Kid
review/text: The title above refers not only to a semi-obscure Damon Runyan-based movie with Bob Hope (we ALL knew that), but to these classic lemon drops with a truly international pedigree:<br /><br />Made in Spain; owned by the French(Cadbury France, located at 143 Boulevard Romain Rolland, Paris; imported by New Jersey's own "Euro-American Brands," Paramus, NJ  07652.<br /><br />All the way from Paris to your local candy seller or movie theater (which is where I experieced my first taste of La Vie en Lemon).  They were everything a lemon drop should be: A sugary entrance, developing into a deeply satisfying, soul-stirring essence of pure lemon. The mouth-watering joy of the lemon drop is seductive and addictive, and I am nearly certain that sucking on these golden gems made Kurosawa's "Savage Dogs" even more enjoyable.<br /><br />They're hard candies. but not so hard that you couldn't cheat and bite into one, breaking it up into ten or so smaller candies, zig-zagging around your mouth like offshoots from a single magnificent fireworks explosion.<br /><br />One 2-ounce tin lasted longer than the 2 hours or so of Kurosawa's brilliant detective drama, one of his first with Toshiro Mifune, who once again delivers a compelling performance.  Although the packaging is a bit precious, there's nothing pretentious about the taste of Les Citrons, and as for value, these drops are the working man or woman's workhorse.  They're far less expensive than other candy (to say nothing of popcorn), and their staying power is extraordinary.<br /><br />Still, this vendor charges more than some others, and with the added shipping fee one may wish to purchase these  at a local outlet (or occupying it until your lemon drop demands are met). If you're serious about your lemon drops, tt's Paris 1968 all over again.<br /><br />Nutritional Information per Package (30 pieces; you could try to eat the suggested serving size of 3 drops, but I find this highly unlikely). 240 calories, no fat or sodium, 60 grams carbohydrates, 60 grams of sugar, no protein, and no trace of food allerges. Sugar, corn syrup, citric acid, natural flavor, and tumoric for color. THh lemon-decorated little tin adds a touch of Europe to any room, and is ideal for holding cuff links, tickets, keys, small, delicate make-up products, or quarters for the laundry.  To paraphrase the great Margaret Dumont:<br />"Les Citrons, Toujours...Les Citrons!"

I was worried that she wasn't getting the nutrients she needed. Then I found Utramix and I am thrilled. She loves it, actually cleans her bowl. I merely drizzle a little warm water on it since I'm no longer mixing in canned food and she gobbles it up. There are chunks of bananas, peas, carrots, etc. that she seems to love. The mix even contains probiotics. Highly recommended.

review/summary: The best of Irish tea!
review/text: Some years ago my husband and I were lucky enough to visit Ireland several times. While there we discovered Bewley's Tea Shop in Dublin, and also their Irish Afternoon Tea. It was better than any other tea I have ever had -- and I am a committed tea drinker. The 'finish' is incredibly smooth, with just the right 'body' for an afternoon pick me up.<br /><br />We bought several boxes to take home in our suitcases;then when we ran out, we had coworkers who were going to Ireland bring more of it back to us. When our Irish trips ended and our sources dried up, we were truly disheartened, since we had only found it in one location in the States [a little tea shop in Alexandria, Virginia.]<br /><br />When I found out that it is now available through Amazon/Sullivan's I was elated and placed my order that day. Unfortunately I didn't see that the large box of it [80] teabags would soon be available until after I had placed my order for smaller boxes. The large boxes are a MUCH better value [80 teabags for $8.99 as oppossed to 25 teabags for $5.99]. That is certainly the way I will order in the future. But I'm delighted to find a source for Bewley's teas, especially Irish Afternoon. And I am anxious to try the Dublin Morning tea, which I also ordered.  Happy Nonnie!

review/summary: I finally found it
review/text: About 10 years ago while visiting disneyworld in orlando florida my wife and I met a nice english couple. Being a tea drinker I inquired about good english teas and they gave me a napkin with the names of bewleys tea on it and about 6 teabags for me to try. I put the napkin in my back pocket and the teabags got wrapped up in an old sandwich bag and put in my wife's purse. We parted with the nice english couple and as we traveled around disneyworld it began to rain that afternoon and we got soaking wet. I found what was left of the napkin that evening at the hotel and it was unreadable. About 6 months later at home the bag fell out of my tea closet as i was fixing to make a cup and I decided to finally try the tea those nice folks from england raved about. I loved the tea and I believe I have finally found it in bewleys. Some of the best tea I have had. The english surely know their tea.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I have been drinking Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea until I tried Bewley's.  I have always like my tea very strong using double the amount of most people.  I drink it with cream and sugar and this tea is perfect for me.  I do not have to put in extra because it is full bodied and stands up to cream and sugar wonderfully.  I have been drinking it in the morning and have been using the Yorkshire Gold for the afternoon. Bewley's is my favorite now, not that Yorkshire Gold sucks or anything but I like it strong.  I will still search for another tea perhaps as good. Life is an adventure and you never know when you're going to bingo.<br /><br />If you like a strong, not bitter brew try Bewley's!  After you've had Irish it is hard to go back, teawise that is.

review/summary: WARNING! Made all four of my dogs sick
review/text: Recently purchased these treats for my 4 dogs from local grocery store. After giving my dogs these chews, my 3 month old puppy threw up the treat. By the next day at lunch time, he was exhibiting neurotoxic symptoms. We immediately took him to the vet for blood work, which all came back below normal limits. He was given IV therapy and monitored over night. Over the next two days, my older dogs (ages 4, 7 and 9)began vomiting and acting lethargic, but with no neurological symptoms. We traced the cause back to these chews, as it is the only coomon thing among all the dogs (puppy eats different food than adult dogs, puppy is walked on a leash not allowed to run around in yard yet, puppy is not out of his crate unless he is beig observed, etc.). After speaking with someone at a pet store, we learned some rawhide chews are pressed with water, while others are pressed with formaldehyde. While it is not listed which method these use, we are concerned it is the formaldehyde. In the case of the older dogs, their GIs are rejecting them due to the toxins. With the puppy, his immature renal and hepatic system exhibited neurotoxicity.

review/summary: Yes, it is like chewing on a sponge!
review/text: I confirm another review here that perfectly describes the texture and taste of this product as like chewing on a cellulose sponge! OMG! I love tofu, by the way. This is the first tofu I've eaten in decades that I did not like.<br /><br />I bought this after reading that review and thinking the person was maybe not familiar with the taste of tofu, or perhaps tried to eat this without re-hydrating this first. No, it is like chewing on a sponge (Have we all by accident done this, or is it an early childhood memory of times when we tested everything with our mouths?) At any rate, you will instantly think "sponge" if you ignore these warnings and buy this tofu. I do not mean just the texture, it really tastes like a cellulose sponge!<br /><br />I am also a fan of Eden Foods and enjoy many of their products, they make great tamari, for instance. I was looking for that texture and taste I find in freeze dried tofu pieces that come in soup mixes as in instant miso tofu soup packets or soup cups. This isn't that tofu! It will not be wasted, it has good protein and I can chop it in very small pieces and mix it with Creamy Tomato Soup by Pacific Naturals, that makes it innocuous enough. But I'll never buy this again!<br /><br />I am looking into buying a food dehydrator to make my own. The cost of tofu is much lower that this item reflects. I will update this if I have success drying my own tofu. Believe the reviews here, this isn't good.

review/summary: You Need to Learn How to Cook Dried Tofu
review/text: Koya Dofu, or freeze-dried tofu, requires a specific approach to cooking. It not only has to be rehydrated in a particular way, but also will not taste good without proper cooking to flavor and soften it. Even at that point, it will have a chewy, slightly spongey texture, but if cut and cooked appropriately, it is not a strange texture and is very delicious as a side dish.<br /><br />Google recipes for Koyadofu and try one that involves simmering it (after rehydration) in a broth made of katsuobushi (if you are not vegetarian -- if you are, then use mushroom or vegie stock), shouyu or tamari, mirin, and a little sweetner. My child loves this, and I pack it in her school lunch box along with rice, and some vegies that have been simmered in the same broth.

review/summary: A bit too cloying
review/text: I really enjoy flavored coffees, and like how mild Melitta coffees are. (I am not a fan of French roast (i.e., Starbucks) - it's too bitter and burnt tasting for me.) Melitta's French vanilla flavor, however, is my least favorite of the Melitta flavored coffees (behind hazelnut and morning decadence). I find that the flavor is too overwhelming and cloying. For those who like strong flavor, this will be a hit, but I find that I have to mix it (1 spoon of flavored to 2 spoons of regular) in order to enjoy it.

review/summary: Best coffee I've ever tasted.
review/text: I've tried almost every ground coffee there is, and I have to say that Melitta French Vanilla (and Hazelnut) is the best tasting coffee ever.  You don't have to use a lot of coffee, so the can lasts longer than leading brands.  The taste is a non-powerful, strong blend with a subtle vanilla.  Even when the coffee is brewing it's out of this world!<br /><br />Amazon has a great price for this item.  WHEN my store has it on sale, they ask $4.89 for a can, so this is a nice price plus the wonderful free shipping offer.  I received my coffee two days after I ordered it!  I will now add this to the list of groceries I now order through Amazon.<br /><br />Highly recommend you to try this coffee and see if you agree too!

In the last month they changed their packaging, which is fine, but also changed the grind. All of a sudden, these four packs come in "extra fine grind," which simply doesn't work well at all in our drip coffee maker. The whole pot tastes weak until you get to the last couple of cups, which taste more like mud because all of the coffee has settled. Here's hoping they switch back at some point, because this is just bad.

review/text: When it comes down to so many Americans, they are right now skipping going to Starbucks to get their favorite flavor of coffee and lattes, and having them right at home. Fortunately, Melitta knows that feeling with their coffees, and make them well from the heart. Their French Vanilla is a delightful tast that just melts your heart away. It is delicious after the first cup, and just everlasting. My one and only gripe with Melitta though is that with their ground coffees is that they are very hard to open the cans, considering you'd have to use a regular can opener to get them open, rather than peel the top off from Folgers or Maxwell House. That definitely is the only thing that is not only frustrarting, but can easily cause the consumer to break the can. Still, the taste is great and if you want a nice soulfully delightful cup of joe, Melitta can take you there.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Convience: B-<br /><br />Overall: B

review/summary: Good To The Last Drop!!
review/text: If you love good medium-roasted and well balanced coffee then you will love Melitta.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. Melitta only uses the top 2% of the world's supply of 100% Arabica coffee and it tastes it. (and NO, I don't work for the company!) Arabica is the finest grade of coffee available on the market.  The other grade, "Robusto" is generally less expensive, lower quality and used by most other major coffee processors such as Chock Full O' Nuts, Folgers, Maxwell House and almost all generic and store brands to name a few).<br /><br />2. The 11.5 oz. cans are nitrogen-flushed and well-sealed to retain its integrity and fresh roasted flavor upon opening. I have found consistently that coffee packaged in plastic or paper bags or pouches DOES NOT, in my opinion, retain its flavor and freshness well.<br /><br />3. If you have a drip coffee maker (Like Bunn, Mr. Coffee or others), Melitta's fine grind works exceptionally well. Remember...the finer the grind, the more flavor you will extract from the coffee. In addition, the finer the grind, the more efficiently your coffee maker will use coffee. Since you can generally use less coffee per cup, Melitta is a winner for price per ounce.<br /><br />4. Melitta seems to be a very transparent and consumer responsible company. They place clear "Best By" dates on the bottom of each of their products.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. Some of Melitta's flavors, like French Vanilla and a seasonally-offered coffee called "Morning Decadence", are very hard to find but well worth investigating and sampling if you have a chance.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />The best commercially available coffee for drip coffee makers. Outstanding grind, well-balanced flavors and consistent freshness can after can.

review/summary: Good coffee, good value
review/text: First of all, 10 days ago Amazon ran this coffee on a great special, about $4.70 per pound.  This was my first try; I should have bought more because Amazon has about doubled the price in less than two weeks.  This is a medium blend and grind as advertised.  The top is tightly sealed; it was the hardest pull off top that I've ever encountered, and you could hear the air express as it was opened.  The aroma is great in the can, when brewing, and in the cup. The taste is, for me, somewhat artificial although not obnoxious, but it cost a star in my book.  There is no residual acidity or aftertaste.  The expiration date is fine, at May 2012; it won't last anywhere near that long.

review/summary: leaves an aftertaste
review/text: I am a fan of Melitta's other coffees, especially hazelnut, but they just didn't get French Vanilla right. There is something of a chemical aftertaste to it that contradicts the nice aroma. It's noticeable enough to make you wonder if something is "not quite right" with it. Not disgusting, you can definitely get through your cup but not delicious either.

review/text: Yes the coffee is good but why do you raise the price without letting anyone know??  I expect 1 price to be debited from my account and then the price goes up $5 without warning or notice!  Not Cool!

review/text: I was a little apprehensive about ordering coffee online.  I had never heard of this brand, but to my delight, it is absolutely delicious.  I love it and my husband enjoys the Vanilla and also one of the other blends.  I would recommend if you are fan of any flavored coffee.

review/text: The Melitta French Vanilla has been a hit with both family and with guests. Great aroma, balanced and smooth coffee with a rich taste. We ordered more to give as gifts and ordered other Melitta blends because we were so impressed with this one and like changing our coffee every week or so.

review/text: I thought these were going to be the same size as the ones in the grocery store. I found they were smaller and more expensive to buy online then if I just bought the bigger ones for 99 cents each at the grocery store.

review/summary: Twix King Package a little old...
review/text: We got a super deal (under $12) on this box of Twix King Size candy, so I can't really complain... BUT the caramel was a tad harder/chewier than it should be for fresh bars. Perhaps they were clearancing them out.

review/text: $23.52 for ten pounds of these beans???  I just bought a bag of these at Sam's Club for $8.95.  If you want to pay nearly 4 times the going rate, by ALL MEANS, purchase this!  Seriously, how STUPID would a person need to be to pay $2.53 for a pound of dried beans?

review/summary: Fantastic Gluten Free granola
review/text: but WHY would you package the product into four separate pouches (which I love) and have a nutrition label say the box contains "about 10 servings"???? I may agree that one pouch is enough for two small servings, great with milk warmed up by the way, but how do you get 2 1/4 servings from a pouch?

review/summary: Yummy and good on the go
review/text: I like variety in my gf cereals and this granola is a nice addition to my shelf. The granola comes in packets inside the box so it is handy for travel. It's sweet but not too sweet. I eat it in a bowl with milk and it is just the right amount. Granola is more dense so a portion is smaller than a bowl full of cereal.

review/summary: Tight Fit
review/text: The Melitta Java Pods Have a slightly smaller circumference than the Senseo pods and are thicker. If you are using a Senseo coffee machine, you probably should moisten the Java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid. Otherwise, you risk breaking the latching mechanism. The resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the Senseo decaf pods. The Melitta Java pods are not really designed for the Senseo machine and several other brands such as Halo, Fratello and Millstone work better in the Senseo machine.
