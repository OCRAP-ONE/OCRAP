review/text: I've tried almost every energy drink out there and some work and some don't, but for the most part they all crash an hour or so later and leave you scrambling for some food or more energy drinks.  A never ending, ugly cycle.  I tried 5 Hour Energy and have been using it ever since.  It is truly a fantastic product.  If you need long lasting energy that wont make you feel hyped up or bring you crashing down an hour or two later, this is the product for you.

review/summary: got energy?
review/text: definitely provides more energy.  I usually have a sip or two<br />if I'm feelling a little sluggish.  I agree with some of the other reviews with regards to feeling jittery.  my solution to that is,<br />don't down the whole bottle in one sitting.  I'll usually take half<br />the bottle, or less, then a little more when I need it.  after opening the bottle, it should be discarded within 72 hrs.  :-)

review/text: My son just returned from Iraq and they said they use 5 hour energy all the time. I decided I would try it and I was very satisfied. I was concerned about the crash but there is none. It provides a smooth long lasting boost.<br /><br />There are no jitters but I wouldn't recommend it if you are going to be sitting at a desk all day because it makes you want to get going.<br /><br />It is great for a day of yard work, hiking, cycling etc.

review/summary: Seriously??
review/text: I honestly don't get the popularity of this item. It is nothing more than B complex in liquid form. I guess it's something to take if you don't carry around a small bottle of B vitamins. Maybe I drink too much coffee and that is why I can't appreciate the energy effects of a B complex, I think taurine and guarana are much better energy sources. Whether you prefer B vits, caffeine, taurine or guarana, below are products that will give you what this product gives you(or more) at a much more reasonable price.<br /><br />B supplements:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020HQAU">B-100 Complex 100 caps</a><br />Super Stress B Complex 100 Caps<br /><br />Liquid B supplements:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NOUDE">Nature's Bounty B-Complex Sublingual Liquid 2 fl oz (59 ml)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00125W1AO">World Organic - Liquid B Complex, 16 fl oz liquid</a><br /><br />Caffeine, Taurine & Guarana:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTM0WK">Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugarfree, 8.4 Ounce Can (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2O4YC">Diet Rockstar Energy Drink-Double Strength Energy Drink 16oz, 24 Pack</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DNBYXK">Monster Lo-carb Energy 16-Ounce., 27.5 LBS Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQSQ68">NOW Foods Taurine Pure Powder, 8-Ounce</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000703AU0">Super Guarana 1200mg - 90 tabs,(Good N' Natural)</a><br /><br />Personally, I  think it's silly to cough up two dollars for one shot of this when you can have the same level of energy, through the same vitamins at a much cheaper price.

review/summary: Wonderful stuff!
review/text: I am very leery of "energy drinks." I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this. Usually it starts with something like this: Them--"Does that stuff really work?" Me--"Yes! It's awesome, and it isn't like most energy drinks. This is really vitamins. Here, try this!" Them (two weeks later)--"Wow! That stuff really does work. I have been buying it now!"<br /><br />This is highly recommended for safe and healthy pick-me-ups! (Can I give it 10 stars?)

review/summary: Energy, Anxiety, Caffeine...  No Problems
review/text: I am VERY sensitive to Caffeine. It can send me into a full blown anxiety attack.  This product, for some reason had NO adverse effects for me.  If this is usually an issue for you, I would suggest trying 1/2 a bottle and seeing how you tolerate it.  I had energy.  Since it has B12 vitamins in it, my mood was also enhanced. I felt excited and energetic.  The berry flavor tastes like Crystal Light Pink Lemonade.  Almost exactly like that.  There was no crash AND I was able to sleep well that night.  Sound too good to be true!? It was for me. I am SERIOUSLY trying to resist the urge to stock up and buy a whole case.  This stuff is great.  I was in a show with someone who had trouble focusing, was moody and forgetful.  We were on stage and he was often a mess... One night he did an amazing job, and I asked him what was different... He said... I took a 5 Hour Energy drink.  I was stunned and still not convinced... but saw the drink in a store and had to try it.  WOW!  That is all I can say! WOW! It's great!!!

review/summary: DON'T OVERDO IT AND ALL WILL BE GOOD
review/text: Dear Five-Hour-Energy (Berry Flavored),<br /><br />You came into my life when I was not ready for you.  I was still in a love-hate relationship with another woman, Coffee.  I loved Coffee's black taste, her bitter aroma, and her warm awakening after missing her for so long.  But she was not the one for me, my nights with her left me shaking, heart furious.  I felt manic and trapped.  My body would crash after tasting Coffee and my mind would race, too busy spinning to do anything useful.<br /><br />Then you came into my life, my sweet 5-Hour-Energy.  Coffee had stormed out, made a big scene at the cafe.  I met you at a gas station, looking alone and forlorn.  I asked you out to a club, and we danced all night long.  Later, I took you to rock climbing, swimming, kayaking.  My heart swelled with joy but you never made it hurt.  As our relationship prolonged, we sat with each other, working, sometimes writing tender missives.  My mind was alert, never spun thoughtlessly.<br /><br />Oh my love, I'd love to love you 5 hours more, my 5-Hour-Energy.<br /><br />Love,<br />Charlie<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- works!  you do get energy!<br />- minimal crashes (only occurs when i partake TOO excessively)<br />- berry flavor is tasty<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- there's a lot of vitamin B in this.  don't know if that is good or bad.<br />- can develop an immunity if you drink two or more every day, so don't do that<br /><br />As always, don't overdo any caffeine product.  If your body does not respond well to this product, cease immediately and maybe ask your doctor.  And then tell me if there are health risks.  Because I am not a doctor.  I am a warrior poet.  If by warrior, one thinks of programmers.

review/summary: 93 octane Gasoline for Humans
review/text: I am a serious runner and a cyclist. I am very skeptical most of too good to be true stuff but I do believe we landed on the moon and 9/11 caused by terrorists not by government. So I sacrificed  my body to test this product in the name of humanity. I run without 5 hour energy and then  I run with 5 hour energy. Difference is so obvious I really did get extra energy and power to shave off 2-3 minutes of my 5 mile morning run before annoying work day, as a matter of fact I still had gas in the tank to go another 4-5 miles if I had time. Same thing when I do road cycling specially 30-40milers, after 20 mile ride I take a shot of 5 hour energy and  double my distance. Having only 4 calories but giving you so much energy is a good thing. I recommended this for my fellow earthlings

review/summary: Works as the ads say it does...
review/text: This product is great and you get what the ads tell you about this product. You can definitely get through hours where you are extremely tired. Usually take it either in the afternoon to get through the rest of the day; small sip before a workout, half a bottle around 10PM when going out during the weekend. This product has a bit of an intense flavor - overall all of them do, so have some water ready as a chaser. This product will get you to a state like when you slept 10 hours and are bright awake and alert, however you wont have the jitters, shaky hands or anything like it. After the 5-6 hours it slowly fades away and you literally get back to the state you were at before taking this product - so there is no crash or anything. Aside from that your body will just extract this product after a bathroom run - it is not based on caffeine or taurine it actually works based on insane amounts of Vitamin B6 and B12 - one of them is at 8000% of your DV for food intake. Personally I have had great experience with it; though I have heard from people that they end up having to visit the bathroom due to some digestive issues.

review/summary: Other energy drinks don't work for you?  Try a bottle of 5-hour
review/text: First, as other reviewers here have already done, i want to emphasize that different bodies react differently to products such as this.  These are my own experiences with the products, and your mileage may vary.<br /><br />For this reason, I would encourage people try try a bottle at a local store (sold just about everywhere) before buying 12-pack's from amazon.<br /><br />Experiences with other products -<br />I drink coffee out of habit, but it doesn't help me to stay awake.<br />Instead, it makes me jittery and occasionally sick in the stomach.<br />Soda makes me bloated and deathly sleepy within minutes.<br />Energy drinks (monster, amp) makes me alert, but not at all focused.  The effect doesn't last more than a hour and the drink makes my stomach bloated and my body tense.<br /><br />5-hour energy -<br />The first thing that will hit you is the sourness, as if you're sucking on a lemon or warhead(though not as strong).  The sourness jolts me right up and then immediately after, it turns sweet and leaves no aftertaste.<br />It gets rid of the sleepy (the in-your-head, eyelids closing, can't stay awake kind of sleepy).. but doesn't really fix tiredness or exhaustion.<br />The thing I like best about this product is the -lack of- side effects.  Doesn't make my body tense or jittery, doesn't make me bloated or sick, doesn't make me more sleepy or crash.<br /><br />Does it really last 5 hours?  I've never tried chugging the whole thing.<br />I keep one in my bag and take a sip when needed.  It usually keeps me happy and productive for a day or two.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad at all imo.. call me crazy but i actually really like it.  Lemon-lime being my favorite, followed by pomegranate and berry.<br /><br />Price - yes, the drink isn't cheap.<br />BUT, the price is similar for any energy drink and i think that the price of this product is way overstated because you're getting a 2oz bottle instead of a 16oz can.<br /><br />However, for it's intended purpose (keeping you awake, not hydrated), (and if it works for you)i see it as a better deal for lasting longer, also I like the small pocket-able size.

review/summary: Great Up without the Down
review/text: 5-Hour Energy gives us the boost without the drop. Pomegranate is our favorite flavor, but we usually buy whatever has the best deal at the time. Orange is a close second. They're all fine. After all, it doesn't take much more than a shot or less to do the trick, so the taste isn't that big of a deal. What's important is the "clean energy" without the plunge, addiction, stains or breath of coffee.

review/summary: I thought 5-hour energy was a scam until I tried it. It's unreal.
review/text: I'll be honest, I was a total skeptic of 5-hour energy for a LONG time. The TV ads seemed like a scam, no one I knew had tried them, and I just didn't buy into their marketing. Sure enough, I was browsing Amazon late at night one evening and decided to just try a box out. Why not, right? All I can say, is that these are unreal. Straight up. I don't know what else to say. I'm actually still trying to figure out how these are legal and the boost is amazing. Everything they claim is fact. There are not jittery feelings, no crash. The only thing they don't tell you is that the boost is so great that you'll want them all the time and they aren't cheap.<br /><br />Granted, I don't take these during the day at work - I'm a tea drinker and that keeps me going. When I head to go play basketball after work (3-4 times a week) I take one 15 minutes before I play. There is a noticeable difference in my energy levels out there when I have one, and when I do not. After a week of trying them out I was hooked. I'm an Ironman triathlete and consider myself to be in great cardio shape - knowing the performance edge that I seem to get from these, I would definitely use them on race day and again, can't say enough about the energy boost that accompanies these things.<br /><br />Anyway, you may not see a huge difference if you're sitting at your desk and take one - Honestly, I have no idea, I've just never used them that way. But...if you're going to work out, going on a run, going to play basketball or something to that effect, take one...and I think you'll be sold.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you'll need to sell your liver on eBay to sustain your habit...they are not cheap.

review/summary: Works almost too good
review/text: I had always seen the commercials for these energy drinks, and being the skeptic I am never really paid them any attention. One of my friends came back from college over winter break and he drinks them quite often, so I figured why not give them a try.<br /><br />These things work well, almost too well really. I've been taking them because during the week between school and work I average about 5-6 hours of sleep. When the commercial says feel it in minutes, they were not lying. It gets me going so much it almost feels like I've taken (illicit) drugs. I have a hard time sitting still in class these are so powerful.<br /><br />I will note that some people seem to get nothing from these, so before you go out and buy 24 bottles I'd say head to a gas station and pick one up for about 3 bucks. Also, energy lovers out there who have a Costco membership, you can get a pack of 24 for about 36 dollars before tax, and skip out on the shipping time.

review/summary: Excellent Product!
review/text: This drink delivers exactly what it promises. You get the energy boost you need without the side effects of a caffeine or sugar overload, which means you also don't get the crash when it wears off.  However, I would recommend taking it in small doses.  When I drink an entire bottle at once I get an immediate rush that eventually tapers off a bit and keeps me going for 5-6 hours.  However, it also makes me a little queasy.  I've gotten much better results by sipping on a bottle all day.  I sip about 1/4 quarter of the bottle every 2 hours.  This keeps me going all day without getting that upset stomach feeling. Highly recommended.

This stuff usually does the trick.  One minute you're falling out of your chair, the next, you're good to go.  Alert and focused.  It's been a lifesaver more than once.  I'm also going to school online, and it has saved my bacon there, as well. I get the 12 pack and keep some at home and some in my drawer at work.  For me, its effect is usually about 3 hours, though.<br /><br />I seem to need the whole bottle, and I guess I'm one of the few that really prefers the Lemon-Lime flavor to the others.  The taste's not great; but it beats Red Bull and the like in taste, and effectiveness - and, you only have to drink the small bottle instead of a whole can.  Only 4 calories.  Sugarfree.  Not much caffeine.  I can honestly say the only time I've experienced anything close to jitters, is when I drank two in one day.  Even then, it wasn't the usual "too much caffeine" jitters.  It's the best thing I've ever found.  Tried another brand last month- tasted even worse and didn't work as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend 5 Hour!

review/summary: All Star Success
review/text: I purchased this product late last week for my husband.  He had been buying it at a local mom & pop store for about a week.  He had been very pleased with its results.  When I placed the order, I told him I thought it would be here on Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.  On Tuesday morning, the UPS truck rolled into my driveway with my order.  I could not have been more pleased.  Not only was the speed of delivery fast from CA to ME, but it was well packaged, in a properly sized box with minimal packing materials(appealing to the enviromentalist in me).  I had also looked at other products on your site and will be ordering again soon.  The prices were very good as compared to the health food store where I generally get these products.  Thank you for your great service.  It is most appreciated.  Annette from Maine

review/text: I just recently purchased this product, so I could get the energy to get off my butt and hit the gym. This definitely helped me do that, and since I count calories, this product also have a definite plus. 4 Calories!  :)<br /><br />  I would suggest to take this as early as you possible can, because you will be wide awake. I think this also helps with concentration, but not right after you take it. heh. If you take this for concentrating, wait a while to do work, or study. I don't experience any unpleasant wired-ness with this product, it's great!

review/summary: Gooood Stuff!
review/text: My brother (who's in the Air Force) loves this stuff, and eventually I got into it as well. I just sent him a 12 pack  as a gift to keep him going during his daily 12 hour shifts.<br /><br />If you have never tried regular 5 hour, I would try that first (especially half a bottle to see how it effects you). Then, if you feel like it's just so-so, try one of these extra strength ones and you might see a significant improvement. Energy products affect us all in different ways, and 5-Hour Extra is packed full with high amounts of B-complex and energy concentrated mixture (Gaurana, Taurine, Caffeine, Ginseng, etc.). I've read doctor's reviews of energy supplements like these, and as long as you aren't chugging down more than the recommended amount (2 bottles a day max), they are perfectly fine. Make sure you talk to a MD if you have high blood pressure, or have medications that might interact with a highly caffeinated shot such as these.<br /><br />I recommend putting these in the refrigerator and drinking them in the morning, or an hour before working out.

review/summary: As ineffective for me as sugar-free Red Bull...
review/text: First off, let me repeat what a few other reviewers have remarked:  different people are likely to have somewhat varied reactions to this product.<br /><br />And some background:  In the past I've had both Red Bull and Sugar-free Red Bull.  Red Bull works wonders for me.  If I take it at 10pm, I have great focus and concentration and I can stay up working all night long through to the morning.  But Sugar-free Red Bull has no effect on me whatsoever.  I can take it at 10pm and fall asleep 10 minutes later.<br /><br />'5-Hour Energy' has a very similar effect on me as Sugar-free Red Bull.  Which is, basically, nothing.  That said, '5-hour Energy' appears to be more likely to (1) give me a headache, (2) make me lethargic, (3) and make me want to go to sleep.<br /><br />So, if you are like me and need sugar for Red Bull to work for you, then likely this '5-hour Energy' drink won't do anything for you either.

review/text: This is an excellent pasta and I congratulate the monks, or at least those who occupy the Monesterio or bought its name. The curl in the pasta is perfect to capture the sauces mixed with the pasta. Since we live in the heat and here in Miami, we found it went well with a family recipe of shrimp, tomato, garlic, and hot spices. The price was reasonable and the quantity shipped makes it easy to part with one bag as a gift. Instead of bringing the traditional bottle of wine that never gets consumed and the host saves for his own enjoyment later, a pasta gift like this one has the same effect -- a follow up thanks by the host when it is you who should be saying "thank you."

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: I'm rather new to drinking tea. I first tried Pickwick Purely Peach while at work. I was looking for something similar, as I've found that fruit flavored teas are my favorite, although Earl Grey is among the few I've tried and enjoyed. I meant to get the Douwe Egberts Pickwick Tea Compiback Fruits, as it includes 6 different flavors.<br /><br />I'm not disappointed in my purchase. Black tea is the only tea I've enjoyed, and the Forest Fruit tea has a wonderful smell. Raspberry and strawberry are the most evident, to me. The ingredients list blackberry and blueberry, as well. The smells are stronger shortly after the bag is placed in the water, and I wasn't paying much attention when I made the tea.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea if you are new to Black tea, or any tea, and looking for something with a fruit flavor, give this one a try! But, my recommendation would be the Douwe Egberts Pickwick Tea Compiback Fruits. You get the Forest Fruit flavor, as well as 5 others. I'm planning on sharing this tea with my friends and family.

review/text: This is a fantastic artisanal pasta. It was very easy to boil al dente and since the surface of the pasta is not smooth, the pasta really absorbed the flavor of the sauce. Highly recommend.

review/text: Where I live, Pistachios have been more expensive than some of the other nuts, so I haven't used them much. But buying them in bulk like this made them more reasonable.<br /><br />I've been enjoying them quite a bit. They are soft, almost like a Cashew, yet flavorful. Excellent for chopping and using in muffins. I'm also going to try making a salad dressing with them, and maybe some deserts.<br /><br />The quality of these was very good, they appear to be quite fresh.

review/text: My girlfriend recently purched them from a grocery store, and wow are they good. I was scared at first, frightened really, most healthy food I have tried in the past has been complete garbage, always tasting like plastic, or you know some orphans died because of what you just ate. But no sir, not these chips. I think these chips may possibly deserve an award, Nothing flashy like the Nobel peace prize but maybe a regional bowling participation ribbon. In this context a personal teleporter would be the nobel prize and the top food product, some sort of cheese and cow monstrosity that has no calories would be the congressional medal of honor. These definitely have their place and they will not budge. Fortunately I have an amazing  girlfriend who provides me with these astounding discoveries of healthy food.

I used to order this brand in the knotted bones and my dogs loved them, but the company changed the recipe and now my picky dogs won't even touch them.  I have also bought the compressed rawhide chicken top bones, which my dogs like too, but they never chew the actual rawhide so it doesn't keep them busy for long.  I saw these online and thought I would try them - what a hit!! My dogs are so happy! They love the chicken tops and it seems to take a Little longer to chew off then the pressed rawhide bones do.  Also, the rawhide is thin enough that they even enjoy chewing that as well.  I hope they continue making these just as they are, they are fabulous!!!

review/summary: Now I Make Pad Thai that Tastes Like It Should!
review/text: Tamarind paste has not been a staple in my pantry -- until I discovered what a difference it can make in my cooking.  I created a marvelous Pad Thai sauce, simply by using this paste (and a few other ingredients).<br /><br />For all its goodness, I have to say that you've got to have a little faith in order to put something like this in a sauce.  It resembles nothing so much as road tar, black, gooey, utterly yucky-looking.  But do give it a shot -- its worth your time and effort.<br /><br />By the way, I bought the 6-pack.  That's a lot of tamarind paste, more, in fact, that I can use in this lifetime.  I'm sharing bottles with friends and relatives.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who enjoy oriental cooking.

review/summary: Great stuff - but use with caution!
review/text: I too am probably going to be giving away several jars of this paste - a very small amount goes a long way, and I'm not sure how long its shelf life is.  There are spaces on the label for batch number, manufacturing date, and expiration date - but just one number (91016) stamped in that general area - appears to be a batch number.<br /><br />While the lack of an expiration date is annoying, I'm otherwise very happy with this - makes pad thai taste like pad thai, so long as you don't overdo it.  I had never used it before and was working with a recipe calling for processing your own tamarind pulp, so I tried guessing at the right amount.  Next time I'll remember to read the bottle - "one teaspoon for six persons...."  Am just beginning to experiment with other uses.  The manufacturer's web site suggests using it to flavor stews and as a replacement for mango pulp or for vinegar in recipes, and yes, there are lots of recipes out there that call for it.

review/summary: Better choice than soaking pods
review/text: First time buyer from this supplier.  Product was on time and as described.  For tamarind, I've always used real bean pods with the shelling, soaking and straining to wind up with a messey kitchen and watery sauce.  When I opened the first jar of Tamicon, I knew those pod days were over.  This sauce is thick and tangy just the way it needs to be for my cooking.  A favorite item for my friends is BBQ with a unique African BBQ sauce that requires tamarind.  Now I have less excuse for not making it more often!

review/summary: Interesting condiment, handy size jar
review/text: Yes, there are six containers to the order, but you might be surprised that you'll use these up b/4 too long if you like to try new recipes with tamarind. If you enter the Foodnetwork site, and word search "tamarind paste" or "tamarind concentrate" you will find a plethora of recipes using this.  I have two I use often...one is for baking fish fillets with a Bali-style sauce that's easy to whip up, another recipe for glazing pork ribs on the BBQ with a tasty sauce. The list of recipes is endless.  If you are a foodie and enjoy exploration of foods that are out of the ordinary, this will fit the bill.  It looks and pours like dark molasses, but b/c the individual containers are 8 oz size, they don't take up room in the fridge and won't sit there for years while you try to finish one jar. The price is so reasonable for six containers, you can afford to gift one or two away.

review/text: I am on a sodium-restricted diet (1000 mg/day) and have taken the opportunity to learn how to make many of the condiments that I used to enjoy when I didn't care about salt.  I made a killer quart of Worchestershire Sauce using, in part, this tamarind paste.  The recipe used about 5 oz. of paste.  I use the sauce to season potroasts and hamburgers, so the six-pack would be about a year's supply for me.<br /><br />I don't know Pad Thai from bow tie, but in Worchestershire sauce this tamarind paste was just fine!

review/text: This paste is excellent. However, getting it in a pack of 6 was certainly more than I think I will need for a long time - but at this price, I just gave a few away to friends that love to cook as much as I do. One negative tho - one of the sealed foils on the inside of the item was not adhered and so some of the paste (which is actually more like a very thick syrup) had leaked out and was all over in side the bag. It didn't look like tampering as much as just didn't adhere in the filling and packaging process.

review/summary: Where Are the Nuts?
review/text: Having enjoyed the wonderful flavor for breakfast for the first time in a very long time, I decided to do some research on whether there were nuts.  (It has been a couple of years since I've eaten Honey Nut Cheerios, and I remembered nuts.)<br /><br />According to an article I read at Wikipedia,  General Mills introduced this delicious honey-and-nut flavored cereal in 1979 with almonds in it. The nuts, the article says, were discontinued in 2006.<br /><br />Now, let's take a look at the nutrional value.  Evidently we can expect the contents of this cereal to change periodically, because there is a statement to that effect on the Cheerios website.<br /><br />More or less, a small serving (3/4 cup) has 110 calories.  I don't usually want to stop at 3/4 cup of cereal.  That little serving has 9 grams sugar and 290 mg sodium.  It supplies 25% of a day's requirement of iron.  How many of us need all that iron?<br /><br />The good things included are 2 grams fiber and 50% of a day's requirement of folate, along with small amounts of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, vitamin D, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc.<br /><br />Ingredients include whole grain oats, sugar, oat bran, modified corn starch, honey brown sugar syrup, salt, canola and/or rice bran oil, and natural almond flavor.<br /><br />The box says that the product can help lower cholesterol and heart disease.<br /><br />I hope you will find this review helpful.

review/summary: Great for fussy babies and the not-so-fussy
review/text: I have used Good Start Supreme for both of my children. My first baby was terribly colicky and would scream for an average of 6 hours a day. I used a few different kinds of formula after I finished BF and this is the only one that didn't give her terrible gas.<br /><br />As with any formula, give it two weeks of use before switching to something else. The doctors said that my first might have a milk allergy (She was gaining weight fantastically but I was supposed to cut dairy from my diet, try soy formula...). I didn't do any of those things. I used Good Start Supreme.<br /><br />She'd spit up about half of her bottle during and after every feeding with anything else - I was covered, she wore a bib all of her waking hours, and I wore a burp cloth on my shoulder all day. She'd would still spit up a bit with Good Start, but it cut it down by at least 2/3.<br /><br />My second child (2 years later) wasn't nearly as bad. No real gas, no spitting up but after finishing BF I wasn't going to take any chances. Both of my children had great weight gain and were healthy and content with this formula.<br /><br />If you'd like to give it one more shot before giving up, try Good Start for 2 weeks. I'm not a doctor though, just a mom that wanted to figure out what the yelling was all about before jumping on the allergy bandwagon. Depending on your own child's health issues, your experience may vary. I also recommend the Dr. Brown's bottles, especially for babies that have gas issues.<br /><br />The only reason it is not 5 stars is the price. I go through a large can every 6 days even though she has started solid food. It is expensive to feed my little one, especially if she doesn't finish her bottle.

They loved the food, but one of the cats had constant diarrhea and bathroom problems, and the other would occasionally throw up undigested kibble. I began to research the food they were eating and kept finding a bunch of reviews about how the food is garbage for cats and very overpriced for what you get. I tried converting them to different types of wet food, and also a version of a Blue Buffalo cat food. They would not touch anything else and refused to eat. A couple of days ago I decided to try again, this time with Spot's Stew for Sensitive Cats in Turkey. From the time I opened the bag to when it was in their bowl, they showed interest in it. I guess the recipe is very attractive to cats. I've slowly begun mixing it in with their old food and hope that they will be fully transitioned within a few weeks. They don't show any aversion to the new food. In fact, I think they're going to the bowl more often. They almost never finished their daily portions (I follow the food portion charts) before, and now they do. I also have not experienced any sensitive stomach problems from either of them during the transition. I have my fingers crossed that this will be the food I was looking for. So far it's a keeper.<br /><br />Update a year later: My cats are still very much enjoying this food. The one that was throwing up undigested kibble hasn't done it since being switched. The other that had constant diarrhea and bathroom problems has also completely changed. They also seem much more energetic and playful than they were with the old food which also means they get into EVERYTHING but a healthy, happy cat makes me a happy owner. Thanks so much Halo! I couldn't recommend this food more.

review/summary: No more mess to clean up!
review/text: I have two cats. One with a sensitive system and one without. They both luv this food ... and so do I! I had tried every brand there is out there claiming it was specially formulated for sensitive systems. None seemed to work. My poor cat with the sensitive system was throwing up about 2 to 3 times weekly. Once I switched to Halo for Sensitive Systems, he stopped. Sure there may be a hair ball or two once in a great while, but; no more piles of puke to clean up. Thank you Ellen and Halo for creating such a wonderful cat food. It is well worth the price.

review/summary: Expensive, but worth it
review/text: I have 2 indoor cats, one has IBS, along with a matted coat & flaking skin. I have tried all the top brands but none seemed to help. Natural Balance, Wellness, NutroMax all seemed to bother his tummy, especially the wet food. I checked the reviews & ingredients on [...] and I switched to Halo dry sensitive food. I can see a real solid improvement in his coat in just one week. His coat is now very soft and shiny,the flakes are gone, & his hair isn't getting matted like it was. The IBS also seems to be getting better now that I primarily give him the dry food with just a little wet food in the morning. Halo is expensive, but they eat a lot less so the cost seems to even itself out. From now on Halo sensitive turkey is going to be the only cat food I will feed my cats.

review/summary: Our kitties love these kibbles
review/text: Kitties taste vary but when we got this bag of kibbles it didn't take very long before ours were totally sold on it.  I was sold too when I reading the ingredients list has turkey and egg as the first two ingredients plus the vitamin E supplement is "mixed tocopherols" rather than the low-end synthetic choice "d-alpha tocopherols".

review/summary: HALO DRY CAT FOOD IS THE CAT'S MEOW
review/text: Our cats were liking Newman's Organic dry cat food and Organix brand cat food, but they inhaled this Halo brand food! They even like it better than their cat treats. Pricey, but our cats love this brand of grain-free cat food. If you care about the health of your little ones, this food is worth the price.

review/text: I have a ten month old Persian kitten and have been dealing with loose, smelly stools with frequent diarrhea since I got him at three months.  He checked out fine at the vet, and I finally realized he must have some type of food allergy.  I had him on Wellness Kitten, then Adult food but an employee at the local pet food store suggested I try Halo.  It has a little less protein but almost twice the fiber of the Wellness, and it's made for pets with food allergies and sensitive GI tracks.<br /><br />He has always been a very picky eater, but he loves this stuff.  He even ripped open the bag when I was at work, something he never did with the Wellness.  Best of all, after only 5 days and while I am still transitioning him to the Halo, he stools are solid.  It's like a little miracle.  I no longer have to chase after him to check his bottom when he is done in the little box, nor do I come home to find stool tracked all through my house.  His stool also smells, well, not great, as it's still stool, but not as strong or nasty.<br /><br />I am so pleased with this food.  I highly suggest that anyone else also dealing with intractable soft stool and diarrhea give this food a try.  It's well worth the price.<br /><br />Update: My cat has been on this food now for about two and a half months.  He still loves it.  And he is still having solid, not disgusting stool.  Very happy with this food, and Halo in general.

review/summary: Great product.
review/text: I switched to this food because one of my cats had chewed raw spots on her back and nothing I tried helped her chronic itchy back.  The vet suggested the condition could be due to a food allergy and recommended I try a natural food with no preservatives or additives.  It took several months of using this product but my cat is much better.  The food also smells good and fresh which I like -- I have to smell it too.  The packaging is well-made and resealable.  Both my cats seem to love the food and are thriving.  It's a little pricey, but worth it in my opinion.

review/summary: This is a first - MY CATS ASKED ME TO SUBMIT THEIR REVIEW!
review/text: WE (3 of us) love this stuff.  The little morsels are pretty small, so we get more of them, and they're easy to munch.  Just a little bit allows us to graze all day long (and into the night after our dinner feeding)  It's easy on our tummy's - no more up-chucking (unless, of course, we've got a fur-ball!)  And our coats are really nice - we still shed whenever possible, but the dander is almost gone, which is a big deal 'cause one of our friends was always sneezing when around us.  Mom was hoping we'd lose some weight since this stew is all natural and healthy without all the fattening fillers in the cheaper stuff, but so far, we're maintaining our hefty weight.  However, she's gonna keep buying this, because she knows in the long run, it's the best thing for our health.  Did we mention she mixes it with the Chicken Stew so we do get a bit of variety in taste. pretty good morsels... pur-r-r-r

review/summary: Great cat food!
review/text: This cat food has been great for my cat.  He has a sensitive stomach and this solved the problem.  When we got our cat he was one year old and was being fed very cheap food by his previous owners. His fur felt like wire and he had digestive issues.  We switched him to this food when we got him and now his fur is very soft and shiny and his digestive issues are cleared up. We have had him for over 2 years now. Everyone always comments on how healthy he looks.
