review/summary: yummy...i love this stuff!
review/text: these licorice hard candies are exactly as you see in the picture, and taste even better.  i've eaten panda black chewy "natural" licorice, but it's not sweet enough when i want to eat some (real) CANDY.  this claey's licorice tastes just as my taste buds imagined/hoped they would.  i'm sold, and about to place my second order of them.  each piece is approximately 1/2" by 1/2", the perfect size, the perfect taste, the perfect candy for my sweet craving.  some might think they are a little pricey, but we need to indulgence ourselves on occasion...we deserve it, right?  my new favorite candy!

review/summary: Perfect Cinnamon Flavor
review/text: My husband and I discovered Claey's Drops in our local chain drug store, but they only stocked lemon and horehound flavors. I am a big fan of anything cinnamon or minty. I also try to search out candy made in the USA, as I find candy from Mexico and Canada to have a strange, off taste to the sugar.<br /><br />The Claey's Cinnamon Drops are perfect! Not too large, not too sweet, and a true cinnamon flavor. The one pound bag is actually not that large. I plan to buy another bag of a different flavor, plus will buy my husband a bag of lemon flavor as a gift.

review/summary: Baby likes the taste but they stick
review/text: My baby skipped the purees and would not touch rice cereal. These puffs were one of her first solid foods when she was about 7 months. They are puffed up air things which easily dissolve in the mounth so there is no choking hazard. Most of what is in the container and puffs is air, so don't expect a lot of nutrition out of it. The container has 6 half cup servings of 25 calories. My little one got far more servings out of it. It is just to get them used to solid stuff, not to fill them up. Unlike the rice cereal, my little one liked these rice based puffs. The vanilla puffs have cute little star shapes. Not looking at the label of the container, my husband popped open the lid and ate half the container. He freaked out once I told him he ate baby food but said it tasted pretty good. I tried a few and I must say they are fairly sweet and not bad tasting at all. They are much sweeter than the HAPPYBABY brand puffs and that sweeter taste is preferred by my sweeth-tooth baby and hubby. The disadvantage of these puffs is that they tend to stick. Babies put their fingers in their mouth and end up with drooly fingers. When the little one was picking up the little puffs with her wet fingers, these puffs started sticking to her fingers which was somewhat frustrating for her (the reason I docked one star).

review/summary: Invigorates Ordinary Coffee Into A New Aromatic Flavor
review/text: When your everyday coffee has lost its fidelity, and the marriage of sugar and cream no longer excites, introducing a new partner of flavor may be the solution.<br /><br />Vanilla extract has for its history been drawn into relationship with bakers, chefs and cooks. In my home, it has all the usual uses in cake and cookie making, but also, as a more daily use as a coffee additive. McCormick is the brand I use most, and always the purest.<br /><br />A few drops dosing my cup just as I pour a cup of freshly ground, freshly brewed coffee, in addition to slightly warmed and whipped cream, with a spooning of sugar, and my day begins with more than a 'cuppa joe.'<br /><br />This threesome of sugar, cream and vanilla tosses an aroma around the room, down the hall strong enough to entice curiosity from neighbors and neighbor's cats alike. If no one is there to share, feel free to drink alone. May your love of the cupped elixir find new vigor.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/summary: holy cheapness!
review/text: I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn't sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.  There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price, you are getting 16 containers.  I personally wasn't sure if I was getting a great price or paying slightly  more then if I went to the supermarket.  I like these gerber containers of baby food.  It's easier to get the food out, they do make some organic varieties, and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars.  If you only use half the lid snaps back on easy like a desposible food container.

The puree seems to be easier to consume than prune juice and we used to give it to our baby with yogurt. It soon became his favorite food and eased his symptoms.

review/summary: some good results some bad...
review/text: I bought the 12 bottle variety to try out.  I just recently started using a hot air popper so wanted to see what varieties worked well.<br /><br />First off.  The baby white and baby yellow kernels are just too light for use in a hot air popper.  We did pop them at work using a traditional popper and they were fine.<br /><br />The are two varieties that stood out as my favorites for my hot air popper.  The first is the Wisconsin White Birch, which popped up big, fluffy and close to zero unpopped or blow out kernels.  The second is Savannah Gold, it popped up big, nice volume and again almost zero unpopped or blow out kernels.<br /><br />Two varieties that are close seconds as favorites are: Autumn Blaze Blend (small, crisp, no unpopped kernels but quite a few blow outs) and High Mountain Midnight (some no pops, good volume).<br /><br />There was only one variety that I would not ever use again.  The Black Hills had about 4 times the quantity of unpopped kernels as any of the other types, the kernels popped up very small, it was extremely hully and some kernels burnt in the hot air popper.<br /><br />Orchard Blossom, Red River Valley and Harvest Blend types all popped fine in my hot air popper with only a few unpopped kernels.  The Blue Heron also popped fine with a few more unpopped kernels than the three mentioned in the sentence before; it was also earthy in taste and popped up small kernels.  Sunset Fire had very few close to no pops and was very chewy without being hully.

review/summary: Like unpopped kernels? Then this is for you.
review/text: After reading a web review that I thought came from the Washington Post (but can no longer find), I was disappointed to find that this popcorn did not behave as expected.  There were many unpopped kernels, which suggested to me that it was not very fresh.  Indeed, when opening the caps, the seals on many of the bottles were not firmly glued on.  There was no sound of air rushing in as I opened them.  The flavors indeed had promise, but I think that my old standby, Petite Princess Amber, still wins as the best popcorn notwithstanding the Washington Post review.

review/summary: lots of good ingredients-- holistic health approach-- but high fat and protein
review/text: My dogs liked the taste of this food just fine, although they didn't go crazy for it.  (I purchased it for a dog who was very thin and needed to gain weight.)<br /><br />The ingredient list of this food sounds great-- no corn or other indigestible grains, and lots of great healthy vegetables, fruits, and carbs in addition to high quality meats and probiotics.  There are NO yucky "meat by-products"-- just meats and meat meals you can feel good about.  Unfortunately this food has a higher than normal fat and protein content. Very high protein (minimum 32% in this food) may not be a good choice for every dog (this is especially a concern for older dogs).  The fat percentage (minimum 18%) may great for working dogs and active dogs, but the average American couch potato dog could pack on pounds with that much fat unless you increase exercise and/or reduce your portion size (and that may lead to a dog who doesn't feel full/stays hungry).<br /><br />If your dog is already overweight you would probably want a food with one-third the fat of this product.  If you decide to use this food I think it would be a good idea to monitor your dog's weight carefully to avoid having weight gain sneak up on you and your best pal.  I am skeptical of dog foods which claim to be perfect for all life stages, too-- puppies and 15 year old dogs can survive on the same foods, but that doesn't mean the same foods are ideal for each dog.<br /><br />You might want to compare this with similar high-quality holistic foods such as Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs. or Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag) (there are several great Wellness varieties) or Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs. (there are several varieties of Nutro Ultra, too).  These foods have the same high quality human grade ingredients, but appear to have a little bit lower protein and fat profiles.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's a list of the major ingredients/nutritional profile-- check it out, talk it over with your vet, and make up your own mind about whether or not this is a good choice for your best pal.<br /><br />Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal, egg product, sweat potatoes, peas, potatoes, canola oil, roasted bison, roasted venison, natural flavor, tomato pomace, ocean fish meal, choline chloride, dried chicory root, tomatoes, blueberries, raspberries, yucca schidigera extract, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevesiae fermentation solubles, dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, and the expected added vitamins.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Wondering if your dog is overweight?  An easy way to tell is to look down at your dog while it is standing.  Viewed from overhead, you should see a definite "waist" narrowing in front of the back legs.  Another easy test is to feel the dog's ribs.  You should be able to easily feel slight dips between the ribs-- if you can't they are covered with a layer of fat (of course, prominent ribs mean your dog is too thin).

review/summary: WARNING! Formula Change!!!!!
review/text: First of all I would like to say that my puppy LOVES this food! I have a 4 month old Lhasa Apso and he licks his bowl well after he has finished eating. When I first got him the breeder had him on Purina Puppy Chow. The first thing I wanted to do was to switch him to a high quality, no grain diet and after alot of research and reviews,Taste of The Wild always came on top(dollar wise). After the switch I immediately noticed a difference in my puppy.His coat is starting to shine and is sooooo soft to the touch. He has so much energy now and he has less eye discharge and less ear odor(due to being allergic to the Puppychow). My only problem I have with this product is when I went to my local pet store to buy him a 15lb bag. I immediately saw on the bag "Now made with Purified Water and More Bison" and I thought to myself; "wow they made it better", but after reading the ingredients boy was I wrong. They might have added more bison but they totally eliminated venison from the list. Venison was the second ingredient but now its lamb meal. What once this dog food had four meat products as its main ingredients(Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal) now has three(Bison, lamb meal, chicken meal). More bison or not the exclusion of venison takes away some of the "wildness" of the formula in my opinion. Sure it still has roasted venison down the list but it just that, DOWN the list. In my opinion they've downgraded the formula but are still charging the same price and I am a little concerned by that. I emailed the company for more info on the "New Formula" before I buy the bag and will post an update soon.<br /><br />UPDATE!<br />Just received an email regrading the formula change by the company;<br /><br />Dear Eric,<br /><br />"Thank you for your inquiry. I'm glad that your puppy has been doing so well on the Taste of the Wild High Prairie. The formula had to be changed because an adequate supply of quality venison was not available. The change is relatively minor with the venison being replaced with bison, already a part of the recipe. I would not expect you to notice a difference with your puppy. However, if you still have some of the food in the previous bag, I would mix the food from both bags for a few days to avoid any potential issues. If you do not have any food from the previous bag, you could add some plain nonfat yogurt to your puppy's diet for a few days to help prevent any issues. I usually recommend 1 tablespoon per 25 pounds body weight".<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />--<br />Melissa Brookshire, DVM<br /><br />Just to let you guys know that the formula change might cause some minor stomach issues so adjust accordantly.

review/summary: AWESOME!
review/text: I have to say that without a doubt this is the very best food I have ever fed my dogs, both were adopted and didn't like any dog food that we gave them. The food would sit all day, and then we would throw it out give them a fresh set and it would sit until (I'm guessing) they were both so hungry they didn't have a choice but to eat it, and this always made me feel sooo bad. I went to the "natural dog food store" the owner of the store was amazing and gave me a few free samples of the taste of the wild line of dog food. I was skeptical but went home and fed it to Jasmine and Peanut, my MinPin and Pekinese mix, much to my surprise they licked the bowl clean and have been ever since, they enjoy dinner time now, they have more energy, their coats are so much softer, and they are going to the bathroom on a much more regular basis. I have nothing bad to say about this food, and if you love your babies as much as I love mine, TRY IT! you won't be disappointed.<br />Samantha

review/summary: Good for allergic dogs! And good dog food for the price!
review/text: I know nobody wants to read a wall of text on how good or bad this dog food is, so here is a very brief summary:<br /><br />This review is specifically for the High Prairie formula only.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Bison and Venison as the main 2 ingredients in the dog food! Not that Bison and Venison meat is any better, but it might help out dogs that has allergies to common meats such as Chicken, Beef and/or fish. Best part of it is that the price of the dog food costs the same as other flavors! A lot of dog foods meant for dogs with allergies usually tend to cost a lot more.<br />2. Price per pound is very economical. Price is actually much cheaper than lower quality foods such as Eukanuba, Purina, etc. It isn't cheaper than Pedigree, but at the same time it isn't filled with garbage like Pedigree is.<br />3. Dog likes the taste. A lot of my friends feed this to their dogs. I fed it to one of my dogs before. He likes it as much as he does for the fish flavor. My other dog doesn't but he doesn't like any kibble anyways, so it isn't this food's fault.<br />4. Food quality is good. No by-products or corn or any other garbage (like unknown sources of bone and meat meals, etc).<br />5. No more ethoxyquin in any taste of the wild products!<br />6. Solid poop with no disgusting smells!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Dogs seem to poop more on this food than other brands such as Orijen or Wellness. Not a lot more though so this isn't really a biggie.<br />2. Made by diamond Pet foods. Not really a biggie either, but diamond pet foods had been plagued with pet recalls problems in the past. Taste of the Wild hasn't had any recalls that I know of, but you're still running a risk, just a really small one.<br /><br />Compared to other brands, this is probably 4 out of 5, but it would be unfair because this brand is much cheaper. Orijen costs almost 2x of what taste of the wild cost.

review/summary: First bag went really well, 2nd and 3rd made all 3 dogs violently ill
review/text: I have purchased 3 bags of Taste of the Wild Bison and Venison. I had 2 Standard Poodle when I purchased the first bag. My 5 yr old SP is notoriously picky and has a very sensitive stomach. She LOVED this food. We went through the first bag and both were doing great. (Gaining weight which is very hard for her to do). So I ordered a second bag, exactly the same. They ate almost all of it over several weeks and all was fine. With the last several cups in the food container the 1 year old SP became violently ill like she has never been before. The older one then became sick. I figured they had gotten into some thing outside and reordered. The 3rd bag came several days later, both had recovered completely by this time. We also got a Bichon Frise puppy about a week before this. The older dogs had Taste of the Wild late in the afternoon and the puppy grabbed some they had spilled on the floor. All 3 dogs then became ill, throwing up all night. Immediately the next morning I removed all Taste of the Wild from the house and put them all on puppy food. Everything cleared up. I have called customer service and was told their vet would be calling me. That was several days ago. I have now emailed requesting a refund.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I have a 65lb 3 year old Boxer and an 80 lb 8 month old Cane Corso. They both love this food. Luckily, I live next to a pet food distributor, and it is cheaper there. ($[...] for the 30lb bag) This has been the only food my boxer has been able to keep weight on. We've tried Evo (Which worked but it was too expensive), Innova, Candidae, and solid gold no grain formula. She always looked sickly thin. Most her ribs showed and  some of her spine. We took her to the vet and they found nothing wrong with her. She is just an extremely active dog. We tried switching around foods to see if we could get her to gain weight. After switching to this formula, she looks like a NORMAL dog! You can not see her ribs as easily anymore and can pet her without feeling her spine. I guess she was just too active for the other foods.<br />My Cane does very good on it too. He is the perfect the weight! Although I think it has too much protein for him to be on it for very long.<br />I would recommend this food for people who have VERY active dogs like mine. The ingredients are good too, it is grain free. (My boxer is also allergic to grains) It is worth the extra money to spend on a good quality dog food like this one!

review/summary: Show Quality Food (but don't buy in bulk)
review/text: My dog dog loves this food. She learned how to open up a locked container where I store the bag just to eat more of it.<br /><br />It goes bad sooner than they mark on the bag (kinda like potato chips without a clip on the bag). The Purina Dog Chow I bought over a year ago is still fresh, but I don't want her eating meat coming from sick cows. By "Fresh" I mean my dog doesn't snub it in the bowl and it doesn't have an "off" smell to it.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy more than a 4-6 month supply at a time, and make sure you keep it in a sealed container (I bought 80lbs of this for a 18lbs dog- BAD MOVE).<br /><br />I've seen a few dogs have their eyes clear up after starting this- no more tear stains.<br /><br />Best dog food for the money, and used by show dog breeders.

review/summary: If you're on the fence about which high quality food to start your dog on, START HERE!!!
review/text: I have an English bulldog, Kingston, who is 5 months old and LOVES this stuff.  He was raised on Puppy Chow and I tried many cheaper brands.  I was taking him out 5-6 times a day and I could tell he was miserable.  His coat was dull and he shedded and scratched constantly. So I decided I should switch to a better quality product.  I did a lot of research and can assure you that TOTW is the best product out there in terms of quality AND price.  Kingston's coat is velvety soft (I cheat a little by mixing in a few pumps of salmon oil) and he's pretty lean- not fat- a active for a bully!  About feeding though- he doesn't lick the bowl clean like everyone else.  The way I see it he is a "low energy" dog.  This stuff is high protein, high quality and designed for much more active breeds.  I'm just glad he'll actually eat it (wouldn't touch Nature's Balance LID) and not throw it up (Merrick's Before Grain).  So if your dog is like mine (couch potato) my advice would be to feed them the lower end amount.  Too much of this stuff and your pup may "outgrow" his body and this could lead to health issues.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CLWS8">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, High Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison and Venison, 5 Pound Bag</a><br />Go with the small bag and see what your pup thinks

review/summary: My Dog LOVE'S his food !
review/text: After adopting my German Shepard/Husky mix I noticed he had an allergy to the dog food his Vet. and Humane society recommended.Can dogs be allergic to grain? So I immediately did research. Ordered a sample pack and he LOVED IT! So I ordered a bag in 2009, and now I ONLY buy this product for his food. His coat is glossy, his teeth clean, and his body is so lean. He was under weight when we adopted him and now he's at a good weight, active and loving his food. I also noticed the change in the recipe, but I didn't tell him. A GREAT PRODUCT for those who want to feed their dogs REAL food. Dogs don't need all that extra grain, Brewers Rice, Corn Gluten Meal, Oat Meal, Whole Grain Wheat...THERE'S your FAT---THERE'S the ingredients your dogs DON'T NEED. I totally recommend this product.

I'm on my second order and I will continue with this brand. It ships within 48 hours and the bonus is that I pay with my Discover Card CashBack Bonus through Amazon. Love that.

review/text: ...but quinoa is better.  This is good stuff; it cooks just like brown rice but has a nuttier flavor and is considerably more nutritious.  At under $3 a box, it's cheaper buying it at Amazon than at the supermarket, and it is VERY difficult finding it here in Florida where people tend toward grits and rice. As an added bonus for those to whom it applies, quinoa is technically not a grain; as such, both the regular and Inca Red varieties of Ancient Harvest brand quinoa bearing the "Half-Moon K" (as these do -- see my customer image) are kosher for Passover. The boxes bearing this symbol come from a factory that processes quinoa only, so there is no chance of chometz contamination.<br /><br />Delivery was under one week even with the free Super Saver Shipping.

This, and two other types of quinoa, form a key part of that effort. One simple dish: small potatoes and quinoa boiled for a bit. Then put them in the oven, covered with cheese, onions, and sopme herbs and bake until done. Tasty--and nutritious! And vegetarian. In this dish, the quinoa is kind of crunchy, adding a nice texture to the dish.<br /><br />As an entree to the world of quinoa, this is a nice product. . . .

review/summary: Kids LOVE IT!
review/text: I just started buying Quinoa, and i had to write a review.  I was a little apprehensive of putting this stuff in front of my kids who are 9, 6 and 4.  It straight up looks WEIRD!  It's got little curly Q's that sprout out of it while it's cooking. But i thought i'd take that "quality" and deliberately market it towards my kids.  hehehe!  I told them some really creative people figured out how to make this really fun food for kids and how to get it to grow little curly Q's when it cooked, and that it was pretty silly. I asked them what they thought and they laughed at the look of it. It takes very similar to rice, so i likened it to that for the kids, but told them it wasn't rice so it does taste a little different. My oldest child is apprehensive about certain foods, and i didn't know how'd she'd react to this.  My middle one is the type who would rather go hungry than try stuff he doesn't think looks right. And my youngest will eat anything.  All 3 of them LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  I made it first by mixing fresh tomatoes, avocado, cilantro, lemon juice, onion, chicken, sour cream, cheese, cumin and chili powder.  The girls ate all of theirs and my youngest snagged my bowl and ate all of mine the moment i got up from the table for a min. And they've never like avocado or onion in stuff!  My son wouldn't even try it, which didn't surprise me. But i had him taste the few plain grains that stuck to the side of the pot, and he ate every single one of them (and his quesadilla).  Today i made it plain by boiling in water.  Then just squirted a little Bragg's Liquid Aminos (or soy sauce) on it, and all 3 DEVOURED it!  I am so glad i can give them something so healthy, and so full of nutrients.  I love that it's packed with 6 grams of protein, and 6 grams of fiber, and 3 grams of good ol' fashioned healthy fats.  They love that it's red and has curly Q's.  I am confident this is a very versatile grain/ grass, whatever it is, and i have big plans for it!  Broccoli cheddar casserole, added to any soup, bean dip, veggie burgers, cold salad base, stir fry...  or mixed with dried cranberries, apples and pecans...  or curried with coconut for an Indian flavor...  Yes, this is definitely a GOOD thing!

review/summary: A  jarred sauce for food-snobs
review/text: I got this sauce when Costco had the 40 oz. jars for $2 off the normal price of $7-something a jar.  The price seemed right for those times when you need to cook supper fast, and don't have it in you to start from scratch.  Now, they don't carry it anymore, and my stockpile for those "just in case" occasions has been completely depleted.  I'm fretting.<br />Normally, I consider jarred pasta sauces to be beneath my dignity.  I believe my Italian grandmother would roll over in her grave, if I used store-bought pasta sauce.  However, this sauce passes as my own homemade.  Sometimes, I'll doctor it up with a bit of this and that, but it isn't necessary.  My family's discerning palates have been fooled on a number of occasions.  That's a tall order in my opinion.  I'm all for anything that makes my life easier, but doesn't compromise on quality, or authenticity of ingredients.<br />This is authentic-tasting Italian sauce, not like that gaggable stuff in the grocery store.  People will think it's homemade, and you don't ever have to let them know otherwise.

review/text: I bought this sauce for years when I lived in NY and had all my Italian friends at work trying it. They loved it too. It was by far the closest to my mother's homemade marinara sauce.  I fooled many a guest.  It's a little pricey so I'd wait for sales to stockpile.  Then I moved to Florida and can't find it anywhere. Friends drove to NY so they were able to get it for me.  Now, I recently found it online and ordered it but the jars came broken.  I was soooo bummed. I'm not giving up.  It's the BEST and a must try.

review/summary: Great sauce
review/text: My Italian grandmother would also roll over in her grave if she knew I used a sauce from a jar.  I couldn't pass it up when I read the ingredients and the name, also my daughter's name, so I gave it a try.  It is wonderful!  It tastes very close to home made which is rare for a sauce in a jar. I've been buying it from the local grocery store for a few months now but for some reason they aren't carrying it anymore.  I'm hoping another grocery store in the area will have it.  It's definitely worth the extra $$$ when you don't have time to make "gravy" from scratch.

review/summary: Perfect for displaced New Yorkers!
review/text: I am a native New Yorker, so I am incredibly picky about Italian food. Unfortunately, upon moving to Maryland, I learned that the yummy NY Italian food cannot be found anywhere but NY.  I decided to experiment with jar sauces, even though I normally hate them. Victoria's was a very welcome surprise and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: An excellent jarred sauce
review/text: I am very picky when it comes to things like pizza, pasta, salsa, anything with tomatoes. This sauce is my hands-down favorite when it comes to a a supermarket jarred sauce. Many moons ago I used to think the Classico brand sauces were good. It took me some taste development to realize they are the equivalent of eating at an Olive Garden. Having grown up on authentic home made Italian gravy, as they say, Victoria Marinara is smooth and rich and for a quick sauce it's a top choice. Not as expensive as Patsy's or Rao's, but blows the doors off of Bertolli, Classico and sauces of that caliber. You will be impressed. The Arrabiata is also pleasant. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Wonderful decaffeinated alternative. Delicious and a Great value!
review/text: I love this apple cider for a sweet treat without any sugar or guilt.<br />Wonderful in the fall or winter. Much better for me than a real caramel apple or pie.<br />It is a great decaffeinated alternative to tea or coffee and kids love it.<br />It is very sweet, but I use extra water for a larger cup.<br />I have also opened it up and used it to cook with.<br />The mix inside does not brew, just rehydrates, which allows me to use it at work without a Kurieg.

review/summary: One happy diabetic
review/text: I got one of these kcups in a sample pack a few months ago.  I've been hesitant to try it as I am not the biggest cider fan.  I looked up the nutritional info- 10 calories, 1 carb- if it's not sweet enough, I have Splenda.  So I brew it and my kitchen starts smelling like a caramel apple.  I found myself fanning the steam from the cup towards my face.  My first sip was heavenly.  I decided to put it over ice since it is summer and it's great cold as well.  I am one happy girl right now as I keep drinking it.  Try it.  You'll love it.

review/summary: My favorite K Cups!!  Only 10 calories!
review/text: I was a bit scared to order these, because of the mixed reviews...I honestly cannot figure out how it's possible to NOT love these!  They are probably my favorite K Cup beverage...AND the cheapest, to boot!<br /><br />I am used to drinking artificial sweeteners (diet soda, Splenda, etc.) -- maybe some people didn't realize that these were sugar-free (i.e., people don't know how to read product titles & descriptions)?  If you're used to straight-up sugar, maybe these would taste off, like people think diet soda tastes bad if they're used to regular.<br /><br />As a diet soda drinker, these taste awesome to me!  I seriously want to drink one or two of them every day when I get home...and by the way, it's June now, so I imagine in the winter they'd be even better.  :-)  I think these also taste good cold.  I make them on the 10-ounce Keurig setting -- 8 ounces and they're too sweet...which is great, since I get 2 more ounces of cider.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd say give them a try...they're cheap, and I think they're awesome.  I guess just make sure your taste buds are used to artificial sweeteners, and you'll probably love them too!

review/summary: OBSESSED!!!
review/text: I am absolutely OBSESSED with these k-cups. I don't want to admit to how many of these boxes I've gone through in the past few months. It's embarrasing.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, sweet and tangy. It's better than any other hot cider drink I've tasted and the best part is, it's sugar-free and only 10 calories. As a treat, I like to top with fat free whipped cream -- it seems like SUCH an indulgence, but it's very low in calories!<br /><br />As someone who is always watching watch I eat, I do not like to "drink" my calories if I can help it -- which is why I shy away from the other hot cider/hot chocolate/teas for my Keurig. Most clock in at around 60-80 calories, so I only have one every few days or so. I can't drink one after another...like I do with these. See? I told you I was obsessed!<br /><br />All that said, I am someone who is USED to eating/drinking artificially flavored/sugar free drinks. I'm a diet soda/Crystal Lite drinker, so the taste isn't anything "new" to me -- in fact, I don't quite understand what all the complaining is about these k-cups on here is all about.<br /><br />You can't beat the price -- I'm on the subscribe 'n save plan but I am already ordering more frequently than that because I drink these k-cups like a fish!

We are a household that drinks plenty of diet soda too so it isn't that we aren't used to artificial sweetner either.

review/text: As someone who is used to artificial sweeteners, I have to say that these were exactly what I hoped for.  Are they a little extra sweet?  Sure.  But let's be honest, I haven't had real apple cider in years and this was close enough for me.  If you're watching your blood sugar and would like a non-coffee/tea treat for your keurig, I recommend these.  The caramel ones are decent too, although they are stronger than these in my opinion.  A single 24 pack is a fairly reasonable price, try it out for yourself.

review/text: When I made the first cup, I was not sure about the taste. It is more caramel than apple flavored and seemed a bit too sweet. But after making it again, it was more like having a dessert! Now I am enjoying it. There are so few sugar-free k-cups available with the various fancy things, so I appreciate finding this.<br />UPDATE:<br />I made another cup of this drink today and I chose the largest size cup to brew in my Breville k-cup brew machine. That was a good thing, as the flavor was not so highly intense. It was most enjoyable when the flavor was not as concentrated.<br />Next, I will try using the "iced drink" setting and see if this flavor is good when done as an iced beverage.

I drink in the evening and after working outside in the cold.  I plan to buy more to make sure I have enough on hand thru the spring/summer.

review/summary: Problem
review/text: Cider had a great taste and I was so happy to be able to purchase sugar-free k-cups...however, when I opened the box, two of the cups had puncture marks already in them, rendering them unusable.  I took my chances and used the rest of the k-cups (after inspecting them) but was upset, knowing that this product I had purchased had been tampered with.

review/summary: Apple Cider K-cups
review/text: I like Apple Cider and I can have more than one of these for far less calories (10) than the normal cider (80).  In fact, I can drink two in the evening as I'm relaxing and I do not have to worry about the calories.<br /><br />If you're used to drinking drinks flavored with aspartame, then these will be just fine!  My husband doesn't like them because of the artificial flavoring.  And he also doesn't have to worry about his weight like I do.  So I bought two kinds of apple cider and neither of us touch the other's cider.

review/text: This is nice if you like it not so sweet, but I am the type that prefers my apple cider on the sweeter side. It is nice that I can make one cup as needed, or many if I have friends over.

review/summary: More like warm apple juice with cinammon
review/text: It's ok, but it is very different from the apple cider that comes in the green and red cup from other brand.<br /><br />It smells funny due to the artificail sweetner, but after a while the smell goes away. It tastes more like warm apple juice than cider.
