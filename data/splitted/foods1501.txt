review/summary: 3 Year Old Will Eat His Veggies!
review/text: My 3 year old hated lettuce before we purchased the Aerogarden. After watching the leaves grow, he is always asking for the lettuce. We no longer have problems getting him to eat his salads and he loves to snack on the leaves! We all do!<br />The only downside- the outside leaves are not that pretty, and the lettuce does not stay lush and full. But it's still great to look at. Customer service is also great and they quickly sent replacements for the seeds that did not sprout.<br />Follow-up! I called aerogarden and let them know about my not so pretty outer lettuce leaves after about 6 weeks of growth. They immediately sent a replacement seed kit. The new seed kit has grown VERY full and lush, much better than the first kit. I was told to call back with any problems. Customer service really wants you to be completely happy. I am impressed! Make that 5 stars!

review/summary: READ THE FINE PRINT FROM AEROGARDEN
review/text: I wrote a long review of this product--I purchased three(3)--and then decided it was too long for anyone to wade through.  So the following is the Reader's Digest version:<br />"YOU'LL LOVE IT--OR YOUR MONEY BACK"<br /><br /> That's what's in large print at the top of the Aerogarden guarantee.  And in the TV ad the founder of the company goes even further and says he'll even pay return shipping charges.<br /><br />I don't have my three aerogardens now.  To me they're not worth wasting electricity on.  And did Aerogarden refund my money?  No.  But they did send me a form-type letter indicating no responsibility on their part because more than  36 DAYS had passed and I'd purchased the aerogardens from Amazon.  SO MY SUGGESTION IS TO READ THE FINE PRINT AND GOOD LUCK!

review/summary: Pump will break - bad customer service
review/text: I bought this on QVC.  It was fantastic until the pump broke.  People on the QVC boards whose pumps also broke said to contact Aerogrow customer service.  I tried sending them e-mails to get a new pump but got ZERO response.  I called, waited 20 minutes on hold, and got someone who was very nice and said a pump was on its way.  Great.  A week later a box from Aerogrow comes and it is 3 Italian Basil pods. ????  I called again and waited 20 minutes on hold.  Nice person again told me they were sorry for the mixup and they would send me a pump as well as a replacement chili pepper seed kit for the one that is ruined due to lack of pump.  Great.  A week later I get the chili seed kit and a light bulb but NO PUMP.  I am debating buying another one of these because I like it, but I am wary of this pump breaking again - apparently it has been a problem for quite a few people.

review/summary: Great Product, Poor Customer Service
review/text: Terrific all-in-one aeroponic grow unit. Seed kits are pricey, but the company has done the hard work of figuring out which varieties of plants grow well in water and which nutrients each plant type needs. Well designed, easy to maintain, fun to watch and quiet - it deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />Customer service, though, earns 1 star at best. Emails we sent to support went unanswered; detailed voicemails were unreturned. The only way we (sometimes) received help was to wait on their toll-free line for a CSR. The agents were courteous and tried to do whatever was necessary to remedy the problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, follow through was quite discouraging. For example, (1) our address was incorrectly entered for an accessory order. We were not able to get anyone at the company to correct it in time which caused a delivery delay. (2) We were charged twice for the order. It took over 4 weeks and many phone calls to customer service before a credit was issued. Finally, (3) the shipping confirmation email was sent two weeks AFTER the order had arrived late.<br /><br />When we told an agent of our frustrations, they remarked about the overwhelming response they've received through Amazon. Well, with a product receiving such positive reviews, how did they not expect this sort of response? Their own literature describes the multiple years of product development. They should've spent some of that time on decent customer support.

review/summary: Delicious Veggies Without Sunlight
review/text: My parents sent me the Aerogarden so I could grow cherry tomatoes in my dark garden-less apartment. I started with the Salad Green kit that came with the unit. Within 4 weeks I had a plethora of greens to pick and eat, so plump and juicy. I just nip off a couple of leaves as I need them. Can't wait to grow my tomatoes.<br /><br />The unit super easy to set up, very clear directions, a real no-brainer. Simply click parts together, fill with water, plop in tablets, insert seed pods and leave it alone until it is time to eat. The seeds sprouted within 3 days and took off. I set the lights so they are on during the day until about 11 p.m. the unit really lights up the room. The Aerogarden lets you know when you need to add more water and nutrients. The air in that corner of the room feels moist which, in Southern California, is a blessing but should be kept in mind when placing the unit.<br /><br />I'm seriously considering about getting another unit, I just have to keep it out of the way of my cat who thinks the garden is her own personal nibble fest.

review/summary: Nothing like those commercials
review/text: I have had my Aerogarden for about nine months.  I am definitely not impressed.  I planted my first set of gourmet herbs which came with the garden, and all I ever got to harvest and use was tons of basil, more than I could ever use, and a little cilantro.  The dill, mint, chives, and parsley never grew big enough to use.  And I was really looking forward to picking fresh sprigs of mint anytime I wanted to make a mojito.  I have been waiting months for that mojito.  My results never looked anything like the big bushes of herbs they show on the infomercials.  I planted my second round of herbs about 6 weeks ago.  This time, most of my herbs did not even germinate.  And my pump rattles ridiculously loud.  I e-mailed the company and they are more than helpful and are sending out a new seed kit and a new pump.  I am not looking forward to installing that pump after reading others experiences.  For the money, it is not worth the very small amount of useable herbs.

review/text: I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. After a few months, I've harvested about 5 ripe chili pepper, the halapeno hasn't done anything, and I'm about to run out of nutrient. I pulled some of the early sprouts, put them in a pot on my lanai, and they are doing far better than the plants in the 150 dollar machine. Point being, some miraclegrow, a few bucks, sunny spot on the lanai, or just a trip to the grocery store. Waste of money. Update, ran out of nutrients, so am using Fox Farms Grow Big, I now have some chilis showing up in the Aerogarden, the outdoor plant is now 24" tall, has well over 30 peppers on it, the Aerocrap has one semi-mature pepper and is 7" tall, do the math, not worth it, and made in china, insult to injury.<br /><br />Aloha

review/summary: Can't Believe They Grow That Fast!!!
review/text: Once you get over the fact that the Aerogrow is infomercical hype that requires costly "seed kits" and special lightbulbs, this is truly an amazing product.  The herbs literally started growing within days.  In less than a month, I have an enormous herb garden.  I don't have to do anything except occasionally add more water, and the Aerogrow even alerts me as to when to do this.  I can't wait to have fresh herbs during winter when they are hard to grow indoors.<br /><br />The "seed kits" are seeds in a little sponge that is encased with a plastic housing.  The plastic fits into small holes in the Aerogrow.  The root system pushes out of the sponge and plastic housing and down into the water tank below.  Nutrients are occasionally placed into the water tank.  The Aerogrow has lights to alert when nutrients should be added.  This is not rocket science.  In fact, I removed the provided seeds from one of the sponges and replaced them with cucumber seeds that I'd bought, and literally within 3 days I had a plant that was 3 inches tall.  When you buy seed kits, you are paying for the sponge and plastic housing that fits into the Aerogrow.  Yes, this is a rip off and a crafty person could probably replicate the housing and use another type of sponge to avoid having to buy more costly seed kits.<br /><br />The Aerogrow is costly, as are the component parts.  However, it's true that it will pay for itself.  It is quiet, though it does take up a bit of space.<br /><br />I would give the Aerogrow 5 stars except for the fact that it is costly and the component parts are costly.

review/text: The AeroGarden is perfect for anyone without outdoor space or without the time or energy for growing vegetables.  The setup was easy and there is a minimal amount of effort required to grow vegetables.  My kit came with the salad greens, and I was amazed at how quickly the lettuce grew!  I was harvesting lettuce within 3 weeks!  I love picking lettuce for sandwiches or salads as I need it.

review/summary: You can never have too many fresh herbs
review/text: My AeroGarden was an impulse buy that I have not regretted for a moment. After planting and killing countless herbs in a pot on my kitchen window shelf, I finally have a ready supply of healthy plants requiring minimal maintenance.<br /><br />I have had no trouble with the pump or timers on my unit. Every two weeks it signals me to add more nutrients. I monitor the water level and keep it topped up, although it does signal if I let it get really low (and the light goes off when I refill it). The unit is nearly silent when the water is at level. Early on in the grow cycle the dripping was audible, but not since the plant roots have grown.<br /><br />As for the plants, the two basil plants are little monsters that I have to keep nipping back (okay, so there is SOME maintenance). As long as I keep the monsters in check the others do fine with the exception of the chives. They're just a thin sprig that I haven't been able to use. Fortunately the cilantro is doing well, since that was at the top of my list and the herb I have always had the most trouble growing. Overall the quality of the plants is very good -- and there's not a pesticide in sight.<br /><br />I've moved the light fixture up three times so far. I have nutrients for another eight weeks on my first bed of herbs, which means these plants will have lived longer than any that I ever grew in a pot.<br /><br />I'm so pleased with my herb I'm planning on buying another so that I can have French herbs too. And then I'll need a third for either tomatos or strawberries. Fortunately, I just noticed the three-garden wall "farm" today.

review/summary: Great product, great fun!
review/text: I was impressed by the favorable reviews of this product, and I can add my own endorsement. The product arrived on time and was easy and fun to set up. It's very well made and the instruction booklet is informative and clearly written. The seeds (except for the cilantro) sprouted right on time  -- very exciting! -- and now, 3 weeks later, I have thriving little herb plants. The unit is attractive and looks beautiful on my countertop. Everyone who sees it is fascinated by it and you can almost watch the plants grow -- you certainly can see impressive growth every day. The lights are very bright so if you're setting one up, put some thought into when you want the lights to be on (they're on for about 16 hours a day). The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the cilantro did not sprout. I called customer service and although I waited quite a while for my call to be answered, the representative was super helpful and nice. She's sending me 2 replacement cilantro pods. Although I'm not sure if the product will ever be cost-effective, I'm getting so much enjoyment out of it, it's well worth it!

review/text: This could have been so cool! What an awsome idea! I loved it at first and it worked great, at least for the herbs. The problem is that after just three crops, the pump gave out. But what can you expect when the pump is essentially the same size as an oversized postage stamp? Total rip-off...(and btw,I DID thoroughly clean it and get the stray roots out of the filter so don't blame the failure on lack of maintenance)<br /><br />If you're interested in a small hydroponic garden for the kitchen, I would suggest searching around for some quality units.<br /><br />-johnvisnaskas@yahoo.com

review/summary: Just doesnt make enough to do anything
review/text: I'm not happy with the yield of this product. I mainly wanted it for the cilantro, and after 8 weeks not enough cilantro to even make a small portion of salsa. The basil grows very fast and overcrowds the other plants. The mint and parsley don't look very healthy. I used bottled, filtered water and always had correct light times. They will NOT grow as full as the picture and never that evenly unless you wait 4-5 weeks to plant all else but the basil.<br /><br />About the only thing I have enjoyed so far was breaking off a leaf or two of each plant, mainly the basil, and chewing it. VERY remarkable how fresh it is (Well, its still alive when I was chewing it). Tastes great!<br /><br />Just not worth the money. If it were 75% cheaper, would be a fantastic product.<br /><br />Note: I bought my own seeds after reading on their website that I can use them with their self-seed kit. Well, they dont sell the self-seed kit. I wanted to plant cilantro, catnip, and stevia. I guess I'll have to wait for the snow to melt.

review/text: I have the herb version and have been happy with my purchase. Just a couple of issues.<br /><br />The mint are quite lush and if not kept in check, can over crowd the other herbs. My case is especially severe since Aerogarden duplicated the mint in place of the dill.<br /><br />The pump on my machine can occasionally be a little loud and rattlely.  It can be quickly resolved by picking up the water bowl, giving it a gentle shake, and replacing it back on to the base.<br /><br />Overall, much better that a window sill herb garden in the Northeast.  Herbs are clean and ready to use.

review/summary: WOW!!! Our family loves our AreoGrow Garden!!
review/text: We have had our AreoGrow Garden for just over a month and we are already eating fresh herbs. We love to cook with fresh herbs, but I have never liked going out to the garden to pick them, then having to wash any little bugs off them before cooking. We tried purchasing herbs from the grocery store, but they can be a bit expensive and need to be used on a timely basis. Then one day I saw this product advertised on TV and immediately researched it online and decided to purchase it from Amazon.<br /><br />At the time I purchased it I also decided to get the Italian Herbs seed kit. We decided to plant the herbs we thought we would use the most from both kits, so we ended up using a few from the kit it comes with and a few from the kit we ordered. Everything germinated early with one exception, the cilantro, to this day it still has not germinated. I did finally give up on it and bought a package of seeds from the store and pushed a few seeds into the sponge a few days ago. I will update this later and let you know if they germinated. It seems from the reviews that I am not the only one with the cilantro problem.<br /><br />I recommend this product to everyone I know who loves to grow herbs, but would prefer not to deal with the dirt and bugs.<br /><br />We received the Gourmet Herb kit with our AeroGrow Garden, it contains:<br />Italian Basil, Cilantro, Mint, Dill, Parsley, Chives and Purple Basil<br /><br />We purchased separately the Italian Herb kit, it contains:<br />Mint, Basil, Savory, Parsley, Garlic Chives, Oregano, and Thyme<br /><br />Update: No luck with the Cilantro. We decided to replace the Cilantro and put in basil instead. Still lovin our AreoGarden!!

review/summary: Great product so far (4 weeks in)
review/text: I got this for Christmas and started it up on December 27th. Today is January 27th. The green basil and chives are probably ready to be harvested. The others are probably a couple weeks away, but all look to be doing well.<br /><br />It is quite an ingenious little machine. Setup was a breeze for me, and all of the parts worked as advertised. It's pretty easy to see if it's working correctly. If you look inside the bowl, you should be able to see water dripping down from each of the seed pods. If not, you have a problem.<br /><br />There are quite a few resources on the web about how to "hack" the Aerogarden so that you can grow your own seeds instead of their expensive little pods (be careful, however, as you might guess the type of seeds that many of the sites refer to). That will make it a much more cost effective proposition. Someone else referenced that there will be some third-party equipment available soon to accomplish the same thing.<br /><br />If you can afford it and like the idea of growing your own herbs, this is a great product.

review/summary: High Promise, Less Delivery
review/text: High Promise, Less Delivery<br />I started growing tomatoes with my AeroGarden about two months ago. I got my first flower a few days ago, the first step towards tomatoes. Unfortunately, the pump on the device stopped working the next day.<br /><br />The FAQ on their web site advises me to open the device, take it apart, and clean the pump. They provide seven (7!) pages of instructions to follow and the process requires the use of a flat head screwdriver, small pliers, butter knife and soap. You also have to provide containers to put the liquid in and find a place for the plants that require their roots to be maintained under water. They claim the cleaning will take 20 to 25 minutes on the first attempt.<br /><br />It actually took about 15 minutes to complete, but then my pump was perfectly clean! The problem was not the pump, the problem was that the root system became so extensive after two months of growing, that the mass of roots blocked the pump intake located at the bottom of the tower.<br /><br />When your pump stops working, I suggest before you go to the bother of taking the pump apart, that you first try trimming the root system around the bottom of the pump tower. That is a MUCH EASER REPAIR compared to taking the whole thing apart. At any rate, I put everything back together, and the pump now works.<br /><br />I have several suggestions for AeroGarden management. Number one suggestion, do something about your NON RESPONSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Perhaps they answer the phone, but if you send them an email, don't expect a response. Its been one week since I sent them a question about the pump failure... no response to this date. Email communications is worthless with this company, so if you need help, call them. From what I have read about their phone customer service, you might want to have a few snacks at hand and use a speaker phone so you can do other things while you wait.<br /><br />Number two, I suggest that management learn a bit about a concept called "Maintainability". Its related to designing a product so its easy to maintain. Apparently the pump on these things need to be maintained. A little point that is not mentioned in the sales literature. Having to take the thing apart to get at the pump so you can clean the filter is silly and reflects a lack of design competence. It would be a cinch to design something better this. I hope potential competitors are listening.<br /><br />Number Three, add to your pump failure instructions the fact that the root system could be blocking the water intake at the bottom of the pump tower. If your pump stops working, the first thing you should do is to move the roots away from the bottom of the pump tower. You can trim the bottom of the roots with a scissor if you are careful. If that works, you have just saved yourself a lot of trouble that you did not need to go through.<br /><br />Number Four, the growth feeding tablets are hydroscopic. That means they attract water. Keeping them in the little plastic bag provided will, in time, result in their merging together into a large amorphous mass. Management should provide a more water vapor resistant plastic vile to keep the growth feeding tablets in. Of course, that might cost five cents, so its not likely going to happen. So at the minimum, I suggest that users of the thing supply the necessary vile.<br /><br />In Summary, we have an intriguing product, where little attention has been devoted to maintenance design. We have incomplete instructions with respect to trouble shooting in the event the pump stops working. We have non responsive customer service, so if you do have a problem, and you expect to save your current plants, you are pretty much on your own.<br /><br />By the way, why is this thing called an "Aero" garden? Its a hydroponics garden so it would seem that "Aqua" or "Hydro" or "H2O" garden would be a more appropriate name.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? I bought the device because I wanted to learn more about hydroponics gardening. I expected little, so my expectations were met. Its a thought provoking gadget, but given all of the faults in conjunction with non responsive customer support, I have to rate it more in the un-met promise category... that's two stars. I can't justify higher ratings when you have a company that provides customer service at this level of ineptitude.<br /><br />Additional Info as of August 2008<br />I have tried an additional Cherry tomato crop (see my review of the cherry tomato seed kit).  Based on Amazon seed kit reviews, it appears that about 70% of the tomato seed kit reviews are negative. So its not just me. My second batch of tomato's consists of a few marble sized yellow tomatoes, and NO red tomatoes. I am out of nutrients, and I am not going to pay AeroGrows inflated price for more nutrients. I suggest that the cherry tomato kits have a limited shelf life and that AeroGrow is ignoring that. What else can explain 70% negative reviews under controlled growing conditions? Save your money and don't bother with the Cherry tomatos unless you are willing to throw the dice. I am going to try an herb kit next. If it does not do better, I will probably take the thing apart and redesign it correctly.

review/text: This is a unique product that will become a conversation piece. I currently have three of them and they do take some space. It is a good idea to put them in an area where you dont mind all the light they emit. This may be helpful in an otherwise dark room. The product works as advertised. Depending on what you grow, you will get a particular yield. The lettuce and herbs grow fast and quickly. Excellent for those people in an apartment of where weather or critters can be an issue. This is a great product to educate kids. The product seems to be well constructed and alot of fun. You wont grow enough to stop shopping but you will have fun with this item. Makes a great gift.

review/summary: Just about instant gratification
review/text: I received as a Christmas gift.  Had never heard of it, but my son just KNEW I'd love it.  Set-up was very quick.  Easy to follow instructions with pics.  All the herbs sprouted in the time frame printed on the pod.  (Beware the basil placement as it LEAPS ahead of the rest - perhaps a side spot vs center where it hogs all the light).  I month later, I have LOADS of herbs, some of which I'm using and some that I'm drying for later use.  You need to top off the water to the fill line and add the provided nutrient tabs every other week.  (A light comes on to warn you).  You can program the light to give your plants the needed 8 hrs of dark.  The grow light is VERY bright, so I suggest choosing your home placement carefully.  We opted for the bottom of the basement stairs.<br /><br />We can't wait to try the other kits.

review/text: I bought two of these directly from AeroGardens.  One with the salad greens and one with the tomatoes.  I've had them for 32 days now, and the greens are about 2" tall and the tomatoes show one tomato plant that is no more than 1/4" high.  I called to do an RMA.  I have hydronic (infloor) heating, set at 64 degrees, which is very uniform and should not have caused my AeroGrows to fail.  I checked the pH and TDS and found that they are way out of whack from what they should be for acceptable levels.  I will be building my own hydroponic systems for far less money after this experiment.  I am glad I got these on the trial basis which allows you to return them if not satisfied.  These may work well in a warmer environment but in the long run, they will not outperform other systems that you can build cheaper and bigger.  To the company's credit, they are paying for the return shipping so I am only out the initial shipping (about $30).

review/summary: Easy setup
review/text: I only just purchased my AeroGarden, so I have nothing to harvest just yet, but I wanted to comment on the high quality of the package, and the ease of setup.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The instruction manual was clearly written and diagrammed.  You simply screw in the light bulbs, attach the light to the base, add water, drop the seed packets into their slots (clearly marked), cover them, plug it in, drop in a couple of tablets and you're good to go.<br /><br />The salad greens seed kit was included in the package, but I started with the herbs, which I ordered separately.  Apparently there are additional seed packets under development.  Also, the grow light is indeed very, very bright but it's easy to program for nighttime shut-off.

review/summary: If you like basil, you will be in heaven
review/text: I have had the Aerogarden for two months now and now have more basil than I know what to do with. I have basil scrambled eggs for breakfast, pesto pasta for dinner, pistou soup for lunch -- I have an abundance of basil. When I first planted my Aerogarden, however, the cilantro and the dill did not sprout. I contacted customer service, and they not only sent me new seed pods for the cilantro and dill, they sent me a whole new seed pod collection. However, since the basil was doing so spectacularly, I did not want to interfere with it. The mint is going good (B+) and the parsley gets a C. The cilantro finally sprouted, but it gets a grade of D at best and I never did get dill (I did not plant the new seed pod). Overall, this is a great product. Customer service is very responsive and, let's face it, these are a living plants -- Aerogarden has guaranteed them the best they can. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is that, looking at results, I'm not sure that the herbs are well suited to be grown together.

review/summary: Not For People With Hard Water Or On a Budget -- Try Cheaper DIY Options First
review/text: I've owned a couple of these for several years, and have had to repeatedly replace the upright support arm (about $15 a pop about once a year). The arm has two copper-covered contacts which erode (NOT corrode) to the point where the copper covering entirely disappears. The company REFUSES to acknowledge this problem, so I've left there customer pool for good, and mm spending my time and money researching far, far cheaper alternatives using good old aquarium air pumps and air stones, soda bottles and LEDs -- you can get LED grow lights now that work in regular lamps. (I'll probably also try a hack involving the old basins from the AG 7-pod units, but -- now that the upright arms are worthless -- using an external aquarium air pump and air stone, and a separate LED. You can find other self-contained table-top hydroponic systems for less than half the cost of these, if you don't want to goof around with soda bottles. Yeah, the AGs are spiffy gadgets (until the copper connections fail), but the Customer Service stinks, and you can do everything this does on your own for much, much less cash.

review/summary: Still not working
review/text: I received this product three months ago.  The first seeds started to grow then died within a few weeks. The customer service center is taking a month or more to get back to customers.  Two months later they say that they will send me a new package of seeds. Great except after one week the bulb burnt out after only a total of three weeks of use (2 at the beginning and one this time).  So, now these seeds are going to fail too.  Ridiculous to pay so much for nothing.

review/summary: A real revolutionary product for the kitchen
review/text: There are times you look at the ad for a product and say, "Well it looks good in the ad, but that's a lot of money to pay for what may be just a cheap piece of chinese plastic." Well, I ordered this for my wife with missgivings. When it arrived,I was immediately struck with the solid, quality construction. My wife followed the instructions and in less than 3 weeks we were eating all the delicious, healthy, fresh herbs we could handle. The herbs produced for over 5 months, and then we replaced them.<br /><br />We were so impressed with the product, we bought two more with a shelf-- one for salad greens and one for cherry tomatoes. If you love fresh produce and especially salads, but it seems as if some are always spoiling in your fridge, then this is a great product for you.

review/summary: Great Unit - No Hassle
review/text: This is a great way to grow fresh vegies and herbs with almost no hassle. The company has a great customer service department. One of our lamps went out and they sent us 2 replacements at no charge within a week. This has been a lot of fun. My only complaint is that it's hard to find supplies for it locally and the unit is currently geared more to prepackaged seed units instead of letting you do custom plants of your own choice. This system is ready right out of the box and you have sprouts in about a week.

review/text: I received a 7 pod aero garden a couple years ago as a Christmas gift.  For 2 years I really liked it.  I had fresh herbs all winter long it was great.  Then last Christmas I received more seeds to plant.  I got the seeds all ready and plugged in the Aero garden.  It was broke and unfixable and the warranity had run out.  I really would like another one but it is not worth the money for just 2 years.

Except the Cilantro and Dill didn't sprout, so it ain't perfect I guess ... still love it though.<br /><br />We plugged it in, placed in the pods, pressed the button for what we were growing and {POOF!} we haven't touched it, other than adding water and the little tablets everyonce and a while.<br /><br />Like others mentioned it puts off a lot of light ... almost like a Flood Light in the Kitchen at night.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: This product is amazing.  It grows edible gardens with minimum care and absolutely no soil.  I planted my salad greens garden on Dec. 4.  Within 2-3 days the seeds begin to sprout; in exactly 26 days I was eating salad grown on my kitchen counter.  The only "gardening" I have had to do was add nutrient tablets a couple of times, add water (twice a week since the plants have matured)and raise and lower the lamp as needed.  Setting this up was as simple as popping in two light bulbs, attaching a lamp shade, filling a bowl with water and dropping pre-planted seeds into holes. My kindergarten age kids are just as excited as I.  My 5 year old niece exclaimed on her last visit, "Wow! That plant is really getting big!"  I harvest about 2 salads every other day and pick lettuce for sandwiches daily.  All you need for sucess is to follow the directions that come with the garden.  I highly recommend this product. I have already given it as a gift, and I am considering buying another so that I have herbs and lettuce growing in my kitchen at the same time.  Who needs to worry about e-coli?

review/summary: Amazing Product
review/text: I bought this for my wife for Christmas and we both are amazed at the quality  of this product.  Our first 'planting' was tomatoes and 4 days later we have sprouts.  This is easy to use with no mess.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to see done differently is the ability to grow multiple products (i.e., tomatoes, salad, herbs) at the same time. Currently, you can only grow the same item at one time.<br /><br />Update: 3 months later<br /><br />This thing is noisy.  The pump is making an awful racket and am afraid it will fail soon...have contacted the manufacturer for a replacement and I hope the customer service horror stories I've seen so far have been resolved.

review/summary: Eh....
review/text: I got this as a Christmas gift and I was so excited to open it and start it up.  (At this point, I've had it running for 4 months) The instructions and set up are easy.  Then I waited until the sprouts started, which didn't take long.<br /><br />Strangely, in the dill seed pod, there was only ONE seed, which... needless to say, produced a very scrawny tuft of dill.  That died.<br /><br />The cilantro seemed to have so much promise, seemed to be off to an amazing start.  It, too, died.<br /><br />The parsely, which is still alive, is really a useless amount of parsley.  I feel guilty when I clip any of it for fear that the plant cannot survive off the tiny amount of leaves that remain.<br /><br />The chives, well.... lets just say that they're lacking in length and girth, and thats never a good sign.<br /><br />HOWEVER! the basil.  Oh the basil - both the regular green and the purple, they will NOT stop growing.  I am constantly cutting it back because the plants are growing up to the lightbulb and burning on the bulb.  I haven't figured out how to use enough of the basil to keep those plants under control.  But then again, basil grows like a weed under any circumstances, so it isn't because of the AeroGrow that they are exploding.<br /><br />And the lights, don't even get me started on the lights!  They are so insanely bright that you don't need to use any other light source in any room that the AeroGrow is in.  I have mine in the kitchen and have resorted to using a curtain to block the glare at night.  I have it set to turn off at 10:00 pm, but until that time, its like the surface of the sun in my kitchen - blinding white light.<br /><br />The pump is quite, unless it needs refilling, which is often.  I have mine near the sink so its easy to refill the reservoir when I hear the trickeling noise.  But that noise is actually a pleasant sound, so really, no complaints about that.<br /><br />But you know what, for the price of running those lights for all those hours every day, and running that pump for 24 hours every day, I am starting to suspect I could just buy organic herbs and produce and still have money left over for a latte.<br /><br />Yes, its a cute conversation piece and yes its nice to have basil on demand (nothing else really grew at all), but really.... it takes up a lot of counter space, its blindingly bright and it is an energy vampire 365 days out of the year.<br /><br />So I give it a solid "Eh..." - 3 stars

review/summary: Tasteless garden products
review/text: I was really excited about being able to grow garden products in my kitchen all year long. Unfortunately, the results were not what I expected.<br /><br />I started with the standard herb garden. All of the seed pods sprouted on schedule. One of the bulbs burned out within 2 months. Aerogrow guarantees the bulbs for six months (which, by the way is their recommended lifespan), so they sent me a new pair.<br /><br />Now on to the garden products themselves. Don't get me wrong, they all tasted the way they were supposed to, but there wasn't the intensity I would normally get from something grown in the ground. I was hoping that the nutrients that come with every kit would provide the elements needed for the flavor. They didn't.<br /><br />Since then, I've also tried the cherry tomatoes and the salad greens. In every case, even with normally tasty cherry tomatoes, there was absolutely nothing exciting about the flavor of anything I grew in the garden.<br /><br />I won't be using it anymore. I'll be better off using regular small pots and good potting soil with a little fertilizer.<br /><br />I can understand where hydroponics would be necessary and even taste good in the right situation, but using water exclusively for growing vegetables at home just doesn't do it for me.

review/summary: Love this thing!
review/text: This is a terrific product, and I highly recommend it.  Whenever I have people in my house, they're always fascinated by it and ask me lots of questions.  I've only planted the gourmet herb seed kit that came with it so far, and all of the herbs were delicious.  It's so convenient to have the garden right there in my kitchen, and I love that it's low-maintenance.<br /><br />I do have a few minor complaints, which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5:<br /><br />* The cilantro didn't grow at all.  I got absolutely nothing.  I received my AeroGarden as a birthday gift in July.  We were in the middle of remodeling our house at the time, so I stored the package, unopened, in the garage.  The 90-100 degree garage.  For a month.  I am going to assume that the heat destroyed my cilantro seeds.  Oddly, everything else grew just fine.  Maybe I just got bad cilantro seeds.  My husband despises cilantro, so our joke is that he poisoned the seeds when I wasn't looking. :-)<br /><br />* The mint seemed to die a couple months after planting.  The two basils, the parsley, and the dill are still doing well.  The chives are looking a little iffy right now, but I haven't been very consistent with pinching back the other herbs.  I think the chives are being overpowered by their neighbors.  This wasn't the issue with the mint, though.<br /><br />* The herbs included in the kit that comes with the garden would not be my first choice.  I love the basil.  It's convenient to have parsley on hand since a lot of recipes call for only a few tablespoons of it.  I used to hate buying a huge bunch of parsley, only to use such a small amount.  I'd like to say the same thing about the cilantro, but of course, mine didn't grow.  I rarely need mint, dill, or chives, though.  That's just my personal preference, of course.  Maybe this mix of herbs is perfect for some people.  I am going to choose a different herb kit for my next planting.<br /><br />I still really love my AeroGarden, despite its few drawbacks.  In fact, I want to plant some salad greens, but I don't want to give up having fresh herbs available.  I am actually considering buying a second garden.  I've noticed other reviewers have had the same dilemma. :-)

I know I will buy at least a second unit to grow herbs and will probably buy a third to grow strawberries when they come out.  I may even go for a 4th for tomatoes if I could figure out where to put it.  This company worked very hard to build a product that is as fail proof as possible and it couldn't be any easier. I am so grateful that someone took the time to bring this technology to the public.  I look forward to the future and all the products yet to be developed. I'd love to have a whole room of these things.

review/summary: Great idea, very poor execution.
review/text: They're certainly designed like razors, you pay for a lot of unnecessarily hard to replace parts.  As far as I see it here are the major issues with the unit:<br /><br />1.  Undersized failure prone pump.  We had and have pump issues, a lot of the reviews here mention it, and even their website is once again backordered.  If they'd gone with even a slightly larger pump they'd have only a fraction of these issues.  The filter is also directly placed against the pump, this dramatically drops it's efficiency and means the slightest amount of debris will completely obstruct the pump.<br /><br />2.  Underpowered lighting that forces you to either stick with the fixed times hardwired into the unit (computerized!) or buy an additional cord, because other than using a non-standard fitting (so you have to buy another cord) the lights themselves plug into rather specialized fixtures which mostly eliminates your ability to just swap BETTER units in.  The lights that come stock are neither particularly efficient or very high in output.<br /><br />There's no easy solution for the pump issue, the quality control on them is so poor it seems to be a very hit or miss prospect to find one that works long term.  The lighting is also an issue, as you'll be seriously restricted in what plants you can grow well with fixed photoperiods and relatively low light intensity.<br /><br />Overall I would not recommend this unit to anyone.  There are far better designed and less failure prone systems that have already been on the market for years.  The general design & build reminds me of the "sharper image" gadgets that would fall apart the 2nd time they were used seriously.

review/text: I like my Aero garden however I've had a few issues. The cilantro never came up (my brother experienced the same problem with his) and my basil had red spider mites that I had to terminate. The remainder of the garden has grown and provided me with beautiful herbs that I have been able to harvest often. The "water level low" light came on last week and will not reset, but that has not proven to be a problem as of yet.<br /><br /> I bought one for my mom who lives in a remote Alaskan village and cannot get fresh produce so I am looking forward to hear how she fares.

review/summary: Great idea, poor quality
review/text: I've had my aerogarden for over  a year.  I get my seed pods in sets of six, and without fail, at least one either fails to germinate, or dies when it's very small.  Aerogarden will send replacements, but it takes them up to 3 weeks (and some times it just doesn't happen), but by then the new plant is so far behind the original ones that it doesn't do well.  The lights don't fit the sockets well, so I have to check and re-adjust them to be sure they are on.  I think I had to request new nutrients every single time--the ones I received were crumbling and not effective.  Last time I talked to a customer service rep, she said that my last kit must have been an old one, because they'd decided the solid nutrients (the kind I've been getting) weren't effective, and had switched to liquid nutrients.  Apparently, however, there were kits packed with the old nutrients, and they just left them that way, and shipped them out.  But, she said, I could call, and they'd send me the liquid nutrients.  Sort of a sleazy approach, no?  .  I'd love to find something similar, even if it cost more, that was built to work.

review/summary: Mixed results- maybe human error
review/text: The basil grew beautifully, but I think the biggest reason the other herbs didn't grow well is from not pinching off the basil early enough. Since there was a lot of basil, I layed the leaves on a piece cut from a paper bag, let them dry out, and put them in a glass jar. Mint was a bust, which I'm not surprised since the way it grows isn't conducive to a small area. Cilantro was ok, but nothing really looked as lush (except basil) than on the display photo. If I tried this kit again, I'm sure it'd go better by not having the basil choke out the other plants.<br /><br />I did the salad greens/leaf lettuce kit, too. I realized I'm just not a fan of leaf lettuce; too bitter, but it grew nicely.<br /><br />My mom got me the Chia Herb Garden and it's been pretty unsuccessful so far. (By the time I purchase a light, fertilizer, bigger pots, it's breakeven comapared to the AreaGarden) I had to get a light over it, and it's still spindly. The AreoGarden fared much better. Sure, there's cheaper ways to grow plants indoor or in pots, but I just don't have the knack for watering and fertilizing, so for people like me, it's the way to go.

I am just about to the end of the first two week germination period, so we'll see if the "add nutrient" lights come on properly.<br /><br />The unit has been through several short power failures and nothing has disrupted the scheduling of the lights going on and off at the proper times. The light is bright, yes... but not so bright as a sunny window. My unit is in a finished basement room where I can keep it shut away from my plant-destroying young cats. Were it not for the cats, it *would* be on my kitchen counter! However, before you buy one, you should be sure you have a good place to keep it and won't be bothered by the light. It is on 17 hours a day during the herb cycle. Me, I like light.<br /><br />We did have one scare, when my husband smelled a burning smell coming from the unit one night. The smell was completely gone by morning when he told me about it and I checked the unit but I called Customer Service anyway. I was pleasantly surprised not to have to wait on hold. They said that sometimes there is a coating on the plastic that burns off within the first 3-4 days. OK... this happened perhaps just past that point, at about 4-5 days, so I assume it was just what they said. No further instances of strange smells since. Still, it was quite worrisome at the time, so I could wish the company might mention this possible occurrence in the manual so one might be prepared! They did give me a quick way to check and be sure it wasn't my pump burnt out... and it clearly wasn't. So I felt safe continuing to run the unit and appreciated the quick help. The pump has so far been VERY quiet, almost silent, actually.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing how my herbs grow. If they do well, I think I'll start looking for a place to put a secondary and possibly a third unit. Perhaps using one of those accessory wall stands. The one drawback of course is that you get hooked into needing to buy their seed or master gardener kits, their nutrient tablets and their grow bulbs (which are supposed to be replaced at six month intervals). So this is probably NOT the most cost effective way to grow. OTOH... I can look forward to basil that is not half-destroyed by earwigs! And FRESH herbs when all is frozen and brown outside. It's surely an EASY way to garden!<br /><br />Update: April 2010<br /><br />Still using my Aerogarden Classic! That first herb garden was wildly successful! In fact, I've bought more and currently have NINE assorted Aerogardens! On the cat issue, I've found that the cats don't go after my herbs, just lettuce. So I *do* have an Aerogarden growing herbs in the kitchen now. Any gardens the cats might bother or where I might be growing a plant that is toxic for cats stays in my basement room. I'm harvesting abundant basil, dill, thyme and cilantro at the moment.<br /><br />I mostly do my own seeds now, using Park Seed bio-sponges, General Hydroponics Flora series liquid nutrients and making my own labels. I save and reuse all the plastic pod baskets I have received with various seed kits. It's more economic than buying extra Aerogarden supplies. At any rate, this first Classic garden is continuing to function beautifully, no pump failures or any issues, though I do keep a spare pump on hand. I replace the bulbs once a year. I have a mixed romaine/endive/arugula/chervil garden that has recently sprouted and growing right now. I've also used this original garden with the Aerogarden Seed Starter Tray and that works very well too. I'm a happy Aerogardener!<br /><br />My favorite Aerogardens are the tall gardens <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L6GFC8">AeroGarden 900380-1200 VeggiePro for Full-Sized Vegetables</a>, but I'm also fond of the little 3-pod gardens, which are super for flowers. I've grown tomatoes, green beans, chard, lettuce, greens, baby bok choy, petunias and various herbs in my gardens so far. I'm trying baby bell peppers right now, though those have just sprouted. For those needing help or ideas for their gardens, I highly recommend the Aerogarden Growers Community Forum.<br /><br />Update: May 2010<br /><br />On harvests... don't expect a single Aerogarden to provide for a large family. However, if I harvest heavily, I can usually get about 100g of lettuce (enough to fill two large pasta bowls or make 3-4 smaller side salads) about every 5 days or so. I get even larger amounts of chard weekly and it is fresh and tender and mild enough to eat raw. Herb gardens do provide fairly abundant harvests, it's difficult sometimes for hubby and I to keep up with the garden! However, the fact that it produces so well does encourage me to use a lot of fresh herbs! Overall, I definitely feel my Aerogardens contribute to healthier eating! And I use the extra spillover light to help start other plants for outdoors. And grow cat grass.

review/summary: Buggy Garden!
review/text: I got this garden for Christmas.  My first round of mixed herbs went pretty well.  However, you need to follow the directions for harvesting.  Some of my plants did not look so good after awhile.  Also, something was eating my basil.  Everyday I would find little bite marks on it.  I did get some nice herbs and enjoyed cooking with them at the beginning.  My garden never really looked like the picture.  I think I harvested a little early and took to much off at first. I decided to try again.<br /><br />My next herb kit is in there right now.  Not doing so well.  Little nats or white flys are everywhere.  They must have come with the plants.  There are a ton of them everywhere.  I tried to spray them with an herbal spray but it killed the nats and and injured the plants.  I rinced them all off but they are stuggling.  I'm going to have to start over again!

review/summary: Poor quality
review/text: It sounded neat but it has some major drawbacks. Only 2 weeks after purchasing it the water level low light came on and won't turn off. Only half of the pods appear to be sprouting - the others died (for a $20 seed kit I expect all to live). The lights are very bright and the motor can be distracting but isn't too bad. Every 6 months you need to replace the bulbs.

review/summary: Fun novelty, kind of works, way overpriced
review/text: I got this as a gift, which tempers my review -- had I paid nearly $150 for it, I'd feel pretty ripped off.  But, it does grow some nice basil.  I'd prefer some oregano or tarragon in the herb kit in place of the second type of basil though, just for more variety.  And cilantro seems an odd choice, it's not as versatile or universally loved as some herbs, but mine never sprouted at all anyway.  The parsley never made it past 2".  I'm excited to start my second kit, the tomato one, as tomato season winds down, but I'm not as optimistic as I was now that I've read about all these pump problems.  If your place doesn't get much direct sun, it's a fun experiment (and my cat has enjoyed eating the chives...) but if you've got a sunny windowsill, save your money and grow them the old-fashioned way.

review/text: This thing is huge.  At full height it won't fit on the counter under the kitchen cabinets.  So definitely think about where you'll put this before you buy it.  Also, the output wasn't what I expected.  I've grown the herb kit and the tomato kit.  It's easier to grow tomatoes outside than in this thing.  I got a lot of dill from the herb kit, not much else.  I don't even use dill that much.  I'll definitely stick with an outdoor garden next year.

review/text: I bought the deluxe edition for tomatoes just after Christmas last yr, it worked fine until now. The lights went out and are unavailable for a month so the tomotoes died. I have ordered a new seed kit but have to wait a month to get the lights. The other 7 pod garden worked well for first few gardens, last kit only one seed sprouted and barely survived. On both gardens, the pump doesn't seem to be working anymore and the 7pod garden is only 8-9 mos old. It was nice while it lasted!

review/summary: works better for herbs than tomatos
review/text: Overall, this is a great product.  The herbs were wonderful, with the exception of the chives.  Having fresh pestos and cilantro through the colder months was great.  After we used up the tablets last spring, we planted the entire insert into window boxes and continued to get great harvests all summer -  in fact the chives came back this spring and are growing better than they did last year.  Tomatoes were a disappointment - it was hard to get the flowers fertilized, and the ones that started growing kept running into the light.  The yellow produced a decent amount, but the reds did not start to produce until we were running out of tablets.  The only good thing is that once they were at this size, they stayed healthy even without pump running or tablets, and now we have them in the garden and will have to wait if they continue to produce.  Letting the machine soak in water for a bit after the aerogarden has been dry is recommended to soften the roots and lesson the noise.  We also found that a good cleaning of the metal contacts on the lightpost and the pump with isopropanol was essential.  We got a free pump replacement, but in retrospect, the first pump would have been fine with cleaning the contacts.

review/summary: Great Product -- Love It!
review/text: I purchased this for myself for Christmas.  Love it.  Don't believe those complainers that it's too bright and noisy.  Where did they put--on their nightstand?  Mine is in the kitchen and I don't usually sleep there.  It is bright--you need light to grow plants.  There is a very slight hum and water sound.  Unless you are sitting right next to it listening for something to complain about it won't disturb you.  It's not really "aero" but who cares as long as the plants are growing.  I looked into building my own, but it would cost more and not be automatic.<br /><br />I planted the herbs and they are growing nicely, especially the basil plants.  I have had to raise the lights three times already.  Instructions seem to cover everything--especially how to harvest your crop.  In the box is a coupon to purchase more seeds for something like $4.99.<br /><br />I purchased at Bed Bath & Beyond using their 20% off coupon.  However, I really appreciate the fast response Amazon has for refunds--the same day they receive a return!  Never a problem with Amazon.<br /><br />You can also make your own "pods" and grow whatever small plants you want.  I'm going to try cherry tomatoes next.

You place the garden grow pods in the corresponding locations.  You do not mix the lettuce with the herbs and place the aerogarden on herbs or tomatoes settings - if you're growing lettuce, which setting do you think you place the garden?  Everyone at the same time "the lettuce setting".<br /><br />Buy this product - it's wonderful if gardening is or isn't your thing.

review/summary: Fast growth, would get different herbs than included
review/text: Everything grew faster than expected, however the herbs included were not ones I could get alot of use out of. Would've preferred cilanto, chives, and italian parsley over 3 different kinds of basil.  Love the dill, it was huge. I made the mistake of putting oregano, tyme, & mint close together, they just ended up in a tangled mess that I couldn't use since they grew long and stringy instead of up. Once they got big I've had to add alot of water every other day and once or twice did not get a low water level lite in time, so keep an eye on it like any other plants.  I love the idea of having fresh stuff without worrying about chemicals sprayed on it from stores, wish I had room for more, it does take up space, also lights are super bright and light up half the house. For those who say pods didn't grow: Initially i noticed one of my pods was bone dry, I removed the black plastic bars inside that were preventing it from getting enough water, then could tell it was thoroughly wet.

review/summary: Poor pump and customer service
review/text: I bought this as a Christmas present, thinking it would be a cool way to grow tomatos and jalapenos inside (I got the Salsa Garden kit).<br /><br />One of the tomato plants didn't germinate.  Aerogarden was quick to send a replacement, but it was too late to plant it.  I ended up transplanting of the seedlings from the side that germinated to the other side.<br /><br />Within a couple weeks, the pump started rattling.  I called in multiple times and never got to a live person.  Emails went unanswered.<br /><br />Finally a couple weeks ago (it's the last week in March), the pump started to make so much noise I thought the dishwasher was on!  We finally got ahold of someone at Aerogarden (we left a message and they called us back a couple days later).  They said they'd send a new pump.  They also recommended that we switch from tap water to some sort of bottled water.<br /><br />The change to RO water did not help the plants, if anything they really didn't like it.<br /><br />Today the pump finally died.  I've transplanted the plants to dirt, where they'll likely die.  We called AG again, and they said that a pump had been sent and that they would send us another salsa garden kit.<br /><br />To make matters worse, when I tried to pull the pump out following the directions in the manual (I was cleaning out the basin so it wouldn't stink), the pump cover broke!<br /><br />Ugh!<br /><br />Now I'm using the grow light to help sprout some new seeds to plant outside in my garden.  At $150, it is a heck of an expensive grow lamp!<br /><br />Harvest?  Well, there are about 2 dozen green tomatos and a few ripening ones.  We've only got one pepper that's growing.  Color me disappointed!

In this 8oz chuka soba, the product is colored with Tumeric, which is very good. In the other compressed 6 oz pkg, a chemical is used to color. Meh!<br /><br />The BIG problem with this is the BIG pricing. 10 for $42.00 is outrageous.<br />I buy at eFoodsDirect, and the price point is $7.80 for half a dozen 8oz pkgs, plus $5.99 for shipping, bringing the total to under $15.00. I recently bought the last pkg of chuka soba in their inventory. I wonder if they will be discontinuing this and foisting the compressed chuka soba on customers. All the other brands are quite lacking the good taste. 5 stars for taste, minus 1 star b/c of price, maybe minus 2, although the Amazon price is the price point in the stores after CA tax. Unfortunately it is NEVER in the stores anymore.

review/summary: Inferior and Dangerous Rawhide Rolls
review/text: I thought I would give this brand a try to see if they were really rolled rawhide.  As soon as I saw the package I knew I had been duped ... two of them were two inches across with the ends folded over and the other two were an inch across.  Out of the four pack two were rolled, solid, sheets of rawhide and the other two were rolls of rawhide with a `filling' of scraps with the ends folded over.  These shards of scraps are very sharp ... like a large splinter of wood and would definitely cause problems if a dog swallowed them.<br /><br />As you can see in my photos ... the two on the left are the scrap filled and the two on the right are the solid sheets.  The scrap filled one on the left, that was briefly chewed by my dog, is hollow where it was filled with scraps of sharp shards of rawhide ... that I threw away as my dog pulled them out.<br /><br />Unless I sit next to my border terrier every minute and grab the shards as she pulls them out she will try to swallow them.  My lab WILL swallow them as soon as he thinks I'm going to take the shard away.  These rawhide rolls are dangerous!  They may be cheaper, but it's not worth the worry ... vet bill ... or death of my dogs.<br /><br />Rawhide Brand ... why not just put what you advertise in the package and grind up the shards for the pressed rawhides?  You are committing false advertising, and needlessly endangering pets with this product.<br /><br />I am returning these and will go back to the high quality, although, expensive brands like Wholesome Hides.

review/summary: Great treats for allergic dogs
review/text: My dogs are JR Terriers.  They are allergic to corn.  I have been giving them all varieties of these treats for several years, they are fantastic and fairly economical.  A note to JR owners (other dogs too):  if your dog suffers from excessive foot chewing, rashes, etc.....before you waste a thousand bucks on allergy tests and allergy shots (the way we did) get the CORN out of your dog's diet.  I sure wish my VET had told me that....before all of those tests and shots we gave our puppy for a year....<br />Nothing gave him relief until I googled around and learned about the corn allergy.  Bingo.  Practically an instant cure.

review/summary: Crust is Terrible
review/text: I used to love to make Chef Boyardee pizzas. They were inexpensive to make and tasted good, but not anymore. They've done something to the crust. It almost tastes like you're eating a dry biscuit. The dough used to be really good. I sent a complaint to the manufacturer and they replied that sometimes they change the recipe to improve the product. I told them they failed on this one and to bring back the old crust. I won't be buying it anymore!

review/text: This product is not too good! If you are looking for a thin and crisp pizza dough, then perhaps this is not the "one" for you.<br /><br />This manufacture must have changed their recipe for the dough because it does not give the same results as before. I followed the instructions exactly as they were presented and the finished product was more like a biscuit dough rather than a pizza item.<br /><br />I will not buy this product again!

review/text: This is a favorite cereal of mine and I haven't been able to find it locally.  This is the second time I've purchased a 14pack of cereal, so I knew what I was getting in for in terms of quantity.  The cereal has flakes, almond slivers, nut clusters, and dried blueberries.  Its quite delicious, but does require focusing on eating or the flakes will end up soggy before you finish your bowl.  Buying the 14 pack might seem light a lot, but the expiration date for the group I got was over a year away, and so I can pick up other cereals at the local grocer and choose what I want each morning and not run out for quite some time.  I've also found that having such quantity around can be helpful when I don't have time to cook and want to a quick meal.

We are finally on stage 3 and I am amaze at how wonderful this food is and what is even astonishing is that Yummy Spoonfuls is the only baby food we found in the market today with a stage 3 product that has no fillers..

Try it you will like it.<br />With the Cappicino one I also add a T. or more of strong instant coffe or instant espresso.  It makes it much richer.<br />Let your imagination go with these.  I have added some in the center of cakes too.

review/summary: You cannot beat these mints for value
review/text: I work in education and my trademark candy is my mints.  I've tried to keep them out and let students, parents, whomever, have as many as they want.  Well, it had gotten to be a chore, looking for a good deal on mints.  I found these, and with Amazon Prime, or Free Shipping, with subscribe and save, they are even cheaper than Wal-Mart.  I don't feel like a cheap-o for buying the generic brand, and I won't have to buy more mints this year because I got 12 lbs for about a dollar a pound. For an office setting or small business, this is a a great value.<br /><br />A few points:  These do not look as colorful and rich as Brachs.  They are whiter in appearance, they appear to be wrapped well, and of special interest, they contain only about one third green mints, which I wish was not the case, but it has been true in the two bags I've opened so far.<br /><br />The shipping container was great, well-packed, without any excess space for those of you that are concerned with the environmental aspect.  No extra boxes or anything extraneous in the way packaging.

review/text: How happy I am to have found a mix that lives up to its name! The original Tunnel of Fudge bundt cake was a prize winning cake of the 70's and the very best chocolate cake ever, in my opinion. The dry frosting mix used in this recipe went obsolete in the 90's. Now, finally, my family can enjoy this lushous cake once more with Nordic Ware's cake mix. I bought one and tried it and the same wonderful taste came back to me. I have recommeded this taste sensation to all of my friends and bought 2 more for myself.

Just the right amount of moisture, and the texture was perfect - everyone thought it was actually made from scratch. It comes with quick and easy to follow instructions with recipe adaptations for the more adventurous. It took 10 minutes to prepare by hand and 45 minutes to bake. Now I always keep a box around for those "just in case" moments and you should too!

review/summary: Not happy!
review/text: I had such great hopes for this Bundt cake mix - I am grateful that I was testing it prior to serving it for a special occasion.  The "caramel sauce packet" consists of caramel pellets that I imagine are supposed to melt during the baking process - but only a portion melted - and the top of my Bundt cake looks like the surface of the moon!!!  My finished cake has huge holes in the top from where the little pellets didn't melt - and, upon removing the cake from the pan, the unmelted pellets (or chips or whatever) stuck to the pan like glue.  I followed this recipe to the letter and I am a great baker so I am sure that the product was old (although the freshness date states that it is fresh until May 2011) or it was ruined somehow on the shelf or in transit.<br /><br />Considering that my investment in this cake is 3 eggs, a cup of whole milk and one and a half sticks of butter - plus my initial purchase cost - plus my time and energy - I am truly not happy.  And of course have no way to return this item.  Arghh.

Something is missing - flavor.<br /><br />I'll have to doctor up the remaining cake "mixes", as it is too late to return them.

review/summary: Not like the old mixes
review/text: I purchased this wanting to make an easy cake, like the mixes from the 70's.  These are not easy.  I think the only thing in the box is flour and sugar.  You will need to have on hand buttermilk, sour cream, etc.  Not what I wanted.  Since I have yet to have the ingredients I need, I have not made it to see if it is worth the time.

review/summary: Fraudulent calorie totals
review/text: The calorie totals on the side of the box do not include the three sticks of butter and the five eggs required to actually make the cake. (Just look at the "total fat" at 0.5g per serving, and it's obvious, but we calculated out the eggs & butter and realized there was no way to reconcile it.)<br /><br />The cake was good, but it's basically a giant brownie; you could use the recipe on the Baker's Chocolate box and get an identical result by slightly under-cooking it for the fudge effect.

review/summary: Better do it from scratch
review/text: As much as I LOVE NordicWare pans, I was completely disappointed by the mixes.<br />Apple Spice did not even get out of the pan, completely ruining my party<br />And Zesty Lemon took three times longer than expected, was overflowing the pan and tasted in some chemical way.<br />So my advise - get the pans, but do the batter from scratch.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: This product is of good quality.  The sauce is thick and somewhat spicy.  I made it with pre-cooked shrimp for a quick meal.  It would be equally good with tofu or chicken.  It is just 2 servings at best but you can always add more noodles of your own.

review/summary: helpful microwavable tip
review/text: I found it very helpful to disregard the directions and simply put the noodles in a dish with water and microwave for about three minutes. Add sauce<br /><br />and eat. I find it to be a wonderful lunchtime meal.
