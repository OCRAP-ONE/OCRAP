review/summary: Played
review/text: I to, thought mistakenly that these pods would fit into the new nespresso machine I had just ordered through Amazon! I spent $75 on these pods and immediately I tried to return them, to buy the pods that do fit, Amazon wouldnt allow it because of their foodstuff laws. What really got me to thinking they were compatible, was the fact AMAZON advertised these coffee pods on the same page as the nespresso machine. I've now learned my lesson, Amazon will put whatever on a page, not necessarily what is conducive to the product you are purchasing. I also had an issue with lens kit, also on the page of the Canon camera I purchased. The lens' didn't fit the Canon Rebel t2i I had purchased. Word to the wise, check before your purchase. Also, I admit I have no way to telling if this is a good product or not. Love the nespresso machine we bought.

review/text: Most Asian rice cracker mixes are basically the same.  This one is different: it has a greater variety of crackers.  They are also quite a bit larger than I am used to; one is about the size of a big gumball!  Perhaps this is the reason for the can, instead of packaging them in a bag?  These crackers are simply bursting with flavor.  I'm scared I will eat the whole can in a single sitting.

review/summary: Short on pesto, long on onion.
review/text: I thought this would be an interesting take on pesto sauce which is a favorite in our house. There were some green bits in the sauce but so few that I'm not sure why it is called pesto sauce. It is hard to taste the basil for the overwhelming flavor of onion. Pesto should contain  basil, fresh garlic, olive oil, pine nuts or walnuts, and parmesan cheese. This list of ingredients appears on the label along with tomatoes and cream to make the sauce pink. And then the onions, lots of onions, big chunks of onions. They take over the sauce. The pesto should shine through but it hardly makes an appearance. The folks at Scarpetta need to go back to the kitchen with this sauce and try again.

review/summary: Not as good as the others
review/text: Compared to Scarpetta's Puttanesca sauce, and even compared to ordinary supermarket brands, this Pink Pesto is sadly lacking in flavor.  Just because it contains cream is no reason to expect it to be bland.  There is absolutely no hint of the basil flavor which should be front-and-center in a product labeled "pesto".<br />After voting it merely edible the first time, we were able to enjoy it a second time by adding in wine and additional chopped tomatoes.  That turned out delicious.  But hardly acceptable paying a premium price for this sauce, and then having to doctor it up - too bad.

review/text: No idea why the other reviewer was expecting classic basil pesto with something called "pink pesto" and sauce that's clearly pink in the picture.<br /><br />Sauce was rich and yummy, good enough to eat as-is. It's creamy and kind of tangy, a little unusual but very tasty. With the half-off special, it's 3 bucks a jar, a ridiculously good deal. 3 bucks would normally buy you a gross, watery cheap sauce, so that's delightful. I would probably buy it at the regular price, but wouldn't be as excited. I love a bargain.<br /><br />I  had no packaging issues people have reported with the scarpetta, but I use Amazon prime, so the faster shipping probably eliminates the rough handling.

review/summary: Tasty, low-carb food for diabetic cats
review/text: We recently switched my daughter's diabetic cat to low carb, wet cat food and Fancy Feast Savory Salmon Feast is by far her favorite! We had no problems at all switching her from her dry, prescription cat food to Fancy Feast low-carb varieties.<br /><br />I am not a vet, but my daughter's cat had been on insulin for about 7 years and was beginning to have other problems associated with her diabetes. After doing a lot of research, I came upon information about home blood glucose testing and feeding only wet, low-carb cat food. After following careful directions, we made the switch and amazingly, the cat is now in remission! No insulin at all! And her vet, who wasn't a proponent of home testing before, is as surprised and delighted as we are. (Don't attempt this switch on an insulin dependent cat without a lot of research and information and guidance. diabeticcatcare dot com is a great place to start.)<br /><br />I now have switched all of my cats to the low-carb varieties of Fancy Feast after learning about the dry food/diabetes connection, and my cats all prefer this Savory Salmon Feast, too. They will eat the other varieties in a pinch, but they are always enthusiastic about the salmon. I use the Subscribe and Save option since I have a lot of cats and it is less expensive and I am never running out to the store late at night in search of cat food.

review/summary: Our cats line up for it!
review/text: We have a male cat with a urinary problem and we've tried a lot of high quality pet food with little success in dealing with his urination in the house.  Our vet recently suggested that we cut down on dry food, even though we buy a very expensive, organic grain free dry food.  She said that Fancy Feast is palatable to most cats and reasonably priced, unlike some of the more expensive canned foods that cats may refuse to eat.  (We have tried them all!).  And, most importantly, canned cat food contains the moisture which might help address the male cat's problem.  I am pleased to say that it works for him and for our other two cats, all of whom have lived out most of their lives on dry kibble.  This is the first "wet" food that they have eaten with a bit of enthusiasm.  Salmon seems to be their favorite.  I'm sold on Fancy Feast, whatever it is made of, as a moist complement to top quality dry kibble.  Our cats are healthy and happy.  And, of course, subscribe and save helps cost-wise.

review/summary: Fabulous Chocolate covered gummy bears!!!!
review/text: I've been a gummy fanatic since gummy's hit the specialty stores in the 80's & then branched out in drugstores, grocery stores, movie theaters, etc. and I can tell you about every gummy brand company, flavor, shape, style, etc. because they are my passion. It was love at first taste when they came out in the 80's and I was a young girl. That being said, I'm also a gummy snob. I like my gummy's to have that perfect gummy taste and texture. I don't want my gummy to have a Swedish fish consistency or an over chewy, overly additive tasted and artificially flavored that lasts on your tongue and leaves your hands sticky! (that being said Swedish fish are delicious but have their place in a different candy catogory) That's a big NO! If you're a gummy expert and you love gummy's like I do, then you will understand exactly what I'm talking about. I have bought many Chocolate covered Gummy Bears over the years, both white and milk chocolate which I like equally depending on my mood. I have bought chocolate gummy bears both from upscale candy stores and from the one that comes packaged in a box typically sold in drugstores. I have had every gummy both regular and chocolate over the years and I love them both and enjoy them equally. I eat the regular ones more often because they won't put a dent in my diet and I save the chocolate ones for special occasions. I also don't eat the chocolate ones as often because they are hard to purchase for me geographically. In fact, I have to resort to purchasing them off of the internet if I want my chocolate covered gummy fix! These gummy's both white and milk chocolate are the best I've ever tasted! The chocolate stays on even after being shipped to me, which chocolate often comes off if it's not a quality chocolate, but these chocolate gummy bears are pan flashed which means they are covered thoroughly and drenched in the chocolate and not made in mass quantities. The gummy's are put through the process in small amounts so that no gummy is missed and the panning effect is only used with the finest chocolate companies. These gummy's are the best gummy's I've ever tasted and I've tasted many gummy bears over the years. You will not be disappointed! I try to keep my ordering of these fabulous gummy's to only special occasions or holidays, but they're so good that I'm finding myself making excuses to celebrate so I can buy these sinful but so delicious little bears of chocolate goodness more often! The chocolate tastes fresh and you can tell that the recipe is of the finest chocolate quality. There is nothing I despise more in the chocolate world than cheap chocolate! These gummy's are on the opposite spectrum of cheap & generic tasting! These gummy's are the best! You will never need to buy chocolate covered gummy bears anywhere else! I'm sold and I will always be a loyal fan.

review/text: I was so looking forward to finally having chocolate covered gummies in the house, as they stopped selling them at our local candy store. When they arrived they were slightly melted to one another but not badly.There was an ICE PAC in the packaging, but it had long lost its coolness. However the gummy bears still held their shape and came apart from each other easily. The sad part was when I ate some.  I found myself chewing endlessly on a gummy that had no desire to break down in my mouth. It was like chewing chocolate covered rubber bands. And the chocolate was not the best I've ever tasted either. So now I have Two lbs of gummy bears I have no interest in consuming. Really sad. :-(<br />The ones I would buy at my local kosher bulk candy shop were amazing and had a wonderful soft texture. Oh well, I guess my search continues. If you like gummy bears that are rubbery to chew, then these are for you, if you like gummy bears that are tender and easy to chew, then look elsewhere!<br /><br />DTS

review/summary: Great gummy bears
review/text: I had some chocolate covered gummy bears while on a road trip in southern California and had been craving more.  I couldn't find them locally, so I ordered a variety through Amazon and a few other online sites.  These were definitely the best of the bunch.  Great quality chocolate.  I don't know how to describe the gummies, really, but these were how I like them -- not too chewy but not too gelatinous either.  I will definitely order these again the next time a craving hits.

review/summary: Herdez chipotles beat all others
review/text: Canned chipotles are smoked, pickled jalapeno chiles.  Different brands taste slightly different because each company uses its own pickling mixture.<br /><br />Herdez chipotles taste distinctly better than the more commonly found Embasa or La Costena brands.  The Herdez brand is worth seeking out- their salsas are good too.<br /><br />The easiest way to use canned chipotles is to puree the entire can and transfer the puree to a jar.  You can then add smaller quantities of the puree to your recipes- soups, dips, sauces, spice rubs for grilling, etc.<br /><br />Drizzle a thin layer of oil on top of remaining puree, and keep the jar in your refridgerator.  It should keep for a few weeks.

review/summary: Alright Tea, but Only Relative to the Price
review/text: Out of all black teas, Yunnan tea is my favorite. It has a very earthy flavor (sort of like what I'd imagine tree bark would be like) and a slight spice to it. I've had many Yunnans from many different tea sellers, and I must say that this Yunnan is a bit thin. A good Yunnan is pretty full flavored and has a good complexity to it; this Yunnan had the same earthy flavor I expect, but is missing the depth that more expensive Yunnans provide.<br /><br />So, my assessment is that this tea is passable for those who want to pay a bit less. IF you don't mind paying about $10 to $15 more, though, and really like a more rich and complex black tea, there are Yunnan teas that are better han this one.

review/summary: Your Chocolate's in MY Peanut Butter!
review/text: How HEAVENLY are these?  I can honestly say that Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are my VERY favorite candy!  I've loved them since I was a child and they always bring back fond memories.  I love them in their regular size so you can imagine that I just about FLIPPED LIKE A GYMNAST when I saw these! They're HUGE!  In my mind, candy wise, NOTHING could be better than your very favorite just bigger (and MORE of it)!<br /><br />They are HUGE, FRESH and ABSOLUTELY YUMMY!  They really do make a great snack.  Besides, who doesn't love a Reese's?  They make so many Delicious candies!<br /><br />These will remain at the top of my list for that "anytime snack". And for an extra special treat, I either freeze them or I break them up over vanilla or choclate ice cream! SO GOOD!<br /><br />This Seller is spectacular. They always send their items quickly.  They are pleasant and professional.  So, if you are thinking of ordering these, or any other candy from this company, do not hesitate.  I would uses them again and again.  I wish more sellers on Amazon were this reliable.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
review/text: I absolutely love Reeses Peanut Butter Cups. Because I could not find the Big Cups locally, I searched Amazon and ended up ordering two boxes from the Online Candy Shop. Given that selling chocolate via mail-order is their business, I figured it was safe to do so, in spite of the gross shipping charge ($12.00).The only thing "good" I can say about the end result is that the candy arrived quickly - end of "good" remarks. The outer carton they arrived in was crushed at both ends. Even the inner carton showed signs of the crushing. And apparently the chocolate had gotten so hot it caused the chocolate to stick to its paper covering, making it impossible to remove the candy whole.  Well, I learned my lesson. Never again will I order ANYTHING from the Online Candy Shop. You have been warned!!!

Strawberry or Ichigo as the Japanese call it, is a really good mild introduction to Daifuku and Japanese treats.

review/text: These pretzels are much less sweet than Funky Chunky's caramel pretzels.  They are supposed to have lots of peanut butter flavor but it's mighty scarce in the cannisters I received.  Light on the chopped peanuts too.  For chocolate-covered pretzels they taste good and were fresh and crispy, but if you had your taste buds set on peanut butter you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Update:  I e-mailed Funky-Chunky about these pretzels and promptly (same day!) got a call from them.  They sent out 2 replacement cannisters -- arrived via UPS in 3 days.  I must have gotten a bad batch the first time 'cause these are just great.  Plenty of caramel, peanut butter and chopped peanuts.  Very enjoyable product and Funky Chunky is certainly responsive to their customers' comments.

Morton and Bassett is the most flavorful I have ever tried. The price is reasonable for such clean flavor. Pure vanilla is expensive but there are other brands that are pricier and doesn't taste as superb as M&B. I am convinced this is the best pure vanilla you can find in the US.  I do wish I knew what bean is used but maybe that's a trade secret.  It's Kosher certified and that's good enough for me. I have searched for the perfect taste in a vanilla for many years.  Thank you Morton and Bassett, my search is over!  Now I can enjoy a vanilla taste that is pure and smooth. I am very happy to have found this vanilla extract.

review/text: We got hooked on this coffee when vacationing in New Orleans and have been buying it ever since. It is a strong, bold but smooth coffee so Starbucks and Pete's coffee fans will love it.

review/summary: Respect the Linguini
review/text: Anna Linguini #7 is an excellent pasta product made and packaged in Italy. It is not carried by any of our supermarkets and as a result I placed an order for 20 one pound packages via Amazon to restock our pantry. The order arrived in a timely fashion but it looked like the original cardboard shipping container was drop kicked all the way from Italy. The box was ripped in a number of locations and the food product was exposed. Three of the the one pound bags were torn and had to be disposed of. Email to Amazon with a complaint must have been lost in transmission because I received no response. Next time I'll travel up to New York to buy my Anna Linguini. New Yorkers treat linguini with a lot more respect than Amazon does.

review/summary: Four Star Flavor, Five Star Value
review/text: So I've been looking for a quality looseleaf green tea, but all the dragonwell teas are getting outrageously expensive, what with the ridiculous health craze about green tea.  I used to get top grade Rishi organic dragonwell teas for less than $30/lb, but those days are long past.<br /><br />Anyway, so I decided to take a chance with this green tea from Elmwood Inn.  As it turns out, this sencha is very good.  It's grassy and lightly sweet with very little bitterness.  It brews to a very sencha-like, distinctive green cup.  It's no lungjing, but it's very good.  I would say my only minor complaint is that the bag does contain a fair amount of stems with no leaves attached, but for this price, it's acceptable.<br /><br />This is a solid value, and the quality is very good.  I recommend this if anyone is in the market.  It certainly blows bagged sencha such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WB1YSE">Kirkland Signature Ito En Matcha Blend (Green Tea)</a> (which is really MOSTLY sencha with a little matcha powder thrown in) out of the water!

I would not recommend it if you are looking for sencha but it is ok green tea. If you don't know what kind of tea you want you likely to satisfied with it. If you have been drinking green tea for long time that is not the tea you will truly enjoy.

I can never part with them though. They're the best chocolate fix there is, hands down, especially if you don't like licking chocolate off of the inside of wrappers.

review/text: When it comes to junk food, I usually stick with Ding Dongs, Ho Hos, and other Hostess products.  But recently my friend (Walter) recommended M&Ms.  I'd never tried M&Ms before, so I bought a bag to see if they are any good.  I didn't like them at all.  In fact, I flushed most of the bag down the toilet (hopefully this didn't harm any alligators).<br /><br />Maybe I've been spoiled by Hostess products, but when I buy a snack item, I expect a creamy filling.  M&Ms do not have a creamy filling, and they taste awful.  Avoid.

review/summary: I absolutely LOVE it!
review/text: Instant oatmeal is the ideal healthy fast fuel.  I choose original flavor so that I can add whatever I want with it (3-in-1 coffee mix, instant noodle soup base packet, honey packet, powder milk, hot chocolate packet, any savory spices/paste/solids, last night's left over food, etc.).  When eating it without additive, it tastes just as good!  It doesn't have the artificial taste that Trader Joe's and Quaker Oats' instant oatmeal packet has.  After cooking it in hot water, it thickens and becomes creamy.  If you only add boiling water and cover the bowl to let it sit, it softens but will not become creamy.<br /><br />My only gripe is that each packet doesn't have too much oatmeal in comparison to Quaker Oats and Trader Joe's.  There were times I had to use 2 packets to get enough calories to get through the first 2 hours of activity (240 cal + whatever else you put in it).

review/text: After listening to Eddie Izzard's Glorious (in which he makes a reference to Jammie Dodgers) I decided to give them a try. These are great cookies (or more correctly biscuits). They are round wheels of shortbread held together by sticky raspberry flavored plum jam. They are rather expensive in the United States because they must be imported, but perhaps that is a good thing--it would be very easy to polish off the entire package in short order!

review/text: One of the things I missed from my trip to India was the Tulsi tea I used to have there. Over there, fresh Tulsi leaves are plucked from a plant and boiled with the tea and milk (also called "chai"). I couldn't find a Tulsi plant in US and was desperately hoping to find something close enough. And Teatulia was more than close enough.<br /><br />The taste is very similar, and as Tulsi is, extremely calming and soothing for the throat, esp. when I have cold, sore throat, and runny nose.<br /><br />I picked up my box from Whole Foods. At 8 bucks per box, it seemed a little expensive. Although calculations based on the label make this come to approximately 50c per tea bag, or 25c per cup, it is actually much cheaper. I put one tea bag in the tea pot. I also mix in other "normal tea", to infuse the brown color and I end up getting about 5-6 cups of the Tusli chai with the single tea bag. So yes, I only use it to get the Tulsi flavor, and get the Tea/Chai flavor from my regular, loose Tea leaves.<br /><br />Your preference may be to use the tea bag directly in the cup. If yes, I think it is strong enough to give at least 3 full cups of tulsi tea.<br /><br />Summary: If you like Tulsi, you wont be disappointed with this. If you make tea in tea pot, even better. If you want tea bags to use directly in the cup, this works too, but might be a bit strong for a single cup.

review/text: I love this tea pack. I bought these in Scotland and I wish I had bought more! I cannot find these in regular supermarkets in the UK, so I will have to order more from the company's website. I was surprised that I would be able to buy them from Amazon in the states (yay for Amazon!). Living in the UK has turned me into a tea addict, and these teas are very good if you add about a teaspoon of sugar and some milk to them. I'm not a fan of the regular English breakfast tea, but I love every one of these. I particularly like the whiskey one. They do NOT taste the same. All of them brew strong black teas with a distinctive overtone to them. The flavors are delicate, but they are brought out if you add sugar and milk to your tea. I tried them without adding anything and it doesn't taste good. Sugar and milk is the way to go if you want to enjoy these teas!
