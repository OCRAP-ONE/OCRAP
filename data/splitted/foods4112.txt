review/summary: Great for a party
review/text: These arrived on time and were packed well. Out of 64 only 1 was broken. I filled with a sausage leek filling and were perfect texture and held up well. I will order more. In fact I wish I had ordered 2 packs for the party. The guest ate them all up. They are small and perfect for appetizers and filling with whatever your imagination comes up with. Also I considered making these myself and it would have been expensive as I do not have the necessary baking dishes or frankly the time involved to whip up 64 of these. Great deal!

review/text: Excellent. Don't be fooled by the American copycat version called holy tea, by another Dr. Wilson. This is the original WHOLY tea from Canada.<br /><br />This product is well designed and manufactured, just follow directions and remember that 2 liters of water is the equivalent of 8 1/2 cups.<br /><br />If it is too strong, drink lesser amount.<br /><br />A great company, be patient, since it is delivered right from Canada.

review/summary: Great Vanilla Beans
review/text: My daughter asked me to make her more vanilla extract for next Christmas.  Ordered these beans  on a weekend and received them early the following week.  Tahitian beans smell more mellow than Madagascar beans, so I anticipate a unique  vanilla extract by mixing the two.  I was able to  order much more product than I could afford in the store.  And I will leave the beans in the Vodka for 11 months so by Christmas the extract  will be just wonderful.  These  beans arrived plump, blemish free and very fragrant.  Will definitely order again.

It's just so rare these days to get good quality & service for a reasonalble price, that I felt compleed to take the time to let people know.<br /><br />If you've only ever gotten the dried-up husk of vanilla bean from your local grocery store, you must try these to see what REAL vanilla beans are like. If you have encountered good quality vanilla, you won't be dissappointed by these products. My vanilla sugar was a hit last Christmas using this vanilla.

review/text: This is my kids favorite jarred baby food. I make most of the food at home and in a pinch I revert to Butternut Squash bisque, most other jarred baby food are unpalatable. This is creamy and has chicken and veggies. So it's a win<br />I usually used to buy this from Babies r us, but with subscribe and save plus the shipping home factor has made amazon.com a fav shopping site.<br />Tip to make this more calorific: once my baby got to 11 mos and wanted more chunkier food, I used to mash up an egg yolk ( boiled) with a splash of whole milk and make it into a paste, pour in warm Bisque and thicken with oatmeal or brown rice cereal . (disclaimer: my kids have never been allergic to milk or eggs and I started them on it pretty early, you might wanna add formula)

review/summary: Great source of protein and my son LOVES it!
review/text: My son loves this "soup".  The consistency of the soup is basically the same as thick, smooth baby food (it just doesn't have any chunky bits of food in it as most Stage 3 baby foods do, which qualifies it as a "soup" apparently). When my son was 8 months old, he had a hard time adjusting to chunky foods (gagging and choking, etc.), but I needed to buy him some protein-rich baby foods, as we were weaning.<br /><br />I was also buying the Sweet Potato and Chicken meal (stage 2), but I really wanted the larger serving that this jar offered. Upon comparing the nutritional content on the two jars, I discovered that this soup has as much protein per serving as the actual meal labeled as Sweet Potato and Chicken - perfect!<br /><br />I was slightly concerned that the "cinnamon" might cause him gas issues or digestive discomfort (it does me sometimes and he is a spitter-upper), but he has no problems whatsoever. And he LOVES the taste. He will eat a whole jar in no time flat (at room temperature, me spooning it in).<br /><br />My son is now almost 14 months old. He is in the 95% for height and 55% for weight. He has never really adjusted to chunky baby food, which I can't explain, as he now eats finger foods, bananas, berries, pb&j, mac and cheese, chicken, etc. just fine self-feeding. But I still use these Earth's Best Soups pretty much daily to supplement his dinner, to make sure he keeps his weight up to how fast he is growing.  He eats on his own for awhile and then I feed him a jar of soup. He still loves them and it is great having an easy source of protein on hand.

review/text: I have two dogs, one is a 4 month old lab pup in basic obedience training.  These treats are great because they don't crumble in your pocket...they are slightly bendable (moist) to break into two pieces or you can feed them whole.  The Salmon smell really motivates dogs to follow commands.  The price was incredible saving me almost half price on "Entirely Pets" through Amazon.  I give my large Akita mix dog a couple of these for treats just because he's a good boy.  I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Best Cocoa Ever Used
review/text: I switched to Equal Exchange baking cocoa after learning about human trafficking and forced labor of children in the cocoa industry; Equal Exchange is Fair Trade so the producers are paid fairly and labor rights are respected. Prior to my Fair Trade switch, I'd always used Hershey's cocoa for baking, making hot chocolate, etc. After using Equal Exchange cocoa, I would not go back to Hershey's, even if they offered Fair Trade cocoa. The Equal Exchange cocoa is a much finer, less bitter product: it makes fantastic from-scratch brownies and hot cocoa! With Hershey's my hot cocoa was always gritty, with a lot of undissolved cocoa at the bottom of the cup; Equal Exchange baking cocoa blends right into the hot milk and tastes as smooth as the commercial hot cocoas (better flavor, though).  This is quite a bit more expensive, but it's honestly worth it, both for the sake of ethics and taste!

I also made a batch with the remaining Hershey's that we had on hand, and although I couldn't really tell the difference in them, we absolutely prefer the organic kind just because we know what's in it. I also try to support fair trade brands whenever I can. I priced this at my local grocery store and it was almost double what it cost from Amazon. Will be ordering a new shipment in the near future.

review/text: The Zevia Root Beer Flavor is one of my favorites of the Zevia flavors.  It has very strong Root Beer taste which I find tastes a lot like my memories of A&W Root Beer back when I was growing up in Canada, back before they started replacing sugar with High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I'm not sure if A&W Root Beer is different here in the US from Canada, as the food in the A&W restaurants here in the US is nothing like the food in A&W Canada restaurants.<br /><br />In any case, I love that there's nothing but all natural ingredients here, and it's naturally sugar free.  This summer, I often combined the Zevia Root Beer with Clemmy's Sugar Free Vanilla Bean Ice Cream to make my own Sugar Free Root Beer Floats (and sometimes with Orange Zevia instead of the Root Beer) and they were absolutely amazing guilt free Floats.

review/summary: We examined their claims, gave it a taste-test, & found multiple problems with Zevia...But here's a solution! (Read on)
review/text: First, my household is a low-carb, low-glycemic index, and zero corn syrup household. We have been looking for alternative *natural* sweeteners for quite some time because our doctor has serious warnings (and lots of research) against chemical-based sugar substitutes like aspartame, saccharine, and splenda.<br /><br />Stevia is our favorite sweetener - usually from a bottle, or as a raw leaf. The problem is, we can find very few products (like snack bars, soda, cookies, etc) which use Stevia.<br /><br />So we were excited to meet the people from Zevia at the trade show in which they rolled out this product (2007)... and we were among the first people in the country to taste a stevia-flavored soda!<br /><br />At the trade show, the company gave out mini-cans of selected flavors, and we were super impressed. The taste is different from mainstream root beer, cola, and ginger ale products ... but it was sweet, sparkly, and had a nice bite. No awful aspartame aftertaste!<br /><br />We came home excited to order our first batch for home/personal use. To our disappointment, we found several discrepancies between their product & literature at the trade show, and the actual product rolled out.<br /><br />First, they decided to add caffeine to many of the flavors (not the root beer), but this ruined most of the flavors for us & makes their "all natural" claim a bit disingenuous.<br /><br />Next, we were told by company reps that the soda contains only purified water, stevia, and citric acid. To our surprise, when the ingredients were published on the can (FDA standards), we found that the PRIMARY sweetener is an artificial chemical called eurethrytol (2nd ingredient), not Stevia (5th ingredient). Drinking a 12 ounce can of ginger root beer flavored Zevia had the same effect on me as eating 4 maltitol-based chocolate bars (LOTS of stomach problems).<br /><br />Finally, they claim this is a zero calorie drink, but erythritol does indeed contain calories - about 25 for the can. And at $1 per can, the price is just to high. This product was a disappointment all around.<br /><br />SOLUTION!!<br /><br />Ok, so you're wanting a safe, natural, great tasting soda without side effects? All you need are 3 ingredients: Seltzer Water, Bottle of liquid Sweet Leaf Stevia, and (secret ingredient) citric acid.<br /><br />Seltzer water is widely available at any grocery store. You'll find the other two ingredients at your health food store (we buy citric acid in the bulk section of our local apothecary, under $1 per ounce).<br /><br />For one serving of soda (12 ounce) add 15-20 drops of liquid Stevia, and just a *PINCH* (1/8th teaspoon?) of citric acid. The Stevia sweetens and flavors, and makes a very nice drink. But the citric acid adds that "bite" that makes a cola taste like a cola!<br /><br />Our favorite Sweet Leaf flavors are: Root Beer, Cinnamon, Orange, & Apricot. This method is actually much cheaper than cans of Zevia, tastes better, broader variety of flavors, super portable (we travel with a little pouch of citric acid & a bottle of Sweet Leaf), and it's truly natural!<br /><br />Three more notes for health-conscious people: (1) We have tried many off-brand bottles of liquid Stevia, and they are all just fine. HOWEVER, many of the off-brands use a grain alcohol base, which tastes awful in soda (unless you're used to that sort of thing! Ha Ha...). So other brands are fine for cooking, but at this time I recommend Sweet Leaf for mixing drinks (just purified Stevia + water).<br /><br />(2) Aluminum cans are a disaster for the environment (takes one 12oz can of gasoline to melt down/recycle 4 new aluminum cans). So I recommend bottles of Seltzer water instead.<br /><br />And, (3) artificial carbonation robs your body of magnesium & other things. Instead, opt for naturally sparkling water, like Pellegrino. We usually pay $1.15 for a 1-liter bottle of naturally sparkling mineral water, no additives, and it has lots of healthy minerals. GOOD LUCK in your continued journey for better health!

review/summary: Love the Root Beer flavor
review/text: I finally found this soda at a local store. Not much on the shelf. I tried the zevia regular cola (bad aftertaste) the root beer one (this is my favorite) and the orange one (good). I didn't get the lemon/lime one. This rootbeer one is delicious. No aftertaste like the cola one has. I love rootbeer so I will continue to buy it. It is expensive at $1 a can and for the 6 pack it cost me $5.99 with no tax on it. It is a much better alternative to the diet sodas out there. I don't use artifical sweetners or have sugar in my diet except for stevia. I hope the price gets lower as other stevia colas come onto the market.

review/summary: Excellent artisan rootbeer taste!
review/text: I am currently drinking my second can of Zevia Root Beer, having managed to sneak it away from my three kids.  It's got a rich, full flavor and plenty of fizz--all our cans did.<br /><br />I left a fuller review on their Cola entry, but everything I said there stands for this variety, as well.  It's just as good as either sugar-full or sugar-free brands, but is not bad for you, and even good for you because of the stevia, which can help regulate blood sugar.<br /><br />Makes a killer float, too, with my own homemade sugar-free artificial sweetener-free ice cream.

review/summary: Natural Ginger Root Beer with stevia tastes great
review/text: When I found out about this product from Jorge Cruise's site, I couldn't wait to try it.  It took many visits to specialty stores (names obtained from the Zevia website) before I finally found one that had just two cans of the Ginger Root Beer in stock.  I bought both cans, even though I never really drink root beer.  After tasting Zevia Ginger Root Beer, I love root beer now!  This is my favorite flavor, even over Cola and Orange (haven't had the Twist, yet).<br /><br />Everything in the Ginger Root Beer is natural, and there's no caffeine (like the Cola, even though it's supposed to be natural caffeine). The cola is  my next favorite that I have occasionally.  I did not care much for the orange, it tasted artificial and not very orangy-tasting. I highly recommend the root beer flavor, though.

review/summary: The best Zevia flavor
review/text: My wife and I have tried the four flavors of Zevia and we both have this as our favorite.  Using Stevia instead of sugar or the common sugar substitutes is great.  The price is OK.  It would be nice if Amazon could make a deal with Zevia to offer "FREE with Super Saver Shipping" in the future.  At this time the $9.89 shipping makes the price less attractive.<br /><br />When we drink "traditional" soft drinks we mostly drink diet drinks.  We get Diet Dr. Pepper and Diet Pepsi (when available at places like restaurants) as first choices.  I tolerate Diet Coke when I want a diet soft drink at a restaurant and none of the above are available.  Although, I may also get a non-diet soft drink if that is the case.  I included some of the other drinks we like, since taste is subjective.  Hopefully if you like the above drinks, Zevia's Root Beer may be to your liking.

review/summary: Enjoy a delicious Root Beer  - guilt free!
review/text: I cannot compliment this brand enough.  I've been purchasing all flavors of Zevia for the past few years and absolutely love it.  There isn't an aftertaste at all, and it is simply delicious.  Zevia's Root Beer is among my favorite flavors.  My other Zevia favorites are black cherry and orange, however all their flavors are super!<br /><br />My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and do not contain any harmful chemicals.  Also, I love the fact that there are not any calories in it.  There are no artificial colors or flavors either. Truly guilt-free!<br /><br />The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola.  All the others are caffeine-free.<br /><br />I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost.<br /><br />I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly. I trust this brand.<br /><br />I hope you give Zevia a try. I think you will be pleased!

review/text: Really love the root beer.  Also like the ginger ale, but think the root beer is my favorite.<br /><br />I tried the orange and didn't like that very much.<br /><br />There's a new one Dr. Zevia, that looks very good, like Dr. Pepper I guess, that has caffeine if you want caffeine, but I haven't tried that one.<br /><br />I find the Zevia very refreshing and great.  At first there was a very slight unusual taste, but I quickly got used to it and now really like it.  Especially since it is zero calories and no bad things in it, like aspartame.<br /><br />Not sure why some of the Zevia's qualify for no shipping and others have a large shipping fee.  I always look for the ones with no shipping fee and that is how I tried the root beer.

review/summary: Blech! Horrendous taste!
review/text: I was pleased to have received a couple of $3 off coupons for Zevia, which brought the cost of a 6-pack in my area down to just $2.50.  I was eager to try this with my family as an occasional treat (we rarely drink soda).  We all tried both the cola flavor as well as the ginger root beer flavor and, after about 1/2 of a small glass, every one of us (including my young kids) said, "Ick!" At the first taste, it is o.k. But, after you've had a few drinks, there is very little to differentiate Zevia's taste from any other diet soda.  I guess if you are a normal diet soda drinker, this might be a wise, somewhat more natural alternative.  Stevia takes a little bit to get used to, but, this is NO substitute taste-wise for regular pop.  We'll stick with our Blue Sky sodas, sweetened with cane sugar and caffeine free, for the occasional treat.

review/summary: The taste certainly lacks & it gave me gas and bloating...
review/text: I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the "big two" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard "bad things" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.<br /><br />But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.<br /><br />Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called "erythritol" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol "shouldn't" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it "supposedly" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.<br /><br />If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the "bad" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.

review/text: I was skeptical of a health-foodie soda of all things! I initially tried this when a friend got it for a gathering. Not only is it good for you: using stevia, no calories, no sugar--it is really delicious!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />-Delicious flavor: Ginger Root beer is my favorite<br />-No calories, no sugar is great. I don't like drinking soda because it is so bad for you, but since this is all natural, it is great to be able to have it as a refreshing snack or with bbq food or comfort foods! I usually steer away from diet foods because they lack in flavor and constantly remind me that I made a "DIET" choice instead of a happier choice, but Zevia has succeeded in making a happy, healthy drink.<br />-Stevia does have a distinct taste or lingering sweet taste on the tongue that is definitely not the same as real sugar. It's not unpleasant, but it is just a different palate experience. I actually like it! I normally don't use stevia in my drinks, especially hot drinks, because of this difference, but this soda really uses it well.<br />-Addictive in a great, refreshing way :)

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I found this soda on sale at Whole Foods for $4.99/6-pack as part of my mission to cut excess sugars out of my diet. I can't stand other artificial sweeteners, so after researching stevia (a calorie-free natural plant-based sweetener) and xylitol (the only sugar alcohol that doesn't cause gastrointestinal distress), I decided I would give Zevia a try.<br /><br />The ginger root beer flavor is fantastic and caffeine-free. I can barely even tell that this is not a cane sugar soda. The only difference to me is that the sweetness lasts with you a bit longer, but it doesn't bother me and goes away with a swig of water. I love that it contains real ginger and other extracts.<br /><br />I did not like the black cherry Zevia at all, too sweet, and I have a feeling the lemon/lime and orange flavors would be equally off-putting due to the flavor profile of the sweeteners being used. I want to try the Dr. Zevia and cola flavors next, although I wish there were caffeine-free versions, as I like to enjoy these sodas in the evening.

review/text: Based on the positive reviews, I was excited about this product. UPS deemed the first shipment undeliverable, so I just received my reorder today. I have not had a diet soda in over 4 years and only 1-2 Dad's regular root beer liter size this past summer for ice-cream floats. Root beer is my second favorite to birch beer, however since I've technically given up sodas, it is a rare treat (or health hazard depending on your viewpoint) that I indulge. My taste-buds response was this product does not taste like Dad's, but more like a weaker root beer flavor and the aftertaste reminds me of how a diet coke tasted. I've used stevia in my coffee for several years and cannot tell it from sugar. I do not like it in hot tea unless it is chai, as otherwise I taste a slight cotton-mouth aftertaste similar to this product. Although somewhat disappointed, I certainly will drink the remaining 23 cans and may decide to try their Dr. Pepper and/or black cherry versions.

review/summary: I guess I don't like stevia
review/text: I've been trying to give up both Aspartame and High-Fructose Corn Syrup, so I was excited to find Zevia at my local grocery store. I've had stevia one other time, in coffee, and it seemed a little over-sweet, but nothing that couldn't be fixed by using a little less of it. I couldn't even finish a can of this soda though. Not only did it have the worst stevia flavor (grossly sweet and somewhat bitter), but the flavor also tasted really watered down to me. I think the Ginger Root Beer flavor could be really good if it was sweetened with something else and the non-stevia flavors came through a bit stronger. I'm glad I only got a six-pack of this rather than buying the 24 through Amazon as I've considered doing before.

review/summary: It's just NOT SWEET!
review/text: I like the fact that it uses stevia (how much of it vs. the other sugar alcohol sweetener though?? I think stevia is not toward the top of the list of ingredients) and I have used pure stevia extract before, and I can tell you they are not using very much of it. It basically tastes like a fountain drink where the syrup was running out. I would not pay regular soda prices for this product, let alone the higher retail prices at places like Whole Foods. It seems to me they are basically jumping on the stevia bandwagon and it has more to do with marketing than actually using it to make a good product.

review/summary: Delicious Flavor - Better than sugary Root Beer
review/text: Zevia drinks have been my favorite alternative to sugary or diet drinks. I like all the flavors I've tried but I really loved the Root Beer flavor. It reminds me of when I was a kid and enjoyed root beer floats. This is however a more complex drink with the natural flavors of wintergreen oil, anise oil, lemon oil, orange oil and ginger extract. This does contain citric acid which can cause tooth damage if you drink it too often. I think it is safe to say that this drink won't harm you if you only drink it now and then. My little Eat Safe handbook also says that Erythritol is safe at low levels. When you think of the dangers of eating too much sugar or artificial sweeteners then this drink starts to look pretty darn good. But drink in moderation. The problem with the ginger root beer flavor is that you will want two cans at a time. It really is that good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Better than my first experience with Zevia
review/text: A while back, I tried Zevia's cola and was not too impressed.  I decided to give the company another go and tried the ginger root beer.  I think Zevia takes some getting used to, but compared to the cola, this product was not too bad.  The initial sips were strange with the flavoring more ginger than root beer.  I don't typically use ice with my drinks, but I felt compelled to drink this cold. I think I could drink this as a soda substitute.  The flavor isn't phenomenal but it is better than Zevia's cola option and it is a good alternative to mainstream aspartame-laden soda products.

review/text: This was my first Zevia soda. The root beer has almost a watery taste to it. And the aftertaste is probably as bad as with regular diet sodas. It's definitely not a creamy root beer (like I prefer), but if you're into the non-creamy, regular diet brands, I would recommend this.

review/summary: One of the most accurate flavors
review/text: Honestly, I love Zevia. It's the only way I can have soda again and not as a compromise. This stuff is not in any way inferior to its original brand names. Zevia root beer tastes exactly right. In fact, with all the flavors, I have not experienced the aftertaste you often hear mentioned, though I have to say that the many citrus varieties are all pretty similar in taste, but different enough that you can tell them apart. Zevia Root Beer is a win and one of the most flavorful of the Zevia brand if not THE most. I like others am a bit concerned about the use of erythritol but only because I have IBS and that product is related in some way to diarrhea and stomach problems. I cannot say I've had any problems as a direct relation to the ingredient but I would like to see what this would taste like sweetened entirely with stevia.

review/summary: Great alternative to regular pop!
review/text: I recently discovered I have candida and have been forbidden to drink anything with caffeine, sugar, or gluten, which cause a flare-up in my symptoms.  My boyfriend and I went to a food co-op on Saturday to find things that I CAN eat (very few traditional grocery store foods are allowed on the candida diet).  I noticed Zevia and was pleased to find that it's sweetened with Stevia, one of the few sweeteners I can consume.  The price was a little high (at a little over a dollar a can, plus tax), but I felt it was worth it to get my sweet fix.<br /><br />I was tentative to try this because we had recently purchased Truvia, and the taste right out of the jar was slightly bitter.  But with my first sip of the ginger root beer, I loved it!  It's very bubbly and light and refreshing; not bitter at all.  It doesn't weigh you down or coat your teeth with a sugar film like normal sodas, either.  And the ginger root beer taste is different than any other soda, too.  All that said, Zevia's Ginger Root Beer makes a perfect substitute to regular root beer.  If I could eat ice cream or have alcohol, I bet it'd be wonderful in a root beer float or mixed with blackberry brandy (my favorite!)<br /><br />I highly recommend at least giving this soda a try.  I haven't tried any other varieties yet, but I can personally attest to the wonderful flavor of the ginger root beer, and anyone who's looking for a healthy soda option should consider Zevia.

review/summary: Thats not bad!
review/text: I got this from a local store, so nothing to say about delivery.<br /><br />I told a story about how I felt and got this in my review of the Zevia cola, so I won't rehash it here. Yes, I just plugged something for which I make no money.<br /><br />When I got it home, I noticed that one of the cans in the case wasn't Zevia but Blue Sky Free root beer. It was okay, but it also says something about how this stuff is packaged.<br /><br />Anyway, I let it chill and popped open a can, expecting something like Mug root beer but less so. It was actually pretty damn good, better than expected! The diet-y flavor is quickly overpowered by one that is decidedly root beer and only makes a brief cameo after the stuff is swallowed. While I would far rather have an A&W or Barq's, this is a very viable alternative if sugar and corn syrup are no longer your friends.<br /><br />The only real downsides I noticed is that there is no vanilla in it, instead it uses four kinds of oil extracts for flavor. Vanilla would have made it a five-star drink and if I have this stuff and some vanilla at the same time, I'll probably combine them.<br />Also, since I kind of assumed (I didn't look, sue me) this would cost a fortune to ship and handle, I found it locally. In the entire area of Arlington Texas, there are four places that sell this according to the Zevia stie. Four.<br /><br />Should you buy some? Sure. It lacks some of the satisfaction of more widely-available root beers, but 'diet' is Latin for 'nothing is as good as it could be'. Good alone, serviceable with Mexican food.

review/text: I have never really been a soda fan ever. Growing up as a kid the only soda I thought tasted good was root beer. As an adult and a vegan I know very well that regular sodas are just empty calories and a whole bunch of high fructose corn syrup so I have stayed far far away from them.<br /> I use stevia for my coffee in the morning and I love it. I have done the research on all artificial sweeteners and I wont go near those chemicals. Amazon had recommended this to me by other things i have purchased. I was too nervous to buy 24 of them since i don't like soda and it could have tasted terrible. So my solution was to get a 6 pack at my local store.<br /><br />All i have to say is WOW! It has a great root beer taste. I am so pleased with this product I plan on keeping this an auto-ship. I recommend this to people who want yummy soda without the soda and future cancer.

It had always been pick your poison between sodas loaded with insane amounts of sugar, or sodas flavored with Splenda/sucralose/aspartame.  I was thrilled to finally find the Stevie-flavored Zevia soda by accident while wasting time in a store, and got the 6-pack of root beer.  I thought it might taste odd, but it's actually quite delicious.  Costs $1 a can pretty much anywhere you get it, but kicking in a little extra pocket change for a guilt-free delicious drink is well worth it.

review/summary: Acquired Taste for Non-Diet Drinkers
review/text: I haven't drank diet soda for many years and back then it was the nasty aspartame stuff.  Those drinks are an acquired taste but once you're off the corn syrup it's hard to drink a `regular' soda.  Zevia sodas also have a period where you'll have to get accustomed to the taste.  This is the third flavor of Zevia I've had up until the cola flavor I just got my hands on it was my favorite.  I was getting used to the stevia sweetened zing on earlier flavors of orange and black cherry before I got the root beer.  It tasted really good to me when I first started drinking it but it took my wife a bit more time to realize it was good.  She had stayed away from Zevia after tasting the orange which she did not like.  Zevia sodas still have a little aftertaste (the zing I refereed to above) that kind of sits with you for a few seconds but the longer you drink it the more used to it you get.<br /><br />However, there are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Root Beer is a very good tasting soda.  I'll definitely continue to drink it if I can afford to and Amazon has it available.

review/text: I am a big fan of Stevia over artificial sweeteners like Saccharine or Sucralose so I was really looking forward to switching my diet soda and I bought a case of this stuff having never tried it, but having read the rave reviews.  YUCK!!!!  It does not taste like root beer.  Why does Zevia company have to invent their own holistic, all-natural recipe for root beer to create a soda with Stevia, why couldn't Zevia have just bought the exact formula from A&W and used Stevia as the sweetener instead?  That soda would taste great.  Unfortunately, this Zevia soda doesn't taste like normal root bear or even diet root beer.  It has a weak taste that's strange and unfamiliar, followed by the harsh aftertaste bite of the oils and ginger making me worry they're covering a weaker, unpleasant aftertaste from either the stevia or other ingredients in the zevia all-natural formula.  Bleh.  If you want guilt-free soda, but dont care about going all-natural, like I don't care, this is not the soda line for you.  Hopefully the diet soda giants will break out a stevia-sweetened branch of their regular line, as Zevia isn't tasty enough to switch.  My wife and I threw out the rest of the case.

review/text: I have tried the Cola, Black Cherry, and Root Beer, and in fact order all of them regularly.  These are great.  To be honest, my first can of cola, I didn't like but then tried it another day and ever since, I really like them all.  My favs are the Root Beer and Black Cherry.

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: I'm a big fan of Zevia sodas and drink several cans per day during the summer months. With that said and just to be fair, I have to tell you that I'm not a big root beer fan to begin with. In fact, I haven't drunk root beer in twenty years or more. So when I ordered Zevia's Ginger Root soda and tried my first can, I thought I was going to puke. This stuff tastes exactly like Pepto Bismol.<br /><br />But you have to remember something here, I'm not a fan of root beer, so maybe this is the way it's supposed to taste. I've read raving reviews about this flavor on other sites but it's just not for me. That's why I had to give it one star.<br /><br />My opinion is subjective like any other one, but if you like root beer, I think you won't be too disappointed because my taste buds tell me that they have a good product, but one I can't enjoy. I know how strange that must seem to you but I can appreciate something even though I may not like it on another level.

review/summary: Dangerously addictive
review/text: If you ever go to an Indian restaurant with me, order your own papadams (English spellings vary). Once these delicious wafers get to the table, I suddenly become sharing-impaired.<br /><br />You've certainly seen them at Indian restaurants. They're the saucer-sized crispy wafers. Thin, crunchy, and often seasoned with big flavors (black pepper, cumin, garlic, or chilis, to name a few), these call to mind some Western crispy snacks, all of which pale in comparison. Made with bean flour, these offer a bit of protein with their crunch, but without a bean-y flavor. And, if it matters, you don't have to be a chemist to pronounce any of the ingredients.<br /><br />I've had a few flavors in the Lijjat line, including plain. I've had other brands, too, but this is the one I keep coming back to. These can be cooked many ways, including frying or toasting over an open flame - but a stack of three in the microwave for a minute come out very nearly as good, and with fewer calories than you might expect. Each package contains about 15 wafers, so the 20-pack is only for large families or the truly fanatical. If you can't get to an Indian grocer, though, consider splitting with some friends. They'd better be good friends, though, because sharing is a real problem.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

review/text: 7.06-Ounce Pack (Pack of 20).  I didn't realize that "Pack of 20" meant a whole case (20) of 7.06-ounce packs!  It didn't mean 20 per pack. I ended up with almost ten pounds of papadams!  Unless you're an Indian restaurant, or a very large family that eats these all the time, don't order these.

review/text: I know the purists cringe, but these pods are very good.  I never had the talent/time or inclination to learn how to make a real cup of espresso from scratch, so this is the perfect compromise.  Develops a better crema than Illy, almost as good as a coffee shop could produce.  And the decaf means I can have a cup in the evening and not end up watching the Late, Late, Late Night Movie.

review/summary: Tastes good in coffee
review/text: This is really good in coffee.  I bought several flavors from the Capella company, and this is my favorite so far.  For a 12 oz cup of coffee, I put in 9 drops, which worked out very well.  I also added about a teaspoon of Wholesome Zero sweetner (awesome stuff).  It probably doesn't need any sweetner at all.<br /><br />FYI - this tastes NASTY if you try it straight.  It's kind of like cough syrup, but worse.  The same thing happens if you try Vanilla straight, though, so I wasn't too worried after I first opened it.  Once it's been dissolved in enough coffee, it tastes like it smells, which is wonderful.  And there's no sugar or calories.<br /><br />I haven't tried this disolved in water.  There are instructions for it, but I think Egg Nog flavored water would be weird since plain Egg Nog should have a creamy texture to it.  A fruity flavor might be better.<br /><br />This would be awesome in milk shakes.<br /><br />I usually buy flavored coffee (whole bean), but I think I'm going to keep investing in this and just buy regular plain coffee.  That way I can have any flavor I want without having to store several pounds of expensive coffee.

review/summary: great snack for on the go
review/text: My children (ages 2 and 6) both love Strawberry PUFFS! They are a great snack for on the go. My little ones are older than the "average Puff eater" :) and yet they ask for these all the time. The strawberry flavor is light, not too sweet. And the Puffs seem to melt in your mouth-- much softer than O cereals. I especially like that these Puffs have considerably less sugar than the other brands, the ingredients are natural and organic. I was also happy that the packaging is recycled and the lid is easy to open for pouring or for reaching in to grab Puffs. Overall love these Puffs and they are a MUST HAVE in our home! :)

review/summary: The best chipotles I've tried
review/text: I live in Texas and this is the best brand of canned or jarred chipotles I've yet to try. Inferior brands tend to smell like overstewed salsa or Rotel gone rancid when you open them up, so you'd know right away it's not good. I find those ones to be worthless - the peppers lack that tasty smokey hotness and the adobo sauce tastes as bad as it smells. But not this brand. These smell and taste smokey and slighly vinegary like chipotles in adobo are supposed to.<br /><br />Empacadora San Marcos thankfully doesn't disguise any of their ingredients under the vague label "spices" (like other brands) so you know exactly what you're eating, and they don't use nasty soybean oil (which seems to do something strange and unpleasant to the peppers). I've also found that they are usually the lesser expensive brand on the shelf. It's even cheaper in bulk. So heck of a deal.<br /><br />The local grocery store that carried this brand here went under, and I haven't found it elsewhere so far. So I'm greatly thankful I can buy these here at Amazon. I'll gladly order these online then settle for something inferior (and any good chipotle-phile will understand that without reservation).

review/summary: Great Seasoning for Just About Everything!
review/text: I first ran across these in the "rot box" at my local grocery. They were selling them out and would no longer carry them. I bought six or eight cans at a disgracefully low price and took them home. They have that wonderful almost tobacco-like smoky flavor similar to really good ancho peppers. The sauce is thick, pungent and slightly sweet. I often take a stick blender and liquefy the peppers and sauce into a paste. You can use it as a condiment (though it packs considerable heat), or a flavoring in sauces, soups, stews.......oh who am I kidding, this stuff is great on just about everything.

review/text: These lovelies have become a staple in my kitchen even though I'm a dyed-in-the-wool green chile eater. So far I've added them to stews, pizza, eggs, potato fry-ups, and anything involving a tortilla. Be sure you can stand a little heat before investing in a case, but otherwise, I totally recommend them.<br /><br />In case you care, they're also Kosher. The hecsher is too small for me to read, but it's there. I think it's from the Mexican beit din.
