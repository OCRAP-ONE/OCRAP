review/summary: Graham crackers good enough for Mommy to eat too!
review/text: I LOVE these graham sticks.  They dissolve well and are super yummy (yes, I have eaten quite a few of them:).  I think they taste better than any other graham cracker I've tried, and they're organic to boot.  As far as sugary snacks go, they have pretty healthy ingredients. I like pretty much everything I've tried from Earth's best.  For those of you interested in how they're sweetened they contain organic invert syrup, organic evaporated can juice, and organic honey.  They don't have anything "scary" in them like maltodextrin or other such sweeteners.  Just vitamins and natural, organic products.

review/summary: Taste and smell were intolerable.
review/text: I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them.

review/summary: OMG, What a life saver
review/text: I have a pure breed GSD and had problems for years with upset stomach, eating grass and throwing up bile in the morning and then would not eat as her stomach was too upset.  It finally dawned on me that due to throwing up bile in the am was that the food was not staying with her.  I even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work.  I tried Evo and I could not believe the change.  She does not get us up at night to go outside.  She was having 3-4 bowel movements every day and now she has 1 or sometimes 2.  I have had her on the Evo large bites for almost a year now and she has not been sick once.  It is the higher protein in this food that stays with her longer and has made all of our lives so much better.  Thank you, thank you EVO!!!

review/summary: So worth it!
review/text: We have a Golden Retriever and had been feeding him the Wellness dog food.  He ate it begrudgingly so we decided to find something else.  I read the ingredients on the Evo red meat and was really impressed.  I gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food isn't really a bargain if your dog won't eat it or get any enjoyment out of it.  The first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it- and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough!  I agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up.  He is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him, although I wish the price were a little more reasonable.

review/summary: Great Food!
review/text: I have been feeding my GSD the red meat formula for about 6 months and all I can say is WOW. Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment!

review/summary: Best food for your best friend
review/text: When I got my dog I did a lot of research regarding dog food and dog food ingredients. There are high quality dog foods like this one out there, but you probably won't find them in regular supermarkets. While this food may be more expensive than other dog foods, it is well worth it. Innova Evo is one of the foods that were NOT affected by the recall. Also, the ingredients are healthier, and don't have high wheat/grain content or nasty additives.<br /><br />My Doberman used to have a lot of dandruff and had some skin problems. Also her poop was really mushy, almost diarrhea. When I finally switched her to Innova Evo Red Meat I'd wished I'd done it sooner. She doesn't need to eat quite as much, and her coat is beautiful! No more dandruff problems and her skin is great.

review/summary: Perfect for the sporting dog
review/text: I have a 2 1/2 year old 60 pound German wirehair pointer.  We feed this food during hunting season due to his increased metabolic needs.  He burns so many calories, he eats 8 cups of this food a day (with zeal).  We use the large bites to help keep the tarter and plaque off of his teeth (and to slow his eating).  Due to the high quality of this food, he can keep up his energy, keep his weight up, and recover more quickly from scrapes/bumps from running the field.  Our vet's exact words were, "Your dog is an example of perfect health."  You may think the price on this food is high, but it is worth it.  You get what you pay for.  Also, consider the canned version of this food.  It is a nice way to feed/hydrate a dog after a long day hunting - just give them an hour to settle down first.  On a side note, we feed Diamond Naturals Beef and Rice in the off season.  We have no digestive issues transitioning from one to the other (we switch over a period of a few weeks).

review/summary: Excellent nutrition
review/text: Complete, protein-based nutrition.  My dogs love this...although I'm not sure the pibble actually tastes it, she inhales it so fast.  ;)<br /><br />Regarding the other users who have had diarrhea issues:  My gastro-picky GSD (is that a word? I think other GSD owners will understand!) has had this as well.  Initially, I overfed this food, thinking that he needed to be eating the same amount as he had been eating the other stuff.<br />You feed MUCH less of this product.  It is nutrient-dense, and not all filler like other foods.  If you over-feed, you increase the risk of unpleasant side effects.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey, and I haven't broken down the cost per day, but since you feed less it might be competitive with other brands if someone was inclined to "run the numbers".

No more brushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny.  We have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried.  It's pricey but we are able to feed them 1/2 of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight.  This food is well worth the price and the dogs love it.

review/text: My husband and I are not coffee drinkers, but we love hot chocolate. We hated the time it took to heat up the water,and the mess the dry mix sometimes makes. We saw that the Keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea, liked that it was almost instant hot water, and bought one. I ordered another brand of hot chocolate k-cup, and absolutely hated it. It had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately. I was worried I wasted my money on a maker I would never use. I decided to try another brand and purchased the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa, and we absolutely love it! It is sweet and chocolately without being too bitter(which is why I originally steered away from the dark chocolate). I fully recommend this product!!

I know it's not going to taste like the real thing, but after just three cups I can't bring myself to finishing the box. I think I'll just throw them out. Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced. This results in just a sweeter cup of hot water. Stick with coffee.

review/text: The hot chocolate K-Cups don't work like the coffe K-Cups.  The coffee K-Cups have a screen inside the cup to keep the coffee grounds in the K-Cup, it also makes the last drop of liquid to fall into your cup as much coffee as the first drip.  These Cafe Escape Hot Cocoa K-Cups don't have a screen the chocolate powder empties out of the K-Cup as fast as it can, so that the last amount of water to come out of the Keurig is mostly water and it sits on the top of your cup.  So STIR it before drinking it, otherwise all you taste is the sweetener.  Also these K-Cups are made for 8 oz serving size, so use the appropriate cup size for your taste.

And Swiss Miss isn't that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff.<br /><br />I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised.

My wife does NOT drink coffee (calls it "Yuck") and I am very particular about my coffee, BUT we agree that this is an absolutely delightful hot chocolate.

This chocolate comes in as a not so close second to some of the great hot chocolates we have had while traveling Europe, however this did save us airfare. But this is not at all bad for an instant cup of pleasure.  Adding marshmallows or topping with whipped cream would take it over the top.<br /><br />If you are one of the ones who wants to throw yours away, please send my way.  I will get rid of them for you.  Thanks!)<br /><br />I got this product directly from Keurig as one of my two free when I registered my new brewer and purchased two.

review/summary: Nasty watery drink
review/text: Just got a new keurig and immediately went on a search for<br />the best dark rich bold coffee (Caribou Mahogany) and other brands<br />with rich taste (Wolfgang is winning so far) but really wanted to find<br />the best hot cocoas and got these first...now trying to give them away.<br />The are even worse than the packaged kind you get in the stores. Actually,<br />I think I've found better instant ones. I hate to write a bad review but..if<br />you want to find a DELICIOUS cocoa mix in the K-cups...get the Grove (Station) brand<br />here on Amazon.  They are always sold out (which DUH I know why now as they are a far better<br />tasting brand) but if<br />you put your email on a wait list, they'll let you know when they come in and<br />you dont have to wait very long.  I'd stock up though, as you'll find you want a cup<br />or two every night! (and the dark, milk and peppermint combined box is the bomb!!)I just<br />sent a couple boxes out to a friend of mine who was complaining about how bad the k cup hot<br />chocolates were....she'll be thrilled to get my care package!!

review/summary: YUCK! -all sucralose flavor, no chocolate
review/text: Gross! I tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes.  The flavor is all fake sweetener (odd since sucralose is the last ingredient) and no dark chocolate.  I am bummed because now I have a box of these cups and don't want to drink them.

review/summary: Best golden berries I've ever had!
review/text: I tried this brand first and I must admit I became spoiled because subsequently I went to Whole Foods to try and buy a bunch more. I had to get Navitas and found they were smaller, drier and less flavorful. So here I am -- this brand's golden berries are large, with a wonderful more succulent texture. The only problem is sometimes I get the seeds stuck in my teeth! They have tiny white seeds like raspberries but the berry itself resembles a large golden raisin. The flavor is very strong and captivating -- like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry. Within days of incorporating golden berries into my diet I have noticed my insides are thanking me. Golden berries are naturally very anti-inflammatory. They have an addicting flavor that I will gladly continue to feed into.

Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamela's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix.

review/text: I read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person's taste could consistently receive five stars.  Is something suspicious here?<br /><br />Nope!  Here's the tenth five-star rating in a row, and I'm tough.  This is the best sauce of its kind (or any kind) I've ever had; and I'm an old guy who's been around.  Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness.  I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.<br /><br />These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure.  Absolutely more than worth worth the little price, this stuff should be standard in every home, along with plumbing.<br /><br />And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you.

review/text: I use this in my banquet kitchen for so many dishes.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and a pinch of heat.  If you toss chicken wings in it, you will have some great bar food in your own home!  Another idea: combine Sweet Chili sauce, heavy mayonnaise, granulated garlic, finely chopped parsely, ginger powder, and splash of siracha - this will give you a delicious sweet chili aoli perfect for burgers, sandwiches, egrolls, potstickers, fries, fish, or even chicken.  Like I said - it is good by itself, but serves as a great base for other things (from salad dressing to marinade).  Buy this sauce in bulk as you will find youself using it on everything!

review/summary: For a taste treat, substitute it for BBQ sauce
review/text: Once in a while you just want a spicy different flavor. Sometimes when I have a lightly seasoned or plain piece of beef or chicken, I put some Sweet Chili Sauce on my rice. Wow that perks up the whole plate. Other times I cook the meat without seasoning and add what every flavor I'm in the mood for when I reheat it. I've kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problem.<br /><br />If you have never tried this, the sauce is thicker than Heinz Ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you. Another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving.

review/text: The sauce was just fine. However, I can't resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy, in the hope that someone might be able to convince Amazon next time. The sauce comes in a pack of 2, but one bottle was broken. Yep, you guessed it, Amazon sent me a new pack of two, and asked me to return the unbroken original. It's only cost me a little time, but how much it's going to cost Amazon to ship and process that returned bottle, your guess is as good as mine. Is it REALLY beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle?

review/summary: Can't Afford a Trip to Thailand?
review/text: Here's a tiny consolation: easy Thai barbecued chicken! Cut your usual fryer in quarters, cook it slowly over charcoal or quickly in a hot oven, and then brush it generously with "sweet chili sauce" and cook it just a few minutes more. Most authentic with 'sticky' rice but also delicious with brown or red rice.<br /><br />In Thailand, people squat over hibachi-sized braziers on the sidewalks and sell portion of this sort of barbecued chicken. Sometimes they trot alongside inter-city buses as they pull into stations, and sell chicken through the windows. Don't be squeamish! This is a treat you'll remember. The same sauce will enhance the flavor of any fowl from blackbird to condor or whooping crane.

review/text: I was introduced to this sauce by a good friend of mine from Cambodia, who runs a Thai restaurant and bar.  I wondered what sauce was used in their ramikens when they served their delicious crispy spring rolls.  Their actual sauce was handmade, but I was directed to try this brand.  Since then, (about 5 yrs ago) my mother, friends, and I have all used this sauce on fried chicken wings, grilled and sauteed chicken, pork, spring/egg rolls, and even sushi!  I keep the large 25 oz bottle in my fridge year-round, and this is the best brand I've used thus far.  Not too hot for those not accustomed to very spicy foods, but is mostly sweet.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!! :o)

review/summary: Mae Ploy Sauce is GREAT STUFF!
review/text: I first tasted this sauce when I was visiting in Alaska.  It was served with fish tacos, and was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered it from Amazon.  It's available for a reasonable price, and is wonderful with fish, pork and chicken.  I haven't tried it on beef, but not sure if it would be good or not.  It's also terrific on vegetables.  I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Pei Wei, PF Changs, now my house
review/text: If you have ever wondered what that delicious dipping sauce for the crab wontons are at pei wei, or the amazing sauce on Chang's chicken is, this is it!<br /><br />I love this stuff.  I discovered it while at a pei wei someone had left a bottle of this laying out and I quick snapped a picture, took it to amazon and found it. It is great on pretty much everything, as previous users say.  I was also in a Thai restaurant the other night and they used the same sauce on an amazing salad.  Try this on a do it yourself salad consisting of sliced mangos, lettuce, onions, and red peppers.  Drench those ingredients in this stuff and everyone will think your a master chef.

review/text: This is the BEST!<br />Years ago, I used it & loved it! Moved & could not find it again. I have purchased many hot/sweet sauces over the years, trying to find this flavor. Recently, I found it again at World Market....now I'm addicted! Everyone has mentioned great ways to use it.<br />My favorite....I use it on my salads, along with a little fat-free dressing. Now, I eat tasty salads every day, (without the cheese!).<br /><br />Sodium is 200 mg per tablespoon....and the amount of added flavor is worth every mg!

review/summary: Highly Addicting!
review/text: I did not purchase this product off of Amazon. I purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store, and I must say it's one of the most addicting sauces I have ever had! I'm a pretty picky eater, and a vegetarian at that, so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. This sauce is ALMOST perfect. It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear "skin" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce. I don't care where or how, just buy it. You'll fall in love!

review/summary: Just Okay, Too Sweet
review/text: I was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews, but it's nothing special. For my taste, it's way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough (even my kids agree). It reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. But if you're more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking.

Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters.

review/summary: Easy Indian cookingat home
review/text: Patak's sauces have many uses but I always make a basic chicken curry.  A friend from India taught this recipe to me, and now I always have a jar or two on hand.  If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles/relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3-4 adults.  I always make at least a double batch; it's just as easy and that way I have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat.  You can use any rice, but basmati is so fragrant that it is what I prefer.  Some Indian groceries have frozen Naan you can heat in the oven for an even more satisfying dinner.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1-1 � lbs chicken breast cut into 1-2" cubes<br />1 cup nonfat plain yogurt<br />Salt<br />3 tbs Patak's curry paste, flavor/heat depending on your taste<br /><br />1 (generous) tsp cumin seed<br />1 (generous) tsp mustard seed<br />1 small onion diced<br />3 cloves garlic diced<br />2 medium potatoes, diced same size as chicken cubes<br />2-3 carrots, diced same size as chicken cubes<br />1 14 oz can diced tomatoes with juice<br />� cup frozen peas<br />2-3 tbsp cooking oil<br />Salt to taste<br /><br />1. Add chicken yogurt, curry paste and about � tsp salt to a bowl; mix thoroughly and let marinate while you prepare vegetables<br />2. Heat oil in large frying pan over medium heat until hot<br />3. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds, stir.  They are ready when mustard seeds start to pop.  Do not let them burn.<br />4. Add onion and garlic.  Saute until soft.  Stir constantly or else it will burn.<br />5. Add carrots and potatoes.  Saute until potatoes are just about ready to eat.  You have to stir very frequently or they will stick/burn.  I do not let anything caramelize.<br />6. Add chicken/yogurt mixture.  Saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through.  Lower heat to low.<br />7. Add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit, and chicken is cooked through.<br />8. Add peas for color.  Add salt to taste.<br />9. Serve over freshly cooked basmati rice.  Remember to soak the basmati rice prior to cooking or it will be hard.

review/summary: My favorite tea of all time
review/text: I first drank this tea at Naniboujou Lodge on the North Shore of Minnesota, and bought a small packet up there. I was hooked, so after I had drunk the first bit I bought I wanted to get more of this tea ASAP. Was glad to see it for sale in such a high quantity here. I used to be a coffee drinker, but I much prefer tea -- specifically, Ashbys Afternoon Tea -- now, and I just gave away a bag of coffee I'll never drink. I never quite got why British people are so into tea, but -- whether this is a typical British tea or not, I don't know -- I now see why they'd build their afternoons around a high-quality tea like this one. Sublime.
