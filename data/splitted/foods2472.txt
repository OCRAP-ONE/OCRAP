review/summary: Not fresh
review/text: I was very disappointed with this tea, it didn't taste fresh.  It was not delivered in an air tight container and the leaves have very low fragrance and the brewed tea has a poor weak taste.  I felt the decaf teas from Taylor's of Harrogate and Clipper were significantly better.

review/summary: Do you miss Roman Meal Cream of Rye?  This is close.
review/text: Until a couple of years ago, the Roman Meal company distributed a flaked rye cereal called Cream of Rye.  I liked it a lot, and it was a nice break from oatmeal.  It disappeared from stores.<br /><br />This product is pretty close, but not quite there.  The flakes are not as fine as Cream of Rye, and perhaps there was some extra treatment for the Cream of Rye.<br /><br />But if you grind this for a moment or two in a spice grinder, you have something that will do until they bring back Cream of Rye.

review/summary: Tastes great, wish it were healthier!
review/text: "Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Polysorbate 60"<br /><br />It's really good cocoa, and I make it every morning for my husband (he won't drink coffee); we even bring it along on vacation so he can have it. I just wish that list of poisons above weren't included.  I've suggested to Land-o-Lakes that they make a ... "Sweet Nothings" version or whatever they want to call it:  a *totally* unsweetened version, so we can add whatever sweetener we wish to add.<br /><br />The corn syrup is unhealthy in the extreme; the 'partially hydrogenated' means trans fats (and soy is *not* healthy, contrary to the "common" "wisdom"), and the polysorbate has been shown in cosmetics to cause problems (and why is a cosmetics ingredient in a food item?!).<br /><br />That said (er... written), until someone comes up with a healthy product that tastes as good as this stuff does, he's gonna keep drinking these poisons every morning. {sigh}

review/summary: Supreme Chocolate Makes My Heart Sing!
review/text: Instead of creamer and sugar, I add a packet of this to my eight ounces of freshly ground coffee each morning! For a mere 140 calories, I enter bliss! Comparable, both in yummy-ness and nutritionally, to a whole milk Starbucks Mocha Frappuccinoï¿½, this Supreme Chocolate mix comes in at 3 grams of saturated fat (30 calories, 14% DV, from hydrogenated soybean oil and coconut oil), 0 trans fat, and 24 grams of sugars (sugar and corn syrup solids). As for price, since I live three hours from the nearest Wal-Mart, the shipped price is actually a little better than I would pay locally, and it arrives practically overnight. The entire box of 72 packets is only 7"x7"x18", and consists of six smaller display type boxes of twelve packets each. These 6"x7"x3.5" display boxes will tuck neatly into the smallest kitchen upper cabinets, and will maintain the individually wrapped single serving packets in a neat upright position. All in all, this is a big luxury for a little price, which is something that makes my heart sing!

review/summary: An Excellent Cup of Hot Chocolate!!
review/text: Being a hot cocoa lover as I am, it's hard to believe I've never tried Land O Lakes Supreme Hot Chocolate until I received it as part of a gift basket. I must say, it was one of the best cups of hot chocolate I've had in a long time.<br />I've tried soooo many different brands....from the most expensive to the least expensive. This ranks up in my top 3...which is a hard place to get to in my eyes (or taste buds?).<br />At approximately $0.40 a serving, this is a great deal.<br />You'll find this hot cocoa rich in taste and quite creamy as well...even though it's simply made with hot water.<br />Make sure you follow the instructions on the packet....6 oz. of water per packet.<br />Go ahead...try it...you won't be disappointed!

review/text: This cocoa dissolves in a nice way without a lot of chocolate clumps at the bottom of the mug. The cinnamon flavor has a 'cozy' aroma/taste. There are several other delicious Land O Lakes cocoa flavors including French Vanilla, Supreme, and Caramel. It's yummo in my tummo ( I find myself saying this a lot when I'm drinking it!). Several months a year the elementary school fundraising company called Market Day features a large box of Land O Lakes cocoa (assortment of flavors) for a much lower cost than in most grocery stores.

If you ever need something to keep you awake through a boring lecture or some other mundane task, just carry a bunch of these and pop one into you mouth the second you feel your head slumping. You could definitely taste the ginger. Also heads up, it tends to stick to the wrapper at the corners, so if you don't want your neighbor asking you for some open it it your book bag or something along those lines.

review/text: I've had a recipe for Fattoush Salad for years.  Every once in a while, usually after making a batch of pita bread I'd think about Fattoush and wonder where I could find Sumac (one of the essential and authentic ingredients).  Finally, it occurred to me that I could order it, online!  Duh!  Sometimes I'm slow, so then I looked around, a lot of the other vendors on here were offering truly hugemongous amounts of Sumac and my recipe calls for just one teaspoon, what would I do with a pound?<br /><br />Also, I wasn't sure if I would like the taste of sumac.  The descriptions I read for it said it was 'lemon-y, but not bitter, sherbet-y (sherbet flavored herbs??) anyways, I just couldn't be sure if it would be tasty to me and I wasn't willing to risk much on a bottle of herbs that I might end up tossing.<br /><br />Well, from the moment I opened the bottle, I knew I liked sumac.  It is a little citrus-y smelling, but I also recognized the smell, it is mouth puckeringly familiar, it smells like A-1 Steak Sauce to me, or rather, the one ingredient I could never completely identify, tart, savory with a fruity punch.  I don't mean to go all smarmy-foodie about this, but I am feeling rather enthusiastic about this, new-to-me, spice.<br /><br />Okay, so onto product packaging. my spice came in a plastic bottle, not a resealable bag.  The bottle was sealed and the seal was unbroken.

review/summary: A divine little berry, for every kitchen
review/text: I was unfamiliar with Sumac until I started experimenting with Middle Eastern cuisine. I didn't even know that it is actually a ground berry, or how popular it is as a spice. I stumbled upon a tempting recipe for Fattoush. I knew I had to give it a try, but success depended on the integral ingredient --- ground Sumac. I began my search locally, to no avail, but Amazon's gourmet pantry came to the rescue.<br /><br />I know how much 4 oz is, but I was surprised at the nice quantity of product I received. It was plenty for me to begin to play with and complete many dishes. But, I was unsure of what I was getting myself into.  Would I like it?  First I had to taste a little dab on my finger.  I immediately recognized the taste sensation from some of my dining out experiences, because of the uniqueness of the flavor --- one hard to describe, but very pleasing. I was glad to finally have identified just what that flavor was.<br /><br />Totally enthused, I immediately gathered items to prepare Fattoush. It was simply prepared and just as fantastic as I had hoped. Afterward, I began experimenting with multiple food items. This is a spice that can go cross-cultural.  It kicks popcorn up a notch, and is even delicious on a baked potato, or sprinkled on deviled-eggs for a twist, instead of typical Paprika. And, be prepared, it might be a conversation starter with friends and family who have never experienced the flavor.<br /><br />I can see Sumac becoming my go-to spice, for taste enhancement of many foods.  And, you don't need to have all the fixings for Fattoush, to have a delectable salad.  Just use your favorite salad ingredients, drizzle with a little quality olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, and sprinkle with Sumac. Perfect! The Sumac just seems to enhance all the other flavors.  And, it's sure healthier than drowning that salad in a quarter cup of Ranch dressing.  Yes, it's a spice that every kitchen, and diet, could benefit from. Give it a try, and enjoy.

review/summary: Mycodex Plus Enviromental Household Spray
review/text: My daughter has moved into an older home that is a rental.  She and her roommate have 2 dogs.  This spring has been unusually warm and it appears that the dogs may have fleas.<br /><br />After vaccuuming, applying flea protection to the dogs, and spraying the carpet and furniture with Mycodex, the fleas seem to be gone.  One can did cover the square footage that was listed on the can.<br /><br />Time will tell how effective everything has worked but the itching and scratching are gone and everyone seems much healthier!

review/summary: Cat won't go near........
review/text: I used the Mycodex Plus on furniture and baseboards for a dog and cat flea infestation.  One of the items I sprayed was a 6 foot tall cat tower with 5 perches.  The cat won't go on it now.  I have tried cat-nip to entice her but she still won't have anything to do with it.  I would like any suggestions that anyone might have.  It is a rather expensive piece of useless furniture now.....none of us can sit on it!!

review/summary: Mycodex Plus Environmental Control Aerosol Household Spray
review/text: Very effective at getting rid of indoor flea problem (moderate severity) in the Midwest.  Light smell - less intense & less chemically smell than Raid Flea Killer Plus Room & Carpet Spray.  Do not yet know how well this product works on eliminating fleas long term as it's only been a couple of weeks.  Dog had no problem using his dog bed after his bed was sprayed & aired.<br /><br />If you need a fine mist & are covering a small area (e.g., just pet bed/furniture), this spray nozzle could be better (Raid Flea Killer Plus nozzle allows for more even mist as per instructions).  The sprayer of my first can was defective squirting splatters/gobs of foam randomly rather than a mist (e.g., splattering foam gobs onto the walls 10 inches away rather than the carpet even while can was pointed down at the ground).  Had to get a 2nd can (the seller sent new can right away at no charge).  I prefer the flea spray for covering carpets, rooms & pet furniture to the flea powder/granules as some people experience breathing issues from the fine airborne particles of the powder/granules long after vacuuming.

The blend of herbs (peppermint, chamomile, fennel, thyme, Iceland moss, licorice root, lungwort, star anise, marigold, yarrow root, elder flowers, lime leaves, cyani flowers, cowslip, mullein flowers, malva flowers) and oils (Peppermint and Eucalyptus) is soothing and comforting. I have used this tea for our family for the past 4 yrs, and it's been the only tea that has brought relief. It melts in your cup so there is no tea bag to deal with.

review/summary: Excellent quality AND Price!!
review/text: I believe this product is of equal quality of some the Italian imported Semolina flours. I am one who does NOT use egg nor white flour to mix in my pasta dough and I find this semolina to be extremely pliable. Not to mention the price here! I love the Italian-imported flours but it becomes way too costly because of the shipping. The fact that Amazon is offering FOUR BAGS of this flour for just over $12 is a steal!!! I live in New York, and when you want a high quality product, you usually end up having to go to a foo-foo upscale gourmet store where you'll end up paying an arm & a leg. I found a 1 lb bag of semolina for roughly $6.00...absurdity! I think this is one of the items where I'll take advantage of the re-order feature because it's simply more economically effective considering I don't want to purchase manufactured pasta anymore. Can't say enough about the quality of this flour...really all I use in my dough is semolina, water, salt and a tbsp of olive oil- makes perfectly flavorful, delicious pasta!!

review/text: I think this made the best homemade pasta we've ever made.  At least that is what my children told me.  We had so much fun fixing an enormous batch of pasta together.  We split the flour types that were used: 2/3 semolina, and 1/3 regular white unbleached flour.  It keeps the price a little lower, however purchased in bulk this way was a very cost effective way to have the good pasta.  This flour was approximately $3 per 24 oz package through amazon when I bought it, the EXACT package was $5.79 at our grocery store.

review/summary: Bobs Red Mill Semolina
review/text: The Bobs Red Mill semolina flour was ok. I was to use it in my pasta maker. I think I didn't let it mix well enough or something because it seemed a little to dry to push the pasta through. It ended up getting clogged and actually popped of my extruding disc. I used regular flour instead of the semolina and that came out perfect. I think  I just need to play with the ratio of egg to flour a little more next time. The pasta machine is a Simac Pastamatic MX 700. It's a wonderful machine and I haven't had any trouble except for the one time. I will try to remember to update this the next time I try the semolina again.

A friend brought me a box from Boston and said it was delicious but hard to find.  I was delighted to discover that I could find it on-line (and for less than standard varieties are sold in the supermarket). Not only is it organic, but it has no artificial flavors so the peach taste is very subtle and delicious.  Some of my other St. Dalfour favorites include the lemon, strawberry, green golden mango and green mandarine orange. Highly recommended.

Lots of tomato sauce, but very lightly salted so that their taste is very delicate. The flavors of the tomato and fish are nicely balanced. These water-packed fish don't have a lot of the punch of some of their saltier, oil-packed cousins, which can leave my tongue wanting a bit more, but overall these are great fish.

And not at all like cheap candy. No, this is rich decadent creamy sweet gooey butterscotch. The matcha base keeps it from being too heavy and sickly-sweet, it's the perfect balance of health and decadence.

review/summary: Sweet Sinful Delight - No Guilt!
review/text: If you love butterscotch hard candies then this is the matcha for you! Its my new secret sinful delight! This is EXACTLY like those butterscotch hard candies from childhood!<br /><br />I think if I had to pick one matcha that I would never share with others this would have to be the one. Although there are so many I have yet to try I think so far this is my favorite. I just made myself laugh though because I have said that with almost every new matcha from Red Leaf Tea I have tried. Seriously though, this is so very yummy, and sweet, and just really the one that I feel will always hit the spot for me! What is even more cool is that when I mix it in my latte concoction - which is how I usually have my matcha, the butterscotch flavor comes out even more and is not by any means hidden underneath the milk or vanilla creamer!<br /><br />I always do try matcha straight before mixing it in my latte and I will say that the butterscotch flavor is stronger in the latte mixture than straight which I found interesting and odd at the same time.<br /><br />I don't know how Red Leaf does it but their flavors are all natural and while I certainly appreciate the health benefits to matcha I am finding I reach for it more and more simply for the flavor but I can't deny the excellent energy boost! Its like an energy drink without all the sugar which means you don't come down and fall on your face later in the day! This is a different kind of energy boost, one that makes you more alert and on the ball and it does not end abruptly finding yourself feeling lower than before you had the drink as energy drinks do. This trails off nicely and in a mellow fashion allowing you to ease into the afternoon or evening!<br /><br />I am now drinking at least one matcha per day, after my morning black tea!

review/summary: So buttery...
review/text: Butterscotch is another one of those flavors that I adore. Butterscotch anything is pretty much a guarantee I buy it. I love the rich buttery-ness of it. In my drinking days, butterscotch schnapps was my go-to drink. I love it. Mix it with a bit of milk or hot cocoa...oh yes. The best, though, is around the holidays, mix a touch of it into egg nog. Ooooh, now that's an idea, egg nog matcha. Red Leaf Tea, I will love you forever if you develop an egg nog matcha by the holidays! I can't have real nog any more, so I've been hunting for a good tea substitute.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. Butterscotch is love for me. It's another Dad memory, he loves it and it makes me think of him...or maybe I'm just homesick this week. Butterscotch pudding is the only pudding I'll touch and if an ice cream shop offers butterscotch topping, I'll risk the dairy allergy to get a cone covered in the stuff. Liquid gold, it is. And seeing the success of Red leaf Tea's Caramel and French Vanilla flavors, I have complete confidence in this blend being amazing. I think this definitely calls for a hot tea latte, despite it being stupidly hot outside. Am I in Toronto or back in Tennessee? These hot days are killing me...I should be able to handle them better!<br /><br />No, I went for a cold matcha instead, it's too hot out there to bother with hot drinks, though this one was made to be enjoyed hot. Hot with a touch of rum and milk. Mmm...anyway. Yes. Cold, it's less than stellar, but it's still yummy. Very buttery and rich, but not too rich. I want to sip on this all day, but I need to save some for when it's cool enough to be able to handle a hot drink. It does taste like candy, but it's not overwhemingly sweet. It's just tasty.  I'm not wowed by it like I am with some of their other blends, though. This one's good, but I need to try it a few more times before I decide if I'm going to keep it on my shelf or not. Perhaps a warmer water temperature will help, or a better ratio of tea to water. Still, it won't be hard at all to convince myself to drink this one! I might even be convinced to share it.

review/text: If you like Nougat and Almonds, then this is your sweet of choice!  I remember these delicious little treats from my childhood.  Whenever my parents would take us for Italian food, they would bring one nougat for each of us at the end of the meal.  As a child i loved being able to open the little box for my own treat.<br /><br />I ordered a couple of boxes to share with my family, especially the grandkids and they loved them and i have to say that after all these years, i was not disappointed, they were just as yummy as i remember!

review/summary: Nostalgic Christmas
review/text: My Italian paternal grandmother used to mail a box of Torrones to each of her children and their families every Christmas.  It was a tradition, and all the cousins and I anxiously awaited Nana's annual gift of these yummy nougat candies.  She passed away 20 years ago, and every year Dad and I talked about how we missed Nana's Torrones.  I was so surprised and pleased to find them available on Amazon!  I ordered a box as a special surprise Christmas gift for my Dad when he visited this Christmas....he was so happy, there were tears in his eyes.  We ate a few together, and through a chorus of mmmmMMMMMs, we agreed that these tasted just like the ones Nana used to send.  Thanks, Amazon!

review/text: This is a candy from my childhood- light, nutty, fruity, flavorful. It used to be available locally in stores.  Since moving to Florida, I now have to buy it over the internet. Not sure if this is due to a change in the times or the difference in location. It was a special treat, but not just on holidays.  I now put it in the toe of my children's Xmas stockings so that they can appreciate it too.

review/text: I was concerned that since I was ordering these online they wouldn't be as fresh as I'm used to. Boy, was I wrong. These were just as fresh and soft as when I buy them at the Italian store.<br /><br />If you've never had torrone, it is a square of soft white nougat filled with roasted almonds. The top and bottom is covered in a thin wafer (like the kind used for Communion) that keeps your fingers from getting sticky. This pack has three flavors: vanilla (which is the traditional), orange (which I think is the most delicious), and lemon. Each piece is individually wrapped in a foil pouch and boxed.

review/text: I am so glad I stumbled upon this delectable treat at the TJ Maxx in a depressing south Georgia shopping mall.  I had never had marzipan before and let me tell, it is now on my short list of tastiest treats.  This new flavor sensation in conjunction with dark chocolate, which I already loved, creates such a delicious combination in my mouth that I feel I've wasted so many good years of my life in ignorance.  If I had known how much I would enjoy this chocolate bar, I would've bought more than one.  I would've bought a dozen at least!  Maybe even a baker's dozen!  I only hope that I can track down a brick and mortar establishment that carries this wonderful delicacy in my city, because them shipping charges is rough.

It's the flavor of the last unwanted chocolate in a Whitmans sampler box, the one that you might find half a chocolate of, cuz' the person who bit it yesterday said "Bleh" and tossed the other half back in the box. Its just nasty. Go with the White Chocolate Hazelnut or Dark Chocolate Hazelnut instead.

I've had other brands of Sumatra, which is normally a stronger coffee, but this was just awful... like the brown water that diners try to pass off as coffee.

review/summary: An exquisite cookie!
review/text: Mother's Cookies have been around forever here on the west coast.  I didn't even know they were gone for awhile (due to financial problems I understand).  I am glad Kellogg's bought the company and brought them back.  I recently tried the Vanilla Creme cookie not knowing what to expect.  I was used to the Circus Animals and their delicious chocolate chip cookie over the years since I was a child.  Their Vanilla Creme cookie is just out of this world and makes me glad I have a mouth!  That's how good they are.  It is an exquisite cookie.  No coffee or tea should be served to company without these.  Your friends will wonder what they are and where they come from!<br /><br />In addition to being a great tasting cookie I love the design and texture of the cookie.  I feel really regal when I eat them.  I introduced these to the whole family and I got everyone eating them.  The local supermarket had a sale on them at two dollars a package and I ended up buying seven of them.<br /><br />If you like the taste of vanilla and are looking for a good cookie to try or just plain like cookies, you won't be disappointed with these!<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted to write a review for Mother's English Tea cookie but apparently Amazon has all the reviews linked to all Mother's cookies products and will only accept one review.<br /><br />I wanted to write that that English Tea cookie by Mother's is just as good as the Vanilla Cremes.  I am not sure but I thought I detected a slight banana flavor but very subtle.  They certainly don't taste like vanilla but they are a really good cookie.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s Mother's Cookies used to put out a variety pack and that's how I discovered their delicious chocolate chip cookie.  It has a chocolate chip taste so different than any other chocolate chip cookie I've eaten.<br /><br />I understand Mother's cookies are hard to find for much of the country except on the west coast.  The fact that Amazon sells them is a good thing.  So if you're wondering if you should give them a try, please believe me, they're all high quality cookies and taste great regardless if they become a favorite or not.  I am very fussy when it comes to food but Mother's cookies are so delicious that I am working my way to try every cookie they offer.  Vanilla Creme is by far my favorite.  As a side note, if your cookies should arrive crumbled or broken, it's the responsibility of the buyer to contact Amazon and complain.  Amazon has friendly customer service and will correct the problem if you complain.

review/text: I do not usually eat sweets, as I find most American made desserts too sweet for me. However, these cookies are just so delicious that I cannot put them down! I love how the frosting is not just sugar, but also has a butter cream vanilla taste. It tastes like cake. The sprinkles add just the right amount of crunchiness before you bite into the entire cookie. As you chew, the cookie turns into a mouth watering sweet buttery cake dough. This is why I need to watch myself and count the cookies as I eat, to prevent over eating! Though they all taste the same, I am personally more attracted to the pink ones =) So glad I can get these cookies at Wal-mart!<br />I do not recommend buying this online, just because when it gets hot, the cookies tend to stick together. It is annoying having a double-cookie because they will not separate without breaking. Also, always store in a cookie place! Enjoy your cookies =) Thanks for reading!

review/summary: Mother's Sack-of-Fat Cookies [Caveat Emptor]
review/text: The English Tea and Peanut Butter Gaucho cookies, by Mother's, are probably the best tasting sandwich cookies I've ever eaten. However, this nirvana of the cookie munching experience, comes at a pretty hefty price. As I was gleefully polishing off the first bag, I happened to glance at the nutritional stats on the back. To my astonishment and horror, I found that just two cookies delivered 2.5 grams of saturated fat, 2 grams of trans fat, and a whopping 180 calories! For this reason, I removed one rating star and won't be purchasing these again, until this problem is resolved. C'mon Kelloggs, get yer 'stuff' in one bag and cut the trans fat! Sure, the saturated fat content is rather high, but the trans fat is not only unacceptable, it is entirely unnecessary. These cookies could easily be baked with lighter oils like canola, sunflower, or safflower. If you truly must, buy these cookies at your own risk, or better still, fear for your poor arteries and beg-off! [English Tea - 5, Peanut Butter Gauchos - 5, Iced Lemonade - 4, Iced Oatmeal - 3]

We tried these cookies & thought they were delicious -- small, bite-size tasty cookies w/o too many chips like Chips A;Hoy, etc. When we got back to Cleveland, Ohio, I tried to find them at our local drug stores. Eventually, I found out they are not available east of the Mississippi. ...Really obsessing over a chocolate chip cookie, I found them on a site called 'foodlocker.com'. But after Katrina, they were put out of order (that's unfortunate). One day a few years later, I thought I'd search Amazon, & my cookie-journey had a happy ending. I just wish Mom was still with us to enjoy.
