review/summary: Interesting blend
review/text: My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct "earl grey" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.

review/summary: The Best Chai...
review/text: I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!

review/summary: Superb Green Tea, Organic, Excellent!
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I've finished drinking 2 of the 6 boxes of Lavender Tulsi Herbal tea. I like this herbal tea as I enjoy the taste of lavender and am glad that the lavender is mixed with another herb as straight lavender can taste quite strong. I'm not sure I like the flavor of tulsi, but I guess it isn't so bad mixed in with the lavender.

review/summary: a bit disappointed...
review/text: I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!

review/text: I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new "everyday" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days.

review/summary: Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it.

review/summary: Bitter Green Tea
review/text: First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit "add to cart" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought "oh, boy" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The "burnt" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .

review/summary: This tastes like CINNAMON OIL, not a traditional chai blend
review/text: Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed.

review/summary: This is a staple at my house
review/text: I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of "tea time," where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic "bite" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the "subscribe & save" option, this is an especially good deal.

review/summary: So relaxing
review/text: I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes. I was so glad to find that the tea mostly tastes like a stronger chamomile tea,  but smells like lavender. The best of both worlds!

review/summary: It is good tea.
review/text: I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.<br />I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills.

review/summary: Would not order again
review/text: I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment.

review/text: I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*

review/summary: Excellent Mellow Tea, Hot or Cold
review/text: This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet.

review/summary: Lovely Green Tea
review/text: I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil.

review/text: THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality.

review/summary: My 'everyday' tea. :c)
review/text: I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)

review/summary: Time for Tea!
review/text: I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too.

review/summary: Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green
review/text: I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.

Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!

Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again.

review/summary: Cuppa Green
review/text: Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are "watered down" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.

review/summary: Handy to have in fridge
review/text: I found this in a local supermarket, not all carry it.  I would buy it on Amazon if I didn't have to pay double the price b/c of shipping...but if you can find this at a price that is palatable, I'd try it.  It is a mix of parsley, basil, and oregano.  I have no parsley in my garden now b/c it's so hot, so I used a few healthy squeezes of this paste in a butter/olive oil/white wine base for steamed mussels, mariniere style. It did the trick, gave some nice green flecks for eye appeal and tasted good.  It's a quick way to add that little something extra to flavor a dish or finish a recipe.

Which means they are the best cookie ever made. Love from a jealous mother.

Everyone thought they were great, though a couple of my children found the salt & cracked pepper to be a bit too "spicy."  I love that these are lower in fat and high in protein.  They are a great alternative to chips.  We enjoyed them so much I tried to find them in stores, but I couldn't find them anywhere.  That's why I love amazon.com!

review/summary: Need salt!
review/text: I first bought these lentil chips in a health food store, and my whole family loved them. They were a bit pricey, so I researched and purchased them by the case from Amazon. Unfortunately, this time they were lacking the "sea salt" they advertise, and were not as tasty as the previous bags I purchased. I still like them, as long as I eat them with a dip of some type...hummus, bean dip, etc., vs. just alone. I did purchase them again, thinking they might be better, but so far, again they are pretty bland. They're a healthy snack, but I probably won't order them again.

review/summary: Disappointing on every level
review/text: Purchased the cucumber dill lentil chips with high hopes, especially after reading the reviews.  I wanted a snack chip made from something other than white flour or potatoes, and lentils are healthy, & cucumber dill sounded like a great combination.  However, they were disappointing on all levels.  First, the flavoring is sparse, some of the chips have a coating of the seasoning, some have a small amount of seasoning and many don't have any seasoning at all.  They are very bland w/o the seasoning.  Second, the ingredients!  Lentils?  Yes, but...here's the ingredient list in order, bean flour (lentil, garbanzo & adzuki beans) that's good, but the next ingredients are POTATO and/or pea starch & POTATO fiber, then oil and seasonings.  These are lentil chips, NOT potato chips.  Why is it all these "healthy" other grain, multi-grain snacks always have potatoes in them?  Serving size is 22 chips, 110 calories, 3 grams fat, 19 carbs & 3 fiber.  But the flavor is so disappointing, can' even tell they're cucumber dill for the most part, and the price is a little high for styrofoam chips.

review/summary: Just not as good as from the store
review/text: I first purchased these chips at my local convenience store, and I was blown away by the taste.  I have never been a fan of potato chips in the first place, and after I went gluten-free I was looking for a suitable substitute in my snacking diet for pita chips.  The moment I tasted these (and shared them with a friend who CAN tolerate gluten), we both swore then and there that we would eat these instead of whatever other junk food is available to us.  A month later, we found ourselves going through two or three of them a week, so the next logical step for us was to buy in bulk.<br /><br />What a disappointment that was.  At a little less than $36, the box of 12 is no cheaper than buying 12 bags individually from the company's website.  And in the bulk box, the product has an undesirable tendency to settle--the dusting of salt just sits on the bottom of the bag, encouraging me to eat it out of the bag upside down.  And for some reason there seems to be slightly less salt in the bulk package than there was in the individually purchased ones.<br /><br />The final straw that has discouraged me completely from buying the chips in bulk is that out of the 12 bags I received, all of them had a few overcooked chips, and at least 7 of them had one or two completely blackened, burnt chips.  Fortunately, despite their uncanny resemblance to blue corn chips, they were just overdone and still gluten-free.  Don't get me wrong--despite the overcooked chips and the low salt content, the chips were still good, on their own or with a dip, but they weren't fantastic like those in the individual packages.<br /><br />The general feeling I get from this package of 12 is just that the company is trying to get rid of its excess stock of chips that did not quite pass the more exacting standards of the individual packages.  And since it isn't even more expensive to buy those, I would highly recommend you steer clear of the bulk pack on this one.

Great substitute for chips and such which are just empty calories and impossible to eat only a few. I am pretty sure the lentil chips have some nutritional value as well..... and they don't taste like you are eating styrofoam like some of the rice cakes out there.

review/summary: Unpleasant flavor and texture - Cucumber Dill
review/text: I grabbed these because they were on a stand close to the cash register, they were gluten free, and I was hungry. I adore lentils and I love cucumber and dill. They sounded perfect.<br /><br />In my hurry I forgot to check the ingredients. As soon as I opened the bag I realized my mistake. An overpowering odor of sour cream, a flavor I find repugnant, greeted my nose. I tried one just to be fair, but all I could taste was sour cream with a hint of dill. The texture was unpleasant too--foamy--kind of like one of those biodegradable foam peanuts had been flattened out and crisped up.<br /><br />The offending ingredient, as far as I can tell, is buttermilk. I understand why chip makers put this buttermilky/sour creamy flavor in their ranch and sour cream & onion chips. I don't understand why it's in so many others, nacho cheese, cheddar cheese, cucumber dill. About the only safe flavor anymore is salt & vinegar.<br /><br />I wish I could get my money back because there is no way I'm going to eat these and I'm pretty sure my family won't like them either. Too bad I didn't happen upon the sea salt flavor that everyone seems to like, because these were pretty terrible.

review/summary: Great but only ten episodes!
review/text: Season 2 of Jake & the Fatman was great but there were only ten episodes, less than half as many as would normally be made. This was due to the 1988 writers strike, along with a union strike by workers in Hawaii, a sort of double-whammy. For this reason, I would definitely not pay top dollar for Season 2, great though it is.
