review/summary: MY VERY FAVORITE PEANUT BUTTER
review/text: I HAD A BIT OF A PROBLEM DURING MY SINUS SURGERY IN 2009.  THE SURGEON USED COCAINE TO STOP THE BLEEDING.  I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK DUE TO THE COCAINE MAKING MY HEART BEAT SO FAST, AND SPENT 2 WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL.  NOW I'M ON COUMADIN..FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.  YAY.  THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS YOU CAN'T EAT WHEN YOU'RE ON THIS MEDICATION.<br /><br />A FUNNY THING HAPPENED WHEN I STARTED TAKING COUMADIN, I STARTED CRAVING PEANUT BUTTER.  ONLY JIF REDUCED FAT SMOOTH PEANUT BUTTER.  I EAT IT EVERY DAY.  I JUST LOVE IT AND I NEVER GET TIRED OF EATING IT.  I'M GLAD IT'S GOOD FOR ME TOO.  I HAVE PUT AWAY SEVERAL CASES OF THIS STUFF..OK, IT'S MORE THAN SEVERAL, BUT I JUST FOUND OUT THE PRICE OF PEANUT BUTTER IS ABOUT TO GO UP DUE TO THE DROUGHT.  WELL, AT LEAST I WON'T STARVE.<br /><br />I DID WANT TO TELL ABOUT THE SINUS SURGERY, BECAUSE IF THERE IS ANYONE OUT THERE THAT'S CONSIDERING ANY KIND OF SURGERY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO MENTION THE COCAINE THING TO YOUR SURGEON IF YOU HAVE A PROBEM WITH STIMULATES.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE..THIS IS THE BEST DARN PEANUT BUTTER IN THE WORLD, IN MY OPINION.

review/text: This reduced fat peanut butter taste good, but probably because its so high in sugar.  I didn't realize the high sugar content and high fructose corn syrup until I received it.  I also ordered some sunland natural peanut butter that contains sugar but no high fructose corn syrup.  In the future I'll avoid the high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oils too which this product contains both.

review/summary: Outrageously delicious ... Bursting with flavors
review/text: I looked for other products by this company (Living Tree) because I was very impressed with their almond butter and tahini. I wasn't totally sure how I would like this but was looking for things that could work as *healthy* light snacks throughout the day.  So I knew this would be healthy because of Living Tree's commitment to quality ... but I did not know it would be this outrageously delicious! I had to read the jar after my first bites because I could not exactly place this amazing blend of flavors that happen in every bite.  It's a dense pesto, more paste like , not like a sauce or liquid.  The base is lush sun-dried tomato flavor, which also gives it a very slightly chewy texture from the sun dried tomatoes ... just enough to be amazing. And then five or six other ingredients that go together perfectly, with every chew releasing a new harmony of texture and flavor. Each ingredient is a health star! It's good dabbed on almond crackers, on carrot sticks or celery. I know I will find many other uses, like warm pasta would release some of the flavors even more.  Thank you Living Tree for your amazing products and your commitment to an ethical, healthy industry not to mention *deliciousness*.  Truly outstanding and worthy.

review/summary: Best organic chicken noodle I've found.
review/text: We love the flavor of Campbell's hearty chicken noodle, and Progresso's is a close second. But these days, we want an organic alternative from a socially conscious company, so we've been trying all the different brands from Wolfgang Puck (weird strong seasonings) to Health Valley (almost no chicken and milky liquid) to Imagine (flavor okay, but almost no chicken and overcooked noodles) to Muir Glen (tasteless and the company is owned by General Mills). This Pacific Natural Foods Organic Chicken Noodle Soup is the best we have found, the closest to the major brands in flavor and contents, texture and amount of chicken. On the down side, I don't know if the foil lined boxes are recyclable.

If it wasn't so darn salty I would have given it 5 stars. I ended up giving this bag away.<br /><br />I've tried other flavors from Buffalo Bills that I loved, but this wasn't one of them. If you like things extra salty then go for it, if not you might want to look elsewhere. Buffalo Bill's  cajun flavor beef jerky is outstanding!

review/text: Teriyaki is something I use on the grill all the time. It's a specific flavor and one that I love. But in this jerky, the flavor just seems to become way too salty. The jerky from Buffalo Bills is very moist and tender it's true, but it also has a wetness to it when you reach into the bag that I didn't find appealing. Have had better teriyaki jerky and would not order this again.

I immediately gifted some to the family and they were hooked instantly! I've been buying a steady supply for all of us ever since. Due to a change in Amazon's shipping service, a couple of orders arrived a little late - with one coming in a completely squished box. Choo Choo R Snacks were very helpful and appreciative of the situation and even sent a nice little care package filled with goodies and a lovely card!  An excellent product backed by a standup company. Can't go wrong!

Most national brands I have tried are very unforgiving to my mid-life toofs' if you know what I'm talking about so I gave up on jerky of late. When I received my order of beef sticks I was pleasantly surprised to find a sample pack of this Jerky included! I was blow away by the flavor and most of all how tender and easy to chew it was. This product melts in your mouth...they obviously start with quality meat!! I was so impressed I immediately placed an order! I can eat jerky again!!

I would recommend the Honey Pepper if options are available, but this was really good beef jerky.<br /><br />I highly recommend the moist and tender teriyaki beef jerky, eh!!!

review/summary: Excellent jerky
review/text: I got a small sample pack of this jerky with another product from the same company.  Although the other product, their "Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots (120 beef sticks per bag)" wasn't bad and I rated it four stars, I found the little sample pack of this jerky to be the real highlight of the order.  I'm strongly considering ordering a pack of this jerky, or a couple packs in a couple different flavors now despite having just gotten the package of snack sausage today, it's that good.<br /><br />Addendum:  I did order two 8 ounce packs based on the sample they sent me with my first order, and I just got them Friday.  The quality is consistant with the sampler pack, this is a wonderful beef jerky.  Fairly easy to chew, not at all tough.  Nice flavor that I'd describe as a mix of soy sauce and slightly smokey perhaps, with just a hint of sweetness.  They again sent a sample, this time of their barbeque flavor.  I liked it but I do think the Teriyaki is better.  Still, I may review the BBQ flavor since it was good as well.  I also ordered some of their vennison jerky, which is flavored well (smokey and some soy flavor) but not cut the same, the vennison jerky is made from pressed pieces of meat, not small whole dried strips from what I can see.  Still, I'd also consider the vennison jerky for times when I want something different then this flavor.

review/summary: Subtle, Lovely Bedtime Tea
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Bedtime Tea from Yogi Tea is an caffeine-free herbal tea that is relaxing and a natural sleep aid. Bedtime Tea is made from organic licorice root, organic spearmint leaf, organic chamomile flower, organic skullcap leaf, organic cardamom seed, organic cinnamon bark, organic St. John's Wort leaf & flower, organic rose hips, natural orange flavor, valerian root extract, organic raspberry leaf, organic English lavender flower, stevia leaf, and passion flower extract. The taste is mild, delicious, herb-y, and very slightly sweet. It is subtle and lovely.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Bedtime Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that this tea is not to be used during pregnancy or while nursing. If you are taking MAO inhibitors or other prescription drugs, you should consult your physician or health care professional before use. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Best of all, it works...I love drinking it before bed to relax and drift off into blissful sleep. This is a great tea that I highly recommend.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: great tea but too much stevia
review/text: My 10 yr. old and I drink caffeine free tea every night. This one has more and seemingly better ingredients than our usual sleep time tea, but it is too heavy on the stevia leaf which leaves a very strong "sweet & low" type aftertaste.<br />It does have very relaxing qualities and the flavor is great until the aftertaste of each sip. I am going to try using one bag of this and one bag of our usual sleep time tea to see if this helps because it really is a good tea if you are used to using artificial sweetners (as I am not) and want a healthier alternative. Half as much stevia and I would give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Knocked me out
review/text: I picked up Yogi Bedtime Tea because a) I'm a tea lover and b) I was searching for teas that might make me sleepy. So far, Yogi's Bedtime is the only one that does the job. One mug makes me pretty drowsy and ready to go to sleep. Two mugs make me very loopy and three mugs just put me under. I sleep through the night and wake up feeling slightly groggy; however, the feeling passes quickly and I'm ready to start my morning. If you're having a hard time getting to sleep, or if you know you need to sleep but just aren't ready to settle down yet, this can help.<br /><br />I notice the information for this tea advises you to drink it during the day to calm and relax yourself. I can't imagine doing that. I would pass right out. (Definitely don't drink this before driving anywhere!)<br /><br />The tea is sweetened with Stevia which does leave a taste in the back of your mouth. It is not altogether unpleasant but might irritate some.<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer mentioned, some of the ingredients in this tea can interact with certain medications such as hormonal birth control, so be advised and ask your doctor first.

review/summary: It always relaxes me
review/text: I am an eighteen-year-old college student and I love this tea. A friend gave me a pack and one night when I couldn't sleep, I took it and it was so utterly calming. It doesn't put me to bed quickly but the feeling I get from this tea is wonderful. I love taking it before bed because even if I'm not tired, I start feeling drowsy. The taste is also moderate. I personally need two spoons of sugar with tea or coffee and this needs nothing.  The taste at first is bland and bleh, but the after taste is sweet and stays in the back of your mouth for a while.<br /><br />I also gave my tea to two young children I was looking over with a friend. They were hyper ten-year-olds that ran up the walls and yelled a lot. We gave them the tea (with a bit of sugar and lied saying that there was honey in it) and the two drank the tea and enjoyed every bit of it. Sad thing was, they were too hyper for it to even work on them but it did calm them down slightly.<br /><br />Also, please remember to read the warning label! It states that mothers to be and nursing mothers should not drink the tea! I honestly don't know what will happen if they do but it's best to not find out.

review/summary: Don't SQUEEZE the teabag!
review/text: First off, don't pay more than $3-$4 for this box. Kroger and some Walmarts carry this in their "organic" section.<br /><br />Secondly, the second time I used this I squeezed the teabag.  I was in a catatonic state for 4-5 hours afterward.  The best way I can describe this tea is that it WILL make you sleepy but doesn't put you to sleep.  My best analogy would compare this with alcohol.  Enough alcohol makes you drowsy but actually interferes with a restful sleep.<br /><br />BTW, valerian root acts on the same GABA receptors as Xanax, Ativan, and Klonipin.<br />If you've been using this for a long period, ween yourself off ... don't stop taking this abrubtly.

review/text: I had been taking a low dose prescription drug to help me stay asleep at night.  I would often wake up in the middle of the night two or three times.  I wouldn't consider myself an insomniac but just wanted to stay asleep all night.  I have been using two tea bags in a large mug and drinking it about 30 minutes prior to going to bed.  I find myself falling asleep easily and staying asleep all night.  I'm cutting down and eliminating my prescription drug altogether.  It works!

review/summary: Excellent alternative to taking Pills.
review/text: I am a night owl, not by choice but because my mind is so full of information, stress, memories, etc I cannot just fall asleep. I have stopped drinking caffeine but still was having trouble. I usually would just pop a tylenol PM, and off I went, but wanted to break that habit and try to find some alternative natural way of relaxing and getting to sleep.<br /><br />A friend gave me a box of Yogi Bedtime tea, and I was skeptical. I knew that it wouldnt have the same effects as taking a pill, but I didnt think it would relax me to the point where I could stop taking the pills all together. I WAS WRONG.<br /><br />This tea of course didnt knock me out, but it for sure relaxed my mind, calmed me down, slowly nestled me into its aromatic comfort and I was in bed asleep quicker than quick! Its consistent, reliable and all natural and that is all I wanted out of this product.<br /><br />AND its delicious by the way, just keep it away from your cats, valarian root has the same effects on kitties as catnip.

review/summary: A better tasting sleepy-time tea
review/text: I have not always been a serious tea lover, but this tea has really changed my mind about how wonderful tea can make you feel.  This bedtime tea has a much more rich and complex flavor than other sleepy time teas.  It does contain natural ingredients that may affect medications that you are currently taking, so please read the box.  I enjoy this tea in the evening.  It has a very rich flavor that does not need to be sweetened.<br /><br />I love the packaging so you can take some with you if you are traveling.  Included on every tea bag is an uplifting fortune.  The price here is so much cheaper than my natural health store.  I can buy the package of six here for what three boxes of tea cost at my local store.  All in all I really enjoy this tea, and have given away several packages as I find this tea relaxing and tasty.  If you are looking for a new bedtime tea, I would highly recommend this tea for you.

review/text: This is the first bedtime tea I've tried.  I'm not much of a tea conossuier of any kind for that matter.  My wife bought a box from our local "whole foods" grocery for about $5.50 and I liked it.  I bought six boxes (including shipping) for $14.71 with Amazon's auto-refill option.<br /><br />This tea is very good tasting.  It definately helps me fall asleep.  I doubt the effect is chemical, I think it's more of a perception.  Anyway, I highly recommend this product.  Also, at $0.15 per bag you can't go wrong.  Happy tea drinking!

review/summary: A Help for Needed Sleep
review/text: I have struggled with lack of sleep throughout much of my adult life.  By the time I got to sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a night I started to take this thing seriously.  Here's what I know now:<br /><br />-Forget about the easy route. Doctors don't perscribe 'knock-out' pills as in decades gone by.<br />-Do find out from your doctor if you may be a candidate for 'sleep apnea'.  Find out what it is and if you have it. (It's dangerous and important that you find out!)  The good news is that most people are able to 'cure' sleep apnea by loosing weight. If you need to loose weight, do it now. You wont regret it. (Don't use a fad diet, eat a healthy lifestyle diet, such as by the American Dietetic Association, that you will continue for the rest of your life) For the record, I had sleep apnea and with loosing just 25 pounds was able to be healthier and sleep dramatically better.<br />-While you are at it, investigate sleeping information on a quality web site like www.WEBMD.<br />-Build some amount of exercise into every day. Even if all you do is walk around the block, get out and do it. Find out more about exercise, but don't do it if it leads to bodily pain.  Also, don't now exercise within several hours of trying to sleep.<br />-Establish a FIRM time you wake every morning and STICK WITH IT!! If you decide to sleep in some days please know it may take several days or nearly a week to get back in the swing of things.  Decide what time you will wake, and let it be that time for the rest of your life.<br />-I take YOGI Bedtime along with YOGI Kava (two bags in one cup) before bedtime.  I believe it helps.<br />I also take "Sedalin" by Xymogen along with my Yogi Herbal Tea.  Sedalin is an herbal blend that has also really helped my sleep.<br />-Also being realistic about your sleep duration is important.  Just because you slept 8 to 10 hours as a young person, don't expect that you will be able to achieve this now. I consider a night when I get 5 to 6 hours of good sleep a sucessful night. Very rarely do I sleep more than that. (Let me be the first to welcome you to older age!)<br /><br />Even given all of the above, I still have trouble sleeping some nights, but on the whole my sleep is much better than it has been.<br /><br />PLEASE KNOW THAT THE ABOVE IS ACTUALLY WHAT I DO TO AID MY SLEEP-YOU SHOULD CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE BEGINNING ANY SUCH THERAPY.

review/text: I bought this tea because I'm a very light sleeper and often have difficulty staying asleep through the night. Although this tea isn't my favorite tasting of Yogi teas, it does the job. About 30 minutes after I finished my cup of tea I got a bit drowsy and I was out like a light when my head hit the pillow! I fell into such a deep sleep it was great. Too bad the taste wasn't better, next time I'll add some Splenda.

review/text: I got one box of this from Super Target for about $3.75 for 16.<br /><br />Tea is comparable to Celestial Seasonings Sleepy Time Tea , though the STT Extra has 25 MG valerian, which is likely the strongest relaxing ingredient. The Yogi Tea, however, is far more tasty and I prefer the Yogi tea with a couple tspns of sugar. I researched the ingredients, and all are classic relaxation promoters with a long history of success. I wish they would make it clear how much of each ingredient was in the tea though.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful tasting and effective tea .

review/summary: Good stuff, very potent.
review/text: I bought this because I read that it creates a calming effect and I get incredibly nervous when it comes to interviews. Since I have a bunch of interviews lined up I thought maybe if I drink some of this before the interview I wouldn't be as nervous...and let me tell you it worked! I brewed 2 tea bags in about 10 ounces of hot water, I took the tea once it was brewed and refrigerated it, then took it once it was cold and transferred it to an empty water bottle and 10-15 minutes before the interview I chugged the entire 10 ounces. Halfway through filling out the application I felt this incredibly strong calmness take over and I was no longer nervous at all. By the end of the interview I was shocked at how calm and easy the whole application/interview process had gone. About an hour or two after drinking it however I did feel a very intense urge to sleep, I took a nap for about a half an hour and woke up with a huge headache. The headache is the reason I gave this tea a 4 instead of a 5. It'd easily earn 5 stars if I hadn't woke up with a headache, I will definitely have some of this tea before any stressful event I plan to attend.

review/summary: Actually does relax you
review/text: This tea actually has a soothing, relaxing effect that is noticeable. It's like a mild sedative--very mild. Its affects last perhaps a half an hour. But if you want something to help you relax and get in the mood for a good night's sleep, it's just right. Also, this tea tastes fantastic. Even though it has valerian root in it, which in capsule form smells light rotting gym socks, the tea has this minty, herby, sweet aftertaste that makes it good all by itself, even aside from the relaxing affects.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3SA0">Yogi Bedtime, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I decided to try this tea because I was out of Unisom and not in the mood to cross the street under the blazing tropical sun to visit the pharmacy. Now, I'm not actually an insomniac, but I am high-strung and nervous and tend to be over-anxious about... stuff and just have trouble sleeping at night. I'm sick of pharmaceutical drugs, you know how that goes right? I take a drug to fix one problem, the side effects create another problem so I take another drug to fix that problem... wash rinse repeat.. I'm sick of that. I'm too young to feel this old.<br /><br />SO: Herbal stuff is less complicated, for me anyway. This tea is delicious. Just add hot water. Perfect for my tired and well, lazy soul. And it works too. It relaxes me, I sleep through the night every time. I've noticed that I dream more when I drink this. I have really long, vivid dreams that I actually remember when I wake up. That's different for me. I like it!!! I've done some googling and I suspect it is the Valerian. Or maybe I'm just crazy...<br /><br />I was so impressed that I also tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3SDC">Yogi Peach DeTox, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LL7OXM">Yogi Skin DeTox, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> and they taste good too. Seem to be working also. I am thinking now that maybe Yogi products are good stuff that works. So I'm going to try their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMIYWC">Yogi Breathe Deep, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QLQ">Yogi Woman's Moon Cycle, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> to see if those will help my other annoying health issues. Will let you all know how that works out.<br /><br />So there you have it. Yogi Bedtime tea is awesome.

review/summary: One of My Favorite Yogi Teas
review/text: This is a wonderful, relaxing tea that tastes great on its own (slightly sweet) or sweetened with a few drops of stevia.  A single tea bag works for me, but you can brew a slightly stronger cup with two bags, if needed.  I only use one and probably drink this about 3 nights a week, since I take <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFHPNY">Source Naturals L-Tryptophan 500mg, 120 Tablets</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00013YZNO">Country Life - Chelated Magnesium, 250 mg, 180 tablets</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFPCN4">Source Naturals Melatonin 2.5mg, Peppermint, 240 Tablets</a> as part of my healthy sleep regimen.<br /><br />I find this tea relaxing and calming, but not necessarily sleep-inducing.  Everyone's biochemistry is different, so you'll need to experiment.  I wouldn't however, recommend this for daytime use.  If you need some daytime relaxation & you're not on prescription medications, try this:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMF18W">Yogi St. John's Wort Blues Away, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />Yogi's Bedtime Tea is one of my favorites; highly recommended by an enthusiastic tea fan!

review/summary: Great tasting tea
review/text: I came across this tea a few years ago and decided to give it a try when I was having trouble sleeping. Now I won't say that it's a miracle tea and knocks you flat on your butt after a few sips but it is calming. It has a great flavor to it too which I didn't expect with all the herbs and spices. Plus you get a hint of sweetness from the stevia that helps tie all the flavors together. I've tried other bedtime tea's and so far this one is my favorite.

My boyfriend is a cop and when he comes in late or leaves early in the morning I don't wake up. I finally found something that helps me to get the deep sleep I need to rest my body.

review/summary: I think it helps
review/text: Overall, I think it does help both ways.  The psycho effect is that when you drink it you expect it to work.  The taste is acceptable, but I wouldn't say it is delicious.  The drawback is that before bed, you need to drink it.  It might actually cause you to pee during the night which is what it supposed to do.  I am the type that need to avoid drinking too much after 8 o clock.  If not, during the night i might need to wake up for the bathroom

review/summary: Sleepy & tasty
review/text: I just started drinking tea three months ago. Started with a Whole Foods brand green tea. Taste is sort of blah but I'm used to it now. Was having some insomnia around that time and came across this Yogi Bedtime tea.  I have to say that I am sold. This tea is absolutely delicious. I can not wait to drink a cup every night (and have not missed a night since I started drinkiing it). Additionally, my sleeping has never been better in my entire lifetime.<br /><br />Amazon's subscribe and save price is a great deal too. I pay $3.99 a box at Whole Foods. On Amazon, I can get six boxes for $12.70. (my last order was $17 and I thought that was a great price.)

review/summary: Tastes great and does what it's supposed to
review/text: When I have trouble winding down, I make myself this tea. It has stevia in it, so once I weaned myself off of needing REALLY SWEET tea, I realized that I don't need to add anything to it. The longer it steeps, the better it tastes. This is what started my love affair with Yogi teas. It's usually about $4.50 a box in the grocery stores (DC area, so your mileage may vary), so the subscribe and save option on here, or even just getting one six pack, is a HUGE savings. Highly recommended.

review/text: I have tried three different Yogi tea varieties and they are great. Compared to similary products that I have bought in the grocery store in the past, Yogi teas have more flavor and seem to produce a stronger infusion. They are about the same price as the comparable teas. The Bedtime tea is so flavorful that sweetening is not needed. The desired effect of the tea is to produce sleep and it works. I recommend this tea.

As an adult, I was looking for something with a little more punch. The Yogi Bedtime tea contains St. John's Wart so it does a much better job of relaxing you and helping you fall asleep.

review/summary: it works, in moderation
review/text: I rarely have trouble sleeping, but when I do I drink this tea.  It really does work, though not sure how effective it would be if one were to drink it all the time.  My significant other, who does frequently have trouble sleeping, tried it and was really turned off by what he called the 'oily' taste.  It DOES have a certain viscous taste probably from the essential oils and herbs in the tea but it didn't bother me at all.  I found it to be an interesting difference from most teas, though I would not want to drink it often.  He did admit it might've had a positive effect on his sleep, yet still wont drink it because of the 'oiliness' so... so much for that.<br /><br />I'll be drinking it, and sleeping soundly.  I'm not sure I'd recommend it based on taste alone.  It's a somewhat pleasant herbal taste but nothing delicious.  For deliciousness alone, I HIGHLY recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMF1A0">Yogi Egyptian Licorice Mint</a> which I drink all the time and find to be the most soothing and tasty of all the Yogi teas.

review/summary: Citrus after taste
review/text: I don't like the citrus after taste the tea leaves in the back of my throat.  My fiance, however loves it.  I will say however, that the mint scent is very relaxing.  It may be the way I am brewing the tea: I tried brewing for 1-2 minutes, 5-6 minutes and 9-10 minutes.  The box recommends a brew time of 9-10 minutes, but I've found that too short a brewing time tastes like poorly flavored watered, but too long a brewing time really kicks up the notch on that citrus after taste.  My fiance says that she doesn't think it taste like citrus, but rather more of a sweet honey flavor.<br /><br />Update: I now brew about 4 minutes but in a much bigger cup and now I enjoy the tea (although I still think other tea's taste better) So I'm changing from 3 stars to 4 stars.

review/summary: Love the Bedtime Tea!!
review/text: This is the best of the "bedtime" teas.  I don't love all the yogi products, but i must have this in my cabinets at all times.  And it's become more challenging to find in my grocery stores, AND it's about $4 a box.  Amazon is cheaper and they bring it to my door!<br /><br />This tea offers both chamomille and valerian root.  the latter is similar to melatonin, in that it is a subtle herb and it builds up in your system over time.  I have a cup of Bedtime every evening around 8 or 9, and it helps me unwind.  I believe that part of the unwinding is the ritual of having tea everynight, but this tea does seem head and shoulders above the others i've tried.  and i like it.  What more could you ask?

review/summary: Must Age to Gain Full Strength
review/text: This tea is so mild that it has no real effect on me or my husband.  Tastes okay though.  I guess it may help you to relax a bit but as far as making you sleepy,  it just doesn't.<br />Edit(08/24/2012):  This tea needs to age before it gains full strength.  When we first got it, seems it had no effect on either of us.  Now, a few weeks later, it has gained potency and when I tried it again, it definitely does pack a punch...it puts me to sleep.  We must have gotten a freshly made batch.  I have never had a bad experience with the Yogi teas but this Bedtime tea is the first one that did not live up to its claims at first.  I would order this again. I put honey and hazelnut creamer in it and it tastes very exotic and good that way. I do the same for the Yogi Triple Ecinachea tea also but I also add lemon balm tincture (15 drops) which really boosts the healing power of the tea to new levels!!!  It even heals cold sores overnight prepared with the lemon balm tincture(homeade with fresh lemon balm leaves steeped in 100-proof vodka). At my age, you need all the help you can get lol.

review/text: This tea does not work at all. I bought it considering the fact that it contains Valerian Root, which is the tea that aids sleep. Completely disappointed. Did not help me sleep at all after 2 weeks of taking it each night. It didn't even make me a little bit drowsy. If you want a good night's sleep without taking sleeping pills, take Valerian Root Tea. If your nearby food store does not have it (Whole Foods- been waiting for 3-4 months), then just get it online. Amazon has some really great prices. And yes, Valerian Root Tea Smells like straight up poop, but one bag knocked me out after 30 minutes and I suffer from MAJOR insomnia. Hope this helps. Do not get this tea!

review/text: Honest I am not Patrick. I am Patrick's wife :)<br />On with the review.....<br /><br />The yellow is probably the best tasting to me. My kids like it too followed by the pink and then the purple varieties. Each can contains 2 servings. The product uses melatonin and Valerian as it's "relaxation" ingredients. Other ingredients include sugar, b vitamins, rose hips, acai berry and natural flavors.<br /><br />I split a can between my 4 kids when we are transitioning from a "break" schedule back to a "school" schedule. We are all night owls and early mornings can be rough for us. So when I need to get them back into a schedule we rely on this stuff. Within a half hour or so they are in their beds asleep. I of course tried it for myself and it really does calm the body down making it easier to fall asleep. I highly recommend this product if you can find it. I can't say much about the price since it varies from each vendor. I find mine locally at the gas station here. You may go to  their site and see if it has places you can purchase in your town/city.

review/summary: Healthy, portable, non-perishable(ish) product that tastes good
review/text: There are a lot of conflicting views about soy but one dietary rule of thumb experts often agree on is most foods are safe in moderation.<br /><br />If you are on the run and need something to eat, there are very few options that are portable, non-perishable, and healthy.  I've spent significant time researching foods that meet these three categories and one of the select few options I identified was nuts.  Of course, only soy nuts have all of the amino acids to qualify as a complete protein.  Beyond their value as a quality protein source, soy nuts also provide a good balance of carbs, protein, and fat, one of the strongest of any single whole food.  This balance is important to maintaining blood sugar levels and deriving a sated feeling from the food, and it also conforms to various diet plans, i.e., the Zone.  These soy nuts provide all these benefits without even the negative of added salt/sodium.<br /><br />Conclusion - it's worth researching whether substitution of soy nuts, especially on an infrequent schedule, for other types of snack food is right for you.  I happen to think it is.<br /><br />I received this product fairly quickly and it met the description on Amazon.  I'm deducting one star only because the taste of these soy nuts is not quite as good as green soy beans that i've roasted at home myself.  However, the taste isn't bad, in fact it's reminiscent of popcorn kernels without the toughness if you've ever accidentally eaten one of those.

review/summary: Perfect size and work well
review/text: Ever since I started marathon running I've been searching for a calorie supplement. Ive tried the gels, goos and cubes but was never satisfied. The cubes are too big and its hard to breath while chewing them. The goos and gels are just too dessicating, its like putting peanut butter in my mouth and I need to get something to drink to wash it down.<br /><br />The jelly beans are the best yet. They are smaller making it easier to breath while running. they do not dry your mouth and they also taste good, aways a plus. They provide 100 cals per pouch and contain no caffeine.<br /><br />That said it is not the perfect product. The package can be difficult to open while running and occasionally a few beans drop out as you are trying to negotiate them out of the bag and into your mouth. Also they should make a variety pack. 24 packs is enough to last me a month and I prefer to buy only one at a time. The same flavor, while good, can get a little boring. They have other flavors, a variety pack should not be too hard to make.<br /><br />Enjoy your exercise!

review/summary: Same Starbuck's Quality for a More Reasonable Cost
review/text: Make my own coffee with a French Press; add these great-tasting syrups; and VOILA -- a Starbucks at a fraction of the cost. These syrups taste great and offer a wide variety of "Designer" coffees each and every day. Amazon Prime makes it even a better deal. I'll be using them for a long, long time.

review/summary: Torani Syrup, Chocolate Mint, 25.4-Ounce
review/text: Good, but lacking in the mint department. I mixed a bottle of Torani Peppermint 50/50 to give it more punch.

review/summary: Refreshing
review/text: I love Torani Chocolate syrup, and this Chocolate Mint is a close second. Not so minty that it overpowers the coffee -- just right.  Another Torani winner!

review/summary: She loves them!
review/text: My dog really loves these, and I do think (with the help of the occasional brushing) that these help her teeth stay cleaner. She just loves to munch on one and it keeps her busy for a bit, which is more than i can say for some of those wimpy treats that just add sticky gunk to your dogs teeth...

review/summary: Made both of my dogs sick!!
review/text: I gave each of my two dogs one of these bones after I picked them up grocery shopping on Monday evening. By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding, of course) and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water. She had diarrhea on the carpet in MULTIPLE areas while I was at work, and then two more times during the night. She was very lethargic and unable to keep any food down at all. Meanwhile, my other dog has now gotten horrible diarrhea as well. Wednesday morning I made them some boiled eggs, but the one dog that was already throwing up ended up losing her breakfast a short while later. I gave her white rice with a little bit of chicken stock for dinner that night and she held that down. But sometime during the night, one of the dogs had diarrhea in the house again! Today is Thursday and both dogs are still loose, but (knock on wood)it seems like the vomiting is under control. I called the vet and she said to split an Immodium AD between the two of them and make sure they are drinking plenty of water, which they have been all through this debacle! I will keep my fingers crossed that my carpert will still be clean when I get home. I will never, ever buy another Hartz product again!
