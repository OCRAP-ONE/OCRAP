review/summary: Great food for preventative oral care
review/text: As a dog owner, I try to do the best for my dog.  My mother is a veterinarian technician and strongly recommend that I take good care of my dog's teeth.  Based on her job, she had plenty of stories about dogs with terrible teeth and told me that I should either feed my dog an oral care food or brush her (my dog's) teeth daily.  Knowing that I wouldn't want to brush my teeth and that my dog wasn't going to like it, I opted for the oral care science diet.  My mother recommends the Hills Prescription Diet TD (prescription oral care), but said that the oral care is also acceptable since it is available without a prescription.  I have been feeding this to my dog for 3 years (since she was a puppy) and her teeth are very clean and white.  I rest happily knowing that I won't be dealing with a vet recommending that I pay a huge amount of money to rip out teeth or put my dog under to get a teeth cleaning (these procedures can run into the thousands of dollars in some severe cases).  Over all, the food is more expensive than other foods, but the benefit of knowing that my dog's teeth are well cared for is worth it to me because I know how expensive the alternative can be.  Another added bonus- my dog likes this food!

review/summary: Great mix for my dogs dinner!
review/text: So we love this product.  We mix is about 1/3 of this with his other dog food (Blue Buffalo).  Our dog builds up a lot of tarter on his teeth, and this really helps clean his teeth in addition to brushing and greenies.  As this product is a bit pricey we mix it in with 2/3 other dog food (which is also pricey lol).  I think its works great on its own or as a mix.  The dog really looks for the bigger bites and I think encourages him to eat more.  He is not picky but really doesn't eat a lot.  I order online and have gotten free shipping sometimes.

review/summary: DOES A GREAT JOB ON THEIR GUMS & DOGS LOVE IT
review/text: I bought this for my two four year old dogs (a miniature poodle and a Lhasa Apso) when I discovered their gums were inflammed and had the beginnings of gum disease.  At first I was alarmed when I got the bag because the food chucks are rather large for my small dogs, however I remembered it is probably them chewing on it that will remove the tartar.  Sure enough they love these mini golf ball size food.<br /><br />It helps their gum problems and it's cute to see them grab one out of the dish and run into the living room with it like they have a prize.  I have a two sided bowl and put this in one side and the mini food bits in the other and they prefer this food.<br /><br />I still offer them both.<br /><br />I highly recommend,

review/summary: Clean Teeth!!!
review/text: I have tried everything to clean my large dog's teeth.  She is 5 and I want to stay on top of it.  We wrestled with a toothbrush and chicken toothpaste, went on a drinking strike when I added enzymes to her water and finally, refused to open her mouth for the glove with little brushes built in.  She does not love the taste of this food but I give it to her at night with a 1/2 can alpo so the gravy coats it and her teeth look great.  Finally a solution to a huge problem with older dogs and cats (there is a cat food too).  Thanks to my friend Ida who has been buying it from her vet at a much higher price and recommended it to me.

review/summary: Great for Bad Breath
review/text: Yes, my dog suffers from bad breath.  Her favorite food is cat poop, followed by deer, cow and turkey poop, so after I let her back in the house I give her a piece or two of Oral Care.  I have trained her to believe she's getting a treat, not a breath freshener/tartar cleaner.  She'll do anything for them, and they really work, otherwise she'd never again get petted.  I trained a friend's dog to also believe they are treats.  He'll sit and catch them out of the air as they fly towards him - don't really want to get too close to that bad breath slobbery mouth stuff.

review/text: I love stuffing and this product works. Boil some water, add margarine to the water, remove from the heat and then stir in the mix. Cover the pot. Wait 5 minutes.<br /><br />It is essentially impossible to screw things up.<br /><br />Taste - well it is decent - there are no harsh notes - it is a bit bland and certainly not the equal of home made but who would expect that from a 5 minute product.<br /><br />Recommended when time and the ease of preparation are paramount. In my opinion - this is a true 3 star product - which is to say good but not great.

Veggies pop with a little True Lemon.  Give up the salt, pour on the True Lemon.

Lemon juice can do that, depending on how much you use.  I first tried it in the little packets and I realized that form was not enough.  So I bought these large caontainers.  So good - I especially like to add it to vanilla yogurt....now I'm getting hungry....

review/summary: Chewy Perfection
review/text: I used to purchase Swedish Fish at the CVS Pharmacy for many years, but the store switched to the smaller fish, which are not nearly as good in texture. When evaluating a Swedish fish, the most important thing is freshness. You want fish that are as fresh as possible, i.e., furthest away from their expiration date (you can check the expiration code through the manufacturer Cadbury Adams). Well, Candy Depot just delivered the freshest Swedish fish I ever had -- just the right chewiness and bursting with flavor that no other gummy candy can match. Older Swedish fish get a bit stiff and are harder to chew. The intensity of the flavor diminishes as well. The assorted fish flavors are lemon (yellow), lime (green), orange (orange), and berry (red). Many people prefer only the red Swedish Fish because its flavor is sublime and difficult to describe; some people think the flavor is strawberry, others cherry, and even loganberry. No matter what, the Red Swedish Fish are the Holy Grail of non-chocolate candy. Although you can purchase a bag with just red fish, I prefer the assorted variety because I like the contrast in flavors, and you can progress in taste up to the red. When eating a Swedish Fish, no filleting is required; however, there is an art to it. Personally, I like to nip off the tail and then eat the body. Sometimes, I will roll up the fish from the tail end and eat it like a miniature jelly roll. But my special technique is reserved for a pair of red fish. I sandwich the two fish belly-to-belly, then I bite off the double tail, then I pop the double body into my mouth for a full burst of flavor. Delicious. Yes, I may seem strange, but I come from a competitive family where we used to have jelly bean wars. We would pair up the jelly beans, then we would "go to war" by holding each jelly bean between each forefinger and thumb, then smash the two together until one end of the losing jelly bean would cave in. These battles would continue in a single elimination tournament until one bean emerged victorious. I hope you enjoyed this review and your Swedish Fish from Amazon.

I found them in Walmart and they are almost $3 a can.  I thought I bought them through Amazon before and did not pay shipping, but I could be wrong about that.  Normally I do not order items where you have to pay shipping.  I will look at Walmart.com and have it shipped for free to the store where I can just go pick it up (as long as they have the item).  But I do like Amazon where you don't pay tax (on items where you normally would pay tax).  It pays to check out different web-sites and directly in the stores for the best buy.

I was thrilled that Amazon still sold them, since all the B&M's have stopped selling them.  But, unfortunatly, all great things must come to an end.  I will not pay $40.00 plus for 6-10oz cans.  I made it through the burnt peanut problem, and love Amazon's service, but at these new prices, I will have to just say no.  It is a shame that such a great product is not sold by local stores any more and that Planters does not push this product harder.

review/text: Basically, they are butter toffee peanuts.  Sweet and crunchy, just like their name.  Only drawback is that a lot of the coating falls off the peanuts, so you have to scoop up the peanuts and coating together to get the full flavor.  A good amount of coating gets left in the bottom of can.  But, if you like butter toffee peanuts at a reasonable price, you will enjoy these.

review/summary: Best snacks ever
review/text: I had some of these nuts this past year at a Christmas Party and was having trouble finding them in the stores around our area so I ordered this pack of 6 and my whole family enjoyed them.  They have the best flavor and just enough sweetness to make you go back for more.  They are very satisfying.  I plan on purchasing more at a later date and will order from this site.

review/summary: Best flavor, superior crunch!
review/text: These should come with a warning, "Highly addictive"! They are soooo good, before you know it you have eaten half the can! One other warning, they are super crunchy, so don't eat them if you don't have strong teeth. I have broken a couple fillings on these! So for me I don't buy them often, because they are VERY expensive!! But I still LOVE them! Also, this is a great price, as they are difficult to find in stores in my area.

review/text: These are yummy peanuts! Roasted peanuts covered with a sweet and crunchy crust. Unique flavor. Sinfully rich in calories: 18 peanuts make one 1 oz serving and have 140 calories. And they are so savory that it is easy to eat 2 or 3 servings at a time.<br /><br />But the redeeming factor is that crust comes apart from a lot of the peanuts in the can and if you don't eat the separated crust than you do not get as many calories.

review/summary: Icebreakers Frost Mint causes throat pain
review/text: I used to love these mints and bought them in bulk on Amazon, until I bit into one that must have had too much of a certain ingredient, causing me to experience a very sudden sharp burning pain in my throat. I google'd "Icebreakers Frost Mint causes throat pain" and read what people wrote and it was exactly what happened to me. I will never eat these again and I would not recommend you take the risk of experiencing this pain because it is very alarming and feels like your throat is closing up, making it difficult to breath or swallow for a few minutes. I tried drinking water and it made it worse.

review/text: These mints came as a big surprise.  They are the best mints to freshen your breath that I've ever tried.  They aren't so powerful that they burn or make your eyes water - but they have the great effect of making your mouth feel cleaner.  Not the sugary coating that many mints (like tic tacs) leave.<br /><br />I think these work even better than altoids for actually freshening your breath.  I will definitely keep them on hand!

review/text: I discovered recently that many sugar-free mints are made with sorbitol and I along with many people can have gastric issues with sorbitol. These mints are made with xylitol and are much better in this sense. I took off one star because they add several other chemicals typical for mints. I just would have preferred to keep the contents simpler and more natural. They taste good and last a while in your mouth.

review/summary: How Can I Describe The Sensation??
review/text: When I pop in an Ice Breaker's Frost Mint, I get the sensation... OF BEING ON A FROZEN MOUNTAINTOP!!!<br /><br />It's been about two weeks now since I made the tragic choice to bite into an Ice Breakers Frost peppermint, and still I haven't made any progress in finding my way out of these blasted mountains. The only food I have is the rest of this pack of Ice Breakers Frost peppermints, which, unfortunately, when I eat one, keeps bringing me right back up to the top of these mountains. They are just TOO. DANG. REFRESHING. I think? I saw a sherpa once? but it could have been the statue I made out of the mints, out of desperation for some company, as I'm getting so awfully lonely. My only consolation left in this world is that, should I not find my way out of these cursed mountains, I will leave this world with cool, fresh, minty, wonderful breath. Please, tell my family that I love them, and, if they chose to eat Frost Mints, they should first tether themselves to something extremely heavy, lest they, too, get whisked away to some frozen mountaintop.... like me.....

review/summary: TAKE THESE OFF THE MARKET!
review/text: These are horrible little things that need to be removed from the market IMMEDIATELY AND PERMANENTLY.  I put one in my mouth and was in ABSOLUTE AGONY with the horrendous pain in my entire mouth and jaws! It lasted for about ten minutes, and I was gasping, crying, moaning and shaking uncontrollably the entire time. I simply could not believe it! I've had oral surgery along with surgery on my hand and both elbows, and even with that I never experienced such horrible pain. For that matter, I recently fell and broke my collarbone, which was rather painful, but even that pain was nothing like what I experienced with these stupid mints. I was truly frightened. Thankfully I was at home when it happened because if I had been out in public somewhere, people would have thought I was dying. I was unable to talk and could never have explained what was wrong with me. Do a Web search and you'll see that other people have also had problems with these terrible, noxious things.  Consume them at your own risk!

review/text: A friend brought me a box for our 3 English Setters and now we're all hooked. I haven't tasted one yet, but they smell wonderful and our dogs love them more than any other treat except chicken sticks, and it's an even tie with those. That makes me happy. I don't even bother with other treats (besides the chicken sticks) any more since Ben, Toby and Chelsea absolutely adore these cookies. I've seen no weight increase in the 2 months I've been feeding them, each, up to two cookies a day. The cookies have replaced other dry treats. The dogs don't discriminate between flavors either - all Three Dog Bakery Classic Cremes are avidly appreciated.

review/summary: Exquisite Jasmine Tea, Not To Be Missed
review/text: *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip." It sounds quite romantic, and it tastes wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />*****

It has ruined recipes in the past so I do pick and choose.  Honestly Kellogg's performs much better, I prefer the seasoning and it doesn't have much salt at all.

review/summary: Worth the price!
review/text: I want to start off by saying - take this with a grain of salt. Everyone has their own opinions of things, and it's good to read reviews of products before you buy. But especially with dog foods, read the ingredients list! It's all there, in black and white, what your dog will be eating. Make sure there's plenty of meat in the product, as in the first two-three ingredients should be meat related, and generally educate yourself as to the good ingredients that SHOULD be in a dog food versus ones that shouldn't!<br /><br />Anyhoo, my experience.. we have a 3 month old boxer puppy, whom we're planning to breed. So of course what food we use is very important, not just to her, but to her future puppies and their health! We wanted all natural and organic, just short of a homemade meal. We tried Eukanuba Naturally Wild at first. It seemed to work good, her coat was shiny and her stools were good sized. She didn't have any problems with it, but we started to notice she wasn't so much interested in eating. Sure, she ate it, but she didn't CHOW DOWN! We started looking for a new food, and in the process I found lots of good reviews on Solid Gold. I chose the Solid Gold Hund & Flocken Puppy Formula, in the 33 lb bag. At first, I was scared she wouldn't like it and made sure we could return the product if need be. We got home, let her out of her kennel and put down the food.. and boy, did she eat it! There was nothing left. She's been steadily gaining weight ever since, which is good. A fat boxer puppy is a happy, healthy boxer puppy! :)<br /><br />I thought her coat shined before, but it's really shiny and soft now. People have previously complained about loose stools and horrible gas in their dogs on Solid Gold. Well, she's always been flatulent so I don't see much of a change. ;) I did notice some softer stools, but she also loves eating strawberries so I can't compare there either. Overall, she loves it and we love it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!

review/summary: obviously tastes better
review/text: I started my puppies, sheltie and pug, on science diet on the recommendation of their vets.  Like the earlier review, my dogs didn't chow down the food, but after getting the solid gold I mixed the 2 to start the switch over.  My dogs ate only the solid gold, leaving the science diet!  I couldn't believe science diet small bites' first ingredient was not meat.  With lamb being the first ingredient in the solid gold there's no wonder the dogs chowed down!  For only $3 more my dogs are way more happier!

review/text: Although very minty, when chewed these mints cause serious burning sensation and pain in the mouth and throat.  May not happen to everyone but has happened to several people I know.  Take care not to chew if you choose to purchase.  As for me and my family, we will NEVER purchase again.  Mints should not be painful!!!!!!!!!!

review/text: I really REALLY wanted to like this. I use liquid Stevia, in small amounts, to sweeten anything in my house as I am "sugar free" (big-time addict). But this is so gross to me. It has a super bitter aftertaste, and not that dark chocolate aftertast I actually love. This is straight up fake sweetener taste. Super strong. co-worker (diabetic) and boyfriend (lenting) who are both also hard up for anything sweet couldn't eat it either. Poo, oh well.

review/text: This chocolate gives you all the pleasure without the concerns of too much sugar. I like to watch my sugar intake because it can easily  become too much of a fun thing. I have a sweet tooth. I eat an entire bar of this chocolate at a time with a big satisfied smile on my face... And their customer service is as good as their chocolate. My first order was the six bar assortment but I received six bars of mint instead. To make it up to me they sent me an additional six bars for free!!! This is a little company that really cares. My only wish is that they would also make a milk chocolate with Stevia. Oh well... something to dream about :-))

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE these
review/text: There are several things I like about this product, including that these are naturally shed antlers that are collected, cleaned, packaged and then sold without involving killing to get them.  Somebody goes out and collects these and that is probably part of why they are fairly expensive, even on-line...I first found these in our local pet store...but forget about the retail price, (IF you can even find them,) the price at the pet store was twice what I found on-line, and the antlers were not nearly as large.  None of the big chain pet stores carry these, at least not in my area so far. I ordered these through Amazon and was amazed and delighted that they arrived literally the next day.<br /><br />That said, my dogs simply ADORE these things.<br />They keep my new, and very young 100# rescue lab busy literally for hours, but do not "slime" my floors or carpet, (or our bed or couch.)  He loves to set one on my desk as an "offering," which I actually don't mind since they are VERY clean compared to all the more traditional bones, hoofs and chews.<br /><br />Additionally, they double as a great "fetch" toy in the yard.<br /><br />Essentially my guys just chew them down to the nubbin's, but without any damage to my stuff. Highly recommend if you want a clean chew/toy that will keep your dog busy for hours without wrecking the party, and helps with tarter build-up on their teeth in the process.<br /><br />Really a great idea, and a great product.

review/summary: Good . . . and over priced
review/text: My dogs like these.  Everything the positive reviews say about them is true . . . they're a really good option because they don't splinter easily and it takes a good while for my pack of sniveling, snarling, white hot balls of canine terror (wiener dogs) to wear them down.  They eventually get small enough that they become choking hazards and you have to toss them.<br /><br />I have no hesitation in highly recommending deer antlers as a chew for dogs.  It's only that after first buying this brand, I then ran across real, honest to goodness deer antlers that were comparable to these in every way at a local pet store for almost exactly half the price of these.  If you can't find real antlers locally or online for a better price, these are absolutely fine.  But do look around first.

review/summary: Excellent purchase, and much bigger than expected
review/text: After reading the reviews about how some customers received an antler piece that was too small, I was concerned that the same thing would happen to me and purchased a medium sized chew for my Japanese Chin.  When I received the chew, I was surprised to see how big the antler piece was! My dog definitely loves the chew toy; she sniffs at it, and tries to chew on the end.  However, it's much too heavy and long for her to carry around happily, and she will inevitably give up on the chew.  I will be giving this chew to my friend's dog, who is a Destroyer of Toys (bit the nose off a rubber squeaky pig) to see how she likes it.  I have already ordered a small sized chew for my dog.<br /><br />I guess my only complaint is that the size estimate is really too vague.  4-6 inches for the medium?  Well 6 inches is 50% more than 4 inches.  I'd like to see the sizes more exact.

review/text: I have an 18-pound Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who is addicted to chewing bones, toys and anything that might be questionable by a human.  He absolutely loves these antlers and I am happy to buy them for him.  This is my third purchase and the medium lasts my boy about 3-6 months depending on where he "hides" them.  This is one of his absolute favorite chew things (other than that blue monkey which ended up in the garbage).  I love this product because I do not worry about him choking or if it is okay for him to be eating plastic.  This product also gives me some peace and quiet since my buddy is entertained for so many hours, he does not bark at me.  WE BOTH LOVE THESE!

I've already ordered two mainly because she runs off and chews on them under the beds then I can't find it later when I want her to stop chewing on people.

review/text: This was thin, unlike the last xtra large that I ordered from this supplier.  I think it will still work for the dog to chew, at least until is shrinks 2 inches or so.  Since my dog is a mastiff, I'm afraid that he'd try to swallow the thing whole if it gets too much smaller, due to its thin diameter.  So far, he hasn't shown much interest in chewing it.  I think  he likes the taste of the elk and moose antlers better.

review/summary: THE BEST CHEW ON THE MARKET
review/text: I adore this chew.  Two years ago I gave up chewing tobacco, the wife and the doc teamed up on me and finally convinced me it was time to stop playing chew Russian roulette.  It was tough to quit, I'd been chewing since I was eleven and half.  The idea was, give up the chew first and then tackle the cigarettes.  Well I'm happy to announce that last July with the help of hypnosis, the Patch, and plenty of nicotine gum, I am a non smoker!  Now watch, I'll get hit by buy a bus :) I'm just joshing.  Sure I put on a few pounds, a hundred and thirteen to be exact.  My shrink said I had an oral fixation and suggested a number of remedies, rebirthing, joggin, getting my jaw wired shut, tummy tucks, fake cigarettes, you know just something to stick in my kisser, hell I tried the works, but nothing seemed to do the trick.  Until accidently I stumbled upon these Antler Chews.  I had bought a couple for my dog "Swiderski," and one night while he was enjoying one at my feet, I was having myself a plate of ribs watching the Braves game.  And you know me, all thumbs, I dropped a rib to the floor.  Well I reached down real quick to grab it and accidently picked up Swiderski's antler.  And Lawdy lawd I tell you what, I was home.  These are TAAAASSSSSTY, I'll never buy a pack of beef jerky again.  I've dropped eighty eight pounds to date, and I don't go anywhere without my new chew.  I keep one in the glove box of my truck, and I've got em in every room in the house. Hell I've fallen asleep sucking these chews.  I know it's somewhat of a cliche but they do taste a little like chicken, and I stress, they are not overwhelming.  I couldn't tell you how many packs of smokes I'd go through when I'd get to drinking my beer, but now I can go a good three or four months with just one antler.  Whew baby!  For any of you out there with an oral fixation or those who just wanna drop a few pounds, these deer antlers'll do the trick. My compliments to the chef.  God does work in mysterious ways.

review/summary: FINALLY something that my girls can't chew through in minutes!
review/text: We have two dogs that are just over one year old (a Yorkie and a Pomeranian.)  And boy do they like to chew.  When they were puppies we could get away with the conventional chew toys, but as the girls got older, their chewing muscles got stronger.  They now destroy any plastic chew toy in minutes.  Eventually we found bully sticks, which are wonderful distractions for those evenings when the girls have more energy than I do, but the sticks would still only last about 60 minutes.  And then we met the deer antlers...PERFECT! The girls love to chew on them and the antlers last and last and last.  The antlers arrived and were approximately 6 inches long.  I didn't have much hope of them lasting since they seemed kind of small and the girls really went to town chewing on them.  But for weeks now the girls have chewed on the antlers and there is still barely any gone.  Oh deer antlers...where have you been all my life?  :-)

review/summary: Product does not live up to reviews
review/text: Over the last several months I have been hearing about deer antlers and I've done a lot of research and read lots of reviews before I decide to try this product. I have three black labs that have a chew product every night to help keep their teeth clean and thought this might be a way to save money and give them something new to chew on. Although the cost was kind of expensive, I felt it was worth trying.<br />I was excited to receive this product after reading all of the reviews. The deer rack was a good 7-9 inches or more long as described, had very little smell, and is very hard compared to something like rawhide or other types of bones one might buy. These antlers were more then twice the size of the ones I seen at local pet stores in the area and only about 1/3 of the price.<br />Needless to say, all three of my girls chewed on their antlers for about 10 minutes and have not looked twice at them again. I might not be surprised if my dogs were picky but I find it interesting since my girls eat anything and everything. Perhaps if your dogs have never had anything to chew on in their lifetime they might like this product. Other then that, the product is a waste of money.

review/summary: Only One?
review/text: I thought I was buying a bag full of these for $9 but there was only one 4" antler piece in the bag!  If my dog's last name was Gucci, Rockefeller, or Gates, this might make sense. But I am just an average guy so the price (including shipping) was rediculous for what I got. As they say, "fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me". Never again guys

review/summary: Pace Chunky Salsa Review
review/text: I've tried both of Pace's Salsas and I like their Chunky Sala best. It's just the right heat and crunchyness. This is my 4th order. I live in a retirement home with 500 residents. At my dinning table, 5 other residents eat together at our table. I bring Pace to the table in a Rubbermate conatiner and they eat almost all of it at breakfast, on their eggs, and then on other foods at lunch.

review/summary: These snacks are awsome!
review/text: I love it. They both taste AWSOME. The cranberry sesame mix is slightly salty and the cherry apple mix is more on the sweeter side. I am a BIG FAN of SAHALE SNACKS. I find them to be tastey and nutritious. They are great to keep in your bag for work or play. They are great for a long car drive and a fun snack to give away. I understand there is sort of a cult following with Sahale, so I loke to give them away to people to spread the word.
