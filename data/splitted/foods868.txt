review/summary: cat approved!
review/text: I just fed this to my cat and he loved it. But it seems pretty much the same as giving your cat a can of tuna. It flakes like real tuna, it smells like real tuna - it is real tuna. I give my cat a can every now and then, so I am not sure I'd bother buying these treats specifically since I tend to keep tuna in the cupboard anyways. But he did totally chow it down and so for that, I give it five stars. It would also be a nice stocking stuffer (for us pet lovers that give our pets Christmas presents) or to bring to a friend who loves their cat, or to people out there who's grand-babies happen to be grand-kitties instead. I can't imagine any cat not loving to chomp into this seafood treat.

review/summary: Cats Go Crazy.....
review/text: My cats acted like they had not eaten in days when I gave them this special treat.  This is real dolphin safe tuna.  I think we humans would enjoy it if we tried it.  Even my dog wanted in on the action.  My cat Pippin will not eat people food of any kind and he loves this treat.  I would be extremely surprised if your cat does not like this product.<br />I was impressed by the companies claim to be responsible for keeping the tuna populations safe as well as keeping the dolphins safe as well.

review/summary: This is cat food???
review/text: I'm glad they write on the package "pet food only," because this tuna looks good enough for human consumption. There are even grill marks on it. It is packaged neatly in a vacuum-sealed, recloseable zippered bag.Our cat probably could not believe her eyes. What a change from dry cat food, huh Frisk?<br /><br />There is enough in one package for at least three servings, perhaps more.<br /><br />Recommendations: Your cat will love you for this. I'd say it is perfect for a special treat or to supplement the usual dry food.

review/summary: Three Paws way UP!!
review/text: Ok, we opened a package of these tuna treats, and the Bengal boy almost went berserk trying to get at the tuna while we were dishing it. He then inhaled his portion so fast we were a little concerned. The two Big Boys were a bit more sedate, but trust me, their portions were also consumed and the plate licked clean.<br /><br />The portion size is about right for a light meal for three cats. But it's too big for a "treat". Note it's about 10X the cost of even a premium can.<br /><br />The ingredient is "tuna", and these are packaged in Ecuador (not China!) which is good.  But do note that tuna is not nutritionally complete for a cat's diet.<br /><br />I think these are great as a special meal when the cats have been extra good, or you had to leave them alone with kitty crunchies for a weekend. Not as a steady diet, however.

review/summary: It isn't a good sign when 2 "epicurious" cats don't like gourmet food
review/text: I have two cats named Vader and Kiwi.  Vader is 16 year old male and Kiwi is a 2 year old female.  I would say they are both very picky eaters. [This might or might not be surprising to other cat owners when they read this.]  These two cats are fed the high end cat food; I am talking cans that cost almost a dollar each.  So when I saw this "gourmet" cat food I figured this would be a no brainer for my finicky feline friends.<br /><br />The packaging for these tuna fillets is nice, at first (return to this in a moment).  There is a sealed zip bag containing three fillets, which is enclosed in a paper package.  The tuna itself has a light sauce and is a bit on the tough side.  I say tough because it took me a few minutes to break it up with a fork.<br /><br />Once I put the food down Vader began to eat rather quickly.  He was licking his lips once he was done.  Now I only gave him a half of one of the fillets since he is a "snacker".  The rest was put in the fridge for later.  When later came he wouldn't even look at the food. He smelled it and begged for something else.  As for Kiwi, she didn't care for it at all.  She smelled it twice and looked at me as she was saying "you want me to eat this"?  As a matter of fact, she never even tasted the food.  I had to end up feeding her something else.  As for the packaging, it doesn't stay sealed all that well.  There was tuna juice leaking out of the bag in the fridge, not cool.<br /><br />It is difficult to review a product that I am not using, but I have to say that my cats really didn't care for this product. The food looks like it is very high quality, but what good is that if (my) cats won't eat it?  I am sure everyone's cat(s) are/is different, but this is a very pricy product with lousy storage and doesn't entice my two four legged friends.

review/summary: Too pricey plus very difficult to open
review/text: I have two cats.  One cat loved this all natural grilled tuna; the fussier one tried to bury it.  There were two things I didn't like about the product.  First, the zippered plastic envelope was very difficult to open. (I ended up placing it in a different sealable bag.) Second, it was very pricey: almost $10 for just over 4 oz compared to about $1 for a 5 oz can of tuna at a grocery store.  I tried the product because it was available to me at no charge through the Vine program.  Despite the fact that my one cat loved it, I would not pay full price for it myself.  (Sorry, kitty!)

review/summary: Two paws up from kitty, but the packaging leaves a bit to be desired
review/text: As thrilled as I was to get a package of this for trial from Vine, it is not the kind of treat I'd normally pick up for kitty. 1) I'm cheap. 2) we do not do wet food or the soft/chewy snacks at all and 3) she's gung ho with stuff like this, eats too fast and then it's a bit of a barf fest on the carpet...<br /><br />OK, so the package comes, a supposedly reusable zip baggy thing, but while I opened it easy enough the first time, day two was another matter and I ended up cutting it open and putting it in my own easier to open zip bag. So much for that. The package contains three sticks of tuna (dolphin safe and all that according to the info blurb), measuring about 4 1/2" by 1" by not quite 1/2" and a bit of broth of some sort. They are rather dense/dry in texture and I recommend breaking it up a bit by fork (or your fingers if the smell doesn't bother). I'm treating these as a snack, and not as a meal. They are a bit chewy looking, so if you have an older cat and/or one who has difficulty chewing I'd think carefully on these.<br /><br />Kitty loves them, and boy does it keep her busy eating after I'm home and not bellowing at me for attention :)<br /><br />A solid five paws from her, and I'm knocking off a star for the packaging issues and the price(!!). I supposed those who have a lot of disposable income would lap this up like a cat with cream, but as I said... I'm cheap (or frugal, as the boss puts it).

review/summary: too expensive to be a "treat"
review/text: The product came attractively packaged in a vacuum packed flat resealable plastic pouch. The tuna had a strong tuna smell, which immediately brought our cats running over to inspect. At 4.1 ounces, this is more of a meal than a treat. While you could cut off a piece and save the rest for another time, this isn't what I think of when buying kitty treats... Kitty treats to me are crunchy and small, so that I can shake the container to call our cats over and then sprinkle out a couple of treats at a time.<br /><br />With this prodcut, we replaced our usual Fancy Feast dinner and served our 2 cats the entire 4.1 ounce pouch. I found that it looked a little dry, but I will say that the cats gobbled up the food like it was their last meal.<br /><br />Overall, our cats seemed to like it, but I have some issues with the way the product is marketed. If this is to be used as a treat, it needs to be easier to serve in small pieces. If it is to be used as a meal, then the price needs to be lowered ALOT. I would never purchase this product as is.

review/summary: Not just for cats!
review/text: We have two cats and two tiny chihuahuas who all line up eagerly for these treats.  The fish seems very fresh and manages to stay fresh for up to about a month refrigerated in the zip lock bag. It breaks easily into small chunks for our babies and we get many servings from each package.<br /><br />It probably wouldn't be cost effective to give this as a treat to larger dogs, but for our little guys it's perfect and they really seem to love it.  And the cats like it better than any of the other treats we've given them.  Though it's a little expensive for an everyday treat, it's a nice special-occasion treat.

review/summary: Not Too Well Received For The Price
review/text: These are Kitty Treats for the Discerning Cat Owner. They are imported, from Eco-safe fishing practices, and are Dolphin Safe. They are in neat little slabs complete with grill marks...all the things humans care about, and should be willing to pay for.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the His Highness doesn't care about any of that. He only cares what it tastes like, and for him the results were mixed. As others have noted, with all the liquid in the pouch it is better to open it over the sink. A fair amount of liquid is lost when opening it initially.<br /><br />The first moist piece (about half of one slab) was gobbled up. The package was sealed up and put in the refrigerator, standing up "so it wouldn't leak." (Per Mrs. Boilermate) Pieces two and three, from the top half of the remaining pieces were less well received, presumably because they were dry. The third sat in his bowl until mixed with his daily ration of Fancy Feast. The remaining pieces were eaten but not as enthusiastically as the first.<br /><br />For the price of one of these packages we could buy about two weeks worth of Fancy Feast, and they get gobbled up. For a treat, people tuna will have to do.<br /><br />While we were glad to have the opportunity to try these, we thought the packaging was messy and a pain to deal with, and the product was WAY over priced, even if His Highness had approved. They won't be on our shopping list.

review/summary: Smells very enticing.
review/text: This tuna smells so good it makes you, as a human, want to eat it.  Although, it is strictly warned on the packaging that it isn't for human consumption.  As far as for a pet is concerned, my cat ate it.  But it didn't seem to be her favorite.  What I've noticed with cats and tuna fish is that they go for the juice more so than the actual meat of the tuna itself.  And this package is a little sparse in the juice element.  So I think your cat will like it, I can't say whether or not it wouldn't just be easier to buy a can at the grocery store.  But this does seem like a healthier choice.

review/summary: Extremely Pricey for Cat Treats, but They Appear to be Delicious
review/text: I've been spoiling my girlfriend's cat since she moved in with me. Out went the Whiskas dry kibble or whatever it was and in came the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9WU74">Royal Canin Dry Cat Food, Maine Coon 31 Formula, 6-Pound Bag</a>. The cat, who would only pick at her food before now wolfs her meals down and meows for more. This spoiling occurs mainly because she is in love with my house rabbits who return her affection with either disdain or bullying. Thankfully it is usually the former. So when I had these treats came up as a vine product for me to review this month, I happily grabbed them to see if the finicky cat would  enjoy them, or if they would just smell up my home.<br /><br />The good news is the cat loved them. These tuna treats smelled so good (to her anyway), that as soon as they arrived she began meowing for them. The treats come in four long thick strips, each of which is far too big for an actual treat sized portion. This means you have to break chunks off or cut them up unless you want your cat to eat too much and then throw up. Kitty really loved the treats and they smelled like actual tuna you would buy in a fish market as opposed to the weird aroma "gooshy" cat food gives off when you open a can.<br /><br />The bad news is the bag is not actually resealable (although it claims to be) and the treats dry out very quickly. These are also VERY expensive at $2.44 an ounce, wich will no doubt cause sticker shock in some potential consumers. The price tag is because the tuna in these treats are dolphin safe, caught in eco friendly fashion and sustainable. The only thing missing is the word "organic." Personally, I'm willing to pay a little more for products that are environmentally friendly, but I know the cat doesn't care - she just wants fishy fish.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be a regular purchase instead of what we usually giver her, but kitty did love these treats and there is no better endorsement for your cat food than that of a finicky cat.

review/summary: Real tuna steaks.
review/text: These treats are real tuna steaks grilled and sliced into 3 strips.  There are no additives, no fillers, just real tuna packaged conveniently in a resealable pouch. (See photos above)<br /><br />The Pros:<br />1) My picky cat that doesn't like treats, loves these.<br />2) My picky dog that loves fish and who also thinks she's a cat, loves these<br />3) Since this is just pure tuna, it is safe for both cats and dogs.<br />4) Conveniently and attractively packed in a easy-tear, resealable pouch and is ideal for traveling or for gift giving.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) The resealable pouch isn't completely leak-proof.<br />2) The resealable pouch was packaged with some tuna juice on the outside of the seal and so when opening, tuna juice gets everywhere.<br />3) Expensive.  This is basically a slice of tuna steak in water, so a comparable product would be chunk light tuna canned in water at a 1/6 the price.  I doubt that whether the tuna is grilled or not would make a difference to the animals.<br />4) As this is an actual tuna steak sliced into 3, the teats are hard to break into smaller bite-sized pieces that one would give their cat or dog.  It needs to be additionally cut into smaller pieces by fork and knife or with scissors.<br /><br />Overall a healthy treat that is minimally processed.  Although expensive, it would make an ideal gift or special occasion treat.

review/summary: Outstanding Treat for Cats
review/text: Our cat is the ultimate of fussiness. She will only sleep on down pillows, and will only drink bottled water from a crystal goblet. Her favorite food is Florida stone crab (at $39 per pound currently). Thus, I thought she would be a tough test for Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna. She loved it! She even begged for more. But to give it a further test, I tried it on my daughter's three cats, and they loved it. From this, I conclude that Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna is likely to be a real treat for cats.

review/text: This kcup was pretty tasty once you get past the weird smell while brewing.  It was described as a bit "funky" by some coworkers.  I tried it out anyway and was impressed.  It's very smooth and has a nice pumpkin flavor.  It gets better as it cools.  The clove flavor is only slighty noticeable which is a very good thing.  The flavor was pretty close to pumpkin pie.  This would mix really well with a good french vanilla kcup and some cinnamon.  The flavor is light years better than the Green Mountain pumpkin spice kcup. It took me a year to get through that box.  I threw out the last few.

review/text: Avoderm salmon and chicken did not appeal to my finicky cats, but neither did the plain Avoderm salmon in consomme  (Wild by Nature) either. Since they gobble up the other flavors of Avoderm canned food which make up the bulk of their diet,, I am putting their rejection of this product down to their personal dislike of salmon rather than to any fault of the manufacturer. I have been feeding Avoderm to them for several months and they prefer it to any other brand of canned natural cat food.( and I have tried them ALL!) They are both pictures of good health...luxurious shiny coats with minimal shedding and no dandruff, bright clear eyes, and plenty of energy...which can't be caused by anything else but the Avoderm I feed them ! Highly recommend their canned cat food, so don't let my kittys' personal tastes affect your choice. Avoderm makes a great product!

review/text: We all know how expensive artichoke hearts are yet we have favorite recipes or dips that call for them. I always kept a few small cans on hand. When I saw this on a Managers Special, I did some calculations and thought I would try them in bulk and break down the large can into managable portions that I generally use for my recipes. I divided the can up, put the portions in zip lock freezer bags and into the freezer. I wondered how they would be when defrosted, because I still wanted the firm texture that they have. I was pleased to find that freezing the smaller bags did not affect the texture or taste in my recipes. So now I pay a little more in the beginning but get so much more for my money and always have them on hand when I need them. I now have them on subscribe and save and they just feep rolling in whenever I am getting low. Roland has good products and I always enjoy their specials!

review/summary: Tulsi Tea
review/text: I had read some interesting stories about the benefits of Tulsi tea and decided to try it. While no scientific evidence has proven its stated benefits, it has been in use for thousands of years and is known for its strong antioxidant capabilities. Since I am kind of a health nut, I decided to give it a taste.<br /><br />Purported benefits of Tusli tea (also called "holy basil") include:<br /><br />- Strengthens the immune system, promotes longevity and enhances well-being.<br /><br />- Promotes heart health by lowering cholesterol and high blood pressure.<br /><br />- Reduces the negative physical and psychological effects of stress.<br /><br />- Increases the body's efficiency in using oxygen, which improves stamina, strength and endurance.<br /><br />- Promotes respiratory health.<br /><br />- Helps with digestion and gastrointestinal problems.<br /><br />- degenerative diseases and premature aging.<br /><br />- Facilitates healthy liver function.<br /><br />- Reduces cell and tissue damage from sun rays, radiation therapy and other radiation sources.<br /><br />- Relieves inflammation from arthritis and other diseases.<br /><br />- Helps fight infections.<br /><br />Amazon.com is usually the first place I look for a new product I would like to try as Amazon.com has great prices and free shipping on a lot of items. So, I ordered this tea to give it a try. I gave some boxes to my daughter who is also a health nut and I thought she would like it.<br /><br />The tea tastes very good and I am glad I added it to my stash of tea. It has a pleasant flavor on a cold winter evening. Something new and different. I am a pragmatic person and don't believe all that I read about foods like this, but if there is even 1/10 of its potential benefits that are true, then I am adding to my own health bank account to ensure that I am around for a long time.

review/summary: Nice warming tea
review/text: I am a big tea drinker and always like to try organic varieties. This is a bit pricey but I used  a very generous coupon and got two varieties to try: the plain tulsi flavor and the lemon ginger one. They are both very warming and aromatic. Tulsi in itself has a mild warming effect and a very discreet aroma. I actually like that it is not so strong tasting. The ginger one is more spicy and the combined effect of tulsi and ginger makes it great for winter. I like that neither is sweet tasting and has no added spices for taste. I like simple tastes and this tea hits the spot. I also tried a bag of the rose flavor, which is not really my thing, but tasted much better than I expected. Bottom line, I would definitely recommend it and will be buying again.

review/text: If you are looking for great tasting pineapple treats, these are it!  I was buying from my local supermarket and they were charging me an arm and a leg for what I was getting.  These are less money, (sure you have to buy in bulk), and are much better tasting!  They have big pineapple chunks, which I like.  The only thing I would want changed, is less sugar or no sugar added.

review/summary: Iced coffe fan.
review/text: I'm a huge fan of the Keurig but in the Summer I need my iced coffee and previously I've been using 2 k-cups, or a making a very small cup of iced coffee because I didn't want it to be watered down.  I like my coffee reasonably robust although not quite as strong as some popular coffee shops make it, and I like a big cup, 20 oz. So the small cup wasn't working out for me and using 2 k-cups meant I was plowing through my box in no time at all.  Today I discovered the Green Mountain French Vanilla Iced Coffee. I filled my 20 oz plastic cup with ice just like it said and set my Keurig to the cup size closest to 8 oz. YUMMY!!!!!!  It's exactly what I had hoped it would be. Usually even a small amount of half and half and the ice would make my coffee too light and watered down, but it didn't.  It was great, I'm hooked already and I've only had one cup.  Also in case you are wondering.  There are 2 less k-cups in the box, BUT each cup weighs  more, .60 ounces verses .45 ounces. They simply put more coffee in the iced k-cups and the result makes me really happy. Just had my last sip which has been sitting on ice while I write my review, still yummy!!!  Hope this review helps.

review/summary: Have a LOT of ice on hand
review/text: The flavor of the coffee is great, but it requires almost an entire tray of ice to actually become "iced coffee." The directions state to put ice in the cup and brew the coffee over the ice. That's fine, but it melts all of the ice in the process (makes sense, it's brewing hot coffee directly over a cup of ice). So then you have to put several more ice cubes in the cup in order for it to actually get cold and for the ice not to melt. The good news is that even with all that melted water the coffee isn't too watered down. I'm guessing it's more concentrated to account for adding all the ice to it. It still tastes great and I'll definitely keep buying it-  I just hope I can keep up with filling my ice cube trays!

review/text: The Starbucks Via has an acceptable flavor, but they all leave an unpleasant grit on the tongue and lack the aroma of a brewed coffee.  If you are a coffee aficionado, Via is not a great experience.  Even so, it is much better than the free Ronoco coffee we have where I work and is nice to have for travel.  I consider Via strictly a backup.

I don't drink coffee often, so I keep a stash of the Via's around for when I actually do have a cup.  I like to enjoy my coffee when I drink it.<br /><br />The via packets are small.  You can put them in your pocket, purse, or even a wallet depending on the size of your wallet.  All you need is hot water and you will have a good cup of coffee.  They are great for camping too.<br /><br />My wife and I stopped using our french press to make coffee now that we have the 30 pack of Via's in the house.

review/summary: When grading on a curve, Via holds up.
review/text: I've tried both the Italian and Colombian Via varities, and while there's definitely a 'Starbuckiness' to both, neither is a substitute for the real thing. However there are times when the real thing just doesn't work, and at those times Via gets just enough things right to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I'll start out with the negatives. Both varieties remind of drinking from a pot of 'yesterdays' coffee. The kind where you can't finish the pot of coffee and rather than toss it all out, you let it sit and cool overnight and then reheat it the next morning. The next day the coffee is always more bitter and the flavor is flat as compared to a fresh brewed cup. Adding milk or cream helps, but the underlying flavor is still a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Though the worst part about the Via brand is the after-taste. There's something off about it. I don't know quite how to describe it. Almost like a tinge of paper/cardboard taste to it which is a bummer. I find I drink a cup of Via faster than a normal cup of coffee in order to combat that after-taste.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think I'm still likely to continue buying the Via brand. I understand this is instant coffee. I mean I'm tearing open a little pouch (love the design), dropping in some hot water, and I've got coffee. Just like that. That's pretty great. That ease of use, and fairly reasonable pricing means that in circumstances in which convenience trumps quality I can find a place for Via. Camping, too lazy to drive to a coffee shop, otherwise stuck drinking Folgers, quick pick-me-up during a zombie invasion, etc... are a few examples of when a packet of Via could come in handy.

review/text: I don't use VIA packets frequently, but I like to keep them on hand. When I purchased the 12-pack decaf VIA packets in the Starbucks store, the best before date was at least a few months away. The 6-pack of 3-count packets which I received from Amazon has a best before date which is about 5 weeks away. I doubt I can use 18 packets in 5 weeks, but I also saved a good amount versus what I would have paid in the store. It's really a matter of individual usage. Perhaps many people use one packet every couple of days, but I usually don't need it that frequently.

review/summary: Fair Substitute for no local Starbucks
review/text: Overall I've been very pleased with Starbucks' VIA products.  I've only tried the Italian and Columbia varieties.  The convenience is a major factor, and it beats the pants off anything "instant" I've ever had before.  Great for backpacking.  The ability to do a 50-count bulk purchase is the way to go, though, as buying 3-packs locally is steep--but perhaps not so much when one considers the price of a cup of the real thing.  My only beef is that my most recent purchase had a "best by" date just 2.5 months away (a complaint I've seen others make).  I spoke with a Starbucks rep who claimed it was still going to be fine for some unspecified time beyond that date, that they'd take my return if desired, but that they couldn't promise that the date on whatever replacement shipped from the warehouse would be any further distant.  Kind of lame...but I'm going through it quickly enough that the question is probably moot.

We had a system of grinding our beans and doing a cup at a time with our coffee that we brought with us.  We ran out in the middle of not coffee country.  We did find a Starbucks and got some Via to tide us over.  It isn't the Americano my husband does for us at home, but it has become a good substitute when we are traveling.  Still love our own beans...but this is good.  Certainly not like any other instant I have tasted...much, much, much better.

There's no longer a need to use my espresso machine or wait in line at my local Starbucks. The taste of the coffee is consistent with the bold Italian Roast coffee, and its equivalent to 'tall' size. Remember to use enough hot water and mix thoroughly, I had a few issues with grainy texture. Add to the bottom of the travel mug and pour boiling water over.

review/text: For thirty dollars, this fifty pack is a great price. The Via coffees taste a little different than a drip pot method, but it is much quicker, easier and leaves no mess. You just heat water in a microwave, add the coffee from the packet, stir and drink.<br /><br />I purchased these for my wife, but I occasionally have one as well. She is a stay at home mom and this quick, easy coffee is the best option.

review/text: Not too acidic, not too bitter -very well balanced. Have used wtih no problem at 6 months after expiration date on package. Just seemed a little "clumpy" at that point but tasted fine.  Much better value per unit than smaller packaging.  I ordered off the Starbucks site directly at this price, didn't notice a short expiration so wonder if it is Amazon fulfillment issue?

review/summary: Surprisingly Fresh, Rich Coffee Taste for Instant, but Pricey
review/text: I am a devotee of freshly made espresso coffee every morning which I make at home with a vacuum espresso pot. The results are a very full-bodied, strong coffee(I use Costco's Kirkland brand Columbian Supremo) that I add just hot water and half and half to. Similar to a double shot Cafe Americano at an espresso bar.<br /><br />I am absolutely NOT a fan of Starbuck's overpriced and over roasted coffee. I also despise coffeemaker Folgers coffee, if I can avoid it! And other instant coffee tastes bitter and watery to me.<br /><br />However, these little packets are quick, pack anywhere--like a purse, glovebox or suitcase--and make a fascinatingly GOOD cup of coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, on the strong side but no "Burnt" taste, and close to freshly brewed coffee as -- sheesh, it tastes like a fresh brewed cup. I am impressed. I add water and my half and half and it's better than good. I love Columbian coffee and this is the flavor I hoped for.<br /><br />Starbucks has done this right!<br /><br />The Downside: The cost is really an issue. I paid $5+ at Starbucks for a 3 pack. Then I got a 3 pack at Walmart recently for $2.99. This offer gets you more for about 80 cents each, but for instant? So I give the VIA coffee a 4 star rating even at the cheaper price.<br /><br />The quality is there though, so I plan to get some for my business trips out of town (no more running out for an expensive espresso) or as a backup in my purse. But I still use my espresso maker for my everyday cup.

review/summary: Better than other instant coffees...
review/text: I bought this when I saw that the price for 50 was much better than the price of the 8-pack or whatever in the SB store. I decided to give it a try. VIA coffee has a full flavor compared to other instant coffees, but it still isn't as good as a fresh cuppajoe. I love the convenience of these packages, since in my job, I don't always have time to go and find a cup of coffee. I can pour bottled water into my mug, pop it in the nuker, and then just pour the package into the steaming water. It also seems to be stronger than typical coffee, as far as the caffeine. All in all, I feel like I made a good choice. If I were you, and you were me, we'd be each other, and you'd know how I feel about the VIA coffee. I should mention here that I am NOT a huge fan of Starbucks coffee in general, but I was impressed with VIA. ONE COMPLAINT... the package. When you open the package, the opening is so narrow, that when you try to pour it into your steaming water, the steam makes the coffee powder get all sticky and clogs the opening. Other than that, I'm pretty happy with VIA. (But I'd rather have a nice fresh cup of french-press... or Dutch-press =))

review/summary: Watch out for expiration date and packaging
review/text: Although this is one of the best instant coffees in the world, I second another review here. Although getting a bulk pack of 50 of this at less than $1/pack (cheaper than buying it a Strbux) the expiration is 6 months. So, unless you consume one of these at least 2-3 times per week - which I don't per se - watch out. Also, I shaved off a star bc of the poor packaging design of the individual packets. When you tear off the corner (the way they indicate where and how to open it)  the opening is still very small and a fair amount of powder is still left in the packet unless you shake it vigorously and make sure it all comes out, or simply chop off the top with a scissor.

review/summary: The perfect compromise: Drinkable instant coffee
review/text: Better than all other instants, as good as many brewed coffees, Starbucks VIA is a great balance between fast, easy and good.  Heat your water, tap the powder out of the tube into a cup, pour and stir.  No grinding, no filters, no mudding the beans; it's just as fast, and just as easy, and spooning crystals out of a jar.  But Starbucks VIA is far, far superior to any other kind of instant, and gives a lot of second rate brews a run for their money.  Is it as good as my best beans, freshly ground and brewed?  No.  But it's better than the coffee that comes out of Keurig packs, and better than the coffee from fast-food restaurants.  And it's instant.  Sometimes you'll want to take the time and trouble for the best possible cup of coffee; and sometimes you'll just want a dang cup of something hot, strong and black.  For those times VIA is a great choice.

review/summary: Nice Idea, good flavor, a little bitter
review/text: This product gets a 4 star vs 5 star due to one little factor, bitterness. For the most part making a cup of coffee without a coffee maker couldn't be more easy or delicious, though I find that these Via Ready Brews (all flavors I've tried so far) have often a hint of a bitter after taste. Its not so bad that its undesirable, however, I'm sure that goes with having the ground micro-ground to produce your coffee as opposed to filtering through larger grounds to make coffee. I will say as for 'instant' coffee - this is one of the best I've had. Each flavor has a distinct aroma and taste. Doesn't quite replace a freshly brewed cup of coffee though.

It's a little pricey in comparison to regular drip coffee, but I am willing to pay that price for not having to clean the coffee pot, grind beans, wait for it to brew, etc when I am in a hurry to get to work in the mornings. One packet makes a large cup of coffee. I use about 14 oz of water and that still has plenty of flavor. In fact, I am drinking a cup of it right now. ;-)

review/text: I travel a lot, often to places where nescafe (ugh) is high end. So my comfort was Via but the packaging is so irresponsible. So I experimented. I have now taken several multi-week trips with a plastic bag of  Bustelo Instant Espresso  measured out from a jar. I used it with just boiling water - or hot milk and water - its as good if not better than Via despite my snobby skepticism about preservation of taste. And I feel I am not adding as much  to a scary pile of non biodegradable waste. Starbucks says they care about environmental stuff but I'm not a crunchy and I can see how marketing has over-run ethic.

review/text: Ordered a 50 pack to be delivered directly from Starbucks.  Two weeks later, received an email from Amazon stating that seller (Starbucks) failed to deliver the product by the date they said they would when purchased, so I should contact them directly for status.  When I did, the Starbucks rep told me they had processing issues on the date I placed my order (for a number of people) and had cancelled it.  When I asked why they failed to even tell me this prior to me reaching out to them, they had no answer.  To compound matters, they then refused to send me a replacement order for the same price I previously paid.  Seriously???  I usually don't write negative reviews, but this experience goes well over the line for me.  Obviously, Starbucks has gotten so big that they could care less about making their customers whole after THEY mess up. Shame on you Starbucks....and I guess shame on me for liking your freakin coffee so much.

I like my coffee strong, rich, smart, flavorful, and easy.... just like my lovers.  You see, I used to be a total coffee snob: roasting and grinding, steeping and pressing,etc. but why make the mess when I can just open a Via and enjoy.  I especially love that I can get two great cups of coffee out of each pack.  I put half of a pack in a cup and then add instant decaf to round it out.  The Via is strong enough,and flavorful enough, to pick up the slack of the decaf.  AND at that rate, a nickle-pincher like me can get a great cup of coffee for about 35 cents, plus half & half.  I run a small Midwest corporation, and do some traveling, so I keep 4 or 5 packs of Via, (and a bottle of Bailey's) in my carry-on.  Try it.  It'll change your life! After your first sip, the sky will open up and you'll find God!  --- (Relax! ..I'm just kidding there.)

(I prefer whole milk)<br />I no longer pay $4 for iced latte at a cafe because this is so much better.

review/summary: Does the job
review/text: When I travel to Africa it is difficult to get good coffee.  I am not a fan of the Nestle instant coffee that is available.  I take VIA to give the instant coffee a bit of a better taste.  Of course nothing beats coffee beans and my espresso maker at home, but it does the job.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good!
review/text: It's probably been over 30 years since I last bought instant coffee, but I'm in a temporary situation separated from my beloved Bodum French press, as well as drinking alone (sigh...) so I needed something convenient. Very, very pleasantly surprised by the full-bodied and satisfying taste of this coffee.

review/summary: Can't imagine living without it....
review/text: Not only is this the best instant coffee, but it is better than most brewed coffee.  It definitely helps me get through the work day without the headaches associated with the "office coffee pot."  Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent, convenient coffee
review/text: Everything about this product is excellent.  It's Starbucks so you know it's pretty good coffee.  The instant kind is much better than others available on the market.  The fact that it comes in such a huge quantity at such a good price is simply awesome.  Would buy it again!

review/summary: More for  me!
review/text: For those of you who are freaked out about a little expiration date on the coffee... are you SERIOUS?  Do you know that there is a coffee out there called Kopi luwak ? (seriously, Google it!) yeah, it is pooped out of a civet cat and sold for 600 bucks a pound.  So, really...  this is not MILK for crying out loud.  You all can stop buying it then, and that will be just more for me!  NOW, on to my review.<br /><br />This is the BEST coffee ever.  And you can not beat the price.  If you poured a cup of fresh brewed into one cup, and then made this instant coffee and put it in another cup, I DEFY you to tell the difference... in fact, I would lay odds that you would point to the instant and call it fresh ground/fresh brewed!

review/summary: Use HOT water, stir, let sit, stir again
review/text: I like it so much, I pretty often wait until I'm home to make a cup instead of stopping for coffee at a restaurant or coffee house.<br /><br />I've read some complaints about bitter "sludge" in the bottom of the cup. Try using really hot water - almost boiling - stir it, let it sit 10-15 seconds, and then stir it again. That seems to dissolve it completely.

review/summary: Instant Coffee
review/text: This is the best instant coffee I have had.  It is as good as most freshly brewed coffees, so I no longer brew coffee; I simply heat water to add to my Starbucks instant. The price through Amazon is very affordable.

review/summary: When you don't have time to brew coffee...
review/text: When I want a quick cup of coffee or coffee offsite, Starbucks instant VIA (instant) is the best product I've ever used. And the price at Amazon can't be beat. This is my second or third time ordering it and I'll continue to do so. Mind you, it doesn't taste like wonderful, brewed coffee. But it the first truly drinkable instant I've encountered.

review/summary: One of the first things in my suitcase!
review/text: I was never a fan of instant coffee until Starbuck's came out with Via. Now a bag of these little packets is one of the first things into my suitcase when I travel (which is often).<br /><br />Even in good hotels the quality of the coffee service in the room is quite variable, and now I know I'll have a decent cup of coffee no matter what the hotel offers.
