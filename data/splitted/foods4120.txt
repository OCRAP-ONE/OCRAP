review/summary: Should have saved my money...
review/text: I should have saved my money, but curiosity got the best of me. I did not have great expectations for this product, but when it arrived, I was surprised to see how small the gumballs were,that when chewed became pretty small in the mouth. The flavor left something to be desired, as it had a smokey chemical taste to them which to me was not enjoyable. Perhaps it would be enjoyed by someone else. By the way I love bacon, but this was not bacon.

review/summary: Another Great Product From Blue Dog Bakery
review/text: The folks at Blue Dog Bakery have added yet another great product to their line of wholesome pet treats.  As with other Blue Dog Bakery products, no animal by-products, artificial flavorings and/or other ingredients that can be harmful or unhealthy for pets have been added.  These bones are harder and apparently tastier than other similar "chew bone" products such as milk bones. I base this on the fact that, when given a choice between these chew bones, rawhide type bones or other milk bone types, my Labs chose these bones over any of the other offerings every time.  I completely stopped buying any chew products made from rawhide after both reading several Vet written articles regarding the dangers of giving your pets rawhide chew products and having a discussion with my Labs Vet.  These bones are a bit pricey but considering they are made from all natural ingredients I am willing to pay the price in order to try and ensure my Labs have both longer and healthier life spans.  My Labs give this product a "Five Paw" rating.

review/summary: Doublemint is great
review/text: I found that Doublemint lasts longer than any "long lasting" gum.  It's also the best tasting.  Part of that reason is that it uses natural sugar as the sweetener.  The sugar does cause plaque buildup, so I got to brush my teeth more often when I'm chewing this gum.<br /><br />Also the "Cancer warning" review is unfounded, the person who wrote that doesn't know how to do research.

But at the same time, doublemint actually makes your breath smell just as great.  Isn't that wonderful?  Wrigley's Doublement gum is certainly for me.  A 15-stick gum pack would keep your minty fresh breath going strong for several weeks (unless you have a gum chewing addiction... then it'd be gone in a few days).  Just don't spend more than 5 bucks.  15 dollars is a major ripoff.

review/text: First, I wish they'd change the picture--it's an old one and the boxes look much different now.  I requested that they do months ago but they (Amazon) haven't. OK, to the review.  Kashi cereals are great but most of them have too much sugar for me. This one doesn't and has so many benefits. It's whole grain and delicious. It's similar to Grape Nuts but without all the junk that Grape Nuts has and it takes so much better.  You can eat it plain with milk or I love it in place of a granola topping.  In the mornings I eat fruit and yogurt with flax and chia seeds and top with these Kashi Whole Grain Nuggets and viola Healthy Yumminess.  It fills one up and lasts for hours.

review/text: I read the rave reviews.  Bought the six-pack and thought I would have a new tasty and healthy go-to cereal for my mornings.  Poured out some in a bowl.  Added some milk.  Crunch, crunch.  Hmmmm...this doesn't taste like a breakfast cereal.  So, I added some sugar.  Crunch, crunch.  Nope.  :(<br /><br />I'll try what others suggest - using it with fruit, yogurt, etc., but as the recipe on the side indicates, this cereal may be better suited to tabouleh!<br /><br />If you're considering buying this, just note that this is not a cereal meant to be eaten unmodified.  You'll need a sweetener and fruit to make it palatable.

I've even used it in making bread - it turns out a really hearty, dense loat that's positively out of this world delicious!

review/summary: Fantastic Healthy Salt with Wonderful Flavor
review/text: This is an amazing salt. Since it is not processed like table salt all the nutrients in it from the ocean stay in the salt. This salt is actually good for you, just google sea salt for tons of articles on its health benefits. Now on top of that the Flower of the Ocean brand is just exquisite in taste. Just a little bit brings food to life, on chicken, mixed in some ground beef, soup, you name it, it really tastes great and awakens other flavors. Oh and as for the other reviewers crazy rant about the price, most companies list stuff at higher MSRP's and then have the correct price as the sale price. It's a tactic that's been going on for years. And in the  old Celtic Sea Salt catalog you actually had to pay that high MSRP unless you bought a membership from them, so that could be where they got there MSRP from. Anyway if you want an amazing healthy salt and are willing to pay a little extra for it. And remember a little goes a long way so the price isn't so bad in the long run.

review/summary: Tasty! and affordable on autoship
review/text: It almost seems silly to me to write a review on refried beans, but having recently started on the "4 Hour Body" slow-carb diet we are eating a lot of them.  My wife has always favored mexican food, and the typical store-brand or name-brand refried beans smelled and tasted, well, not good.  I would usually comment while preparing dinner that they looked exactly how I remembered canned dog food looked when I was feeding my dog as a kid, and smelled the same as well.  So that's how we found Amy's, and I have to say they're the first refried beans that I actually enjoy eating.  However in the retail stores they are around $3.20/can where I live with a slight discount for a case.  I ordered these online and signed up for the monthly autoship since we eat them several times a week now, and the cost was around $27/case of 12, free shipping.  I've tried a few other organic brands but to me Amy's still wins.  Note that the low-sodium version has half the sodium as the regular version, and this seems to hold true for all of their low-sodium canned beans.  The Organic black beans are also very good, better in fact to my palate.

review/summary: Taste Wonderful
review/text: I had always used another brand of canned refried beans and switched to Amy's Organic because they were about the same price as my old brand, and I've come to prefer organic products when I can get them.  I will not go back to my old brand.  These refried beans taste like the pinto beans they are made with, and they have just enough onions, garlic, and other spices to complement the beans rather than overpower the flavor of the beans.  As well, they don't seem as "heavy" as other beans that I've eaten.  I will definitely buy these beans again.<br /><br />I was disappointed, though, that most of the cans were dented and damaged.  This doesn't seem to have affected the quality of the product, but it does seem odd that so many damaged cans were sent in one order.  It seems to me that the shipper may be at fault here and may be sending the dented cans because it might be easier to cast them off on the internet-order crowd--they aren't as likely to return them as a shopper in a store would be not to buy them without a discount.

However, the product is rather bland and the texture is almost like bean soup. Even mixed one to one with Amy's whole pinto beans (drained) and cooked to thicken some, the resulting texture still makes a very messy burrito.

review/text: I was buying these at Whole foods for way too much and my kids love them so much they eat them out of the can so I decided to buy them by the case and we order a case about every 2 months.  They taste great, are organic and have reduced sodium.  Absoultely love them for beans and rice or quesadillas.  They are a staple in our vegetarian household.

review/summary: Great product.  Surprisingly dented cans not good.
review/text: In deciding to buy this item, I read the other reviews and expected a few dented cans.  Yet, I wasn't prepared for what I got.  10 out of the 12 cans were seriously, seriously dented.  I do fully understand that this does not affect the food's safety or nutritional value, but really!  We all know that crushed pages and a torn cover do not affect a book's readability, yet Amazon would not be in business today if they applied the same care in storing and shipping to their books as they do to their canned food goods.  All supermarkets that don't have an on-site cannery deal with shipped cans, and storing cans. Amazon may be entering a retail sector that it cannot so far handle.<br />I just have to point out that even though it may have been easier to buy these off Amazon, it is certainly not cheaper (even with the subscription discount - BTW, I cancelled my subscription after unpacking the cans).  For in fact, they were so dented that no brick & mortar supermarket would think to sell these at anything more than half-off the price.  To see the amount of denting, I uploaded a photo to the product description page.<br />In terms of the product itself, it's something I've loved for a long time.  Just buy a single can of it at a grocery store and try it before buying the 12-pack.  Make sense?

review/summary: Even with less salt they're still great
review/text: I'm a fan of these, the taste does take a bit getting used to at first for some (It did for me), but that's due to the lower amounts of sodium than most beans (sometimes up to 80%+ of your recommended daily intake).  Instead of a salty taste you get a hint of garlic and other flavors, the beans actually taste a bit sweet too (at least to me).  I've really grown to like the taste and the fact that they're better for me is even nicer.<br /><br />Perhaps the only downside really is the cost, but that's cut down some with the subscribe and save, although they won't ever be as cheap as $1/can like some can be found on sale for, but better quality just costs more, plain and simple.

review/text: I was surprised to find a black tea that has licorice in it, usually licorice is reserved for herbal teas.  The mix of ginseng, peppermint and licorice is an unusual taste treat, one I would recommend to others.  The mint is strong, the licorice sweet.  I normally don't like ginseng in teas, this ginseng stays in the back of the brew and isn't that noticeable yet I am sure I still get the health benefits from it.

review/summary: Best Nacho Cheese Ever!!!
review/text: This is the best nacho cheese ever! We use this cheese on our fajitas, tacos, and chips. When this product was scarce to find I went to more than a dozen stores until I found one store that carried it and I bought all fourteen cans. As these got low I began searching on the web and was unable to find it. I sent in many request to bring it back. Thankfully as I approached 3 cans left I found it on Amazon and bought 2 cases. I've not found another nacho cheese sauce that makes our mexican dinners at home taste so good. I highly recommend this product, my family loves it and won't eat mexican food at home without it.

review/summary: This is the nacho cheese to get
review/text: I've tried perhaps dozens of brands and varieties of store-bought nacho cheese (or types of salso con queso).  None of them are nearly as good as this for use with chips or in a burrito.  Coming out of the (tin) can, this stuff is a little scary (my wife and I refer to it as "scary nacho cheese"), but once you microwave it and stir it's smooth, creamy, and has just the right amount of heat for us.  I've tried the hot and mild varieties, but the medium is most versatile and shouldn't be too hot for most people.  It's easy to add some of your favorite hot sauce (I like Cholula) to make it a little spicier.<br /><br />This was cheaply available where I used to live (below the Amazon bulk price), but it's much harder to find where I am now.  Look for it in a Mexican section of the grocery store, not anywhere near chips or most other salsas, but usually nearer Goya canned products.

review/text: This is the most nacho cheesey sauce that you can store buy. And best of all it is at a great price. It has a real cheese taste and believe me I have had to try several to find something with out that "fake taste" this is all REAL taste. I like all, Regular, Hot, and Mild. I am so happy Amazon is carrying this product because it has become impossible to find locally anymore. I like it so much I've "subscribed" it! I recommend anyone who like wonderful creamy nacho cheese do the same. It great as a base for more sortof homemade sauces, just aad sausage crumbles or bacon or any meat you want, or add tomatoes but it is great straight out of the can. I even shared it with a co-worker who is of Mexican descent who makes her own nacho cheese from scratch and she thought it was really good too!

review/summary: Liquid Cheese, No thickness
review/text: I bought this item and from what the reviews had me believe that this was like ball park nacho cheese.  I had previously gotten Ortega Nacho Cheese Mild in the large Aluminum can (maxwell coffee type can) and it was too much of a hassle and wasn't hot enough.  I read the reviews thinking this should be better and hotter.  Turns out it was neither, this cheese was mostly liquid before the microwave but after you could literally put it in a glass and drink it.  Completely disgusting.  Do not get me wrong, I would eat all sort of processed cheese, meats whatever, but this is not even close to what it should be.  Going back to BJs and getting the Ortega!

review/text: This cheese was expensive compared to other brands I found, but I figured why not try it (bad idea to try things in bulk...). It has a really high sodium content (one can will exceed 140% your daily value). It is also not thick at all. It's so runny it can barely stay on the chip. Save your money and spend it elsewhere, on other brands.

review/summary: Low-cost green tea with an added punch
review/text: I am not a huge fan of Lipton teas in general, but this variety struck my fancy - the traditional green tea with passionfruit, orange, and jasmine.  I compared it side-by-side with the plain green tea from Lipton and there is a very noticeable difference.  This variety is less harsh and bitter, more smooth and engaging.  It's great when tea has a bit of a fruity taste to it (Earl Grey is the prime example) and this tea definitely pulls it off.  True, it's not quite on the level of other gourmet teas (hence the 4 stars), but for the price, you would be hard-pressed to find a better value.  Highly recommended for green tea aficionados who want a little something different in their traditional blend.

Curious, his grandpa and I tasted it before grandson arrived , and we were pleasantly surprised --it was similar to other flaky breakfast choices, especially that one known as "the breakfast of Champions".<br /><br />Since it is organic, and it has no added sugars, it meets with the approval of the ultra-health conscious parent. It also tastes good, especially with sliced bananas, so don't be afraid to try it.

review/text: I suffer from diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome when I visit many countries in the world.  Usually I eat many exotic dishes that use animal parts or spices that disrupt the large intestine.<br /><br />When I am at home, I pick up a few old grain cereals, which are a good source of fiber.<br /><br />Spelt was an important grain in parts of Europe from the Bronze Age to medieval times.  It is an excellent source of vitamin B2, a very good source of manganse, and a good source of niacin, thiamin, and copper. This particular combination of nutrients provided by spelt may make it a particularly helpful food for persons with diarrhea, migraine headaches, atherosclerosis, or diabetes.<br /><br />It has a good natural taste free of anything artificial.  It may seem boring but I crunch it up alone or with milk.  It's really good.

I can't imagine what this company's other flavors smell like.<br /><br />The taste is also good but it is somewhat more subtle than I would have thought. I wish the company would have used a bit more vanilla or a bit more mint in the manufacturing process. It is still a very nice tea and, according to the box, there are an estimated 50 cups to each box.<br /><br />The boxes I received came sealed in a plastic bag. None of the tea had come loose from the boxes during shipping but I was glad to see the added protection around the tea because it is a loose tea. According to a note included with the tea, the packaging is eco-friendly. A snapshot of this disclosure is in the image gallery.<br /><br />I'm trying to transition to diet that has less caffeine. Tea has been my go-to beverage. This particular beverage is a tisane and is naturally caffeine free. The box has a caffeine comparison chart between this tea and others. Please see the image gallery.<br /><br />You don't need to add anything to this tea but this tea can be quite flavorful with a bit of agave and/or milk (in my case coconut milk) for those preferring a little extra in their teas. The box indicates that this tea contains trace amounts of sugar and dairy.<br /><br />I use a Finum brewing basket for this tea and I have no problems with tea escaping into my mug. I will be buying more flavors of this brand in the future.

review/summary: My new favorite dessert tea!
review/text: I had this tea after dinner at a restaurant about a month ago and loved it! I was so happy to see that Amazon offered this tea and at a decent price. ($14 for 2 boxes, approximately 50 cups per box) Since I received this about a week ago (along with the "Buccaneer" tea) I've had about 2 cups a day. I put just a tiny bit of milk/creamer and about a half packet of artificial sweetener and it tastes like a mild mint hot chocolate. Since it's caffeine free you can have a cup after dinner and before bed without worrying that it will keep you up all night.

review/text: I was looking to get some loose leaf tea and I'm glad I took a chance on buying some SerendipiTea, this one is delicious.  I think the smell of the tea is much stronger than the taste, I may try brewing longer or adding an extra tsp next time but overall I'm very happy with this tea and will probably order more flavors from this company pretty soon!

review/summary: Decadent & delivered to your door!
review/text: If you've never had these, they're really just a traditional Double Stuff Oreo with a vanilla cookie rather than a dark chocolate one. DH & I like to pull them apart and make "quadruple stuffs," but the leftover vanilla cookies don't go to waste. The golden cookies are just as good by themselves as they are with the frosting in the middle. They sort of make me think of a Twinkie with a crispy cookie outside and extra thick creamy inside, if you want an idea of flavor.<br /><br />I got them on Subscribe & Save, which makes them about the same price as the local supermarket, and I don't have to leave the house to get them. Amazon's subscription policy is incredibly flexible and makes it easy to keep both treats like this and essentials on hand without a huge commitment. For us, the cookie and subscription combination are a winner!

review/summary: Produces thin, watery hot chocolate
review/text: Yes, these are hot chocolate capsules that fit in Caffitaly coffee machines. No, they don't make very good chocolate. How could they? Think about the various ways of making a good cup of hot chocolate, and then try to figure out how anyone could stuff that into a little capsule -- it's not possible.<br /><br />Even if you want a mocha, there are better ways to make one than one capsule of espresso and one capsule of this chocolate in the same cup.<br /><br />Is it truly awful? No. Just not very rich and satisfying. And you're supposed to use the "long espresso" setting when making hot chocolate, so it doesn't produce very much -- I think it's just 3 ounces.

review/text: These samosas remind me of empanadas. You have a bread stuffed with delicious food. We keep these frozen in the freezer, then defrost in the microwave and cook for 15 minutes in the conventional oven at 350 degrees. They are spicy to me. The chutney (yogurt and mint leaves) helps cut the spices. 4 samosas to a box with 6 boxes comes to ~$1 a samosa--expensive to us. Per samosa: calories 190; calories from fat 90; total fat 10g; saturated fat 4g; trans fat 0; cholesterol 0; sodium 397mg (16% RDA); total carbs 21g; fiber 2g; sugar 1g; protein 4g.

review/summary: Incredibly tasty, incredibly spicy - worth the $$$'s for indian food lovers !!
review/text: I absolutely LOVED their samosas.  There are 4 samosas in one 11-oz package.  They're really supposed to be just appetizers but after just eating 2 or 3 of them for lunch at work, I was full and I didn't feel like eating anything else.  They're HUGE - like large eggrolls folded over and stuffed with peas and potatoes in a spicy mixture and the mint chutney condiment adds a delightful complex flavor to the samosas.  I microwaved my samosas but to get the real fried texture, it's probably better to fry them in a little oil.  I have to agree with other reviewers that their samosas rival what you'll find in a really good Indian restaurant.  I've never seen them made so good and so huge and so authentic by any other indian food maker.  You may want make a type of raita with the mint chutney condiment by adding sour cream or greek yogurt or regular yogurt to it to help cool down the spicy heat from the samosas and make the chutney creamier and less liquidy.  I also usually add loose leaf lettuce/herbs and sliced cucumbers to my raita like it's a "cooling" salad-raita mixture.  Instead of dessert, finish your meal down while cooling down your palate with the smooth refreshing indian yogurt mango smoothie-like drink while eating your meal with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J1B136">Rasna Lassi Mix Mango</a>  or  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XHFG70">Rellure Kesar Mango Pulp, 30-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>  which is a lot more cooling than drinking iced water or other cold drink.  It's too bad they don't have lamb samosas like they have in the indian restaurants - i LOVE lamb!<br /><br />Other wonderful products of theirs to try are their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GOYT1O">Tandoor Chef Chicken Tikka Masala, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> or their quite incredibly tasty biryanis <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GOYT4G">Tandoor Chef Chicken Biryani, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> or their Masala Dosa as light appetizers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZKCQL2">Tandoor Chef Masala Dosa, 14-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> or their very spicy tasty <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OBTYL2">Tandoor Chef Lamb Vindaloo, 9.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/text: I had these samosas for the first time when I bought them at Wegman's but every time I went back they never had them stocked so I came on Amazon and saw them. They do cost more than the individual boxes do but since shipping was included and they came in one day I really didn't mind, especially when you consider that at a restaurant they cost $4 for 2 usually. Samosas are my favorite from Indian restaurants and these definitely satisfy the craving for them! The chutney enhances them even more.

review/text: I was a little skeptical when I first saw the listing for these on Amazon.  Then I read the reviews..and it looked promising.  These are shipped to you chill-packed, so they do arrive cold to your door.  I wasn't sure about that, but when they arrived everything was great.  THESE ARE WONDERFUL SAMOSAS!!!  The chutney that came with them was also excellent.  They are a little expensive, but when we moved from the east to Colorado we found it a little more difficult to find our favored Indian food.  As a once in a while treat they help to fulfill the homesickness of the east.

review/summary: RESTAURANT QUALITY SAMOSAS
review/text: I have been an aficianado of Indian food for more than thirty years, thanks to my now-fiance who introduced me to it when we were quite young, and have eaten in many fine Indian restaurants. I decided to try these samosas even though I was not familiar with the TANDOOR CHEF brand. I am extremely pleased with the taste and quality. They are as good as those you get in a high-quality Indian restaurant, actually better than most I have had, and rival the very best. The outer shell of the samosa is crispy yet tender. It's not greasy and has a lovely flavor. The filling of potato and peas is almost perfect. The taste is fresh with complex flavors and the proper spicing. Just the right amount of heat and celantro as well. The addition of packets of mint chutney is a nice touch. The chutney is a proper bright green and has a vibrant, fresh mint flavor. It's not too salty as many are either. My only criticism is that they should have supplied more of it. The two packets are quite small. The samosa boxes arrived in a styrofoam box packed with dry ice and all were still frozen. They cook-up in about 15 minutes in a 350 degree oven. If you like Indian food you absolulutely cannot go wrong with these samosas. They are delicious.

review/text: These samosa have a great flavor, just enough spice to bring heat, but not disrupt the good taste of the other ingredients. The chutney is okay, but these are fine without that addition. 4 stars simply because the price is a bit high for what you get - 4 samosa that are simply and accent to a meal, not a meal in and of themselves. Would purchase again.

review/summary: Inferior quality caused by PGPR
review/text: Unwrapping an egg it appears to be VERY slippery. When eating an egg I can taste the peanut butter and the supposed chocolate coating taste very OILY with ONLY a slight hint of cocoa. After eating an egg it leaves my mouth with an oily feeling. Whether this candy really causes it or not I don't know but after eating several I later had lots of burps. From now on, I will avoid any candy which contains this PGPR simply because of the oily texture and lack of taste of real chocolate.<br /><br />Wikipedia says: It is used by chocolate makers to reduce the cost of raw material. Since 2006, commercial-grade candy bars, such as those made by Hersheys and Nestle, made an industry-wide switch to include PGPR as an ingredient - a possible indicator of a cost-saving measure by the commercial chocolate industry. Makers of PGPR such as Danisco and Palsgaard indicate PGPR can be used to replace the more expensive cocoa butter as an ingredient in chocolate. Palsgaard's website asserts, "Cocoa butter is an expensive raw material for chocolate manufacturers. By using PALSGAARD 4150 the chocolate recipe has lower costs in terms of less cocoa butter but also gives the benefit of having less fat."<br /><br />"Less fat". Guess I'm one who like fat better than an oily substitute. Ingredients such as PGPR should be shown for consumable items IMHO.

I've never had an Amy's food product that I didn't like and these beans are no exception.<br /><br />The flavor is so distinct and hard to describe, but it's very similar to the same flavors in Amy's Chili. It has a depth of flavor that you never get with canned beans, but you do with these. Definitely, worth a try if you've never had these.<br /><br />Since none of my local grocery stores keep the refried beans in stock, I'll be back here again and again for more because once you've had Amy's beans, you'll never go back to the other brands.<br /><br />Plus, these are gluten free.

We will happily continue to buy these beans on a regular basis.  Amy's is a great brand, and these refried beans are simply terrific.  We love the spices and the flavor, and prefer the "Traditional" over the "Amy's Refried Black Beans" (although these are pretty good too).  Thanks again, Amazon.

review/summary: Great refried beans!
review/text: Of all the canned beans I've tried, these are the best. Good flavor and very little "tinny" taste. Like all things canned, don't expect to eat without extra flavoring (garlic, kosher/sea salt, fresh ground pepper, etc). My 6 year-old loves them in an easy quesadilla (buttered, cast iron skillet warmed tortilla, beans and cheese). Great price from Amazon. They beat anything I can find locally, unfortunately.

review/summary: the BEST refried beans
review/text: As with all Amy's Organics products, these refried beans are great. Just heat and serve or eat cold out of the can! All the flavor is there with the added benefits of being kosher, organic and vegan.

review/summary: Phoenix Home & Garden taste test winner
review/text: I'm going to try these refried beans.  I just noticed in the March 2009 issue of Phoenix Home & Garden magazine, Amy's won the taste test over five other brands.

review/summary: The 2nd order had at least 3 dented cans
review/text: That's a lot of dented cans, and there were even ones in the middle of the pack.  The un-dented cans tasted very good, though.
