review/summary: sugar substitute candies
review/text: After years of consumption of regular sugar, a recent diagnosis of prediabetes has led me on the search for sweeteners that will not affect my insulin levels. While I do not yet have Type 2 diabetes, I am confident in saying I don't want to get it. I have relatives that do have it, and I don't really want to join their ranks.<br /><br />I have tried many of the sweets (candy, gum, chocolates) that contain this sweetener, and I must say, I was quite surprised. There is a bit of a cooling sensation to this sweetener, an almost mintish sensation, but I do like it. These lollipops are the perfect choice when a sweet craving hits. Xylitol is a healthy alternative to regular sugar, and much safer than the artificial sweeteners out there. Given a choice of having no sugar in my life, this was a godsend.

review/summary: healthy lollipops
review/text: I actually like these lollipops a lot, but some are better than others (I like the grape flavor!) The xylitol candy was recommended for my mom, who was recently diagnosed with shogrins. The doctors told her the xylitol would help her "dry mouth" produce saliva and reduce dental decay. She enjoys them, and they do help. The only problem is they become very sharp, and she has to be careful with her already painful tongue.

review/summary: My Favorite Snack!  And so healthy too...
review/text: These individual packets of almonds are the perfect snack or mini-meal if you're trying to do the six-a-day small meals instead of three larger ones.<br /><br />Each package holds 1 oz. which represents 160 calories; 14g fat (the very good kind - almonds are heart healthy); 10mg sodium (when do you ever see such a low salt content - and this is natural sodium in the almonds, not salted nuts); 190mg potassium (having leg cramps?); 5g carbs; and 2g fiber (subtract from the carbs for an ECC of only 3 grams of carbs per serving; ECC = effective carbohydrate count).<br /><br />I do have to say that there is the occasional stale, chewy nut in the bunch but I haven't been able to find any almonds from any supplier or in any form that doesn't have them.  Can't really say why because some nuts are fresh & crunchy but a few just aren't.<br /><br />I won't deduct a star for that simply because it seems to be the nature of the food...large cans, large or small bags, they all have some "chewy" ones.<br /><br />The individual packaging helps me monitor just how many I eat, too, because I could just sit down with a party can of almonds and have a party by myself...until they were all gone in one fell swoop.<br /><br />If you like flavored nuts, you could add your own seasonings such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N625Q8">GARLIC SALT FRESHLY PACKED IN LARGE JARS, spices, herbs, seasonings</a> if you want something with a little more punch.

review/text: Great way to have a snack on the go. These almonds are awesome - they're raw and fresh, full of flavor and snap.<br /><br />I love the small size - saves me from having to buy small snack sized plastic bags. They're pricey but if you wait for Amazon to have a sale and combine it with a subscribe and save subscription, they end up being cheaper per ounce than if you get them at Trader Joe's or CVS on sale (both I think are $4.99/lb for raw almonds.)

review/summary: Good product
review/text: I really like these almonds, they are raw and have about 6 grams of protein per 1 oz bag.  These were less per ounce with Subscribe & Save than a lot of the other raw almonds on Amazon (when you include their shipping costs) and with the 10% additional savings from the mastercard promotion that ends 10/31/2012.  I decided that the individual packaging is worth the small amount extra I paid.  If this experiment in portion control goes well, I may order another brand and bag them myself.  Now that I have Amazon Prime, some of the other brands will be quite a bit less expensive per ounce with free shipping.  I do like that this company has been family run for generations and that these are Nonpareil Almonds, so will take that into consideration.  The almonds are packaged in 2 boxes with 24 bags in each box.  They arrived very quickly and in good condition.

review/summary: Since it doesn't make good bread -- some ideas to use the remaing 20 pounds!
review/text: Like another reviewer, we only have home-made bread in our house and have not bought a loaf of bread in 30 years. So, I am an experienced bread maker.<br />My first loaf of bread, made with a favorite recipe failed. While it did rise, the texture was similar to a "quick" bread made with baking powder. (I use my KitchenAid to kneed for about 8 minutes, then do a final 5 or 6 minute hand kneed to check for "feel" of the dough.) We made two sandwiches from it, then fed the rest to the goats.<br />I went to the Great River Organic Milling web-site to look at their recipes and made one using my KitchenAid rather than a bread machine. Once again, the texture was unacceptable. Finally, I made a honey/butter french bread from a recipe we have been using for years. While the dough rose during the pre-shaping rise, after shaping it went to sleep. When it was finally double in bulk I baked it -- and once again -- good taste, but quick bread texture.<br />An other reviewer has had similar problems.<br />So, what to do with the 20 pound of flour you have left? I have found that the flour makes great crackers --olive oil, flour water and what ever seasonings and flavors you want. (My recipe comes from Fine Cooking, but there are many on the web.) The Great River Bread flour can also be used in several of the recipes in "Simply Great Breads<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600852971">Simply Great Breads: Sweet and Savory Yeasted Treats from America's Premier Artisan Baker</a>It works in the crescent rolls (pg 58) and in the flatbreads beginning on page 75.<br />I hope this comment helps other like me that have a great deal of bread flour that they do not wish to use in "regular" bread. I'm down to 15 pounds left to go!

review/summary: Awesome organic flour at an even better price!
review/text: This flour makes the most delicious wheat bread.  I ordered it expecting it to be more white than wheat but it actually has a very wheaty color.  However, after reading about it on the Great River Milling website, I learned that it is in fact wheat but has had 80% of the bran removed.  It bakes up nicely and does not have that sour taste that I have often associated with whole wheat bread.  So, if you are looking for organic white bread flour, keep looking but for a light wheat alternative, this is perfect.  I would also suggest checking out the company website for info on all their different flours.  You can also order individual bags there if you don't want to get 20lbs of something when you aren't quite sure you are going to like it.  Amazon rocks for bulk purchase and the free shipping and discount through subscribe and save is awesome!!!  I'll definitely continue to use Amazon every chance I get!!!

review/summary: Big surprise
review/text: This product had a lot of great reviews, so it was a big surprise to find it really was not a good product for me.<br /><br />Although the baked goods made with this flour tasted good, with a nice flavor, it did not knead well, and refused to rise well.<br /><br />So the bread it made was good-tasting, but with terrible texture.<br /><br />I tried more than one thing to make it work, and more than one recipe. All failed, and the common element was this flour. I used it in a bread machine, and it didn't work. The dough did not come together into a ball, but remained crumbly, almost like cookie dough. Everything was right, and the recipe was a proven one. All ingredients were measured correctly, the proper yeast (fresh and in perfect condition) was used, and used correctly, but the dough would not come together well, nor would it rise well.<br /><br />My wife also tried to use it in homemade recipes, using our big stand mixer to knead the bread, but that bread also failed. Again, she used proven recipes, but with this flour, had poor results.<br /><br />Finally, we tried mixing it into better-for-bread flour that had proven its worth many times... but even 1 cup (1 cup out of 4) caused the same problems... poor cohesiveness in the dough (where usually when the best-for-bread flour is used, you get a nice velvety ball), and a low flat loaf.<br /><br />The results were consistently bad... no matter where or how (even only mixed in a little into some better flour) or how we used it our breads failed.

review/summary: Great Flour with Wonderful Flavor
review/text: I use this wheat bread flour when I make the basic recipe from the book "Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day". Because of the higher protein content of this flour, I have had to increase the amount of water from 3 cups to 3 1/2 cups (more if necessary). In the Artisan recipe you are looking for a very wet dough.  For a really great crust and crumb, bake the bread in a covered enameled cast iron skillet or dutch oven on heat tolerant parchment paper at 450 F for 30 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered. This flour has a sweet, nutlike flavor that I really enjoy.

review/summary: Unbelievably GOOD!
review/text: I have been trialing various wheat flours to the end of building fine artisan sourdough bread. I have finally found one which is up to my standards and which makes a truly fine loaf of sourdough bread. This unbleached flour is made of red wheat, so the color is beautiful and makes a rich light brown loaf. The grain is uniform and fine and it is delicious. So many flours today are completely lacking in flavor so that even with sourdough they come out tasting like cardboard, but this makes a full-some and hearty bread. My strongest recommendation.

review/summary: Great bread flour, but not fully "whole wheat"
review/text: I ordered this by mistake (I wanted their whole wheat pastry flour, which is also excellent).  It didn't make sense to ship it back, so I decided to try getting back into bread baking.  This flour is something between white flour and "genuine" whole-wheat bread flour.  It has all of the wheat germ, but about 80% of the bran has been removed.  Amazon should probably include better info on the great river flours; you can find a lot more at the greatrivermilling.com web site.  Click the "bread flours" link under the "products" tab to see a full description of this and their other bread flours.<br /><br />This flour makes great bread for me, somewhat lighter than a full whole wheat, but still very healthy and delicious.  I haven't had any of the problems with texture or rising that some other reviewers mention.  I use a very simple recipe: just flour, water, yeast, salt, and a bit of brown sugar and oil (2 Tbs of each for two loaves).  A really big factor for me is that my kids actually love the bread it makes, so I can get them eating something better than store-bought bread.

review/summary: treat as you would white whole wheat flour not white
review/text: I purchased this flour to use as unbleached white but it is identical in color to my white whole wheat flour. I found that it works fine for bread but only with the addition of 1/2 cup wheat gluten per 6 cups of this flour which is how I treat whole wheat flour, (otherwise it results in a useable but flatish loaf).  I used it for pie crust, tortillas, and biscuits as well and it works great for these. I haven't tried it for pasta yet but I think it work no problem. My friend that I spilt this order with tried this flour in her bread machine and it did not work (with no added gluten). Overall, this is a great value. This is less expensive than I can get organic flour from the health food store or Whole Foods. I will be buying this again but am also continuing to search for inexpensive unbleached white organic flour.

review/text: I was quite hopeful about this candy, as I love the flavour of violet and having an inexpensive bulk supply would be quite nice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, rather than using a natural violet flavour, this candy uses an artificial one.  This makes it take on a rather flat and overpowering floral note, without any of the more interesting characteristics of violet (real violet flavouring always had a spicy undertone that reminded me of celery seed.)<br /><br />Additionally, the artificial colouring gives it a bitter note on the back of the tongue.  The flavour of the violet candy put out by L'Anis de Flavigny is much superior (and also available from Amazon.)

review/summary: oh I didn't know these were still around
review/text: My grandmother often got care packages from Ireland (these couldn't be found in the midwest in the 70's can't be found now either!) and there wouldn't be packages of these tucked into corners. I didn't know they were originally an American product until I found them here, I thought they were European. They are really unusually because they are such a very floral tasting candy, at first as a child I didn't care for them, I think because I initially ate one expecting it to be mint tasting, but when I tried them a second time I found I really enjoyed them. You find you can't eat several of them at once, but one or two here or there and they are really enjoyable.

review/summary: addicting or revolting!
review/text: I LOVE these violet candies, but have yet to find another person who can tolerate them! My husband will not kiss me after I have eaten these.  I walk into a room and my kids groan and tell me to stop eating the violet things!  They remind me of perfume candiesthat my grandma sent us when we were kids.  I think that anyone who likes Sen Sen would like these.  No, they are not the same flavor--but they are equally odd!  I have to stop myself after eating two packs in a row.  They give a tummy ache by the third pack!

review/summary: Taste like soap
review/text: This tastes like soap. And it sticks with you forever; drinking water doesn't help remove it.  I recommend this for anyone who needs to wash someone's mouth out with soap - much less messy.<br />I bought a pack at World Market because it was unique and out of the 10 people or so I've given a piece - only one likes it. So there is a market for this.<br />Also the smell comes thru the package and if you hold the package too long,your hand starts smelling like it.

review/text: To know C Howards Violets is to love them.  that is how it is - people either love them or hate them.  they are especially good for smokers, even though i am not one - really gets rid of the odor.  and my few latin friends say they remind them of the violet scented water their mothers used to use when they were little.  These are definitely an acquired taste and not for the uneducated.

review/text: These brownies are just terrific.  They taste the same as the Little Debbie regular iced brownies do, but they're in the shape of a bat.  Very, very cute, particularly if you have children that are fond of the little guys, but they taste very, very good.  These are particularly nice as well for the chocoaholic in the family - the icing is all chocolate and without the sprinkles.  They also make their regular Cosmic brownies in fall colors, if you'd rather have those instead of the bats.  Just a great brownie, a house favorite.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: A few hard nuts to crack
review/text: I have purchased pistachios from the Bergin nut company a few times so I figured I should get an action shot and post it.  Well as I went to look for the camera I got hungry and I figured I had two bags so what would it hurt to open one. Needless to say I never found that camera and I ate both bags.<br /><br />I won't say that they are the greatest pistachios but they are damn tasty for something that shows up in the mail.  The bag is easy to open and I would say 98% of the nuts can be opened with your hand (I used a pair of pliers to open the rest). I had maybe 3 shells minus the nut and 2 just plain nasty nuts in the last four bags that I have eaten.<br /><br />Overall if you are looking for perfection go to a gourmet store and hand pick a bag out of the bin but if you want pretty good quality delivered to your front took then this is the right one for you.

IMPOSSIBLE!<br /><br />Now, I live in Nashville, and one can only be shipped these gems during cooler temperatures. These are priceless.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: This mix produces a huge pot of vegetable beef soup with lots of body and flavor. It's not even necessary to add extra ingredients to make it more complete, and that includes the optional tomato sauce suggested on the package. (It's better minus the tomato sauce.) The only reason I'm not awarding five stars is because the recommended 10-minute cooking time isn't nearly enough for the dehydrated peas, which are rock-hard. (Try 30 minutes instead.)

review/summary: Makes A Delicious Hearty Soup
review/text: A good hearty veggie beef soup has always been one of my favorite meals.  Especially on a cold winter day when I make it in a crock pot.  Although I enjoy making soup from scratch when I have the time, I often use various mixes that add all the spices and ingredients for you.  As you may expect, some mixes are much better than others.  I decided to try the Bear Creek brand when I saw it here for I have never seen it in any stores.  Take it from me, it makes really great soup that is rich and spicy, but not with too much of anything added to make it overpowering.  Its also the kind of mix that takes kindly to anything extra that you may enjoy adding to it like other reviewers have suggested. I recommend it for its price is very reasonable, and even more for its delicious....Bon Appetite!

So if you happen to try this one FIRST, don't use it as an example......it's just a matter of personal taste because the Chicken Noodle is a 10-star soup!!

Powder the Stigmas just before use in a small mortal and pestle, etc.  Use the correct amount and weigh your Saffron:  1 gram for a large Paella (containing 1600 g. mixed seafood, chorizo and other meats) or 0.5 gram for a simple Seafood with Saffron sauce (containing 900 g. seafood).

review/text: Beautiful deep red stigmas. Nice mild aroma and strong coloring properties. It is on the milder side when it comes to saffron taste and a lot of it was required to prepare a medium size "paella", due to its milder saffron taste. I would certainly recommend this product for great soups and sauces. For a paella I would rather use "MANCHA" DO(Denominacion de Origen) saffron or indian baby saffron. I still recommend this product without reservations.

review/text: I've been googling curry powders for a few days. I had a craving for lamb curry masala just like how the local restaurant makes it. After choosing a paste made by a different company I asked the clerk in the store and she suggested this powder mix.<br /><br />Essentially this powder is all the herbs you need less the fresh ingredients. I grinded ginger and garlic and sauteed it with onions and then browned the meat.  I used sirloin chunks as I couldn't find bone-in lamb anywhere. Added water and simmered for an hour.<br /><br />This mix tasted great! My wife agreed. It's worth trying if you're into curry masala.  It's a bit spicy but we like it like that.

I am seeing shinier, softer coats, and the 2 that I have with some skin irritation have improved as well in just 2 weeks. Stools are also firmer and my picky eaters love the carrots. With traveling alot and being around many different dogs I am happy that the products also help boost their immune system.  So many benefits of adding just a couple Tablespoons a day.

review/summary: Great for all breeds!
review/text: I have 2 dogs of my own that I use to feed dry food only.  A friend of mine recommended adding in Olewo supplements to my dog's food. I hadn't really heard of supplements for pets but I did a little research and liked what I found. My dogs love to carrot supplements in their food! I have a smaller dog who is a picky eater and would refuse food sometime. After adding in the carrots to her food she went crazy and finished every bite. I am also feeding my dogs the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083QBWKU">Olewo Dehydrated Red Beets Dog Food Supplement, 2.2-Pound</a>. If you are going to try the carrots, get to red beets too!

review/summary: Italian Sausage Success
review/text: This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5") and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy. I will be purchasing other blends in the future to also try.

review/summary: Mild/Hot Italian Sausage seasoning
review/text: We followed the directions closely for a 10 lb. mix of 1/2 venison and 1/2 pork. (We did mix the seasoning directly into the meat, then added a bit of water.) We then let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  We fried some patties up the next morning to taste test.<br /><br />The pepper seasoning came through, not excessively so, but it did linger a bit.  I have been known to like things hot (although my tastes have mellowed with age) and I would rate this between mild and medium.  I have tasted commercially prepared breakfast sausage that tasted hotter.  It definitely makes this a great sausage for using in spaghetti and other italian dishes.  By itself, the sausage is very flavorable.  We plan to pack 1/2 into casings and bulk store the rest for cooking Italian dishes.<br /><br />I do agree with one reviewer, it is a bit salty tasting and could be toned down a bit.  But, it is within the limits for a spicy sausage and will be fine used in other Italian recipes, IMHO.<br /><br />I would buy this again, but back off of the amount to mix into the meat (due to the salt) and add other Italian seasonings.

It's great for adding to (or on) rolls or bread, pizza or basically anything Italian. Even salad. It's crispy, crunchy and really does taste like roasted garlic bits. Very good and a real find.

review/summary: Mild, Tasty Mix
review/text: A scant tablespoon of seeds produced well over two cups of sprouts in a few days.  I was truly surprised at the yield.  Please note the seeds are very tiny, so if you're using an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EJ11X2">Easy Sprout Sprouter</a>, you definitely want to use the screen and add water for soaking and rinsing gently so as not to let the seeds run out into your sink.  After the seeds have begun to sprout, you can remove the screen.<br /><br />Mine came packaged in a plastic jar with a cap.  The mouth of the jar is wide enough to accommodate a measuring spoon.  Sprouting seeds I've purchased in the past have come in cellophane bags, which offer poor protection for the seeds.  There is a tradeoff with the plastic jar as far as waste goes, but a pound of seeds will last a very long time, so the plastic jar is really superior packaging, and one can always find a way to reuse it.<br /><br />The sprouted seeds (I harvest mine just as they are about to go green) have a mild flavor with a slight sweetness and nuttiness, are thin and fine, with a pleasing bit of crunch and mouth feel.  There isn't much bite, so if you're looking for that, don't buy these.  But these are quite versatile and can be used in salads, sandwiches and a garnish for rice or beans.<br /><br />I'm neither a vegan nor a vegetarian.  Anyone can enjoy sprouts, especially home grown sprouts.  They're very inexpensive and nutritious, and add welcome diversity to one's diet, especially in the cold, dark days of winter.

review/summary: These are GREAT!
review/text: You HAVE TO try these pretzels if you can! I ordered a bag just out of curiosity when I learned that an old friend is one of the people behind the company -- and I'm going to keep getting them, for what they are. They're unlike any pretzel I've ever had. Granted, my experience is a little limited; I've mostly just had these kinds of pretzels at ballparks, but.....my usual take has been that salted ones are good (mainly because of the salt!) and unsalted ones are, well, "okay." I wish I could get the Yankees to stock these at the stadium! They have a unique texture and taste that are just as interesting as they are wonderful: soft but substantial, nicely chewy, and with a fresh taste that is surprisingly sweet but not sugary.<br /><br />They come with simple instructions on how to heat them up, in either conventional oven or microwave, and with a bag of salt for you to add. Well, I cheated. :-)<br />For my first taste, I was too curious to spend any time heating it up, so I just had it "straight" -- darn good already! Then, so as to get a comprehensive overview, I heated up a little piece without adding anything to it -- even better! Then, I brushed some butter on a piece before heating it up (as per one of the suggested instructions), but still without adding the salt....and this was so great that I was able to stop right there, without proceeding to the "salt" stage -- which suits me fine. (By the way, I didn't really use butter either, but the substitute whose initials are ICBINB.) :-)<br /><br />The only problem with these pretzels is that they come in an 8-pack, and it took restraint not to finish them off right away. Try them!

review/text: I've been searching for healthy multigrain soft pretzels for quite some time. So I was thrilled to find these on Amazon. I was even more thrilled, when I tried them for the first time.  These are excellent, great texture & taste.  They list the serving size, as half a pretzel, at 185 calories per serving. But it tasted so good, that I ate the entire pretzel for lunch. I didn't even add the extra salt, that comes with them. I just heated it up & ate it with some mustard, YUMMY! If you are sitting on the fence, waiting to decide if you should try these. Jump off the fence, & order them right away. :-) You will not be disappointed.

review/text: First off, the value for this package was great. I've tried a good variety of coconut waters and Taste Nirvana ranks at the top. However the taste of the canned Taste Nirvana coconut water is different than out of the glass bottle. The can seems to be sweeter with larger chunks of coconut (almost reminds me of drinking the milk after you've finished honey nut Cheerios). The glass bottle version is lighter, more refreshing and less pulpy. I prefer TN out of the bottle, but you should probably try both and decide for yourself.

review/summary: My favorite one so far--coconutty, delicious chewy bits of pulp, refreshing, not too sweet!
review/text: I've been through so many trials with coconut water. While fresh from a real coconut is always gonna be a special, special thing, it's not always convenient. So, I resort to canned coconut water. I've tried various (and reviewed many on Amazon), including Zico, ONE, Amy and Brian, etc.<br /><br />This is my current fave. It really has a taste similar to fresh coconut water--as much as canned allows, I suppose--without being weirdly sweet (as A&B can be, especially the small cans) or weirdly salty (as VitaCoco can be) or just plain milky awful (like Zico in the bottle). My sister likes O.N.E. best, but I like this one. Sweeter, less salty than many I've tried.<br /><br />I've had the pulp and no pulp versions, and prefer this one. Just a bit stronger flavor.<br /><br />For now, I keep stocked with this and have a can nearly every day. If I didn't have to watch calories, I'd have two a day, no kidding. I wish it came in a smaller serving (say, 60 calories worth like ONE). But hey, small quibble. It's 130 heavenly calories with 1000 mg of Potassium. Helps keep the blood pressure down.

review/summary: Surprisingly sweet
review/text: This coconut water is very good, but also very sweet. It is surprising how sweet this actually is.<br /><br />I've given up drinking soda and most carbonated beverages for a couple of years now. I try to avoid high fructose corn syrup and large amounts of sugers and all artificial sweeteners like the plague. So, needless to say, I was excited to find this product on Amazon at a decent price.<br /><br />I tried my first can the day the package arrived. I only had it in the refridgerator for about an hour, thinking that was sufficient time to chill it down since it had been cold when it was delivered. I'm not sure how much the taste differs between chilled and warm temperatures of the beverage.<br /><br />I think the coconut water is actually too sweet for my own personal preference. But remember, taste is subjective so take my opinion with a grain of salt. The flavor is great, but the sweetness is just a little overpowering for my liking.<br /><br />Also the "pulp" is little pieces of coconut meat. It's really mushy, and an odd texture to have in your mouth while you're trying to drink the beverage. Some of the pieces are big enough that they may cause you to slightly choke of you had several that came out in one single gulp. Though I do think they help add to the overall coconut flavor.<br /><br />I may decide to try this product without the pulp.<br /><br />Note that this is a product of Thailand, and has only natural coconut water and pulp ingredients.

review/summary: best coconut water on the market
review/text: I've tried all the major name brands, and this one is clearly the tastiest. It's light and refreshing, without even a hint of bitterness or cloying sweetness. The label says "happiness inside," and it doesn't exaggerate. I tried this by chance, on a hot day, on vacation in a hot city, and spent about a month working my way through the brands at my local Whole Foods, looking for that same perfect treat. Now, I'm addicted to it. Forget post-workout treats, which I'm sure it is perfect for. It's so good, I drink it in place of plain water. This brand is a thousand times better than its competition.

review/summary: BEST Coconut water
review/text: This is the BEST coconut water I've had. It's so satisfying and is better than any other coconut water or juice I've tried. Amazon also has the best deal for this coconut water if you sign up for the subscription to have it delivered at whatever interval you choose. I enjoy the perfect amount of sweetness & the pulp!

review/summary: BEST EVER
review/text: I got this for water to add to my juice thinking that it would taste like caca like vita does.  I gave it to my wife to try before I would force myself to try it.  She looked like a little kid that just tasted soda for the first time.  This stuff is so good, tastes like you're drinking straight out of a coconut without spending an hour opening it.  The pulp makes it that much better.  I could see this taking the place of a soda drinker pretty easily.  SO GOOD.

review/summary: The Purest Coconut Water, Tastes Exactly Like the Real Coconut Water
review/text: Can't get enough of it. Too bad it's expensive. But sometimes I just buy real coconuts. This is the best brand of coconut water, it tastes exactly like real coconut water, no additional ingredients that change the taste like any other brands I have tried

review/summary: The absolute best!
review/text: I've tried every product like this one and navarna has by far the best taste and it the only product that has 100% all natural ingredients.  Cocoanut water is the next best thing to pure water and the only hydrating product on the market that is naturally good for you.
