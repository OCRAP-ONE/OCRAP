review/summary: Blackberry honey
review/text: This is some fabulous honey.  It absolutely delights my tastebuds.  However, it is definitely not truly "raw".  It for sure has been heated, but who knows to what temperature.  Hopefully not so high that it destroyed the beneficial enzymes.  Extremely delicious high quality honey at a great price.  If you are like me when it comes to honey, better to buy in bulk.  5 stars in my book, =)

review/summary: Without Question, The Best Honey I Ever Tasted!
review/text: I planned to make a batch of blackberry mead (honey wine)and needed a good honey for that.  I'd read reviews of this honey, and most were glowing reviews.  One was even from a fellow mead brewer.  While some reported tasting or smelling a light blackberry flavor from this, I have to say that I didn't.  It is a dark, rich honey without the "hay taste" of clover honey.  My wife is not a fan of honey at all, having only eaten the supermarket garbage.  Even she loved this stuff, and kept going back for more.  I have my mead brewing (6 1/2 gallons), and the brewing yeast seems to love it too.  I ordered a second 12lb bucket of this honey for my next batch of mead, which will be black cherry.  Anna's Honey is the best I have ever tasted!

review/summary: Not as good as Godiva Hot Cocao
review/text: I bought this for the price.  I have been a fan of Godiva's Hot Cocoa (Dark and Milk) for about a year.  While much better than those instant hot cocoa (Swiss Miss, Carnation etc) that are made with water - it leaves a slight aftertaste that I do not like.  Also, it did not mix as easily (dissolve) as the Godiva did.  I think it (like wine and food) is just a personal taste.  Try both brands and see for yourself.

review/summary: Absolutely the best sipping chocolate!
review/text: I am incredibly picky when it comes to chocolate, and most chocolate mixes are simply sugar with a few specks of chocolate.  Bellagio sipping chocolate is by far the BEST chocolate mix I have ever tried...and I've tried many!  It is a little more expensive than other brands of cocoa mix, but you definitely get what you pay for.  A little goes a long way, and you can make anything from hot cocoa to thick sipping chocolate to "spoon" chocolate to chocolate mousse....the list goes on and on.  I even made a great "chocolate emergency" frosting by simply mixing some of the chocolate in with a bowl of whipped cream.  And as an added bonus, the tin the chocolate comes in is super cute and makes a wonderful gift.

review/text: I am a vegan, and it is hard to find a good cocoa that is vegan.  This sipping chocolate is delicious made with soymilk!  You can follow the directions on the package for a 4 oz. thick, rich and robust sipping chocolate, or add more milk to make more of a hot chocolate/cocoa consistency.  Either way, it is delicious!  It melts very well into the milk, it is not bitter or chalky as other cocoas tend to be.  Top quality and yummy!

review/summary: Great Hot Chocolate!
review/text: This is great hot chocolate! I looked up European sipping chocolate after trying it at a local chocolate store, and I love it. It's not just the regular hot chocolate you find at grocery stores...it's very rich. I follow the instructions except I substitute whole milk with straight heavy whipping cream, which is what the chocolate store uses. It tastes like a melted candy bar. The one ounce packets are the perfect portion too. Will definitely be getting this again!<br /><br />Update: I tried this with skim milk, which I usually drink, because I wanted something lighter. It was only ok with skim. It tastes a lot better with heavy cream, where the flavors just seem to blend better. It's also good with a dash of Irish cream.

review/summary: I used it for hot chocolate and it was great!
review/text: I used this sipping chocolate for hot chocolate and I enjoyed a wonderful experience. I have grown up on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JJRS6K">Swiss Miss Milk Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix 80 Ounce Value Cannister</a> and Bellagio blows Swiss Miss out of the water. I do recommend adding sugar, because like others have said it is dark chocolate and it can taste bitter to your palette. I mix it with hot water because I find it to be too rich for my taste using milk. My own recipe involves water, sugar, a splash of real vanilla, and sometimes cinnamon and chili powder. I then add a large dollop of milk to bring it to a nice drinking temperature and then it is perfect for immediate consumption. The reason I gave this product a four star rating was due to the fact that I had lots of trouble mixing it with cold ingredients. At first, I tried soy milk and I got left with little bits of mix that would not dissolve. Thinking the soy milk was the problem, I tried whole milk and got the same results. So don't expect <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M050T8">Ovaltine Chocolate Drink Mix, Rich Chocolate, 12-Ounce Container (Pack of 4)</a>! Anyway, this is a great product for the dark hot chocolate lover in your life, so mix it up and enjoy!

review/summary: Beautiful for a gift presentation...excellent cocoa!
review/text: First off, the tin is gorgeous.  You would be hard-pressed to find a more artful tin of cocoa for gift giving.  I wouldn't feel bad to gift one tin of this wrapped in a beautiful paper as a birthday or holiday present - unwrapped it could be given as a hostess gift without worries of looking 'cheap'.  Careful thought was taken on the container this cocoa would be housed in.  A fine gift for a man, too, as it's not 'foo-foo' looking.<br /><br />Upon opening the tin, there is a silver packet of cocoa, sealed tightly.  Expiration date is 2 years from now (as IF it will last that long).  On the first cut of the packet, the aroma of chocolate filled my senses.  Deep, rich, pleasant chocolaty promises of tastes yet to come. I will be keeping the cocoa inside the silver packet as opposed to pouring it into the tin directly.<br /><br />Now, on to the best part ... the taste of the cocoa.  I licked the cocoa off the silver packet top that I cut off and wow, what an impact.  The first taste to hit was definitely chocolate - and not overly sweet chocolate I might add; was a bit bitter at full strength but expectations of my first mug of cocoa were pressing at this point.  I put 8 oz milk, 1 oz half and half, and 1 oz heavy cream into my Back to Basics Cocoa/Latte maker, then added 3 heaping teaspoons of Bellagio Sipping Chocolate, a splash of vanilla, and a spoon of sweetened condensed milk, then turned the machine on.  Within minutes a rich, well blended, decadent cocoa was soon at hand.  Poured it into a 16 oz mug, (nuked it for 20 seconds since the cocoa/latte maker doesn't make it as hot as I like it) and topped with fresh whipped cream. Realizing that it wasn't 'plain' cocoa at this point, the resulting flavor  was still utterly delicious.  The cocoa taste was still the star and rang through even with the add-ins, the flavor of chocolate was pronounced: strong and bold, yet smooth with a slight 'fruitiness' was to be discovered.<br /><br />Now for the final merits: YUM!

review/text: I am a big dark chocolate fan, so after reading reviews on this hot chocolate I knew I wanted to try it.  My first attempt, I made this with water.  It was easily some of the worst hot chocolate I have tried.  Which was a shame since I actually enjoy hot chocolate more with water than milk.  My second and all attempts after, I have made it with skim milk.  This had made this hot chocolate much more enjoyable.  It is a sipping chocolate that will take a while to finish each cup.  I will be trying a different brand once this bulk package is over though.

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

Unfortunately they display Fluaid picture on the Amazon website and their own website but the words are COLDAID.  THere is a separate product for Coldaid.  Regardless -- if you order the FLUAID on AMAZON you will get the COLDAID...the picture is not the product...the words under the drop down menu are worthless...as they all default to the same product COLDAID.  If you want FLUAID, which is the superior product, don't buy it from AMAZON or off of the sellers website.  It is a mistake.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P936UK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title

review/text: I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.

However, much though they might like it, we can't just feed them tuna day after day so we try to vary their diet by giving them other brands and other varieties of cat foods. Plus, we give them a couple small scoops of dry cat food every day. Of the things we give them, they seem to prefer the Fancy Feast brand of canned food so we pick up this variety pack. They seem to like everything in it. No food goes to waste, that's for certain. Now and then we add a couple other Fancy Feast variety packs. It seems to provide good choices. We've had no problems with them getting fussy and our cats have maintained excellent health<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: One of the best marzipan products
review/text: These are about the size of a snack candy bar, and they are great to eat just like that, straight out of the package. There is no chocolate or any other covering so you get the pure marzipan taste. There are only 3 ingredients: almonds, sugar, and invert sugar syrup. No nasty artificial ingredients. The main ingredient is almonds so the product is not too sweet, unlike other brands where the main ingredient is sugar. Product arrived fresh, soft, and moist, sealed in a plastic pack. It is eligible for free shipping, and it was shipped next day express. It is more expensive than other marzipan products because other products are mostly sugar or contain artificial ingredients. If you want to make marzipan fruits (especially for kids), consider purchasing love 'n bake marzipan in a can instead, which contains more sugar, which makes it more ideal for that purpose.

review/text: This is some high quality, pure marzipan. This grade of product doesn't need any candy coating or sugar on top; the flavor itself is very rich. The best way to eat this is in small bites because you'll end up eating all four loaf's in one sitting, in a big hurry. If you love marzipan, you owe it to yourself to at least give this one try. Odds are you'll be ordering this on a regular basis. Sometimes Amazon doesn't have this on Prime but when they do, I get some. Don't get too much though; reading the nutritional information might give you heart palpitations.

review/summary: PURE HEAVEN!
review/text: I am a frequent purchaser on Amazon, yet I cannot remember the last time I wrote a review. That is because, even with products I was really happy with, I just can never be bothered to do it. HOWEVER, when something comes along that completely MADE MY DAY, I am compelled to tell people about it! If you are a fan of marzipan, (and there doesn't seem to be a lot of us out there,) Niederegger is the highest quality, most moist, not-overly sweet, delectable marzipan I have EVER come across, and that's out of all the marzipan I've tried during travels in Europe throughout my life. This stuff cannot be beat. The problem with most marzipan you find here in the States is it's almost always the ludicrously too sugary, kind of stiff decorative stuff that usually comes moulded into fruit forms. That stuff might look fun to a kid, but it's no good. Niederegger is for the true marzipan-lover! I only wish I could find more actual candy stores that will carry it, but it lieu of that, Amazon will do, and this seller sent these loaves with ridiculous speed, and they are so fresh, they honestly taste like I just visited Niederegger's marzipan-making facilities in Lubeck, Germany and asked for a sample. Completely awesome.

review/summary: Read on for the story here. Lubeck Niederegger is the best highest quality of Marzipan! The Connoisseur's Marzipan!
review/text: These bars are a purist form of Marzipan. Cut easily into little slices to share. The wonderful taste of Niederegger marzipan comes through nicely here.<br /><br />Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar makes the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 "The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames."<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available. With German reunification, it is easier to get this great marzipan again. Highly recommended!

review/summary: A great beginner's golden berry.
review/text: I've had a few different types of golden berries and their benefits are undeniable. They're naturally anti-inflammatory and it's when your body doesn't have to deal with inflammation that it can then begin repairs to itself.  I usually have a bag ready for those on demand snacking urges. They're also wonderful mixed with a few other ingredients to make your own trail mix. I use coconut flakes and mulberries to negate the citrus lemon notes of golden berries. Some brands have stronger tasting berries but I've found Sunfood has a mellowed, but very pleasant flavor. The 1lb bag is a good size and the price was good when I purchased it here on Amazon. Sunfood's berries are USDA organic.  If you've watched Dr. Oz and you're ready to give these a taste I highly recommend this brand.

The marinara sauce has a funny taste and is pretty spicy. Usually, a prepared meal like this has too little sauce- this has way too MUCH sauce; it's about a 2-1 ratio to the noodles. They could cut down the sauce, increase the noodles and drop the calories by about 50. I also picked up one of their seasame meals, but I'm not hopeful.

I have a very hardy, healthy appetite and eat alot.  For the amount of food I eat I should weigh more than I do.  I believe that the Coconut Oil helps you maintain a healthy weight.

review/text: I probably have every skin care product ever made.. I am huge with natural skin care and I have been using honey as a face mask (which I love), but it is just too messy and sticky. I research constantly for new things for natural skin care and I came across coconut oil; I just have to say I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love this product! I don't break out a lot, just a few on my chin every now and then, but it is usually painful cystic acne and after applying this at night the next morning I woke up and my face was glowing, I couldn't believe it! I don't have wrinkles, but I was getting a few fine lines under my eyes and they have disappeared after only four days of using this at night before bed and in the morning after my shower. I am absolutely amazed, this is a miracle product! I also use it as a moisturizer and hair mask. I have my mom and sister-in-law using this now and they said the same thing! I recommend this product to anyone! Also, I got the 15 oz jar which will probably last months because you only need a tiny tinyyy bit for your face

review/summary: Pure Coconut Oil with nice flavor and good price
review/text: I'd been reading about the health benefits of eating pure, unadulterated coconut oil, and found that the little jars in the supermarket were just too expensive. So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity. I looked at many options here, and found this one. For me, the taste is a plus, but some might find it a problem. It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.) I heartily recommend this oil if you are looking for organic, pure, not hydrogenated coconut oil at a good price, (unless you don't want the coconut taste.)

review/summary: Good value conitioner/moisturizer
review/text: I read about the miracles of coconut oil. Though it is not what I would call miraculous I would say it does a nice job. I have sensitive skin, and this seems to work as well or better than most moisturizers I have tried, plus you can eat it. It has a coconut flavor to it. Subtle, and not sweet like a Peter Paul Mounds bar. I believe it helps a little as a laxative, but that might be me wishing it to do so. Anyway, just a small amount goes a long way, and my skin feels less sensitive and cooler. I'm a guy, and not looking for silky smooth skin, but this does that also.<br />This stays a solid until it touches your hand, then it melts quickly. This summer I may need to refridgerate so it stays solid, or knowing me, I'll spill it all over the place. Large jar for low cost. I'd give it a go.

review/text: Great product all around. Completely natural & unrefined so this is the purest & best kind of coconut oil. I use it as an overnight treatment for my hair & started to notice improvements right away. Smells amazing! I take a chunk in my hand, rub my hands together so it liquifies & apply it to my hair. You get a huge container for a great price. You won't regret this purchase! On a side note if you don't like the smell of coconut, you won't like this product. It's pure coconut oil so of course it smells like coconut. It seems silly to write it but you wouldn't believe how many reviews I've seen where people actually complain that the coconut oil smells like coconut!

review/summary: I love, love, LOVE it!
review/text: I am glad that I chose this production as my introduction to coconut oil.  I love it.  Yes, it has a soft coconut fragrance but the fragrance dissapates during the cooking process.  I have replaced 90% of the oil and butter in my house and I don't even miss that other stuff.  I add a nickel-size drop to my lotion after bathing and it knocks the ashyness right out of those ankles and elbows!  It also works great on my coarse straight black hair. After having issues with shedding, my hair stylist complimented me on taking great care of my hair.  "Keep on doing what you're doing," she said.  Ha!  I love that.<br /><br />As for cooking, I am in awe everytime I use it.  I recenty made omelettes for Saturday brunch.  Oh...My...Goodness!  They were absolutely amazing with tons of flavor in every bite.  That alone, sold me on this product.  I could have opened a restaurant on those omelettes alone.  (Patting myself on the back.)  Talapia works great with coconut oil as well since it is a delicate fish and one of my favorites.  I was very impressed with my cooking recently and I know it has to be the oil because that is the only thing that I've been doing differently.  I could cook before but now my food has reached another level and I feel more empowered when I cook.  The large 54-ounce jar will be a staple in my house so I won't have to worry about running out.<br /><br />Try it and see how you like it.  You may want to start with the smaller size if you are not sure about this product, or your can just jump in feet first like I did.

review/text: I use this for cooking and for my skin as well. It has a very pleasant light coconut smell. In cooking I have never noticed a transfer of any coconut flavor to the foods I cook, which is a good thing. Basically you can use it to pan fry various food items without worrying about flavor conflicts.<br /><br />It works nicely as a skin moisturizer too. It's a little greasy (it's oil), but absorbs well, and again smells good (unless you don't like coconut).<br /><br />Tried it as a hair conditioner but that didn't work out too well. It is very easy to apply too much and end up with hair that looks like it has to be washed again. Maybe it takes practice. :)

review/text: I started buying this coconut oil about 2 years ago and now use it dually as a cooking oil and lotion. It's excellent for eggs, curry dishes...really almost any meal where you would use another type of oil. As for use as a lotion, it's amazing. Any and all skin issues I have ever had, have disappeared. When I first started using it on my face there was a bit of a transitional period (some breakouts) but after that, I have year- round clear, healthy looking skin. Yes, I am a bit fanatical about my love of this oil but I really don't care because everyone should be in the know.

review/text: Yeah, I use this both for eating and for moisturizing.  It's great on my skin.  I do a head-to-toe with it nightly and it keeps my skin all creamy-soft.  It has a nice sweet smell and stays solid at room temperature.  I'm turning thirty and hopefully it'll keep my face totally free of crows feet for a good long time to come.  No expensive anti-wrinkle creams here.  Also, it's fantastic for cooking Thai and Indian food.  Really high heat tolerance.  Takes forever to go rancid, so the shelf life is awesome.  It also clears up the allergic skin rash I get when I use latex gloves.  That stuff makes my knuckles crack and bleed, and the coconut oil is incredibly soothing.  This stuff is a great deal!

review/text: There's been a lot said recently about the benefits of Coconut oil.  But it's difficult to find quality oil for a good price.  Nutiva extra virgin coconut oil from Amazon.com makes it affordable.  Coconut oil is the best oil to saute with as it doesn't turn into a carcinogen at the regular temp we cook at.  We also add it to our green smoothies, and often use it with a drop of essential oil as an overall skin conditioner in conjunction with our chosen safe skin care line that is much more natural and effective than other things available on the market.  I'm always looking for better ways to help our family be as healthy as possible.  This is a great product to help with that goal.

review/summary: Nutiva Organic EV Coconut Oil
review/text: I LOVE this stuff.  It arrived fairly quickly, but had leaked a bit inside it's box (I suppose that's to be expected with trying to ship an oil in the middle of summer).  I've had it for a month or so and it's only just starting to solidify in the cupboard.<br /><br />The oil smells wonderful, a yummy coconut smell, and when it's heated in a pan it just smells that much better. I use it every time I pan fry anything (eggs, fish, chicken, etc) and it always works wonderfully.  I haven't noticed it adding any coconut flavor to anything really, except perhaps eggs which I don't mind at all.<br /><br />I have used it in baking a couple of times and have had only one issue.  Because it's a 'solid' oil (depending on temperature) when I added cold eggs to the oil and didn't mix fast enough it started to chunk up so things didn't mix very smoothly.<br /><br />I should also add that my son has exzema and has since he was born.  I haven't found anything better then coconut oil to use as an after bath moisturizer for him, and he smells sooooo good when we are done.

review/summary: Great alternative cooking oil
review/text: I first read about the benefits of coconut oil while reading an article in Oxygen Magazine.  I was curious about it's potential benefits so I did more research. I was very surprised to learn how this oil had been the primary source of oil in the United States until there was a propagandist pitch against buying this oil due to conflicts of the world war at the time, as well as the increased interest in corn oil manufacturing in the U.S. Coconut oil became a target of U.S. corn and vegetable oil manufacturers. Today, it's nearly been forgotten or written off because of it's high saturated fat content.  Interesting to note that this oil's properties do not act like other saturated fats because it is a medium-chain triglyceride, which breaks down differently in the liver. After reading the information I gave it a go and I love it.  It is great for all sorts of cooking. It even blends well into a protein shake. It smells wonderful and works as a great skin conditioner and massage oil.  I would highly recommend coconut oil to everyone. Once you try it you won't want to go back to the unhealthy corn or vegetable oils.

review/text: Found this same product for about $5 less at the Vitamin Shoppe website and bought it there.<br /><br />Even with their lowest price shipping, the Nutiva Coconut oil arrived quickly.  However, it opened during transit and leaked everywhere.  Called the customer service number and the gentleman who answered immediately wrote an order to send another shipment to replace my shipped spilled one and the replacement arrived quicker than the quoted time frame for the discount shipping.  This time, it was packed much better and didn't spill.  Seems I'm at least the second person to complain about how Vitamin Shoppe ships their coconut oil - hoping they'll ship it better next time so that they have more profit and I have more instant gratification.<br /><br />On to the product itself and the 5 stars it earns:<br /><br />Nutiva's extra virgin coconut oil has just a faint coconut smell and no taste.  It's liquid at 77�F and great inside and outside the human body.  Can't wait to saute veggies in it tomorrow!  Very psyched Nutiva markets this superfood and The Vitamin Shoppe sells it.

review/summary: Good Deal - Good Oil
review/text: I've been using coconut oil for years.  I took several T. a day for 2-3 years but never lost weight, so I can't recommend it for that.<br /><br />To eat several T. daily, I made a concoction of chocolate melted with coconut oil and kept it in the fridge.  I found that I ate less sugar and chocolate that way--the coconut oil helped me feel satisfied with a little less chocolate. But, perhaps you can see why I wasn't losing weight . . .<br /><br />By making this coco/choc mixture, I was able to add fruit or ground flax seed (I'm allergic to nuts and this gave the choc/coconut oil a nutty flavor like a ganache) or wheat germ (a nutty-like crunch).  These additions helped me maintain a good glycemic index while eating so much candy.<br /><br />When I was using the coconut oil daily, my total cholesterol did rise but my ratio of HDL:LDL greatly improved.  I do believe that coconut oil is the best one to use, I'm just not much of an oil user.<br /><br />Perhaps if I had been substituting for something besides chocolate, I might have lost weight.  I was really adding oil to my diet instead of swapping.  But, even adding 3-4T. daily, I didn't gain weight, either, and I did get the improved cholesterol ratio.<br /><br />By God's grace, I stopped eating sugar in 2008. Now, I use coconut oil on weekends as my "weekend treat" in homemade popcorn.  (Not eating sugar really made me lose weight:  1#/week for 30 weeks, where I've remained for months.)<br /><br />This Nutiva jar is easy to open.  It's probably good to keep smaller amounts in another container to keep the big jar less contaminated . . . but I don't always do that.<br /><br />There was a slight coconut scent at first but that disappeared.  When I lick off the spoon when I make popcorn, I can taste a little bit of coconut, but not much.  I'd highly recommend this brand unless you really wanted that coconut scent.  the lack of scent does make it extremely versatile and much easier to substitute as a butter spread (hot vegetables, toast, etc.)

review/text: This coconut oil is raw. It smells amazing and is super healthy. I use it for everything, from salad dressing to raw vegan deserts, to stir fry, skin moisturizer, hair finisher, massage oil, etc. It's amazing on baked yams. If you eat toast, try mixing raw coconut oil with honey and using it as a spread. This is a great value, and a fabulous product. Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too.

review/summary: Best Deal Ever!
review/text: You are not going to get a better deal on any Coconut Oil product. The best use? Put a teaspoon of coconut oil into your morning protein shake, along with organic berries and a teaspoon of almond butter.  It will taste great, optimize your overall health and keep you energized well until lunchtime. I repeat, don't hesitate to purchase this excellent product at an excellent price.

review/summary: A great deal!
review/text: This coconut oil is of great quality and the price is great. I paid $10 for an 8-oz jar in the local stores!<br /><br />I love cooking with this product. Scrambled eggs seem to come out very fluffy.<br /><br />I will warn new users to not use coconut oil on very light foods, as the oil does have a slight coconut taste and fragrance. In other foods, the taste disappears completely.

review/summary: Tasty and nutritious
review/text: I can only compare this Nutiva coconut oil to one other that I had tried bearing the Spectrum label.  Perhaps the Spectrum oil is exactly as good for you, but it had no flavor whatsoever.  This Nutiva coconut oil, on the other hand, actually has a delicious coconut flavor.  Well, I think it's delicious.  If you don't like coconut flavor, you'd better try a different brand.

review/summary: Best oil for hair
review/text: According the research online, the coconut oil work great on hair. It is the only oil reported to penetrate the hair shaft and leaves hair soft/moistened. I use the oil as a pre-conditioner for 30 min or longer no heat. Then followed by shampoo. After shampoo I apply again the coconut oil other oils to seal the oil in the hair. The product is cost effective, natural, and most importantly does the work.

review/summary: Nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil
review/text: I would not live without this product. I Have read and done some research on the benifits of using<br />coconut oil. Its uses and benifits are endless. I actually have a small jar I refill for keeping in<br />the bathroom. It has become my lotion after showering. I use this only in the pm due to the initial slipery<br />feeling till it soaks into the skin. My skin is supple, no more dryness, more elasticity, and the best of all is it is antibacterial, antifungus and a great disenfectant. I put it on everything. It dries it up. I eat 3 tablespoons of it a day, I cook with it, put it on anything I would normally use butter for. Its great for high heat. I have read it is good for the gums and digestion as well. The body synthesises it well and is beneficial. I would encourge anyone to read about this and try it. there are cookbooks and how to use this on amazon. Thanks to Nutiva and Amazon for carrying it.!!!<br />Its flavor is lightly nutty and love that coconut flavor.

review/summary: Amazing Oil
review/text: I think I will always use coconut oil from now on. It is just amazing. Since I can't get oil in Istanbul, I actually wish I had bought more of it. This brand of coconut oil is smooth, creamy, and sooooo delicious.

review/summary: Delicious & Nutricious!
review/text: Our family now uses this in place of butter or other oils for all our cooking needs. It tastes sooo good - it has a very nice lite sweet taste to it. Also it is much healthier for you than butter or other oils. We use All Clad cookware and have no trouble with sticking as long as adequate coconut oil is used when cooking.

review/text: I love this oil.  It has just a slight taste of coconut when you fry with it or use it in dressings or baked products.  It came in great condition and on the listed date.  Very happy with my order.
