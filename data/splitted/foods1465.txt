review/summary: What a difference in the taste
review/text: I would have never guessed that there would be as much of a difference in the taste of a Thai dish using this sauce.  I did the same chicken dish using a high quality soy sauce.  Then ordered and received the Golden Mountain Sauce.  Day and night difference in the taste!  Without this sauce the dish was good.  With it it was great.  The vendor shipped it propmtly and at minimal cost.

review/summary: THIS STUFF IS SAM-EZING
review/text: This stuff works wonders!<br /><br />I went through a pretty rough patch in my life. I lost 2 dogs, 1 cat, and my best friend/roommate to cancer all within 2 years.<br /><br />My doctor placed me on Welbutrin but that stuff made me completely insane! 1 day I was angry, 1 day I was completely miserable, 1 day I was unbearably tired. I also had a horrible headache when I was taking it. I felt like was a mindless zombie on Welbutrin. I decided to stop taking the Welbutrin before it settled into my system.<br /><br />I figured I would try and go the more natural route after reading all the side effects of the other anti-depressant medications they have available. I first tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014DT1W">Kira St Johns Wort Tablets - 45 Tablets</a>. These seemed to help, but it was very mild and not consistent in keeping my mood up.<br /><br />Then...there was Nature Made Sam-E. I tried some of the store brand Sam-E's to try and keep costs down, however, none of the other brands even came close to working as good as Nature's Made. And if you shop around you can usually find a buy one get one free at Walgreens, Giant, CVS, or even Amazon for a total of $45 bucks for 76 400mg tablets.<br /><br />This stuff helped me through the roughest time of my life. I've been using Sam-e well over 2 years now and if I even missed one dose I would immediately notice a huge change in my mood. I have been taking 1 400mg pill a day since I started. Once in a while I would take took 2 or 3 in a day.<br /><br />I just started taking 1 pill every other day to give my body a break because I do not like to be dependent on any type of medication. But for those super hard times, this stuff really helped to get me through.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying Sam-E. I prefer the 400mg. They are a better value and work much better. Especially before trying any prescription anti-depressants. It is a natural approach to overcoming depression, has low to no side effects at all (I never experienced any), and even if it does not help with improving your mental health, at least it is supporting your joints.  ;)<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I refuse to feed the dogs anything made in China. These went straight to the trash can. All manufacturers claim to have great inspection standards and control over what goes into their products---so I must this question: Why make something as basic as a dog treat in China? Is it THAT labor intensive to make these? I think not. I think they are made in China because the regulatory bar is so LOW.

review/summary: Lamb & Rice is more digestable
review/text: In my opinion, the lamb and rice strips are more digestable for the dogs.  I have two smaller dogs, both have some trouble with different foods.  These lamb & rice are "processed" like a hamburger jerky that breaks into pieces easily and then, in my opinion, digest more easily for the dogs.  The other products, JERKY, is actual strips of duck or chicken jerky.  It is very hard to tear apart and seems to have strong tendons or strips in the treats that would seem to be stringy.<br /><br />All in all, I would rather give my dogs the treat that breaks easily for me and they seem to enjoy without getting sick and/or not eating the next day.  Our Malti-Poo actually has noises coming from her stomach when she eats the thicker, tougher jerky treats.  The lamb & rice is my choice and, if you look close at that treats when purchasing, you'll see what this looks like compared to the tougher jerky treats.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I really do enjoy these Sesame Honey Crunch.  They're hard like peanut brittle, but easy to bit into.  Because they're small, and wrapped very very well, I sometimes think I'm expending all of the calories just getting the candy out of the wrap.  But they taste great and they're really good at satisfying my craving for something sweet without my going overboard ... at least not too far overboard!

review/summary: Meh...  We won't order again.  Local quality & price are better.
review/text: Shipping was prompt.  Packaging was good.  However, the 'bulk' product was actually more expensive (~$1 or 13% more) and not as good as available locally 'by-the-piece' in downtown Chicago.<br /><br />In addition, we were hoping that there would be nutritional information.  There was not.  Instead, there were 76 pieces in a plain plastic bag weighing 16.1 ounces.<br /><br />So, overall the vendor performed well but there was no value added.<br /><br />Quality Comparison<br />-----------------------<br />The wrapping was similar but the candy is less sweet like it contains HFCS instead of honey and the texture is noticeably coarser and seems to stick to our teeth a lot more.  This made us miss the nutritional disclosures even more.<br /><br />Cost Comparison<br />--------------------<br />Bayside Candy on Amazon = $8.59 / 76 pieces = $0.113<br /><br />Downtown Chicago at Kramer's Health Foods = $7.60 / 76 pieces = $0.10 or about $1 less for the same quantity and we have the flexibility to buy as many or few as we like.<br /><br />In short, we found no advantage and will continue to drop at in the local health food shop and get our sesame treats along with a friendly smile and without the extra packaging waste or wait for delivery.  Amazon's great, but you can't win 'em all.

review/summary: The jury is still out....
review/text: Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me.

review/summary: Fibromyalgia
review/text: I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word "magnesium" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.

review/summary: Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon magnesium is good for regularity
review/text: I purchased Natural Vitality's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon 16 oz</a> as a magnesium supplement to help me absorb calcium better because I was diagnosed with osteopenia--precursor to osteoporosis.  I will have to wait until my next bone density test in about a year and a half to find out if adding this readily absorbed magnesium product has helped my bones.  In the mean time, however, it has helped with my chronic constipation.  I had been using stool softeners for the past couple of years and this works much better.  It is a powder which you mix in a cup of hot water and stir.  I usually take 5 grams (a heaping teaspoon) once a day.  After it is dissolved, I add a little cold water so I can drink it quickly, although it does taste good.

One star off: it's horribly SWEET!! Most American-made sweet goods are sweet to such a degree that sometimes it's hard to detect any other taste, but even by those standards this stuff is incredibly oversweetened. I'll use it, but I wish there were another, less sweet and more natural flavor available. How about, say, mango or grape...?

review/summary: calm, yes... but at what price?
review/text: I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money.

review/summary: Balances so many things in your body!
review/text: This stuff is truly amazing. Previously I had chemotherapy and the drugs took just about all the hormones away, hence giving me hot flashes. Calm helped to restore the balance and get me back on track, since I was kind of young for menopause. It has also taken my monthly cycle from 30-45 days right down to 28 days. It really is a great product. Magnesium is also wonderful for helping the body absorb calcium. I have been taking it for almost 8 months and I wouldn't think of stopping.

review/text: I purchased this as a calcium-magnesium supplement for my kids.  This particular bottle does NOT have calcium as the picture of the nutrition label states.  That label belongs to a different product.  This is 325mg Magnesium citrate only, and it is Really tart!!  Now I am going to have to buy (and get the kids to take) a separate calcium supplement.:(

review/text: I write very few reviews but this product changed my life. I have suffered from constipation all my life and I started to drink this daily as a friend recommended this for me to try- what a life changer- If I don't drink it for a few days I go right back to being constipated! This is a product I can never be without!<br /><br />I recommended this to a friend and a few months when I saw her she said that she recommended this to all her friends and they all started to lose weight :) and my friend lost 30lbs only drinking this, eating clean and working out a few days a week! You have to try this product, I cannot say enough good things about it.

review/text: This stuff is great, while I don't like this kind as much as the Natural Calm with Calcium, it was my own fault for not looking close enough when I ordered the second bottle for the office. I actually look forward to having this in the AM with my breakfast and in the PM before bed. You can feel the relaxation slightly, it is not overwhelming. Not the kind of thing that knocks you out when you take it, but if you pay attention you can feel it.<br /><br />The great thing about the calcium is it is a great way to help sustain and maintain weight loss. This is the best flavor they offer no doubt about it.

review/summary: Don't get Orange flavor
review/text: orange seemed most appealing to me, but I do not like it. It works, but I have to build up to it. I just really don't like drinking it. It is really tart, slightly orange tasting, and I have a hard time getting it down. I have to chug it quickly. I'd rather take a pill and get it over with quickly. Just blech. I'd rather take Bluebonnet Calcium/Mag Vit D liquid, and that is a thick goopy liquid but I only need 2 TB of it. This is just hard drinking a whole glass. Aside from the texture/sense issue, the product works well, and I don't get restless legs at night. It does help me sleep and I am in a better mood since taking it.

review/text: I have had a very easy pregnancy except for these insane charlie horses in the middle of the night. My midwife prescribed a magnesium supplement and suggested this brand. It took about 2 - 2.5 weeks for the leg cramps to go away completely but I haven't had a leg cramp since (unless I don't take it every day). I also find that I fall asleep faster and I am able to go straight back to bed after getting up in the night to go to the bathroom.

review/summary: GREAT STOOL SOFTENER!
review/text: I do not get the calm relaxing better sleeping side effects from this. What I do get though is something that keeps my bowels regular. I take a medicine that causes heavy constipation, some users resort to taking laxatives every day which is addictive and dangerous. This is the best thing to clear you out and move things along. I've had two children and they send you home with a stool softener (Collace for me) and this works far better than collace. I started out about a week on just one large teaspoon. I was very bloated and backed up the entire time, it wasn't really doing much, then I upped to two large teaspons, without being graphic, it completely fixed my problem, although there were a few times if I hadn't been very close to a bathroom it could have resulted in a very traumatizing event. I don't think it tastes bad at all, I enjoy the warm drink in the evening, I put honey in mine, and use the natural one.

review/summary: LOVE this stuff!
review/text: Our chiropractor recommended Natural Calm for more muscle relaxation and deeper sleep - and my entire family takes it.  We've adjusted the dose for our 10 y/o downward (1/4 t. per day) and that's been better for him, but for my husband and me, the 1/2 t. dose is just right.  :)<br /><br />Our child has benefitted from it in that when he sleeps more deeply and doesn't wake easily, he has better days in lessons and is better able to focus.  That alone would make me re-purchase this product!  :)<br /><br />When we take it, we sleep better, more deeply, and if(when) we get up in the night to use the restroom, we don't struggle to fall back asleep - sleep is just *there*.  :)  I've also found that my "side stitches" - where the muscles at my ribcage contract and pull (it's uncomfortable) - go away when I take NC.  That's a beautiful side effect from taking it - and one I didn't expect.  My husband's infamous "Charley Horses" that wrack his legs with pain are virtually gone, too - and adding the NC has been the only change in his habits, so it's not like he's attributing the lack of cramps to anything else he's doing.<br /><br />I'm also a PCOS patient, which means I trend towards overproducing insulin.  With that, comes rough elbows and ridiculously dry skin - the NC has helped in that area as well.  My normal moisturizer doesn't touch my elbow-roughness, but the NC takes care of it on its own.  w00t!<br /><br />We like the lemon-raspberry flavour as well - it's like a hot lemonade in a mug.  :)<br /><br />All in all, we'll definitely be ordering more - I don't ever want to be without this supplement!

review/summary: Great for kids to get their magnesium!
review/text: I can't write this review based off of continued use, as we just received it this week.  However, I wanted to say how glad I am that this product is available.  I have one child with asthma and another with autism.  Magnesium is suppose to benefit them both a lot, BUT getting children to take it is another story!  It's very sour and zingy, if that's a word, so the magnesium has taken a lot of coaxing to get them to take daily.  So I find this product of Peter Gillham's, and I'm so happy.  The kids say it tastes like warm sweet lemonade, and down it goes like a treat.  Also, very comforting to take just before going to bed.  Yeah!

It does have a "good" effect on your bowel movement, it's not a bad thing, it keeps you cleansed. I would highly recommend this for any with muscle, joint or bone pain.

review/summary: Don't know why the word "Calm" is on the canister.
review/text: I drink this every afternoon with two heaping teaspoons in 16 ounces of water. This does not make me either sleepy nor calm. However it is both a good way to hydrate (the stuff tastes good) and get a daily dose of magnesium so I like it and will purchase it again.<br /><br />I am writing this a month or two later and this, in fact does calm me and it also promotes a good night's sleep. I just ordered my second canister.

review/summary: I am not sure if it has helped me
review/text: I have purchased this product due to its amazing reviews.  I have been having horrible health issues that started after taking a diet pill which has caused me drastic changes to my health.  I have been having issues with my digestive system, emotions, IBS, I never had heartburn now I do, I have cracked tongue, dry tongue, metallic taste in my mouth, I dont digest well my food.  I have done too many tests and nothing has been coming up but only GERD and have taken so many treatments for this but nothing helps me. :(<br /><br />I thought maybe this would help me but I dont see any change in anything.  Its been 5 days since I started.  I started with half teaspoon in morning and night, and then after a day did 1 tsp twice a day, then did 2 x a day but started to have diarrhea so now I am back to 1 twice a day.  I do not see it has made any changes, maybe it takes time, we will see.<br /><br />The delivery was fast taking into consideration I live in Doha, Qatar. and the package was in good condition.<br /><br />Will keep updating.

review/summary: THIS IS THE REAL DEAL! Ended years of IBS-C suffering
review/text: I tried every possible remedy I could find and nothing gave me consistent results. This product changed my life after 20 years of suffering from IBS-C. I only take one heaping tablespoon a day. I have been using it for about 2 years now and the results are very consistent. I ramped up my dose until I experienced loose stools and then backed off just a little until everything became normal. I am now thinking of breaking it into two smaller doses because the effervescent nature makes me burp like crazy for the first 15 minutes after taking it. But believe me, no matter what, it is worth it. I will most likely take this product for the rest of my life. THANK YOU to the makers.

review/summary: I really like tis product
review/text: I think the great majoority of us are magnesium defficient and I think this is a great way to up you magnesium intake. I do sleep better when I take it and tend to not wake up in the middle of the night.<br /><br />One caution would be to work up to your proper dose. Just don't go and start out with thee heaping teaspons! If you do you will need to keep the location of the nearest restroom in mind. Start at around a teaspoon and work up.<br /><br />This has a pleasant taste and I look forard to taking it in the evening. The container mentions mixing it in warm water and while I tried that I do not find that it is necessary. I just put two heaping teaspoons in a glass, add about six ounces of cool tap water and stir. After the fizzing goes away and it clears up drink it on down.<br /><br />I do recommend the larger sizes as it is more cost effective.

review/text: Needed a sleep aid, The reviews amazed me so I ordered some.  Brought it back with me from the states to Costa Rica.  Finally opened it up, tried it before bedtime, went easy on the quantity due to reviewers suggestions.  Next morning, I did feel like I slept well enough, but the bowels were very active.  So be very easy on the tiny spoonful of it is all I can say.  It takes a lot for me to have loose bowels.  This is like a natural laxative.  I don't use it every night though.  Don't want to worry I need to stay home to be near the toilet.

review/text: Hi, does this supplement make you super thirsty?  I wanted to check because I have been feeling very thirsty especially in the late evening.  It has coincided with me taking this supplement.  But I have heard that excessive thirst is also symptom of diabetes.  Is it documented anywhere that magnesium can result in thirst?  If anyone can share this info, it would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />As for the product, I just started it.  The taste is citrusy.  I have had no side effects other than thirst.  But I don't know how much is psychological I have already been feeling more energy.  I will update if I continue this for a longer time hopefully.

review/summary: Very versatile
review/text: For the most part, I'll just echo what previous reviewers have said. This stuff is wonderful for putting you to sleep fast, as well as helping with anything to do with muscle relaxation. I've found it helps with both the cramps and mood swings of PMS, and even seems to lessen eye strain headaches. It's also proving invaluable as a way to counteract the rebound insomnia and moodiness of withdrawal from a prescription sleep medication. I take away one star (and would make that a half if I could), because in its raw form (or merely blended with water), it tastes terrible. But mixed with a sweet juice, it's decently palatable.

review/summary: Less Stress, Better Sleep, Great Product
review/text: This is an excellent source of magnesium which provides a number of health benefits.  Some obvious and some not so obvious.  I have trouble sleeping, waking up many times at night and like everybody else I deal with my fair share of stress.<br /><br />I take a 1/2 teaspoon at night about an hour before bed time along with 5-htp and phenibut powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007YY2XQE">5-HTP Powder 10 Grams + FREE Primaforce Phenibut Powder 100 Grams</a>.  I started taking the magnesium long before the 5-htp or anything else, taking them together definitely enhances the mood and sleep stabilizing effects, if that's what your looking for.<br /><br />The Raspberry Lemon flavor doesn't taste delicious but it certainly does not taste bad so it is not a chore what-so-ever to drink a glass each night before going to bed.  Since I've started this nightly ritual nights have become more peaceful, days have become brighter (i.e. tears from stressful situations do not rear their ugly head nearly as much).  I've been happier, plain and simple.

review/summary: This one supplement has changed my life!
review/text: I eat well.  I read a lot of research on health.  I'm a Medline junkie.  I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs.  Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed.  Also increased my ability to deal with difficult "crisis" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right??  Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without.  It has made that important an improvement in my life.  It is almost like a miracle.  Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume.  Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.  In America this ratio is about 4 to 1.  Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1.  I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.  (Try "The Magnesium Factor" by Margaret Seelig or "The Magnesium Miracle" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two.  You probably won't need that long.  I noticed an improvement in two days.  A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.  Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!

review/summary: Review on TASTE
review/text: I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere.<br /><br />When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE.<br /><br />So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well.<br /><br />I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one.<br /><br />Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning.<br /><br />This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me!

review/summary: OMG It WORKS!
review/text: I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess!<br /><br />I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep!<br /><br />Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too.<br /><br />Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of crap and I guess they were right!<br /><br />I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of crap and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you.<br /><br />One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in  girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand). I hope this review helps and if you have any questions please contact me, I am real and this review is real!

review/summary: A major improvement in menopausal symptoms
review/text: I tried this product after researching menopausal heart palpitations and internal tremors on www.power-surge.com.  The relief was immediate!  What surprised me was the improvement in many other aspects of my health.<br />No more headaches that feel like a tight cap binding my scalp.  Reduction of my migraines. No more nightmares (brought on by hormone fluctuations).  No more "internal earthquakes" or buggy-crawling sensations on my skin.  Less anxiety (formerly triggered by hormonal changes). No more weak nails.  Monthly acid reflux greatly reduced, sometimes none at all. Greatly reduced frequency of colds, flus and sinusitus.<br />I chose the Calm with Calcium since I am dairy allergic.  My body assimilates it well, much better than calcium & magnesium pills, which had little to no effect on the above-mentioned problems (in ANY ratio).<br />Overall, I feel much calmer & more energetic.  Not a cure-all, but definitely has raised the quality of my life.<br />I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: " A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!"
review/text: I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try "Natural Calm"; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot.<br /><br />I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because "Natural Calm" does the job.<br /><br />I've been taking "Natural Calm" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff.<br /><br />As for negatives to "Natural Calm"...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick.<br /><br />All in all 5+ stars. "Natural Calm" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer.

review/summary: Great for multiple things
review/text: I originally started taking Calm for the magnesium to help with my Chronic Idiopathic Constipation. I put a couple of teaspoons in hot water and drink a mugful before bed every night and I have been very regular ever since. The taste is almost too sweet but that's probably a perk for some people. It tastes like hot lemonade, nothing chalky about it which is nice. It can be drunk cold but I find that 1) it works better when used with hot water and 2) it tastes better in hot water (cold water doesn't dissolve it well enough and you end up swallowing chunks of the magnesium). Within the first day or two of taking the Calm I realized that not only was I regular but I was sleeping much better. After one mugful, I fall asleep within the hour and also the cramping I was getting in my legs at night has diminished. I started taking this for one reason but realized there are a lot of benefits to it. I will warn you, on the directions it says "add 1oz of water, watch it fizz...", and it FIZZES. I made the mistake of filling my cup with water first and then added the Calm and made an enormous mess! It fizzes up at the slightest splash of water and also when you stir so just do it little by little and you'll be fine :)

review/summary: Natural Calm Magnesium
review/text: I have used this product before in the calcium/magnesium blend. It was suppose to be tasteless.  It wasn't.  It tastes awful.  This lemon-raspberry tastes okay and the product is more reactive when the hot water is added.<br /><br />I was medically advised to take my magnesium in this form because of slipped disks in my back.  This is only one piece of my back program however I can attest to the efficacy of the product.  My disks are no longer slipped.  It has helped me to heal.<br /><br />A bonus benefit for me is that taking the magnesium in this form has stopped the migraines that I have had for 36 years of my life.  I have learned that if a headache begins that I need a dose of Natural Calm.  I was dealing with a magnesium deficiency.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to anyone with muscle or joint issues, migraines,and back issues.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry Lemon Flavor 16oz, Natural Vitality</a>

review/summary: like my calcium this way
review/text: Soothing drink at night before bed.  I can tell my body absorbs it because enough calcium in my system eliminates menstrual cramps.
