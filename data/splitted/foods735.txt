review/summary: Oh the possibiliites!
review/text: We received this as a gift and pounced on it. The Kalamata olive infused oil is very smooth and has a strong note of the olives in it. It seems like something that would go perfectly over some hot, fresh pasta all by its lonesome. It is a complete flavor, you can add elements to it, but you wouldn't miss them if you didn't.<br /><br />The pomegranate infused oil and vinegar are meant for each other, I look forward to using them in a pasta salad. I don't have a lot of experience with oils nor infused oils and their uses, these certainly are begging for a lovely loaf of artisan bread to dip into the oils and vinegar.<br /><br />These are definitely treat food, and are enjoyable. I don't think my cooking warrants the luxury of these oils, but it will be fun to experiment with them in the pasta dishes we have scheduled.<br /><br />But, maybe the same wisdom applies to cooking as it does to sewing/wood working/car repair: the results will reflect the quality of the ingredients and tools used, as well as the skill of the technician/artist/cook.<br /><br />I definitely would recommend this gift pack for a house warming gift basket or as a hostess gift. These aren't the typical store bought cheap oils with things of dubious provenance floating in it.

While we are fans of coffee from Costa Rica, we had never tried this brand before. For the price the purchase was a good one and we were pleasantly happy with trying something outside of the norm.

review/text: I love fresh pineapple, but always find the "processed" pineapple products too sweet and don't taste good, no matter how they are manufactured. Out of curiosity I ordered this bag along with the other variety (Taro), and instantly I become a fan. Besides sweetness, this product also has the sourness that I love about pineapple. Both combined strike a great, balanced flavor. Plus these chips are crunchy! I think I will try other products from this company soon.

review/summary: Not bad for a salty crunchy low carb snack!
review/text: I must say, I was not sure what to expect when ordering these.  I have been trying to stay on a low carb plan for a while, but the one thing I missed a lot was chips/crackers.  I have experimented with baking different things and even trying to fry up my own root vegetables.  Nothing really worked well.<br /><br />I stumbled on these one day and bought the Pizza flavor and the White cheddar.  They are both quite good, however, they are a bit TOO salty and that says a lot coming from a salt-a-holic like myself.  LOL.<br /><br />I have not checked yet to find out if they just have a "plain" cheese with none of the additional additives, but if they do I will try them next to see if the salt is lower.<br /><br />Oh, and you can barely eat a whole bag.  These are small bags, but they are rich.  I found that I only needed a small amount to satisfy that salty/crunchy craving.  So they will go pretty far I think.<br /><br />Would recommend for anyone trying to stay low carb.

review/summary: Merckens Coatings are my preference
review/text: I recently decided to jump on the bandwagon and give cake balls a whirl for a July 4th Party I was having. I had never even seen, much less heard of candy melts prior to this undertaking. Of course, where do I go first when looking for something? Amazon.com! Now...I live in Texas and it's H-O-T right now, so I was concerned about product "meltage" during shipping. I drove myself on over to Michael's and purchased a plethora of Wilton Candy Melts. Well, I couldn't help myself...based on the positive reviews of the Mercken's Candy coatings, I decided to go ahead and order some White (5 lbs)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D6R92">5 LBS. Merckens White Coatings</a> and Blue (1 lb.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00085F7S2">1LB. Merckens Blue Coatings</a> Candy Coating. To my surprise, both arrived without melting...shocker! A few days later, I ordered Yellow Mercken's (1 lb.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D6R9W">1LB. Merckens Yellow Coatings</a> and Paramount crystals <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012A2FVY">Paramont Crystals, 1 lb.</a>  , along with a couple other items. This shipment came and the candy melts had, well, melted! The Paramount Crystals were also a melted mess, but I figured since it was going to be liquified anyway...no harm no foul (or is it "fowl'?). I wasn't surprised by this...have you ever BEEN to Texas in late June? As my late Grandmother would say "It's as hot as Corn Liquor!" (not that she knew how hot that was, since she NEVER drank alcohol in her 94 years!) So, I will not remove a single star from my rating based on this product melting...after all, it is INTENDED to melt! ***take note those of you who remove stars based on issues irrelevant to the item itself, you know who you are, you're the people who rate a PRODUCT based things that don't speak to the product...such as shipping speed, poor customer service or other acts of God which have nothing to do with the actual worthiness of the product itself. Rant over.<br /><br />Okay...now that I got the "back-story" out of the way...the actual review! I set about making chocolate cake balls to make a r/w/b flag and some cheesecake balls, which were oh-so-yummy, but a big, fat, time-consuming pain, to put on a stick, coated and decorated with sprinkles. I also was going to be dipping pretzel rods and Oreos...a regular "dip-fest" as it were. Being one to experiment until I find the best/easiest method...I melted some white almond bark (I'd used almond bark in the past for white and choc dipped pretzels with good success), Wilton's Candy Melts, Ghirardelli White Chocolate (the bars for baking $$$$$), and finally the Mercken's Candy Melts. Of the 4, the Mercken's was the "winner" as far as ease of dipping, smooth consistency and taste. I hesitate to put taste in there, because it's so subjective and besides, they all tasted good to me. But, I do realize taste is an important consideration for most people. Really, the Ghirardelli had the best taste, but the cost and the difficulty in it "setting up" as nicely gave the edge to Mercken's for this project. The Mercken's did edge out the Wilton candy melts as far as MY taste buds go. Your mileage may vary. The Almond Bark was the least expensive, slightly more difficult to work with for this project, not real white, very yummy. Mercken's is available in many colors, is readily available (in Dallas), is less $ than Mercken's and certainly the Ghirardelli, but not quite a smooth and a tad more difficult to work with.<br /><br />Since this review is for the yellow coating, I wanted to mention you might consider purchasing a large quantity of the white candy coating, since it can be purchased in 5 lb. bags, and just use Candy Food Coloring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FWVX">Wilton Primary Candy Color Set</a> to tint it to a shade you like.  Regular food coloring does not work...it must be specifically for candy.<br /><br />If you're particular, like I am, and the extra cost doesn't bother you, go with the Mercken's . If this is a project with and for the kiddos, the Wilton melts will be hunky dory. It's not that Mercken's are head and shoulders above Wilton's candy melts, just moderately so. Wilton's are certainly more widely available, cost less and come in more colors.<br /><br />Bottom line (for me) is that Mercken's was easiest to work with and that was/is the biggest factor in my preference. With the sprinkles and candy coating...all the desserts I was serving were so uber-RICH and sugary, I rightly figured the cake-pops and such wouldn't get eaten as much as they would be looked at for their decorating value and cuteness factor. My soiree hosted no kids...just a a house full of (thirsty) adults who were more focused on the offerings of adult beverages and jello shots than they were the desserts.<br /><br />***Note, I have pretty much the exact same review for the 5 lb. white, 1 lb. blue and 1 lb. yellow Mercken's Coatings, thanks to "Cut and Paste", to spare myself the trouble of re-writing the same review. Therefore, there is need to read my reviews for those items.

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.<br /><br />There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars. And they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 Tablespoon--per bar (I was expecting more like 25-30 mg when I tried my first one). The chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor, but honestly, I've tried every single flavor of the Go-Lean Roll bars, and they are really all quite good.

I sometimes have a Zone Perfect bar for lunch but it's hard to make it to the end of the day without feeling famished; these Kashi bars keep me satisfied up to dinner time. As others have said, they are quite chewy, which I like, and the nut/grain coating has a good crunchy texture. Know that if you try to wolf one of these down quickly, the crunchy coating makes for a pretty effective abrasive against the roof of your mouth... in other words, chew slowly!<br /><br />Amazon's price per-bar is quite high compared to just a pack of 4 that you can find in big-box stores.

review/text: If you have dentures or braces or loose teeth, don't try to eat these.  The first time I bit into one, I was unprepared for the resistance I met, which resulted in a small battle with the bar complete with slobbering and growling.  Note to self--do not eat in public.  My solution is to microwave the bar--after removing the foil wrapper!--to soften up the caramel.  The taste is decent--and may or may not be worth the struggle of actually consuming it.  Personal decision, I suppose.

review/summary: Not my favorite of the Kashi bars (GoLean Crunchy is the best), but not bad
review/text: The rolls consist of a very firm and chewy slightly chocolaty nougat-like center surrounded by a layer of caramel and rolled in a Rice Krispie-like coating. The taste is pretty good, and it should keep you going for a few hours.<br /><br />The caramel layer is very sticky, so try not to touch it. The least messy way to eat this is to just pull down the wrapper far enough to take a bite. Keep the rolls at room temperature (chilled you will not be able to bite into it, too warm and you have a sticky mess).<br /><br />It would be great if these were packaged as a pouch of bite-size pieces rather than a roll.

review/summary: GOLEAN roll bar, over a dollar each but very good
review/text: I love trying Kashi products because they are attentive to whole grains, low sugar, etc.  This product has 12 grams of protein and is less like candy than other nutrition bars, which I appreciate. It is, however, sweet enough that it is a pleasure to eat. I am surprised that what I am asked to review is called a Turtle Bar; I just re-read the description and what I got was definitely not the Turtle bar because the center was vanilla and not chocolate.  I don't really care because I was looking for a tasty Kashi product, hoping for something less sugary than other meal replacement bars and these goals were met. I will be trying other flavors anyway.  One caution: this bar requires a good set of teeth to eat--lots of crunch and chew (which make it more satisfying, in my opinion).  If you like Kashi products in general, you will probably like this one.

review/summary: Hard and Chewy
review/text: I bought this at Trader Joes and it was pretty hard.  Maybe it was just old, as others have said.  It was so hard and chewy that it hurt my jaw.  The taste was ok, not as chocolatey as I had hoped.  The caramel was good but pretty sticky, and it got on my fingers.  The nuts and things on the outside were pretty good, but kept falling off and onto the floor.  I guess I'll try for a less messy kashi bar next time.

review/text: I am hooked on the Kashi Golean bars but this one is my least favorite of them. Maybe I just got couple of old ones or something but the 2 of this flavor that I tried were as hard as rocks. I nearly broke my front tooth (at least it felt that way) biting into them. I do agree it tastes good once you get a bite off, but it's not worth the toothache.<br /><br />Try the other flavors, they are good but think twice about this one.

review/text: I love these bars which I discovered 3 years ago when I needed to eat more foods with a better glycemic response. These are great and really keep me satisfied.  I'm on the auto delivery plan which is so much cheaper than the grocery store.  I used to try to wait until they went on sale at the grocery store, but now I just do the Amazon auto delivery and cheap price. I do wish they would make them a little healthier and stop with the palm kernel oil and a little less sugar would suit me better.

review/summary: Super filling bar
review/text: There are several things I like about this bar, but the most important thing is that it fills you up and you feel full for several hours. My favorite flavor is the caramel peanut. It has 190 calories, 6 grams of fiber, and 12 grams of protein. It's very chewy-the nougat center is the best part. It takes a while to chew, so by the time you've eaten the whole thing, you feel satisfied. It also has a low glycemic index, which means that it doesn't cause sugar spikes. Sugar spikes give you some energy, then you crash and start to feel hungry again. I eat one at work around 11:00 or 11:30, and I don't start to feel hungry until around 4:00. The price is very good too-even if I paid the full price of around $24.00, it's still only $2.00 for a meal, because this bar is usually the only lunch I eat. Amazon is good about usually having a 12 bar box available for around 16 dollars. I consider this bar a real bargain.

Well, after getting my box this past Saturday and literally just finishing one (05/09/2011 at 2:00 p.m. EST) these are awesome!  Don't buy them from the grocery store because you don't know how long they have been sitting on the shelf!<br /><br />The center was a nice soft texture!  I can now let my hubby try them, he has dentures and there was no way he could have bitten down on the ones from the grocery store!<br /><br />I am on the auto delivery plan for every two months, I might have to change it to every month!  Going to look at the other flavors that are offered here on Amazon!

review/summary: Best Protein bar I've ever tasted
review/text: What I love about this bar is that it doesn't have the after taste that many other protein bars have. I have tried many believe me and most of them are not even good for you and taste artificial. I love this because it is chewy, delicious, and most of all has excellent nutritional value.<br /><br />It maybe a bit chewy for some, like it can hurt your jaw at times, but I love that fact because I love the fact that it is re-teaching me how to take time to chew and enjoy food. These days, everything has become so convenient, our teeth don't even do any work any more :)<br /><br />I also love that it has so much fiber but doesn't taste so chalky or grassy.<br /><br />I guess at the end of the day, it is all about preference. I love most Kashi products but this one, I will give five stars b/c they did an excellent job packing in nutrition in a delicious roll. Thanks Kashi!

review/text: it's really good!!! i've had so many types of granola bars before, thinking they'd keep me full, but always realizing they're full of empty cals.  this one tastes quite similar to a candy bar, but keeps me going the whole day!<br /><br />the caramel roll is deadly sticky, has a little chalky feel to it, prob because of the soy protein isolate added, and the crispy exterior makes it dangerous for the roof of your mouth (first time i ate it i scraped so much skin off the roof, i was chewing it into my food-- gross!)<br /><br />BUT: not too sweet, tastes decent, keeps you full for hours, travels well..  most importantly, i don't feel guilty having one!  give it a try when it's on offer.

review/text: If you have TMJ, steer far away from this. It's inedible. Never mind the taste, which is completely bland and somewhat chalky, but this is very, VERY tough to chew for someone with TMJ issues. I made the mistake of looking at the picture and spotting "nougat," which really shouldn't be *that* chewy. I mean, if I can handle a room-temperature Clif bar...<br /><br />Maybe I'll microwave the ones left in the box to make them edible.

review/summary: Great, refined sugar free snack
review/text: I discovered the Kashi GOLEAN Turtle Roll last year while hiking with my boyfriend. I've given up on anything with refined sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. You have no idea how difficult it is to find healthy, mass-produced snacks that don't contain either of these. But Kashi GOLEAN Turtle Rolls are made with brown rice syrup. They're great for packing into a back pack. Even when they get squished, they're still easy to eat. And they tasted good, too. These are incredibly difficult to find in my local grocery store and market so I buy a case or two from Amazon every other month and keep one at home and one at the office for days when I can't make it out to lunch. With a glass of milk, the Kashi GOLEAN Turtle rolls is great for tiding me over 'til dinner.

review/summary: Country Choice Oats is a Great Choice
review/text: I am just going through the first of the six pack I purchased from Amazon. I added two tablespooons of Country Quick Oats, raisins, walnuts and almonds and then half a glass of Soy milk to a bowl. Cooked it in a microwave for three mintues under reduced power, added honey and a touch more of soy milk for consistency. This has been the easiest breakfast to make. The taste and texture are very good. Amazon offers active subscription rates.

review/text: I realize that taste is a matter of personal preference so food reviews are always going to be hit or miss for your tastes. Got the cookies, liked them but they didn't quite send me the way other folks seem to take to them. Not bad and I don't feel I wasted my money but I'll probably look for something else next time I'm ordering snacks for work.

review/summary: Delicious cookies, but not single serving packs
review/text: Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these.

review/summary: Bit Too Dry
review/text: These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.

review/text: This was another great find on Amazon Grocery!! They are very tasty, crunchy little cookies.  My family has really enjoyed these, they have a great mild chocolate taste and quite the crunch.  Most of the animal crackers/cookies that I've purchased for my family have become dismembered sometime before my children get them out of the package, these are mostly whole and you can really tell what the critter is before you pop it in your mouth ... Extra fun snack time for the little ones.  All in all, the box of cookies is well worth the price and I feel good about packing healthier snacks in my children's backpacks for school.

review/text: These chocolate chip cookies are addicting! They are the best tasting cookies out there, and they are healthy for you too! They are crisp, fresh, and have an even amount of chocolate vs cookie flavor. They are not animal crackers by any means.<br /><br />The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have them delivered to some place cool (not to your door step on a hot July day!) as one batch came out a little not-so-crisp, and I'm pretty sure it was because of that.<br /><br />These cookies are almost twice as expensive in the stores where I live if I buy them by the bag. Forget that! I'm sticking with them here on Amazon!<br />Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Did the recipe change?
review/text: I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local "healthy supermarket," and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.

review/summary: VEGANS BEWARE - These contain milk.
review/text: These are delicious and actually have pieces of peanut butter in them. Crunchy but still creamy, and so yummy. However, I didn't check the ingredients before purchasing and assumed that - like the Vanilla, Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal - these would be vegan. They're not - they have whey and milk powder in them. For a non-vegan, these taste great and are a more healthy choice than your standard cookie.<br /><br />For the calorie counters: these have almost 50% more calories per serving than the other Snackimals flavors. Most of the other flavors are 110 calories per 10 cookie serving, and the Peanut Butter are 150 calories per 10 cookie serving.

The deal you get on amazon can not be beat. I have gotten these from health food stores at a MUCH higher price than the rate they go for here. I do no have kids but when I do these will make it into their lunch  boxes.

review/summary: So good!...........
review/text: One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.  I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!

I'm leery of having snacks around and I'm not too fond of having the kid eat a lot of snacks, but my wife assures me that these are relatively healthy snacks. Hmmmmm. I suspect that these are just as much for her as for the boy. Well, what can you do? We already have them and the bag is open. I might as well try one just to see what they're all about. Mmmmmm. Somewhat dry and crunchy. Nice chocolatey taste, but not too heavy. Sweet, but only lightly sweet. Nice snack or treat! Of course, the boy loves them! I'm going to have problems staying away from these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I like the ingredients and packs are big enough to share with another person.  I bought based on good reviews and found them to be crispy and delicious.  They taste like those little animal crackers you find in the small, red, zoo-like boxes with the string handles I had as a child but these are crispier and better ingredients.  I didn't sense the chocolate chip in the flavor but they are good. Recommend! :)<br /><br />EDIT:  Tried the Oatmeal flavor and was sadly disappointed..2 stars from me. The taste was bland and nothing exceptional for the over-the-top cost.  PLUS...Amazon only lets you review ONE FLAVOR even if you try others.  Obnoxious and deceptive...makes all flavors look 5 star when they are NOT.

review/text: My son has a ton of allergies and there are so few things he can have that are not homeade.  These cookies however have made the list for snack food he can eat being that they are free of peanuts, wheat, soy, treenuts and more.  I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens.  usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too. It is so great to find a snack food for a small child with allergies that he can take to school and be like every one else.
