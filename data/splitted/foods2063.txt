review/summary: I liked it!
review/text: I added some brown rice I had already cooked.  I was concerned that it would tame it so much I wouldn't care for it.  However, it was still spicy enough for me with the rice.  I liked it before I added the rice, too - not too spicy.

review/summary: Kitchens of india SPINACH with cc.
review/text: Kitchen Of India READY TO EAT Spinach with Cottage Cheese<br /><br />Kitchen Of India Spinach with Cottage Cheese is well wrapped for packaging shipping purposes. I find the asthetics appealing. The aroma in my microwave was wonderful; the dark green may be fearsome to a timid person, but for someone who really likes spinach and wants a little taste adventure; this is a perfect first Indian food to try. It is not too spicy for the palate. It has a good flavor and I used crackers dipped into it as well as on top of a noodle mix I make with turkey.

review/summary: decent snack
review/text: Firstly, I don't eat Indian food often so I'm absolutely no expert on Indian cuisine. I've always enjoyed palak paneer at Indian restaurants so I thought I'd give this a try. Each packet contained a decent amount of cheese - about the amount shown in the picture, and the cheese is pretty good. The spinach sauce is very watery, like pureed spinach soup, but still flavorful. It was more spicy-hot than what I've had in restaurants, which I didn't like. Overall - I liked the cheese, didn't like the sauce.

review/summary: Poor taste and nutrition
review/text: I've never been a big fan of palak (spinach). However, the major problem with this item is that the palak gravy is too thin and the paneer tastes really bad.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the sodium level in this product is ridiculously high. I bought this product thinking that it would be slightly more healthy compared to other packed-food products but the high-sodium level ruined it.<br /><br />That said, some of the other products by this brand, for example 'dal bukhara' and 'rajma', taste much better. And if you are looking for healthy food, I guess you should be looking somewhere else. Buying some fresh vegetables at the local grocery store might be a good start in that regard.

review/text: My title says it all.  I've had palak paneer in restaurants, so I know what it should be like.  It's one of my favorite Indian dishes.  But whew, the salt, and the high fat content makes Kitchens of India brand palak paneer a heart attack in a bag.  I couldn't taste the spinach for all the salt.  The texture is unpleasant-<br /> more like a gruel than pureed spinach.  Finally, the hard, pathetic little eraser-sized pieces of cheese, two at most, just made me cancel my "subscribe and save" subscription to this product.

review/summary: Remember to shake the bottle first
review/text: In my quest to duplicate the taste of my favorite White Chocolate Mocha drink from the local coffee house I needed to find a White Chocolate Sauce that would duplicate the flavor.  I love Ghiradelli chocolates so this is the first one I tried and I have not changed since.  We are now on our 4th bottle of the stuff in as many months and unless they stop making it I will not change.<br /><br />One thing that many forget to do and may be the reason for the above posters issues is you need to give the bottle a good shaking when you recieve it.  The sauce will seperate a little over time.  You can see this by pumping some out first and then shake it up good and pump some more out.  You will see a difference in the two samples.<br /><br />Either way, in a 16oz coffee cup I use three pumps of the sauce(I like my coffee a little on the sweet side), with about 4oz milk and then my favorite dark blend of coffee and this gets very close to the taste I grew to like and costs me a fraction.<br /><br />I have also tried the powder but that did not taste as rich and creamy as the sauce.

review/summary: Espresso + 2% milk + this sauce = HEAVEN
review/text: My husband and I became addicted to white mochas from our local drive-thru coffee shop this last summer.  He decided to buy a Bialetti Moka Express, 6 Cup to make espresso at home.  We tried getting away with the syrups that we could pick up at the supermarket, but nothing felt like a true replacement for our coffee shop favorite.  I finally broke down and bought this sauce (with pump - makes it SO much easier!!) and I LOVE it!  I will never flavor my espresso drinks with another flavoring again.

review/summary: BUY CONDENSED MILK, IT'S CHEAPER
review/text: I bought this sauce at my local Smart & Final to make my Iced White Mocha's I LOVE so much.  I would normally spend $4 for a venti white mocha and my husband decided to get me my own Espresso Machine.  Well I was excited and ready to go with my clear plastic cups and lids and my white chocolate sauce.  Unfortunately, this was just awful.  I knew it wasn't going to be good when I poured the sauce and it was a transparent  yellowish tone, not the thick white sauce  I normally see the barista squirt into my cup.  So I poured it back into the bottle thinking I needed to shake it up but it didn't change.  It tasted awful.  Even my 4 yr old son who enjoys white mocha's with me all the time (Decaf,of course) didnt want anything to do with it.  Thankfully my 6 yr old who hasn't had as many white mocha's as my son and I gave it a thumbs up so hopefully she can finish off this stuff so its not a complete waste.  I just ordered Torani's white chocolate sauce With a pump so I hope that is exactly what I am looking for.  Good luck!

review/summary: Best Min Tea money can buy...
review/text: And considering how expensive teas can climb these are a steal, especially on Amazon (thank you!)<br /><br />I opted for this particular blend at my favorite cafe recently and was expecting tea but instead got TTTTEA!<br />The aroma literally cleared up my senses, you breathe it in and it just calms and restores you. The flavor is deep but not over powering and can serve as a breath freshener. I went over to my local whole foods and bought a box asap but will be buying from here, after I finish my first box. Very anxious to try the rest of the line.<br /><br />And as if it didn't get any sweeter, the tea bag as well as the string and name tag are completely biodegradable!<br /><br />A fantastic tea any time of the day but I prefer it at night, it's my reward for getting through the day :)<br /><br />Happy Sipping

review/summary: Spearmint, not Peppermint
review/text: Organic mint is my favorite tea, I drink at least 5 cups a day of it.<br /><br />Amazon's ingredient list and description are incorrect (as of the date of my purchase, I have contacted them so hopefully they will correct it).  This tea is comprised of 100% organic Nana Mint, which is spearmint, not peppermint.  I would not have ordered this tea had I known that, as I prefer peppermint.<br /><br />But if you are desiring a spearmint tea, this is a wonderful, high quality tea.  I can't imagine anyone else doing it better.  It tastes smooth, delicious, and has a crisp finish.  Wonderful aroma.  It tastes fantastic even when its ice cold.  As noted already, the sachets are top quality and make for a lovely presentation.<br /><br />So now that I am impressed with Mighty Leaf, I cannot find an organic peppermint mint tea by them that isn't molested by lemon verbena!

review/text: The sweet aroma immediately gives it away.... This is finest quality bagged tea on the shelves!<br /><br />As an "only organic" leaf tea and herb tea drinker for years, Mighty Lea Tea is easily the highest quality and freshed tea I've ever drank.  And, the taste of Mighty Leaf Tea is so delicious and strong.  You can tell great care went into growing and packaging this tea.  The silk tea bag is evidence of this.<br /><br />So when it comes to high quality organic tea, Mighty Leaf is clearly at the top.  I've tried other "expensive organic" brands, and most are overpriced, stale, and flat tasting.  There are only a few brands of store shelf tea I'd drink, and Mightly Leaf is one of them.

But by far, this is the best brown mustard I've ever eaten and goes great on everything one might want it for!  Brats to hotdogs, burgers to egg salads, it conquers all!<br /><br />The best part is they use sea salt AND their own excellent brand of apple cider vinegar, which we use a lot of and have for years.  This mustard is different than any other brown mustard I've tried because of those two ingredients right there. Gives it a nice tangy but balanced flavor, with the fulness that sea salt brings to all foods!<br /><br />Absolutely LOVE this stuff -- can't go wrong with this one folks!<br /><br />I do prefer the glass jars (not avaialble on Amazon), but this is still a viable alternative.

review/summary: The Best British Fruitcake
review/text: All those jokes about the same fruitcake being re-gifted every year.  Yes, I told them too.<br /><br />My Brit husband loves this one by Walkers.  Believe me when I say it was the best fruitcake I have ever tasted.  It is a rich, moist dense cake packed with raisens.  None of those icky plastic apple, cherry or pineapple pieces that dominate an American one.<br /><br />Rather on the expensive side esp when you add in shipping/handling but once a year makes it a true holiday treat.<br /><br />Enjoy the Holidays!

review/summary: There is NOTHING like European Fruitcake!!
review/text: I LOVE fruitcake. I just love it ... but when I try to share that with other people, they just don't understand. Fruitcake has gotten such a bad reputation. The thing is, people from the US believe that fruitcake has to contain those disgusting day-glow pieces of cherry and other "fruit"  It seems even the gourmet cakes purchased at places like Williams Sonoma or the cakes lovingly hand made by monks have this atrocity! I find that to be beyond gross! I won't touch any of those cakes.<br /><br />It is the European fruitcakes that I long for. Not too sweet and full of raisins and nuts and other goodies (Not to mention the alcohol which keeps everything nice and moist).  Absolutely nothing about it glows in the dark.<br /><br />This cake made by Walkers is one of the best I have ever had. The marzipan on the top really gives it something special. It is just delicious! I would give it 5 stars, but it is a bit pricey. I agree with the other reviewer though. For a once a year treat it is well worth it.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I first heard of this PB from a food blog and thought it sounded great.  I love peanut butter and love trying new brands and flavors, so I was really excited about getting these.<br /><br />First, I will say that the Banana is AWESOME!<br /><br />The Cookie Nookie just tastes like regular peanut butter.  We couldn't taste any hint of chocolate chip cookie dough in this.  It's not bad at all, so we will eat it, but it's disappointing to pay so much for no cookie dough flavor.<br /><br />The Razzle Dazzle is what we were looking forward to the most and we ended up having to throw it out.  We couldn't get past the horrible smell.  We thought maybe we got a bad jar, so we bought another at Whole Foods Market and it was the same way.  After several attempts to try to eat it, both jars went in the trash.<br /><br />I will definitely buy the Banana flavor again, but not the other two.

My youngest likes the banana one and my oldest of course Mr sweet tooth likes the raspberry one. I love how it has natural to it, no added yuckys! They are very easy to spread and a little goes a long ways. We haven't even made half way into them and that's awesome for PB! Great CS and they ship super fast!

review/summary: Never received product
review/text: A blogger friend of mine tried out PB Crave and posted rave reviews. Being a huge peanut butter fan myself I decided to order this for an upcoming camping trip. My order was placed on July 17th with a delivery window of July 23 - 26th. Perfect, it would arrive a week before we leave on our trip. July 26th came and past with no order or shipment history with FedEx, the only history FedEx had was that a label was created but the package never shipped.<br /><br />I email PB Crave on Sunday July 29th inquiring about my shipment and got a response on Monday. Apparently one of the flavors in my trio was out of stock but they graciously offered to ship my order sometime next week and would throw in the CoCo Banana for my troubles OR I could cancel my order all together and they would issue a refund. My issue is the lack of communication, had they emailed me when I placed my order notifying me of the back order I would have opted to substitute my original order with something else.  This wasn't even an option. I replied to their gracious offer asking them to substitute and overnight the new order to me (so far no response), I will update IF they respond to my reply.<br /><br />Is this going to ruin our camping trip, no..But there is a slight disappointment. This was going to be something new for the huge group of kids going on our family trip to try out and a couple of those kids are huge peanut butter enthusiasts and were just as excited as I was about trying something new.

I first tasted this Chai in a little coffee shop and searched all over to find it so I could make it at home. I found it here on Amazon and bought the 4lb bag. We have had it for a couple of weeks and it is almost half gone between my husband and I. I thought that it would be enough that we would want to share with family and friends but now we are being stingy with it because we love it so much. I know shame on us tee hee. I will definitly be buying again and again! It is best steamed with milk!!!

review/summary: These are good.  Very, very good.
review/text: I don't mean "good for a gluten free cookie", or "almost like a normal cookie".  No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.  They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free.  No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also.  According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You're probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn't the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren't.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me.

review/summary: Good grief, these cookies are delicious!!!!
review/text: Are these really gluten free, because they sure don't taste like it!  There are a few other cookies being marketed as "gluten free" or "diet" but there simply is no comparison to these nuggets of goodness.  Frankly, even given the choice between these and something like a Pillsbury or Toll House oven-baked cookie, I'd take Lucy's cookies in a heartbeat.  No guilt, no high glycemic index to make you feel like you just gained five pounds, no impulse to hibernate.  Just moist, sweet morsels that make you wonder why the bag isn't three inches deeper.  (Seriously, Lucy, you need to make them deeper.)  And the inspiring story behind the creation of Lucy's cookies will make you feel that much better, knowing that you're supporting a homegrown business, rather than a huge multi-national.  I can't recommend these enough.

review/summary: Used to own stock in the company, but changed their formulation, and get a much lower rating
review/text: I used to love EVERY flavor of these cokies. I was the one buying out the entire shelf at WFoods. I started ordering on amazon multiple 8 packs at a time.  I could easily eat 2 boxes a day by myself!  I eat really healthy and my sweets is the only thing I give myself what I want.  I am vegan and "prefer" to eat gluten free, as I am supposed to due to healh issues, but don't always because there are no other GF desserts that are vegan that I LOVE.  So BOY was I disappointed when I had to stop buying them very mcuh because they changed the fat and calories significantly.  I wonder i anyone else noticed.  I wrote to Dr. Lucy and she replied.  I asked if I could still order some from her int he original formulation, or where I could buy them like that, but she said no.  The only reasons she gave were some type of problem with the formulation and baking f the cookie, but I don't understand beacause they were perfect??!  A better explanation would have been nice.  So thus, I am very disappointed in this line, which was the ONLY GF, VEGAN, LOW FAT/LOW CAL, DELICIOUS!!! line of desserts I enjoyed, and now cannot eat them very often at all.  When I am consuming large amounts, I'm sorry but 25g of fat for a whole box vs. 7.5 g fat/box for the old cookies?  Can't do it. Dang Lucy....I miss my sweet yumminess.

review/summary: Dry with after taste
review/text: I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.  I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucy's.  Thanks for reading.

review/summary: Ecellent Vegan Gluten Free Cookies, No Tummy Aches
review/text: These cookies are very similar to garden variety wheat based chocolate chip cookies, they have similar texture and snap, but these are both vegan and gluten free, which matches my requirements.  My celiac disease makes me very sensitive to wheat and these cookies do not trigger any reaction.<br /><br />The cookies are if anything a little more crisp than most, but not at all hard or difficult to chew.  They certainly contain sugar.  I do not eat these everyday because they are so sweet, but I do like them and may very well subscribe to them.<br /><br />If I were rating these only on flavor and texture I'd give them 4 stars, but Lucy annoyed me by creating a bizzarre nutrition panel.  Each package contains 4 cookies.  They state it is 1.3 servings, then go on to say one serving has 130 calories.  So each package seems to contain 169 calories, possibly over some people's limit for a snack.  But let's be honest, these cookies with lots of organic cane sugar have a lot of calories.  Each cookie must weigh in at a bit over 40 calories.<br /><br />For years we have known that 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  Now we know it is a cookie worth of calories too, tasty calories.  Will buy again.

review/text: While I am not gluten intolerant, I'm trying to reduce my gluten intake for health reasons and snacks seem to be the best way to to try and curb my intake. Since snacks of this type are not a dietary requirement (much as I'd wish they were) I have the ability to chose *any* cookie, gluten free or not, I am lucky in that I can afford to be a little picky. I had tried a few other weird/bland gluten free options and wow- these cookies really surprised me - the are actually very good! Crispy, no weird/off tastes, just like a "real" cookie. Nice size for dunking in a cold cup of lactose free milk without getting lost or soggy. I deducted one star because they could use a few more chips sprinkled in there.<br /><br />They are a little expensive but I don't mind the price point considering that the factory goes to great lengths to protect against cross contamination from allergens and gluten. Plus being a little pricey I am less likely to eat more than one pack at a time :) I'm looking forward to trying the four flavor combo pack next time.

But, I have to say, I always feel MISERABLE after eating these cookies.<br />Someone else mentions how they are too sweet, etc etc. I don't think they taste too sweet, and they have 13g of sugar per serving which doesn't seem like it's that much, considering most other 'sweets' have more sugars per serving (take a look at Gatorade, for example).<br />That said, it does seem to be some kind of a reaction to the sugar, because immediately after eating them I feel like my body is dumping into some kind of sugar coma. I start to feel like lead, and lightheaded. They also mess up my tummy. Maybe it's the type of sugar they use? Evaporated cane juice is the 1st ingredient, and they also contain 2 kinds of cellulose, which I think are sugars also (but I could be wrong).<br />Anyhow, I gave 4 stars for taste, because they are THAT good, but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster they should do *something* about this ... I don't want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them, but maybe try using less sugar, or a different kind of sugar, like organic brown? I have no idea, but I would never let a kid eat more than 1 of these at a time, for fear it'd make them just pass out!<br />I eat other sweet stuff, and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over-sugared.<br /><br />I'm not even totally sure it's the sugar that makes you feel this way ... any ideas? It's a shame, because they are so delicious. I've tried them several times, and may keep them on hand for a once-in-a-blue-moon craving, but I definitely won't be eating them often.

review/summary: Pretty Good for what is is
review/text: For what is is, this cookie is pretty good. Does it taste like the soft, under-baked, buttery kind you get from a bakery or your favorite shoppe? No, however it does satisfy a sweet tooth. In my opinion these taste just like a "less sweet" version of the chips ahoy brand I ate as a kid.

review/summary: Just like Snickerdoodles!
review/text: This cookies are really tasty and I will definitely be reordering.  I ordered the package of 16 small bags to be able to have a snack to carry with me to places unlikely to have anything gluten free, and I'm glad I ordered this product. If one is signed up for the autodelivery program the price is pretty reasonable. The little bag of 4 cookies helps me with portion control because if I had the whole box I would probably plow right through them.  They are very flavorful and taste just like cinnamony Snickerdoodles; there is no weird aftertaste as with many GF foods. (I have also had the oatmeal cookies and found them crispy too but much more bland; they would be good with coffee.) I've even considered crushing the cinnamon thins to make a crust for cheesecake but haven't tried that yet (would buy a box to do so to avoid the need to open multiple bags).  The cookies are very crispy, so if that is an issue for you, take note. (I know my false-toothed father would have to soak these in milk to be able to eat them, but I believe he would think they were worth it!)

review/summary: Chocolate Chip Cookies
review/text: I went on a search for dairy free chocolate and found these great cookies!  We believed my breastfed son was sensitive to milk, and having to avoid dairy when you're a chocoholic is very difficult!  These cookies helped to feed my chocolate cravings, and helped keep my sanity in those difficult first weeks with a newborn.  At first, I thought they tasted just a bit different.  They're a lot crunchier than regular chocolate chip cookies and they don't taste exactly the same.  However, after being off of dairy and munching on these cookies, I began to not notice a difference.  My picky husband also said they were good!

review/text: These cinnamon thin cookies looked appealing in the package so I bought some.  I didn't buy them because they were gluten-free, I just like anything that TASTES GOOD, whether it's low-fat, fattening, gluten-free, low carb, etc. and they ARE really good and surprisingly satisfying for being gluten-free.  Make sure that if you eat them while having coffee that you "dunk" quick (if you like to dunk your cookies).  I order 5 or 6 boxes at a time and will continue to in the future because now they are a favorite that I eat practically every day.

review/summary: Yummy, little crunchy cookies
review/text: If you have serious food allergies or gluten intolerance, you probably bake your own (and aren't reading this review) -- but what a joy to find Dr. Lucy's cookies in Starbucks recently!  Yes, these are boxed cookies, not to be confused with homemade, which is the sterling standard for me.  But given that, they're lovely!  The body of the cookie is slightly bean-flavored, since that's what the flour blend relies on; but it's not an obtrusive flavor.  Just a bit tangy.  The milk-free chips are great:  nicely rounded flavor, not burnt or sharp.  The texture is pleasantly crisp & sandy; not tough, not hard, not chewy.  Great with coffee or tea. Our favorite is the chocolate chip variety, but the cinnamon and sugar cookies versions are delicious also.  If you're not allergic yourself, but considering buying some for guests or grandchildren who are, then I'd encourage you to go for it.  You'll find you munch on them, too, because they're just yummy, little crunchy cookies.

review/text: I discovered these at my local Starbucks and loved them. The sugar cookies are wonderful, have a nice crunch and leave no aftertaste. The easiest way for me to explain the taste of the sugar cookie is to tell you they taste & remind me of Christmas sugar cookies. The chocolate chip are good and the cinnamon are too but the sugar is my favorite. It's so hard to find gluten-free snacks that taste great and don't leave you yearning for a " real " snack. Buy them !

review/text: I have 15 documented food allergies and it is very difficult to find decent goodies.  These are the best allergy friendly cookies I have tasted yet!  I tried them for the first time today.  I needed to use up a Starbucks gift certificate and found these cookies in a basket in the front of the store.  Boy was I pleased when I discovered they were as good as any cookie made with wheat and eggs. Not the bland, dry, grainy taste of most GF cookies. Also the price is much better than many of the other allergy friendly products I have tried.  You will not be disapointed in these.

review/summary: Crispy Airy
review/text: These are fabulous! I saw in an online review of Dr. Lucy's cookies someone complaining about broken cookies when they arrived. Yes, some of the cookies will be broken, though not a lot. I think they break because of their unusual texture. I wish I knew the trick of making a cookie like this. They taste great, but a big part of what I just love about these cookies is their texture -- it's that airyness and crispness. Personally, they are addictive. I finished my first two boxes (I had bought, as a test, one of the 16 pack boxes in Cinnamon and one in Sugar) and sadly after a month or so I had eaten them all. I tried baking something simliar and couldn't do it -- though when I have mroe time, I'll give it many more tries. So just a couple days ago, I ordered a 16 pack box or cinnamon, sugar, and now I'm trying for the first time the oatmeal. I do recommend these cookies; they are my afternoon treat -- one pack of cookies (only 120 calories) and a good cup of decaf coffee and I'm fine till dinner!

I bought a 16 pack box of these and got in the habit of having a bag (only 120 calories for 4 good-sized cookies) of these every afternoon when I got sluggish. I began to look forward to their cinnamony taste and was bummed when I finally finished all of them. I tried to make some like them and it was a sad failure so just a couple of days ago, I ordered another box of these and the Sugar cookies (they are wonderful, too!) and I even ordered the Oatmeal ones so I can try those and see if they are as good as the others. I highly recommend these!

review/text: My daughter tried these cookies at a celiac camp she was at and fell in love wih them.  In addition to her loving the cookies, what is great about them is their grab bag type.  Being gluten/dairy/perservative/dye free often she feels different (and a little embarrassed) with the types of foods she eats.  This size is like having something most of her peers eat but it's healthy.  Another benefit is her non-gluten sensitive brother also loves them.  That is the real test, if the gluten eating kids like it!

review/summary: Great crunchy sweet treat
review/text: These cookies are great!  They have a slight Tapioca flour taste, but I'm very sensitive to that.  The chocolate chip ones are even better.  Thank you Dr. Lucy for a low-calorie gluten free treat.

review/summary: I was pleasantly surprised at how good these cookies are
review/text: I have Celiac Disease and have tried several brands of gluten free "bought" cookies as I call them.  I have always been disappointed and resorted to baking my own.  Although baking my own is fine, sometimes I would like the convenience of being able to have cookies on hand when the urge strikes, or to grab when I'm on the go.  I ordered a "case" each of the oatmeal and the sugar cookies and was very pleased with both of them, although I slightly favored the oatmeal.  I purposely tried to detect the usual "off taste" that I've found in other cookies - there is no "off taste" to either of these flavors.  Both cookies are crisp, just the way I like them....I have just one word for them "yummy"!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: These are pretty darn good cookies!  I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00213IAUQ">Lucy's Cinnamon Thins, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> but these are a close second.<br /><br />The cookies are crunchy, not chewy.  They do have a lot of sugar on the top but it is only noticeable if you have several at a time.  Seemed sweeter  to me than the cinnamon thins.<br /><br />Not crumbly or cakey.  No funky taste.<br /><br />Only 8 in the package, not very many at all.  Putting that in a positive light, you can consider it built-in portion control.  Handy if you're like me and sometimes happen to snack without actually paying attention to how much you are eating.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: These cookies are the best.  They are very crispy and taste great with a bowl of coconut milk ice cream.  The reviewer who thought they had an aftertaste or grainy texture is reacting to something I can't taste at all; these are yummier than all the wheat-based commercial sugar cookies I've tasted.
