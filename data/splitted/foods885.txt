review/summary: Found my replacement for a discontinued favorite!
review/text: My former favorite drink was Crystal Light Ruby Red, which was a yummy grapefruit flavor - but they discontinued it. I've been looking for a replacement, and think I  have found it in Sparkling Ice Pink Grapefruit flavor. Light carbonation, the grapefruit flavor is bright and divine. My new favorite!

review/text: Tired of the 3 flavors offered at Costco. Shipping cost was outrageous, so I elected to wait 2 months for free shipping (really) and then I received notice  that my items would arrive sooner. Waited maybe 10 days. These flavors are a little more expensive but a nice change. I love these since giving up diet coke 6 months ago.

review/summary: If you like grapefruit and you're counting calories/carbs, you'll love this!
review/text: I recently discovered this at my local big-box store while searching for a different product.  It looked interesting, so I tossed a bottle into my shopping cart.<br /><br />I chilled it in the fridge for an hour, then took it out for a test drive.  As soon as I opened the bottle, I was impressed by how authentic the grapefruit aroma was.<br /><br />By the second or third sip, I was hooked.  This stuff is great!  Even though it only contains 3% juice, it has a very intense, very authentic pink grapefruit flavor.  The best way I can describe it is as follows: if you took some freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice and added some plain seltzer water to it, that's what Sparkling Ice Pink Grapefruit tastes like.<br /><br />Best of all: zero calories and zero carbs.<br /><br />The standard caveats regarding artificial sweeteners are sure to apply here, but it seems like this would be fine when enjoyed in moderation.  I wouldn't recommend chugging multiple bottles every day, but one a day shouldn't hurt.<br /><br />Amazon's price is actually better than the local big-box, and the Subscribe & Save option lowers the price even further.  Nice!

review/text: The Pink Grapefruit ICE Drink is hands down the best tasting calorie-free drink available.  I have tried for years to get more water into my diet, and by drinking the ICE drinks I have managed to do so.  I also enjoy the Orange Mango flavor too.  I usually buy several cases at a time to ensure that I am never without my ICE drinks.

I purchase 18 pack from Sam's (orange mango, black raspberry, lemon lime), finding the pink grapefruit is hit or miss and I've only been able to find in singles; so I have a case auto shipped - it's less expensive and reliable.

review/summary: Ice over soda
review/text: I am a lover of sparkling water and unfortunately, soda.  However, making a lifestyle change includes eliminating myself from the big "P" something I never drank until I was pregnant with my second child and had crazy cravings for Pepsi, my husband's drink.  Anyway, a spiral down a bad road of 7-eleven trips in secret for my next Pepsi fix has caught up with me in pounds.  If you like soda and need a healthier choice try Ice and other sparkling flavored water until you find the one that dances on your taste buds. I can speak for myself and share it was the flavor and bubbles that hooked me soda-- with this selection you can still get taste, bubbles with NO CALORIES (Yeah)!  Perrier also has a citrus flavor selection as well.

review/text: This is a really great drink. I am actually not a grapefruit fan but cannot drink sugared soft drinks. I found this product in a round about way. My wife and I ate lunch at a Panda Express out west and she noticed SOBE diet grapefruit in the drink dispenser so got that. I tried it and could not believe how good it was. We started looking for it in grocery stores and could never find it, so I contacted Pepsi (the maker). They replied that it was discontinued. We are now in the midwest and saw this Ice Grapefruit (sugar free) in a small Amish store so decided to try a bottle. Amazingly it tastes almost identical to the SOBE, maybe even better. We keep buying all this small store has on the shelf but see Amazon's price is much lower, espedcially when you consider the free shipping so will be ordering from them from now on.

Since I posted that review my husband and I, in fear of running out of the stuff without access to it locally, have begun to receive the Pink Grapefruit, Orange Mango, and Black Raspberry by subscription, twice a month, and the shipping cartons are starting to loom. Now the fear is that we're turning into some sort of crazy soda cultists. I think we need an intervention....

I have been cooking/eating anchovies for 40 years, I used canned in oil like these (most are from Morrocco), canned in salt from Sicily, and jarred in brine. All are good, the canned in oil are much saltier. But they always are. These are great because they are firm, nice fishy flavor, not too salty. When they are available again don't hesitate to buy if the right price......I have used them all and these are as good as any other brand (except those from italy/spain).

In fact the same brand was selling in 4 oz glass jars for $2.79 at a local grocery. Obviously, Amazon has figured out the price was way out of line (I guess someone snookered their buyer) but, unfortunately, not before I wasted $25.

review/summary: So tasty!
review/text: My husband is Russian and this is the only brand of Cod liver we buy. Unlike some of the other brands its packed in cod liver oil, instead of nasty rancid soybean oil. The taste is remarkably fresh for canned.  We love to make spreads out of this or just eat it on a salad or on toast.

review/summary: Inuit-Style Treat
review/text: According to two other reviewers: "The taste is remarkably fresh for canned" and "The Japanese would describe it as Umami." I quite agree with both of these observations. Some cautions, however:<br /><br />You can't just open a can and eat it as if it were a can of sardines, or even a can of oil-pack tuna. The product is extremely oily -- in fact, it is 60% oil (richer than triple-creme brie)! It happens to be a healthful oil with vitamins A and D and Omega 3 fats, but it is still a bit much. I compared the nutritional values to a somewhat smaller can of oil-packed sardines. The cod liver had less protein than one might expect -- 9 grams versus 16 for the sardines -- but off the chart on calories with 1165!<br /><br />To make matters worse, the instructions on the can (if you can read them -- they're in four languages and the tiny print requires a STRONG magnifier to see) say, "Must be consumed immediately after opening." I strongly suggest a skeptical regard to that. The "remarkably fresh" taste does change quickly even in the refrigerator, but the result is not unpleasant. A little fishier, perhaps. I kept some for over a week and it was still tasty.<br /><br />By the way, you ought not to waste the oil. It is of course sold separately as cod liver oil and is a fine nutritional supplement.<br /><br />So, I suggest a strategic approach to consuming a can. You don't want to eat it all at once (even if you have help), regardless of what the label says.

review/summary: Our kids love it too
review/text: My husband brought home a different brand of smoked cod liver from a trip to France, not really knowing exactly what it was, only that it was fish (which he could get through Customs). We LOVE it. I bought the King Oscar, hoping it would be as good. It nearly is. Still very, very good. The kids eat it with a fork, right from the can if given the chance. If you want to be more refined about it, just make sure you have a cracker that is worthy!<br /><br />In good conscience, it's hard to throw the oil away. A little drizzle on salad is good, but too much is "heavy" tasting. So, I add some to the dog's food (instead of salmon oil) until it's gone.<br /><br />It has a texture closer to a good pate than mousse. The smoke flavor is fairly light. We'll be buying it again!

review/summary: Very nutritious and surprisingly mild
review/text: I had never eaten canned cod livers before, and these were surprisingly mild. I was trying them for the nutritional benefit of the oil and the vitamins A and D.<br /><br />You can easily "hide" these in your tuna salad in small quantities if you are trying to eat them for the nutritional benefit, but don't like how they taste.  I also find the excess oil to be very good lightly sprinkled on a salad.  I also make my own salad dressings, and the oil/pureed livers can easily be incorporated into the dressing in small quantities, as you would anchovies, for instance.  I get bored with just eating the pate, so I'm trying to find new ways to eat this great food.<br /><br />Having said all that, a little goes a LONG way, as they are very oily and high in calories.  I have to eat a whole can over several days.  I agree with other reviewers that the taste does change over time, but if refrigerated immediately and consumed over just a few days, the change is negligible.  The price seems a bit high, but the nutritional bang for your buck is worth it.<br /><br />I will order more in the future as long as they are available.  Thanks to Amazon for offering this product!

review/text: This is the best price for cod livers in cod liver oil, and has a good fresh taste. But I wish it came without the bay leaves, pepper and table salt seasoning, as it would be healthier that way. I freeze the contents in a glass container after opening, and eat a few bites every day to get my fish oil supplement in. It lasts me about a week per can.<br /><br />I also ordered the other brand of cod liver in its own oil with only sea salt added. That option was very good, too, but it was more expensive than this brand due to smaller-size cans and added shipping costs.

review/summary: Cod Liver...
review/text: This is 6.67 oz which is huge amount of cod liver... for every 4.26 oz = 121 grams, I get OVER 100,000 IU vitamin A (2,000%), 10,000 IU vitamin D (2,500%), 20,000 MG Omega-3, 570 MG cholesterol (190%), 100 g fat (150%)... I have consumed cod liver from Ireland, Latvia, Denmark... It has so much vitamin A that can be considered toxic less alone, fat and cholesterol. Not a strong fishy taste at all. I place it in a sealed container in the refrigerator and consume it within a week since with over 8,000/IF, very high in inflammation factor it is great for my muscles when I do heavy work out. King Oscar is priced less than other brands. It is recommended that you drain the oil which I do not since I consume it all, but need to consume it cold. I make sure not to consume more than one can a month.

review/text: Okay, to each it's own. I've been a flavor chick my whole life. When I eat a cookie, I want to taste the sweetness of the chocolate and the sweetness of the cookie. The same goes for my food - when I eat meatloaf, I want to taste the flavors of my seasonings and the tomato sauce on top. I hate flavorless foods. So, with that being said, these are AWESOME! I loved the fact (being a Celiac) that I have finally found a cracker that I can eat now and one that is so good! My whole family (children, who are extremely honest about how things taste) thought these were the best thing since pizza bites! Maybe this may not be for you if you like your foods without season, but if you like flavor this is it! Love these!

review/summary: The taste is overpowering and lingers on your tongue!
review/text: I like Almond Nut Thins very much, especially the Cheddar Cheese flavor. These ranch-flavored crackers taste good upon first bite, but the problem is that the tangy taste doesn't go away, so if you munch on a few of these in the evening, you will still taste them the next morning - and that's after brushing your teeth and tongue!  Blue Diamond, if you are reading this, please modify the ingredients so that these crackers don't contribute to embarrassing bad breath.  I found myself having to stand back from people and I felt uncomfortable. My husband also experienced the same lingering taste in his mouth. Other than that, they are perfectly crunchy and enjoyable to eat.  I purchased them through Subscribe & Save.  I am going to try out another flavor.  None of the other flavors have had the same longterm effect on me.<br />I have a cupboard full of these crackers.  I'll just have to give some away.  The other complaint/observation is that these rice crackers have no fiber content whatsoever.  For that reason, I may look for another alternative.<br />Update:  Turns out that these crackers don't go over well with my teenage daughter and her friends - too much "after breath"!  Blue Diamond, if you are listening, you may want to re-vamp your recipe.

review/text: You will get spoiled after eating these chips! These chips are very thick, crispy and flavorful! Most chips on the market are very thin with lots of salt and added colorings on them.<br /><br />Not Kettle! The tangy and sweet taste is remarkable and very, very delicious! I could eat a whole bag myself!!<br /><br />GET THEM!!! THEY ARE SOOOO GOOD!

review/summary: Ranch isn't only good with tortilla chips....
review/text: I have been a longtime fan of Kettle Potato Chips, since I was a small child. The terrific texture and "crunch" of their product never leaves me disappointed - what's more, the high quality ingredients that go into the top-of-the-line flavors they have are first rate. Zesty Ranch does not fail to disappoint me. The Ranch flavor has a terrific, zippy quality (like the flavor name would suggest). It livens up your taste buds, and I am pleased to say that it isn't too salty, nor too greasy. Each chip is packed to it peak with flavor, and it is far from skimped upon. You almost don't need any dip or sauce of any kind on this snack. It speaks for itself. Highly recommended. Makes me want to go crunch on some right now!

review/summary: Most of the Bags were open
review/text: I've eaten these Krinkle Cut Salt and Pepper Chips for years.  I was very excited to find them on Amazon.  I bought the 24 pack specifically so they would be fresh every time I opened them (opposed to buying an 8 or 12 oz larger bag).<br /><br />When I went to get a bag this evening, I noticed they were slightly open and the chips were stale.  I checked the rest of the bags in the box and most of them were open.  I think it may have to do with the oil on the chips.  They seeped into the seal and loosened the glue.<br /><br />I called into Amazon Customer Service and the CSR was pretty rude.  The first question she asked was why I didn't report this earlier.  Duh, maybe because I didn't notice the problem until now?  I've been very happy with Amazon's Customer Service in the past and have been buying 100s of dollars product during this Christmas season.  Hopefully this was just a cranky CSR and not indicative of Amazon's direction for customer service.

review/summary: Yummy chips!
review/text: My son and I agree. These are fine flavored potato chips! The Kettle brand has a lot of interesting variations on flavoring. This is one of those we like best from their stable of goodies.<br /><br />I went to graduate school in Buffalo, lived in Western New York for years, and frequented the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were invented. So I rather like the cheekiness of referring to Buffalo wings in this product!<br /><br />And these are tasty indeed. I would prefer a bit more of the bite/heat of a Buffalo chicken wing, but that is not a serious issue. I find it amazing that this product can even hint at the pleasures of Buffalo chicken wings!

We were in the middle of one bag when we pulled out chips that seemed wet.  Turns out it was just the oil on the chips.<br />They are mighty flavorful and crunchy, but, yes, they can be greasy. Definitely a guilty pleasure to be eaten in moderation!

review/text: I love these chips...for overall flavor, texture, freshness, and most of all CRUNCH...they can't be beat. My only criticism would be that they are a bit greasy, but they're potato chips...so what do you expect? Besides, they are not greasy to the point of being unpleasant...and their durability when facing even the most daunting dip...7 layer, chunky salsa, and even heavy cream cheese dips...is well worth the trade off.

review/text: I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good. The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ ! They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know. They are much more flavorful. Never had this flavor before. before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />These arrived in a case of individually wrapped chips. Each one was in great shape. No open or broken bags. No mess, no crumbs.<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Krinkle makes very thick chips, what's even better is that the krinkle cut chips feel even thicker because they are krinkled or have ridges in them.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing. I like the peppery flavor of these.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/text: These Kettle potato chips are great. I love the krinkle cut because it gives the chip great texture when eating it. Those thick ridges also allows more of the seasoning to stay on the chip. The pepper in this really stands out so if you're not a fan of fresh ground pepper flavor then don't buy this. These chips are rich, bold and delicious. The quality of the potatoes used are excellent. I can't wait to try the other flavors.
