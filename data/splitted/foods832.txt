review/summary: Blah- tastes weird
review/text: Depending on your taste, you might find the flavoring weird. I usually buy breakfast blends and add french vanilla creamer so I decided to try french vanilla coffee and then add half and half. Yuck! I'll stick with breakfast blends and regular cofee

review/summary: Good Product but OVERLY SALTY
review/text: I like this product but don't LOVE it...dips are notorious for being somewhat salty and that's why we like them, but this was outrageously salty. Even my husband, who never finds anything salty, complained. We ended up using twice the called-for amount of sour cream and it was just fine. So next time we make a batch of this dip, I'll just use half the amount of seasoning. In this way, I suppose, you get the item for half-price, since it lasts twice as long as it should per directions....but if you just mix per instructions and serve without tasting, your guests will complain!!!  Flavor is good, very peppery and "green" tasting, if that makes sense. Love this company and their products, just be warned, they can be strong.

review/summary: Premium Gum - Good For Your teeth
review/text: Classic bubble gum flavor with a subtle mix of mint. Just like other chewing gums, I have to open two every time. One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle. But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out. What more, it cleans your teeth. No calorie and no sugar.<br /><br />Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the maker of "Juicy Fruit". Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war.<br />It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health. It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States.

review/summary: I haven't had licorice in 20 years!
review/text: I recall fondly those days as 10 year old eating Twizzlers black licorice with my grandmother until they changed the recipe, removing molasses. It became too disgusting for words. It was the only time in my tween years that I wrote to a company to complain. Y&S Candies sent me back a letter saying that molasses had become too expensive and was no longer being used in the licorice, but they included coupons for spaghetti sauce as an appeasement. Inexplicable. In any case, my licorice consumption declined. A few years later, I developed a horrid gluten intolerance, and my licorice days were over for good.<br /><br />Or so I thought.<br /><br />After nearly 20 years without licorice (OK! I admit I would steal an occasional nibble...), I was shocked, SHOCKED to find Candy Tree Gluten-free licorice, and best of all, it's pretty darn tasty! I blame Candy Tree for restarting my sugar addiction, but I just can't stop eating it. I highly recommend this product. I like the licorice twists the best, but the ropes are good, too. Give it a shot!! And thank you, Candy Tree, for giving me something I truly missed.

review/summary: Very Tasty BUT NOT SUGAR FREE
review/text: I eat several varieties of the Think Thin bars, and they are a good, low carb snack.  This particular variety, while VERY tasty (not to mention a higher fiber count than the other varieties), is not sugar-free...it contains honey.  For anyone NOT doing a low carb diet, this may not be an issue; however, for low-carbers out there, you know that the carb count alone isn't enough.  You have to read the ingredients.  I was sooooo disappointed to see honey on the list.<br /><br />Oh, well...it was a nice, one-time indulgence.

review/text: Looking for a low sugar alternative in a bar, this is it!My husband was munching on Zone bars until I glanced at the sugar it contained! This bar was a great substitute without the high sugar (his trigycerides were much too high) and now it's part of his daily food choices. No complaints about taste, the crunch and chocolate are very satisfying. Buying on the monthly plan is also cost effective as they can be costly bought individully at the store. In all, a win win.

review/text: I usually buy a few of these for $1.70 each. They are perfect for people on-the-go. I am an active person, always on my feet at work. This box works out great because I don't run out after a few days and its works out to be more economical than paying per bar. They taste delicious and are low in sugar, high in protein. In between work and school, eating one of these with a bottle of water holds me over until I can get home for dinner, because who in NYC can afford to buy dinner every damn night? They arrived a day late, but it perfect condition, no melting and just a few were broken in half, but that even happens at the store. Great product and great price.

I would rather pay more but get a fresh product. Why doesn't Amazon do something about this? I am not the first person to have had this experience.

review/summary: Good crunch and not too sweet
review/text: I like these bars because you get the crunch and flavor of a nut bar without too much sugar. They are peanut-y, without the weird texture and gross sweetness of other peanut butter protein bars. In my mind these are positives.<br /><br />Be prepared that there is not likely to be a large amount of chocolate coating on any given bar. The first time I bought one, I was disappointed when I opened it and compared the appearance of the actual bar to the picture on the packaging. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste so I decided to buy more.<br /><br />They can sometimes leave an impression of being a bit dry or gritty, which I suppose is due to the soy crisps or tapioca starch, or maybe just how dry my own mouth happens to be that day. I simply make sure I have a glass of water available when I plan to eat one of these.

review/text: My favorite, all around snack bar. Total love that it's not overly sweet. I'll never get tired of these, they're great with a smoothie as a meal, and I eat them as a snack at least a few times a week. The best tasting bar I've had, and I've had quite a few.

review/summary: Little too sweet
review/text: I was looking for a nut bar made with 100% wohle nuts for a meal replacement.<br />Saw Think Thin here and tried it.<br />This bar tastes good. Whole nuts and soy crisps and everything.<br />But for a meal replacement, it's too sweet.<br />It says to be 70% less sugared than leading fruit and nut bars. I wonder which bar it's reffering to? It's still pretty sweet. I'd call it sweet snack than meal replacement.<br />When I have less than satisfying meal, I would eat it for desert. For me it's canndy bar replacement.<br />I feel guilty eating it instead of a meal.<br /><br />Everything is laced with so much sugar now days, when I eat something for health, I want no sugar or very little sugar in it.<br />This bar would taste even better if it were less sweet.

review/text: I read a review, commenting that the nuts were stale.  I thought it might have been an one-time deal.  The nuts in my bars are stale as well.  The expiration is Feb 2013.  Even though grocery cannot be returned on Amazon, customer service refunded me without asking for return.  (When I checked at the store, where the bars have been fresh, the expiration is April 2013.)

review/text: Two member of my family have celiac sprue and so we have been plunged into gluten free living over the past few years. Although these are not organic, my husband and daughter do like these to have a bit of variety in their lives. There are only so many Larabars one can eat in a lifetime. If you are looking for a good organic snack type product and have not yet discovered Orgain drinks, run there and order them immediately.<br /><br />I purchased several varieties of the Thinkthins when they were on promotion. Best price I have found.

review/summary: I Like These Bars But They Don't Like Me
review/text: I love the taste and texture of these bars; they're sweet, but not overly-sweet and have a satisfying, nutty crunch and just enough chocolate to make them interesting.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, I apparently have a severe negative reaction to the artificial sweetener, maltitol, used in the chocolate coating.  About an hour and a half after eating one, my abdomen puffs up like a balloon filled with air, resulting in a very sore, achy feeling tummy and (excuse me) painful gas that lasts about three hours.<br /><br />Many people have this reaction to maltitol; if you're one of them, you'll have to learn, as I painfully have, to avoid anything that contains this sweetener.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company can make some maltitol-free versions of these bars in the future.

I don't recommend refrigeration, as they are already chewy and don't need to be hard on top of that.  I recommend these bars for athletes, students, moms, and kids alike.  They taste great and are very satisfying.

review/summary: The best bar Think Thin makes
review/text: I have always longed for a real crunch in the Think Thin bars. Until this bar came along this sensation was lacking. This bar combines a darker chocolate with nuts in every bite. It's very tasty, and with the crunch, it satisfies one's chewing crave. I have bought this product by the bar in Trader Joe's but when I saw that Amazon sold it by the box, I jumped at the price point. I haven't had any of the shipping problems that other reviewers have mentioned. (Mine are shipped to Maryland.) I will definitely order these bars again. I use these bars are a meal replacement, especially at breakfast.

review/text: I've tried many low carb bars and these are very good.  Not too sweet but a perfect balance of sweet and crunchy.  They don't have that funny chemical taste that many bars have - probably because they are made with maltitol, which can cause gastric distress if you eat too much of it.<br /><br />One reviewer complained about the lack of nutrition information provided in the description, with which I agree.  However, I have that complaint with Amazon overall for the food items they sell, not just this particular item.  I look up nutrition information elsewhere before buying on Amazon, which shouldn't be necessary.

review/summary: For health purposes consider the alternatives
review/text: If you're looking to use cinnamon as a *health supplement* I hope this review will help. I've been on a fitness regimen for a couple years and became interested in cinnamon because of Tim Ferriss' book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X">The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman</a>.<br /><br />On pages 144-145 Tim recommends Saigon cinnamon, followed by Cassia *because* they contain the highest amount of "coumarin", a blood thinning drug that also affects blood sugar. This can be dangerous in high doses and Tim recommends taking no more than 1.5 teaspoons per day. Note that those types of cinnamon are regulated in Europe for the same reason.<br /><br />For three months I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SBI04A">Saigon Cinnamon 7oz.</a>. I purchased this at a "big box" store for about $6, however it is no longer available locally. The taste is quite intense and *super* "cinnamon-y". I used a teaspoon in my coffee every day. I feel that it had a positive effect on my metabolism, energy and ability to maintain my weight. When that began to run out I looked for a new source.<br /><br />I read more (including reviews on Amazon) and wanted to try the Ceylon cinnamon (also called "true cinnamon"), i.e. the product sold here. Ceynon cinnamon has a minute amount of coumarin and is seen as entirely safe.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GKV8DQ">Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder Spice Pack, (1 lb)</a> was the best buy in terms of price and customer satisfaction. It cost about twice as much as the Saigon cinnamon I've been using but it is organic and Fair Trade Certified. Delivery was super fast.<br /><br />The product is definitely more subtle than the Saigon variety in both smell and taste. I prefer the intensity of the Saigon variety, but that's a personal thing. This Ceylon variety has a bit of a "piney" scent and taste, especially in coffee. It's sweetening effect in coffee is far less noticeable than the Saigon variety.<br /><br />This Ceylon variety is ground *extremely* fine -- it's almost like talcum powder. Keep in mind that cinnamon is a wood-like substance and when you grind wood you get sawdust. In coffee this Ceylon variety is much less pleasant because it sinks to the bottom in greater quantities and it also feels scratchier on my throat. Compared to the Saigon I was using, there's about twice as much residue left when I'm done drinking. All this may just be due to the fineness of the grind.<br /><br />I will be switching back to the Saigon variety for medical, taste and texture reasons. But for the Ceylon variety this was the best product I found, it is certified organic and they deliver their product very fast.

review/text: I received the Real Cinnamon today!  It is really great.  It has a sweet aroma and a noticeably better and milder flavor than the cassia variety.  I ordered this variety for health reasons although I will use it in cooking as well. Cinnamon is known to have therapeutic properties and can act as an anti-inflammatory.  My acupuncturist has recommended that I take 1 tsp 2 x's a day with<br />honey (I'm taking it with agave nectar).  I have read that this variety of cinnamon (True  Cinnamon)<br />is much safer to take for these purposes and is a superior product from what is sold at the local super markets.<br />I am extremely pleased with the products quality.  Indus Organics delivered the cinnamon in a timely manner as well. I will most likely order this product from them again.

review/text: Since cassia can legally be called cinnamon it can be difficult to find real cinnamon.  That is why I appreciate this company's honesty.  The product is what it is supposed to be.  And the taste is excellent.

review/summary: Best Cinnamon!
review/text: This cinnamon is so much better than the kind I've always bought in the supermarket.  The taste is delicate, not too sweet, and the fine texture mixes well.  For those who supplement with cinnamon, this variety is better than the more common cassia variety, which has a blood thinning quality when taken in large doses.  The cost for this product is a great deal and the company shipped very quickly.  Will buy again.  5 stars!

review/summary: How To Enjoy Ceylon Cinnamon
review/text: If you are reading reviews on Ceylon Cinnamon, more than likely you are into healthy living. I agree with most of the reviews on this site concerning this product's pros and cons so there is no need to repeat anything.<br /><br />I enjoy this cinnamon by taking 2 slices of frozen quality bread from the freezer and spreading creamed honey (the hard, off-white kind) on the open-face bread because this way the frozen bread isn't smashed by the hard honey. Pop the bread into the microwave for 20 second, and then sprinkle a thick coat of cinnamon and spread with a knife. This way the cinnamon combines with the honey. Taken with a good cup of coffee, you'll find that all the flavors and aromas come together into a pleasing healthy snack.

review/summary: This is the only for me !!
review/text: 8 month ago I developed arthritis and started taking  Braggs A.C.V.Locally grown honey and at that time over the counter Cinn, then I started reading reviews on Cinn. and found out that it is toxic and Ceylon is the only REAL Cinn there is so I get on Amazon and this one had the most 5 stars reviews so I decided to order it. I have been taking it for the past 8 month very happy with the taste not as strong in scent or flavor as reg Cinn. but very close. So a few weeks ago I my cousin was talking about taking Cinn and I xplained the diffence so she asked me to order her some and they loved it too..thank you for offering this quality of Ceylon Cinn. we love it....

review/summary: Yeah!
review/text: This is the cinnamon I grew up with, the milder version in UK desserts & curries. Great in oatmeal - no heat, just taste.<br /><br />Mine arrived very quickly in a ziplock bag, in another bag, in a mailing envelope. It didn't look like a pound until I transferred it into jars; this will last quite a while.<br /><br />As others have said, cinnamon verum is hard to find in the USA. A health newsletter told me verum is the healthy one to take, and that it tastes different from cassia. Online research told me it was the milder cinnamon I wanted, but I couldn't find it in supermarkets or even the local Indian food stores. I found it here, read the reviews, and Indus sounded like the best choice. It was the first of several items I ordered to arrive (3 days), and I have no reason to try any other brand. This is the stuff I was looking for.

After doing some research she asked me to find Ceylon Cinnamon since she takes it daily, apparently other types of cinnamon are not that good for you.<br /><br />She uses this in her smoothies and found it to be stronger and more flavorful than what she was using before.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy it for her again but it would be helpful if the shipping fees were more manageable. I thought the cost of shipping was unreasonable. Unfortunately, I couldnt find it anywhere else.

review/text: I recently purchased the 1 lb. jar of Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder Spice.<br />Thanks once again, Amazon, for offering another great product choice!  The cinnamon most of us are used to is not necessarily the healthiest for us...too sweet.<br /><br />Though the "real" type of cinnamon is slightly less sweet tasting, it is much better for blood-sugar issues etc.  Although it can be used exactly the same way as the sweet type, I am very satisfied with my purchase.  Also my blood-sugar control<br />and cravings have greatly improved with the addition of the Ceylon Cinnamon added to my diet.  Try it and see for yourself!

review/summary: Excellent taste from a cinnamon know-nothing
review/text: This review will sound like a broken record after you read the other reviewers, but my experience is just like one or two others here. I've been buying organic Saigon, as many have, ever since the DAY that The 4-Hour Body was released. But I always worried that he said cinnamon was toxic in doses above 1.5 teaspoons daily. Although he does state it's the Coumarin and other components, I never knew until I read a review for this Indus that Ceylon HAS NO COUMARIN and doesn't have the toxic effect. THAT IS A HUGE BENEFIT because I no longer have to worry, "Have I had to much already today?" Plus, our bodies don't need yet one more potential toxin even if "low levels" means it's "not toxic."<br /><br />My use of this Indus now, which I've used for a week or so only, is excellent. Yea, I wish it wouldn't drop to the bottom of every glass so quickly but I suppose that's what spoons are for: to keep it stirred up. And the taste - yes, I also preferred Saigon when I first tasted this Indus but the Indus QUICKLY grew on me and I think it tastes sweeter than Saigon and I like it better now. I don't notice the "piney" hint that at least one other reviewer notices. I have began to use less Stevia (half a packet instead of a whole one) when I use my Indus and find my tea and coffee to be just as sweet as before. I WILL be buying this Indux regularly now.

review/summary: Subtle and spicy ground Ceylon Cinnamon
review/text: I ordered the Indus Organic ground Ceylon Cinnamon because a knowledgeable friend informed me that the Cinnamon we Americans use is actually not true cinnamon, but Cassia, a cousin of Cinnamon that has VERY different chemical properties.  When I found out that the blood-thinning potential of Cassia is over one thousand times as potent as true Ceylon Cinnamon, I was determined to sample the Ceylon Cinnamon and see how I liked it.  I have always found Cassia very bitter and overbearing, so I was hopin Ceylon Cinnamon would be a milder version of Cassia taste-wise.  I must say I was surprised by the taste...it does have a hint of what my palette is used to in the "cinnamon" arena, but there is also a scent of bay laurel or something else rather herbal about it.  It is not unpleasant, but it doesn't taste like Cassia!  I am enjoying it on its own merits.  I like to sprinkle a good amount in an empty mug and add hot water and a little milk for a lovely nigthttime beverage!

So far taste and smell is good but for the food value, I just have to wait to see the result. They say it's good for the brain and that I can use. Also it's supposed to be good for Diabetes. I don't have Diabetes but I hope it will help so I don't get it.<br />My complaint though is not the product but the fact that I was charged for the shipping when it was very clearly stated that it qualifies for free shipping. Indus said they paid for the shipping and why is it that Amazon still charged me for the shipping of more than $6.00. Amazon needs to send me a refund. Thank you.

review/text: I was looking for some Ceylon cinnnamon as I use an awful lot of it (supposedly helps with blood sugar and, anyway, I love it). I recently read that most of the cinnamon in grocery stores is cassia which does have some blood thinning properties. This shouldn't be a problem for usual users, but I didn't want to risk it. The product was promptly delivered and well-packaged. The flavor is different, a bit more mellow, but still good cinnamon. I may end up using a bit more in cooking, but as I add it fresh a lot, it'll be just great.

review/summary: GREAT - and the only REAL & non-toxic Cinnamon
review/text: If you're consuming more cinnamon to lower your blood sugar that's great, but what you probably don't realize is that most store bough cinnamon is Cassia - a lower quality, lower price cinnamon look-alike and LIVER TOXIN if taken in a quantity about 3/4ths of a teaspoon daily.  That's not a lot people, especially if you pour it into fruit shakes like I do.<br /><br />That's why I am so GRATEFUL that I learned that CEYLON IS THE REAL CINNAMON and it's it's non-toxic.<br /><br />It tastes great too - like you'd expect a SPICE to taste like.<br /><br />I'm so glad there's an organic variety available at Amazon. Even the organic brands sold at WholeFoods are the Cassia knock-off, and not real CEYLON CINNAMON.<br /><br />This brand is awesome!<br /><br />Please spread the above information to anyone you know that is taking Cassia cinnamon, since they could be putting their health at great risk.

If you've never tried Ceylon cinnamon before, you should because its milder flavor blends beautifully with other ingredients without overpowering the taste of your recipes.<br /><br />Indus Organics makes Ceylon cinnamon more affordable for the average consumer. In case you didn't know, two kinds of cinnamon are sold in the U.S. There's cassia cinnamon (which is a very strong flavor and much less expensive) and then there's Ceylon cinnamon (which has a milder, sweeter flavor, but usually costs considerably more).<br /><br />I've ordered twice now from Indus Organics through Amazon and each time, my order has arrived quickly and in good shape. The 1 pound pack that I ordered the second time was a great price and enough to last for many, many months. I want to thank Indus Organic and Amazon for making true cinnamon more affordable and easily obtainable.

review/summary: Coumarin in Cinnamon can cause liver damage
review/text: I started using Ceylon Cinnamon (purchased from Indus Organic) as a treatment for diabetes. I did a little bit of study on the orgainic compounds in Cinnamon. I chose Ceylon Cinnamon because it has little to no Coumarin. The compound Coumarin (up to 5%) is found in the Cassia kind of cinnamon. The cassia cinnamon, widely available in grocery stores, is mostly imported from China and Vietnam. The Ceylon Cinnamon does not contain Coumarin, which is known to cause liver damage. [...]<br /><br />The beneficial compound in Cinnamon is proanthocyanidin. This is the compound that is beneficial in reducing blood sugars in diabetics. I have not been long enough on the cinnamon treatment to abandon as yet my insulin and pills I take. I would be happy to write another review when I come off of Insulin and other pills.

review/summary: Better than i imagined....
review/text: I ordered this for the health benefits and safety of Ceylon cinnamon in comparison with the cassia variety, specifically in that the Ceylon reportedly has a much smaller amount of coumarin (which in large doses can have negative affects for people, such as my father, on blood-thinners like Warfarin/Coumadin).  However i didn't really expect much difference in terms of taste or smell, in fact i was anticipating being underwhelmed in that regard, thinking it would be somewhat bland, but right away was pleasantly surprised by the fragrance and later by the taste as i sampled a bit on a bite of banana.<br /><br />So, in short was pleased with the product itself along with the fast shipping and the packaging. The powder came in a large ziplock bag nestled inside a large mailing envelope which in turn rested inside an even larger mailing envelope. A sample of organic black seed was also included.

review/summary: This is a useless, tasteless powder!!
review/text: I am extremely disappointed.  NO TASTE WHATSOEVER!  This seems to be a useless, tasteless powder!!  The only effect I noticed was a slight unpleasant burning in my mouth and throat.  Not only does this lack of any flavor make it useless, but I paid $29 for it, and I fear I cannot return it or get my money back.  Even one star is too many, and I was so eagerly awaiting delivery. I realize it is hard to imagine or believe, but there is absolutely NO FLAVOR to this powder!!!  I could tolerate a weak taste, and figure that was the nature of Ceylon true cinnamon, but to use something with NO taste at all seems absurd.  I can only think it must be a really bad batch, since with the exception of three other reviewers, most other reviewers were satisfied.  I have not been using any of the Cassia Cinnamon for several years, so I don't think I could possibly be comparing it to that stronger flavor. I decided to start using Ceylon cinnamon now for its health benefits.<br />I am now happy to say that to my immense relief, I just now<br />learned that AMAZON IS GIVING ME A REFUND!  I must say Amazon is absolutely WONDERFUL!<br />I cannot praise them enough!  What superb customer service!!  Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: Cinnamon without the bite
review/text: My husband uses it on his breakfast cereal to control blood sugar. We are not sure if this kind does that ( the write ups are unclear), but I have read that regular cinnamon can irritate the liver, so we switched. The taste is milder than the traditional, but retains the 'nice' bit of the cinnamon without the heat part.

review/summary: Healthy, Tasty cinnamon
review/text: I read that Ceylon Cinnamon is very good for keeping your blood sugar in check, but only Ceylon cinnamon, which is different from average cinnamon you get in the grocery store, so I tried it. Don't really know if it works, since I do not test my blood sugar, but the cinnamon is very good on oatmeal and toast. Delivery has always been timely and efficient.

review/summary: I really like it
review/text: After long research and many other brand and I found this one is the winner.  The price is right and flavor is really nice.  I use it regular for my health because I read it somewhere that this will help for urinary infection (somehow I got it often), so far I found it works for me. I will purchase again.

review/summary: Ceylon Cinnamon
review/text: Ceylon Cinnamon from Indus Organic is the real thing !<br />It is the true cinnamon that is healthy  for you as it lacks Cassia . Cassia which has a stonger flavor is not good to ingest regularly or in larger quantities.<br /><br />Ceylon Cinnnamon from Indus Organics has a lovely true cinnamon flavor in addition to its health benefits of lowering blood sugar. This true cinamon is hard to find here in the U.S.  and I searched quite awhile until I found Indus Organic.<br /><br />Its a quality product and I highly recommend it . I put a tablespoon in my whey protein drink every day ! Delicious !

review/summary: This is the real thing
review/text: To my surprise it turned out to be very difficult to find (true) cinnamon in the United States as even upmarket grocery stores rarely make the distinction between cassia and cinnamon, and most of what's labeled and sold as "cinnamon" in this country is actually cassia.  In plain English cassia is a cheaper, lesser alternative.  True cinnamon has a less harsh, less intense but noticeably more aromatic taste.  It's also supposedly better for your health which I cannot vouch for, but it certainly tastes better in my opinion.<br /><br />The product arrived very quickly, nicely packaged and seems to be of very good quality.

review/summary: Love this
review/text: We like this Ceylon Cinnamon better than the cinnamon found in grocery stores. It's lighter in color and milder in flavor. It's great on oatmeal or in anything that calls for cinnamon, and some things that don't. We'll purchase this again and again.
