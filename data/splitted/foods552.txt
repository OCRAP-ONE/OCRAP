review/summary: Delicious and Not Overly Sweet
review/text: Lipton's To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix in Blackberry Pomegranate is a delicious addition to a bottle of water.  Initially in cold water, the mixture clumps up if not shaken well, but it eventually disolves completely.  The flavors complement each other well, the sweetness of blackberry tempered by the tartness of pomegranate.  Lipton's product is much more flavorful than some of the Crystal Light varieties I have tried.  I would definitely buy this product and try some of the other flavors.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I was worried that the sugar and carb content in these drink packets might be high because of the honey used to sweeten them. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. There is 2gm sugar, 10 calories and 2gm of carbs per packet (it is listed as 1/2 packet per serving, but that is unrealistic). One packet makes about 16oz prepared. Each box comes with 10 packets. The packets are made with real tea leaves and each packet (2 servings) contains 120mg tea flavonoids.<br /><br />My first impression of this drink mix was something along the lines of "ohh my..." followed by a second quick drink. This stuff is WAY better than I thought it would be. I think I would actually prefer the taste of the Lipton Tea & Honey Blackberry Pomegranate to fresh brewed Blackberry pomegranate tea with honey. It is incredible! The honey sweetens it perfectly without giving it that over-sweet, bitter taste. The tea itself tastes more like a black tea than a green tea (which is a good thing in my book because black tea tastes better, but green tea seems to have more health benefits). It has a perfect harmonious balance between the blackberry, pomegranate and honey. They seem to compliment each other very well.<br /><br />This was my first time trying any of the Lipton Tea&Honey packets and I am tempted to run out (in pajamas and all) and snatch the rest of them off of the grocery shelf because I have a new favorite. Thanks Vine for bringing these into my life. I definitely recommend you try this....NOW.<br /><br />Note: all tastes buds are different and mine do tend to prefer super sweet drinks, so these may be too sweet for you if you like light sweetening. However, you can always add more water to your cup! I think you should try them and decide for yourself

review/summary: fruit juice taste, diet friendly, healthy on-the-go drink
review/text: I must watch my calories, sodium, sugar, and fat due to health issues. Thus tea is a preferred drink over sodas. I want to live, and live a good lifestyle. This product helps. Expecting good taste since it is produced by Lipton, a favorite of mine and my wife's, this was hardly a gamble in trying. The flavor was excellent, strong, fruity, and actually better than expected. I've tried lots of flavored teas and usually have gone back to regular plain old Lipton.<br /><br />Fat & Sodium are 0. Sugar only 1g per 8 oz. and calories only 5. 10mg caffeine if that's an issue for you, not for me. After realizing the drink was a bit sweeter, like southern sweetened tea, and I'm used to less sweet, I tried mixing the drink with an equal amount of club soda. WOW. Even better. Now the Lipton Blackberry Pomegranate flavor was still there, less sweet, the drink had the fizz of soda, calories cut to 2 ï¿½, and sugar only 1/2g. The drink came out as clear as sun tea.<br /><br />Kids will love this sweetness. Kids need drinks with low calorie count. That's becoming major for child health.<br /><br />Convenience is a plus, an easily opened individual tube of powder, travel friendly, a freshly mixed drink at work, or make it one bottle at a time at home. No more having several types of bagged tea on the shelf to mix one with another, and then a remaining half-pitcher of tea going funky in the refrigerator. This has a shelf life of well over a year. It is tons better than instant teas I've tried, easier storage than bottled brew, and has the refreshing taste that the world has come to expect from Lipton. My sample convinced me to begin converting from the mess of tea bags.<br /><br />Dare I mention this can be carried in a shirt pocket or purse to a restaurant and instead of ordering those overpriced drinks, ask for the free iced water, then pour in your Lipton, stir, and "Bob's your Uncle".

review/summary: So refreshing!
review/text: Love the flavor of mango pineapple with a hint of green tea! Super refreshing to drink on a nice hot or warm day and I especially enjoyed it after a walk around the park. Quenched my thirst and didn't leave any disgusting after taste in my mouth that some other mix ins can leave. Super easy to mix into my drink: I just opened the packet, poured it into my cup, added cold water, and stirred. I had to stir for awhile to break everything up all the way otherwise I can see myself drinking little undissolved particles.<br /><br />What was so interesting about the flavor for me was how refreshing it was to drink and so flavorful. Right away you can taste the mango and pineapple, which are a perfect combination together, but there is also a hint of green tea behind those flavors. Thrown throughout the whole blend is a slight taste of honey that just compliments everything together. If your a fan of these flavors and are looking for a really refreshing drink, I have to say give Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea & Honey, Mango Pineapple a try for I am sure you will find it just as delightful and refreshing as I did.<br /><br />Please note that this is 5 calories per a serving, but keep in mind that 1 packet contains 2 servings so in fact it is 10 calories per a serving that I have been using. But I have also been using it in a really tall glass that holds more then 8oz of water (More like 13ishoz) hence both servings work just perfect for my taste level. Enjoy!

review/summary: MangoLicious
review/text: I think this product is absolutely great. I just gulped down 16 ounces of water flavored with one of these Lipton Tea&Honey packets and I really loved it!<br /><br />But, then again, mango is one of my favorite flavors. Pineapple is in there, too, but I think the mango stands out. Either way, it tastes delicious.<br /><br />You just empty one of the long, narrow packets into 16.9-ounces of water -- either a bottle (and shake well) or a glass (and stir well). I used a glass of water, but will try it in a bottle of water on my next long, hot walk.<br /><br />Packets are scored, so they're easy to open -- a real plus -- and easy to pour into either a bottle or a glass.<br /><br />Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors. Ingredients: honey granules (sugar, honey), citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, maltodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, beta carotene (for color). (NO aspartame.)<br /><br />Calories 5. Zero Fat. Zero Sodium. Sugars 1g. Vitamin A 10%. 10mg caffeine per 8 fl oz serving (2 servings/packet).<br /><br />Lipton, you've got a winner here! Great product!<br /><br />UPDATE: The day after writing this review, I filled up a 33.8 ounce bottle with water, poured in ONE packet of "To Go Stix" and took it on a 6-hour road trip. Flavor and sweetness held up well in twice the amount of recommended liquid and the drive didn't seem nearly as long as usual.

review/text: This new honey pineapple mango is awful.  The worst tasting powdered tea mix I have ever had.  I guess I will have to go back to plain iced tea because I threw this stuff out.  I loved the Green Tea TO GO mandarin and mango but it has been discontinued by Lipton and replaced with this terrible tasting stuff.  I won't even waste my money trying the other new flavors.

The package says that half a packet is for 16 ounces of water and has two servings per packet.<br /><br />I used them in 32oz of water the first time however, it was sweet enough that I cut back to a little more than half a packet for 32oz and it still had a nice sweetness.<br /><br />It's a great product and I would purchase it without any reservation.

review/text: This is my second go-round with one of these and won't be my last.  Blackberry/Pomegranate is a fantastic combo and using Sucralose instead of Aspartame (which metabolizes into formaldehyde) makes it that much better! Some might find it a little too sweet, but I liked it fine.  And being a Type II Diabetic I'm very happy to have something that I can enjoy pretty much whenever I want and won't throw my diet out of whack.  Nice job, Lipton.

review/text: There is very little tea taste, you can taste a fruity flavor and a little honey BUT it does contain sucralose which is NOT natural. I would think this is false advertising if you claim a product is all natural and has ingredients that are not natural??? It is overly sweet and really doesn't taste natural to me.<br />so this is a Warning that this product contains sucralose (splenda)<br />I had thought it would only be sweetened with honey because that is the only sweetener mentioned in the description.

review/summary: They lose a star for having so many types of sweeteners...
review/text: We tried this recently. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />First off, I am allergic to aspartame, so most of the great flavors of drink mixes out there are<br />already off my radar.  After living in a place with nasty ol' well water for a few years, I developed<br />a soda habit that I am trying to break. I've tried plain tea, don't care much for it, so looked for<br />a decent flavored tea that I didn't have to boil water for (partially disabled, and no stove, etc<br />where I am most of the time).<br /><br />Last time at the store, I saw these. The package is a little deceptive, so be aware!<br />That "five calories" is not even for one whole bottle of water - it is for HALF of a bottle of water<br />with ONE packet mixed in! I guess they didn't want to post double-digits of a whopping ten calories,<br />but that's what it is for one packet.<br /><br />The sweeteners are THREE KINDS - Honey, Sugar AND Sucralose. Why they needed three, I do not know.<br />It actually ends up being a little too sweet. I make it, them dilute it with more water than<br />it technically needs.<br /><br />Not sure why Lipton can't just make something ALL natural, or use stevia, which has no effect on<br />blood glucose. They seem to be hesitant to use it for some reason, but I don't know why. They have no<br />problems loading up the other drinks with chemical sweeteners, but avoid stevia!  Weird...<br /><br />I have had a lot of problems with my throat swelling up this week, but I have been sick. I am not sure<br />if it is related to the illness, or because I've been drinking this tea almost exclusively for the last<br />few days. Aspartame makes my mouth, tongue and throat swell up, which is why I read every label now.<br />Not sure if the sucralose is doing anything or not - I would tend to think not, because my lips are not<br />numb nor is my tongue swollen. Still, I'd avoid the sucralose if I could.<br /><br />The flavor is really sweet, but I like it. It is refreshing and tasty. Again, a little too sweet for my<br />personal tastes, so I "water" it down with lots of ice, and it makes it very good!<br />It's worth trying. This is the only flavor we've tried so far, but will definitely give the others a shot<br />as well. If it helps me give up soda, then that's even better! : )<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 9, 2012:<br /><br />Well, it has been incredibly hot here in the midwest, with a heat wave that broke all kinds of records.<br />Of course, I was drinking a lot of tea. These packets are 10 calories each (that "5 calories" on the box refers to HALF<br />of one packet!), and I had either one or two packets each day for the last month, perhaps.<br />We also tried the peach flavor now, and I don't care for it, but my husband and son like it better than this one.<br /><br />I had to come back and add to the review because of something kind of odd. Now, I am hypoglycemic, so maybe that is part of it,<br />but I have to mention it in case others have this problem. I got this tea originally to help me get away from my Pepsi habit.<br />The 24-oz bottles of Pepsi that I buy have 300 calories in the bottle. I make the tea kind of weak, so one packet actually makes closer to 32 ounces of liquid for me - I like the flavor better that way (just personal preference), so by comparison, I am getting just 10 calories for 32 oz, vs the 300 in the 24-oz Pepsi. Savings of about 97% of the calories, which should be a good thing!<br /><br />Here's the kicker - I have been GAINING WEIGHT since I changed over to the tea! Nothing else has changed. I didn't suddenly<br />take up eating endlessly, etc, and in fact, have eaten a little less during this heat wave. I put on almost five pounds in the last few weeks of changing over to this tea. Now, from a caloric standpoint, it doesn't seem possible. However, I am one of those people who does much better on high-protein, low-carb. If you have a similar type of metabolism/body, then be aware of these little packets!  I think it might be the honey in them creating a non-stop (because I sip tea all day long to keep cool) assault on my blood sugars. I've noticed that I feel hungry more often as well too. I normally don't get all that hungry - just have a few hungry days once in a while. With this tea, it almost gives you the munchies. I haven't indulged, so it isn't from extra food. It has to be the tea.<br /><br />Again, I have to say that I don't think that everyone will experience this effect, but wanted to bring it up.<br />I think the combo of the THREE sugars Lipton has chosen to use for reasons unknown are having a negative effect for me personally.<br />I still like the tea, but have now been cutting it down even more, to see if I can lessen the effects of the sweeteners.<br />I find it odd to think that I could cut out 590 calories a day (I usually drank two of those 24-oz pepsis! Yes, I was bad...) and GAIN weight. It has to be the way all those sugars are interacting with my system.<br /><br />So, if you are one of those folks who do really well on a low-carb diet, be aware that this tea could cause you to lose progress, or even cause you to gain weight. I have also warned my husband, who tends towards higher blood glucose, to only drink it with meals, never alone like I do.  Just an important heads-up on what could have been the best thing to happen to tea in a long, long time.<br /><br />Lipton - please try making something with stevia, which has no impact on blood glucose levels and has no calories. Why put sucralose into your items, when stevia is so much better?  I don't get it - it can't be that much cheaper to use! And I'd pay more for an item that used stevia... what a shame!

review/summary: Pleasant Taste, Only 10 Calories
review/text: I am mostly a water drinker, but occasionally I like to have a little flavor for my drink. The instant Lipton Tea mix provides that for just ten calories (five cal/8 oz.). It does have Sucralose in it, but it is pretty far down on the list of ingredients. I'm glad it has a little sugar, which leaves a much better after-taste than some other instant teas.<br /><br />This one (they have some other flavors) is Decaf Green Tea with Strawberry and Acai. You can put it in a bottled water, or at home I use one packet and fill-up a large glass. It comes with 10 packets, which works for me for a couple of weeks.<br /><br />The box boasts that it is sweetened with some honey and made from real tea leaves.<br /><br />For me, what made it a winner was that it didn't have a nasty after taste.

review/summary: Nice taste, easy to mix
review/text: Update:after a week or so of drinking this, I decided to stop because I was having some odd health problems (upset stomach, etc) and a lot more sinus/allergy problems than normal.  I decided that it might be the Acai berries, that were causing the problem.  I looked on the internet and the berries are associated with some stomach problems.  I really did like it, especially diluted somewhat, but it's not worth the aggravation.  If you don't think allergies will be a problem, here's what I thought of the product:<br /><br />I decided to try this flavor additive for bottles of water because it is decaf and also, unlike most of those flavor-adds, it does not use Equal or some other sweetener.  I can't drink much caffeine at one time (more than a couple of sips can really mess me up) and I also can't use Equal or several other of the sweeteners.  This tea uses honey and the natural sweetness of the strawberries and the Acai berries to sweeten the green tea that is the basis of the beverage and it doesn't contain caffeine.  It mixed very easily with the water and had a nice taste.  I don't like my bottled water to have very much flavor, so I tried changing the ratio (it was one packet to each 16.9 bottle) to see how using half strength would work and I liked that even better.  I ended up just putting the bottle of water with the flavor in it inside my fridge door and I just get a glass of water from a plain bottle and then add however much of the flavor that I want.  My boss liked the flavor, too, when I gave him a glass full.  I wasn't sure how to tell the Acai berries from the green tea, but I could definitely taste the strawberry, so if you don't like strawberries, you probably need to skip this product.  But if you love them, maybe you've found this year's summer drink.

review/text: Be careful when opening the little packets because the powder is quite strong smelling.  I guess that comes with the powerful flavor this packs.  Also, as the granules take a while to dissolve I would suggest putting it in a container with a lid on it so you can vigorously shake the contents before pouring into an ice-filled glass (crushed ice is my favorite).  Then, you can enjoy this robust blend of strawberry, honey, and acai berries.  Lipton gets five stars from me.

review/text: I previously got the blackberry and pomegranate flavor off of a Vine newsletter.  I really enjoyed it so I decided to give this flavor a try as well.<br /><br />It's about the same.  Really if you're not a tea drinker this tastes a lot more like Kool-Aid or Crystal Light than tea. The sweetness from the honey and fruit disguises most of the tea flavor from it.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked it, though probably not enough to buy it instead of my regular tea mix, which I'm sure is much cheaper.<br /><br />That is all.

review/text: I'm really liking these new Lipton packets. I've also tries their pineapple mango and its just as great. What I like about them is that they are great for traveling. When I go away, I usually buy a case of spring water and add one of these packets to the water. I'm not a big fan of just plain water especially on the beach so having this flavor makes the water delicious. They are very convenient to put in your pocket too. I always have one handy when going out to eat because I don't drink soda so i'll ask for a tall glass of ice water and add a pack of the Lipton to it. You get 10 packets in a box which is nice too. And lastly its decaf Green Tea with Honey so you get some antioxidants. I've tried many other brands and so many seem to have an after taste that tastes like chemicals. I'm happy to find that these didn't have that. They also have a peach flavor and a blueberry, haven't seen them in the stores yet but i'm sure by the summer they will hit the shelves.<br /><br />Its a great sugar free flavoring and enjoy them better than many others.

review/text: These one serving packets are becoming increasingly popular for people on the go and for those of us who like to take something other than water when heading to the gym, but dislike the chemical taste of many drink supplements. This product really fits the bill for something that's tasty ( without any wierd aftertaste) and somewhat healthy. Also for those who have wanted the benefits of green tea without the slight tartness of the tea itself, the strawberry acai taste is just exotic enough to make you forget you're drinking green tea.

review/text: These tea mixes are fantastic for work since they dissolve quickly and require no stirring IF you add them to your glass first.  Stirring or shaking is definitely ideal, but the beverage works without them.  Not too sweet and no bitterness that green tea mixes can sometimes have.  I didn't find that there was a pronounced tea flavor here, but enjoyed the light sweetness this mix added to a glass of cold water.  Oh, and I'd highly recommend adding ice AFTER mixing since ice seems to keep the powder from dissolving.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice and relatively low-calorie way to dress up water without a lot of artificial sweeteners.

review/summary: Excellent for a powdered drink
review/text: I've drunk my share of powdered drinks, including stuff from Propel, Lipton, Crystal Light, even the Walmart brands, as well as the liquid concentrates, like the Mio.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this packet is that it's a bit bigger than the normal Lipton Iced Teas.  Well, it definitely made a difference in flavor.  Put this into a 20 ounce glass (it's designed for 16.9 ounce), and it was still full flavor.  Strangely enough, it's supposed to be Mango Pineapple, but the flavor seems more like Peach to me.<br /><br />Still, the flavor was very nice, again, slightly stronger flavor than the Lipton To Go packets I usually use (my favorite is the Lipton Iced Green Tea, Mandarin and Mango flavor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HQAYLA">Lipton Tea to Go Iced Green Tea Mix Packs, Mandarin & Mango, 10 ct</a>).<br /><br />Overall, very nice for me.

review/summary: Tasty Good
review/text: This is not the first time I've used  Lipton Green tea to-go products, but Blackberry Pomegranate Green tea is a new flavor.  For the most part ,most of these are virtually the same, but I have to say that I have always a high taste for anything blackberry. I don't taste the pomegranate as much as I do the blackberry and that's a plus for me, but for those die hard POM drinkers it might not be so likable.<br />Would buy this product again? Absolutely. Especially since I SHOULD drink more water but won't unless its flavored. This give my water the boost I like and it only has five calories per serving.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: Delicious and refreshing with a fresh mango taste. I can't taste the pineapple at all which is too bad because I got this specifically for that. I'm not a big mango fan but this taste great. The green tea is just right. I plan on buying this on a regular basis.

review/summary: Crystal Lite SUCKS
review/text: I'm picky about iced tea and haven't been a huge fan of Lipton in the past, nor am I very fond of powered drink mixes. I thought I'd give these a try since I'm on the go lately and don't have time to make proper iced tea. They are EXCELLENT. Just sweet enough, but very fruity, almost like the tea with flavored syrup you get in restaurants. I'm addicted to these now and can't go back to the hum-drum Crystal Lite flavors. The other flavors are great too - my favorite being Blackberry Pomegranate. I'm so sick of the same ol' same ol' Lemonade, Raspberry Lemonade, Orangade, Strawberry Kiwi, etc. These flavors sound a bit odd at first, but the taste is crazy good.<br /><br />I should mention that the crystals are a little harder to break up in cold water than most single drink mixes. However, it clearly states this on the box and the extra effort is absolutely worth it.

review/text: and I want to congratulate the graphic artist for putting the entire product name on such a small box.  The ad men must have really thought long and hard.<br /><br />But seriously, I love the product. The taste was refreshing and I thought that the taste was pleasing with no aftertaste.  Not too sweet and Goldilocks would have stopped right there if there was a choice of 3.  Easy to use as you just pour the contents into a 16 oz bottle of water and shake.  Mixed well, no granulation, you really couldn't ask for anything more and Lipton like a good drug dealer knows what they are doing, give me a taste for free and have me for life.  5 stars.

review/summary: Make Your Water Delicious with Lipton To Go
review/text: The first thing I check with any flavored drink is the nutrition facts (I want to eat my carbs and calories, not drink them!) There are 2gm sugar, 10 calories and 2gm of carbs per packet (it is listed as 1/2 packet per serving, but that is unrealistic). One packet makes about 16oz prepared. Each box comes with 10 packets. The packets are made with real tea leaves and sweetened with honey. This mix does not contain Aspartame, it is sweetened with honey and Sucralose (equivalent of Splenda). The Strawberry Acai flavor is decaffeinated.<br /><br />Full Ingredient List: Honey Granules (Sugar, Honey), Malic Acid (Provides Tartness), Decaffeinated Green Tea Powder, Hibiscus Extract, Maltodextrin (Corn), Sucralose (Sweetener), Natural Flavor, Strawberry Juice Solids, Acai Juice Solids<br /><br />As far as taste goes, it has a really nice and sweet Strawberry flavor with a hint of honey. I personally can't taste the Acai. I also verily taste the tea. It is more of a strawberry drink with a slight tea and honey flavor. It is really good. However, if you are expecting lightly flavored tea, this one is not for you. It is also on the sweet side. I personally prefer sweet drinks and it is perfect for me. If you prefer your drinks not as sweet, plan on adding more water.<br /><br />I definitely like this flavor and will buy more. I do wish it had caffeine, but I can stick to this in the evening hours. It makes a nice alternative to water. While I would recommend this, I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007I7Z0T4">Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate, 10-Count (Pack of 12)</a> flavor better (it is caffeinated). These would also be great with vodka or rum.

review/summary: Delicious, Refreshing, and Light-Tasting
review/text: Lipton's new packets of Iced Green Tea with Honey and Blackberry Pomegranate are delicious, refreshing, and light-tasting.  Plus, they're only 5 calories per packet.  Obviously, they're very similar to (and probably a direct competition for) Crystal Light's to-go packets.  Naturally, Lipton offers tea flavors.<br /><br />The instructions say to add one full packet to 16 oz. of water, but I used twice the water it recommended for one packet, and it's still very flavorable and super-sweet.  If you're going to use a glass of water or small bottle of water, I'd recommend trying only half a packet (or less) to start.  There are honey granules (sugar and honey) that dissolve and sweeten the water.  The packaging touts that there's no aspartame (Equal) in these like Crystal Light, but there is sucralose listed as an ingredient, which is another artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Most importantly, though, is that these new Lipton packets, like Crystal Light packets, give your water a little boost of flavor and, in the case of green tea, flavonoids.  If you're trying to eliminate sodas from your diet and are tired of drinking "just" water, try these little packets.  You'll still be drinking the water, but you'll have a flavor boost that won't make you feel like you're drinking "just" water.

review/text: I normally drink decaf beverages so I jumped at the chance to review this.  It's hard to find a powder that tastes good AND is decaf.<br /><br />I find these types of products very artifical tasting and I really don't enjoy them.  They actually make me more thirsy.  This one is very nice.  There is a very strong taste of honey, which I love.  The strawberry and acai taste is mild and not overwhelming.  If you like the taste of honey, you will like this.  If you don't like honey, then this product probably is not for you.<br /><br />I will buy these again.  I  didn't feel thirsty after drinking it and it didn't have a horrible aftertaste, as some of these products do.<br /><br />Great product.

review/summary: A Tasty Drink While on the Go
review/text: "To Go" products have been one of my favorite items since I began using bottled water. On a break at work, while biking or hiking, or on a trip - slipping some To Go dust into my bottled water always provided a tasty break. To Go drinks also provide a nice flavor break when travelling aboard in countries where the water is not safe and all you want to drink is bottled water.<br /><br />And I do enjoy Lipton's To Go Stix Iced Green Team Mix, Team and Mango Pineapple product. The mango and pineapple tastes dominated enough that I really could not taste the green tea but that didn't matter that much. I enjoyed the health benefits of green tea without the taste.<br /><br />The product has 5 calories per 8 ounce serving as it relies on honey for sweetening and real fruit flavors. And  do appreciate that the product does not have aspartame, the artificial sweetening chemical once sold under the brand name NutraSweet that may or may not be harmful, depending upon whom you listen to. But why take chances?<br /><br />I enjoy most of Lipton's To Go drinks but especially liked the mango, pineapple taste.

review/summary: Might yet turn me into a tea drinker
review/text: All my life I've confounded my British mother by my intense dislike of tea.  It's something she can't understand and certainly hasn't accepted even after all these years.  Since I've been hearing and reading about the benefits of tea, especially green tea, I decided to give this product a try in the hopes that it would help me overcome my antipathy.<br /><br />My plan seems to be working.  Lipton has mixed its green tea with honey, mango and pineapple, a mixture which is more than just palatable but actually delicious.  It has no hint of the "medicine" taste which I've always associated with tea and serving it iced on a warm day is so refreshing.  The stix are convenient either for home use or for traveling so it can be enjoyed wherever you go.  I definitely intend to include this tea in my summer beverage consumption.

review/text: This has a nice pleasant taste.  The artificial sweetness doesn't seem artificial to me, and it's not overpowering.  The strawberry flavor stands out for me (and to be honest, I really don't know what Acai really tastes like, so maybe it's there and I just don't notice it).<br /><br />But as much as I like it, I am unlikely to buy it again in its current packaging.  I guess I'm just not a fan of making a bottle at a time.  If this came in a form where I could make a pitcher at a time, it would likely replace the gallon container of Crystal Light that is always on hand in my refrigerator.

review/text: When I drink this delicious green tea flavored with mango and pineapple I like to imagine I'm at a beach. In fact if I was going on vacation I'd take these packets of iced tea mix with me. One packet works well in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water but it tastes even better stirred into a glass of water with ice. The message you get when you read the front of the box is that this is going to be all natural with just honey sweetening your tea. That is not exactly true. This contains honey granules (made from honey and sugar), sucralose and maltodextrin. This also contains green tea powder, hibiscus extract and natural flavor (mango and pineapple). If you made this tea with only 8 ounces of water as it suggests then this tea would be very sweet. It needs about double that amount of water to taste normal. So really if you add this to a normal bottle of water it will still be only five calories per drink. I also like that this does not have aspartame in it. The flavor is great and if you don't mind a little sugar this might be a satisfying drink for the summer.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

The convenience of either adding it to a glass of cold water or to a bottle of water for on-the-go is nice. I prefer decaf teas during the day so this is perfect. With only 5 calories and 1 gram of sugar, it's a much better option than sodas or high calorie fruit juices. I will definitely get this again.

review/text: I drink mostly water every day, so was looking for something to change it up that had some flavor but that was also decaf.  These little tubes of Lipton to-go stix decaf iced green tea mix are convenient, and tasty.  The taste is a little to sweet for me so I use a half a tube per bottle of water or add ice cubes to help dilute it in a glass.  This is very tasty, not grainy at all as long as you shake or stir it well.  It is a great way to stay hydrated and mix up the taste of bland water when you are sick of it.  I would recommend these for any busy person, to throw in your bag for a flavorful drink anytime and anywhere. I will buy these again and am looking forward to trying their other flavors.

review/summary: Fruity, citrusy and just the right amount of sweetness
review/text: I really liked the flavor of this, the tartness, as well as the sweetness. It is not too sweet but has just the right balance.  The instructions call for 16.9 ounces of water, but I put it in about 22 ounces (which is what I usually do with powdered mixes that call for less water). This has a little honey, sugar, as well as sucralose (splenda)in it. That's why it's only 5 calories per packet. I would definitely buy this in the future.

review/text: Enjoy Lipton Tea? If so you have to try this new flavor. Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate has to be one of the best flavors that I've tasted. It disolves nicely and is the perfect blend. Those hot days are coming soon. Instead of drinking pop that makes you more thirsty, take a Lipton to go packet that will quench thisrt, and leave you fully satisfied.

Pour the powder in water (the instructions say 16oz but I feel that with 24oz it's a little less tart), shake it and there you have it, instant iced tea. Very good stuff and I look forward to trying the other flavors as well.

It is convenient because you can carry the little packets with you and mix into an 8 oz. bottle of water and have an instant drink.

review/summary: Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate
review/text: yummy, this tastes really good, not too sweet and plenty of fruity flavor. It reminds me a lot of the taste you get from Crystal Lights brand Raspberry Ice flavor. I made it with hot water from my tea pot, then after it got room temperature I put it in the fridge. I have to say it tasted good hot too. If you add 2 quarts of water to your pitcher and then add 4 of these little packets you'll have 2 quarts ready to drink instead of using just one little packet with 16 ounces of water. You'd need ice to add too that way to make it cold enough so I'll just make it my way, 2 quarts at a time... You can always fill your empty water bottle with it before you go where ever your going and you can save the big bucks and use your home drinking water instead of paying to buy water in a bottle.

review/summary: really good, convenient, no aspartame!
review/text: These are pretty cool!  You can pour them into a water bottle and mix or just a large glass (add the ice later or it's hard to blend).  The thing that surprises me is that they are 5 calories...which is really good.  Because unlike some low-calorie drinks, this has NO aspartame.  So no icky aftertaste and no scary chemical either.  Just a good mildly-sweet tea blend (not over the top cloyingly sweet).  I was surprised because I usually hate flavored teas, and just opt for unsweetened black or green tea.<br />This is refreshing and light, and I like that's it green tea because green tea is supposed to be healthy for you...I just better not drink this with an order of fries, LOL.<br />I'm putting a few of these in my purse for when cold water doesn't do the trick.  Will definitely purchase, but wish they came in a larger box...

review/text: I'm a big fan of the Lipton To Go products, I drink a lot of their White Tea W/ Raspberry because it's wonderful but Caffeine limits my drinking to the mornings and early afternoons, Then I found out about the Tea & Honey Strawberry Acai and I had to try it!<br /><br />It's a true taste treat and the sugars are very low (1g per serving) So I don't have to worry because of my dietary limitations of sugar.<br /><br />I have a iSi soda siphon, that I've been using for years and after putting a  packet of this Iced Tea mix in the bottom of my glass, I spray some of my carbonated seltzer water into the glass making the most delicious Green Tea soda I have ever tasted, I LOVE IT!<br /><br />This mix is truly delicious and it's decaf, I will be enjoying this as I watch my evening TV without losing sleep.

review/text: All you need is a regular bottle of spring water or whatever you want to use, in goes the powder and voila, instant iced tea drink (well, instant in that you have to shake it first). The flavor (mango pineapple in this case) is very tasty and refreshing. Powdered drink mixes in this form aren't exactly a new found invention but if it tastes as good as this does, I have no problems recommending it to anyone. It's perfect for storing in your desk at work, taking it on the go or in just about any manner you can think of.

review/summary: Great Tasting Ice Tea
review/text: I was not expecting much with all the instant flavored drink mixes out there. There are ten packets in each box. I added one too 20oz bottle of cold water. It dissolved quite well with some vigorous shaking. When I took my first sip I was shocked. This tasted very good and as advertised. The water had become a refreshing and tasty Blackberry & Pomegranate Green Iced Tea sweeten with honey.<br /><br />I wanted this for flavor and did not care about calories but for those who do one warning. The box list that these are 5 calories per serving, which is eight ounces. But each packet is designed too be used with 16 ounces so is 10 calories. So for two servings (which is what I drink) you are consuming a drink with 20 mg of caffeine, 2g Fat, 0g Sodium, 0g Protein, and 2g each of Sugar and Carbohydrates.<br /><br />As another reviewer mention the packets are very convenient too carry with you and too use anywhere you can get a glass or bottle of water. I enjoyed the taste so much I have ordered two more flavors.

I could definitly taste and smell the fake sugar that is in it (Sucralose) so I was a little confused when it said that it was sweetend with honey. I would not buy this product again.

review/text: My husband and children, for some reason or other, HATE the taste of regular water so I'm always looking for a way to make the water taste different. We were excited to try this as they all love ice tea, but surprisingly it was not the biggest hit in my house. My husband, who loves honey and has been on a honey kick lately, said that it "tastes like Kool-Aid". He did drink it but said that he wouldn't be likely to purchase it. My children liked it a bit better than my husband did but they prefer products more like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4FUHG">MIO Strawberry Watermelon, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. The bottom line? We likely won't be purchasing this again.

review/summary: More like Kool-Aid than Tea
review/text: 10 individual pouches come in this box, which is handy for sticking it in your purse or in your lunchbox. It is easy to mix up with a glass of water, and does not take long to dissolve.<br /><br />Why only 3 stars? Well, first because it really does not taste like tea, more like berry kool-aid. The second reason is that though the words "tea & honey" are splashed all over the product box and the packet, you'd expect that 1) it tastes a little like tea, 2) you could taste the honey, 3) honey is the only sweetener.  I've already talked about it failing point 1. You can faintly taste the honey - it's not overpowering, and was a nice taste. Point 2 in its favor. Now onto point 3; the ingredients are as follows: honey granules (sugar, honey), citric acid (provides tartness), green tea powder, hibiscus extract, sucralose (sweetener), maltodextrin (corn), natural flavor, blackberry juice solids, isomalt, soy lecithin, pomegranate juice solids. I see 3 sweeteners other than the honey granules: sucralose, maltodextrin, and isomalt. Point 3 against this product. Serving size is also misleading - you'd think one packet is one serving. Wrong, one packet is 2 servings. Not really a big deal, but it might be for some.<br /><br />I'll enjoy the drink, but not sure that I would be eager to go out and purchase it right away.

review/summary: Totally UNnatural!
review/text: I can't write a review of this product because I cannot use it.<br /><br />I got it thinking it was a natural alternative to the mixes with aspartame or high fructose corn syrup...but no. This product (as a couple other reviewers have stated) has sucralose in it. If I drink or eat products with sucralose in them, I get migraines. So I can't even taste it to tell you how it tastes.<br /><br />When a product description says "naturally sweetened with honey" And the second ingredient IS honey, WHY why why why throw in an artificial sweetner? That's like adding peach flavour to a slice of peach. Why make something that IS healthy, unhealthy and more expensive to produce by adding unnecessary ingredients?<br /><br />Depending on how you feel about Stevia, try the True Orange/True Lemon products...or enjoy your plain water :-) That's the way I'm going to go.

review/summary: It's not as natural as Lipton advertises
review/text: I think that this Liptons To Go Green Tea Mix tastes OK, but I prefer real tea. My wife likes this Lipton's Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix. She likes the mild strawberry flavor.<br /><br />But it is not as natural as Lipton advertises. Lipton's product info states, "Lipton Tea & Honey ... is a low calorie iced tea mix you can feel good about simply because it's made with real ingredients ... blended with honey and strawberry and acai flavors ... Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors ... flavor with other natural flavor ... and no aspartame."<br /><br />So what's there to not like about that? Well it's not all real ingredients and sweetened with just honey. The fine print discloses that it includes Sucralose (sweetener). Shane Ellison calls himself "The People's Chemist" and is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402225059">Over the Counter Natural Cures: Take Charge of Your Health in 30 Days with 10 Lifesaving Supplements for under $10</a>. Shane was a big pharma chemist who quit when he discovered that the drugs that he was creating for the big pharma companies were nothing more than toxins and the real cures were natural and didn't require a prescription. Shane says that artificial sweeteners like Sucralose (Splenda) have serious problems. Studies show that they lead to weight gain and even pre-diabetes. Artificial sweeteners "disrupt the body's natural calorie counter" and "put the users at much higher risk for being obese and insulin resistant." Shane says that Sucralose, 1,6-Dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-'-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-'-D-galactopyranoside, contains a historically deadly, nasty form of chlorine (RNFOC), which yields poisons such as insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides. "An RNFOC can invade every nook and cranny of the body ... and may result in weakened immune function, irregular heartbeat, agitation, shortness of breath, skin rashes, headaches, liver and kidney damage, birth defects, and cancer. Hiding its origin, sucralose pushers assert that it is 'made from sugar'. Sucralose is as close to sugar as glass cleaner is to purified water. France recently banned such false advertising statements. The deceit has been ignored within the United States."<br /><br />Why does the FDA allow this? Shane says science was sold out for profit. "Just like chemists manipulate the properties of matter, Big Pharma manipulates studies using 'checkbook science.' This allows them to pay for the design and interpretation of clinical trials. Checkbook science isn't illegal by FDA standards. It's been going on for over 20 years. Known as the Bayh-Dole Act, US law was amended in 1980 to permit flagrant conflicts of interest, ones that allow the industry to design drug trials and hire experts to conjure up favorable results at will."<br /><br />So if you want something natural, look for Shane Ellison's book and skip this Lipton's tea mix.

review/summary: MISLEADING- contains artificial sweeteners
review/text: I bought this product because I dislike the taste of artificial sweeteners, so I thought this would taste better than other low-calorie powdered drink mixes such as Crystal Light.  However, as soon as I tasted it I knew there was "fake sugar" in it- I could taste the artificial sweetener but could not taste the honey at all.  I turned the package over and sure enough, one of the listed ingredients was sucralose, which is found in Splenda.  I think the label is a bit misleading because it gives the impression that only honey is used to sweeten the product which is not the case.  The box says it does not contain aspartame, which is true, but sucralose is not much better for you and still has an artificial taste.  I didn't like this so I wouldn't buy it again, and truthfully, I would rather buy this product if it was sweetened with ONLY honey or real sugar, even if that meant it had more calories.  A spoonful of sugar only has about 20 calories- if they put one spoonful per pack and each pack makes two glasses of beverage, it would still be a low-calorie drink, it would taste better and would be more natural.

review/summary: Thumbs Down on Taste; Thumbs Up For Convenience
review/text: This pertains ONLY to the Lipton To Go Stix (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007P5NVBI">Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple, 10-Count (Pack of 4)</a>) product with the honey, mango and pineapple flavor. I had thought this would be a product I'd enjoy as mango and pineapple are two of my favorites when it comse to fresh fruit or smoothies; I've also been a Lipton tea customer for years, and have never been disappointed in their products. I even enjoy honey on occasion as a more natural sweetener, and was curious to see how these flavors would combine.<br /><br />This one was such a disappointment that I gave away what was left in my sampler box (my friends and family didn't care for it either). Now I liked the convenience of the stix, and have appreciated what companies have done in order to give you a somewhat cheaper form of "flavored water" so I thought Lipton might have had something.<br /><br />The honey was so prominent and overly sweet that it pretty much wrecked the remaining flavors; it also had a slight chemical tinge which left me with a horrible after-taste in the end. What there was of the mango and pineapple was not the fresh taste I had hoped for, but something with a disgusting artificiality that did not play up a combination which does work very well under most circumstances (such as when I've made up my own mixture); again there was way more artificial sweetness (and this is coming from a Southern girl who loves sweet iced tea on occasion). Even the fragrance was sickening and overpowering. The color in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water was a straw-yellow -- not quite golden, not quite regular yellow, but I figured that meant it would be strong enough to give me the full flavor I desired without being too weak. As I mentioned, I could only take several sips; I think I drank 1/3 of a bottle in the end...and then I called it quits. I even refrigerated it for a bit, as if hoping everything needed time to "merge"; after a few hours I tried again -- lost cause and down the drain it went.<br /><br />I don't know if the other flavors are an improvement, but I will never waste money to find out. Had the box I received NOT have been a sampler courtesy of Lipton, I would have demanded a refund. Back to the drawing board Lipton!

review/summary: my teens loved it; I thought it a bit weird
review/text: My teenagers love green tea and anything with a funky flavor, so I got them the mango pineapple flavor of this Lipton To Go green tea mix. It's a great way to flavor plain water, which one of my boys hates to drink.<br /><br />They both liked it quite a bit and said it tastes just like the pre-made Lipton green tea bottles you buy in the store. I mixed up half a packet in an 8-ounce glass of water for myself, and it took some time for it to fully dissolve. The color is a bit weird...a yellowy orange. I could taste the mango and the pineapple, but with the honey, it had a bit too much going on for me, flavor-wise. Didn't seem that balanced. I wouldn't make it again for myself, but I'd buy it again for my boys. Flavor is such a personal thing, though, and there are SO many reviews on here with different opinions, so if you're an adventurous sort, try it for yourself. It didn't have a chemical taste to me, just a lot of flavors going on.<br /><br />In reading the other reviews, I don't understand why some people are FREAKING out about there being Splenda in it. So?? Many low-calorie drinks are sweetened with Splenda (sucralose) or Nutrasweet (aspartame), and Splenda is a much better alternative than Nutrasweet. If you don't like artificial sweeteners, then don't get this product! And read the label first...yes, it says there's no aspartame, which may lead people to believe there are NO artificial sweeteners, but a quick glance at the nutrition panel tells you it has sucralose. Those of us who are hypoglycemic appreciate having products with lower sugar available to us, because we have to give up most sweets. If you prefer things with Stevia, then buy unsweetened tea mixes and flavor them yourselves. Toss in a little pineapple juice and honey and knock yourself out. But just because this tea has Splenda doesn't make it a product worthy of scorn. To each his own!

review/summary: Strong flavor!!!
review/text: First of let me say that I love a good Iced green tea. This one is super rich. I diluted per instructions and still needed to add more water to get the right flavor.<br />Needless to say you can really taste the acai and strawberry with the honey sweetness...the tea part...not so much...therefore the 3 stars. If you are looking for an intense flavored drink mix. This one packs a punch and you definitely get your money's worth.<br />If you are looking for a Tea...this might not be up your alley.<br />Definitely the Kool-Aid on the go for adults!!!

review/text: When I first tasted Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, I had to go back and check the calorie count; it tastes like honey and fruit, rich and real. The tea and pineapple take a back seat here, but if mango and honey are in the front seat, I have no problem with that. Mango is one of my favorite flavors, and this mix really tastes like mangoes.

review/summary: It's just Okay...
review/text: I'm sure everyone is familiar with powdered water flavoring packets.  You just add them to a nice bottle of water, and you're set!  It's convenient and easy!  Well, that's what we have here - yet another contender in the powdered drink mix market.  In terms of being a powdered drink mix, it's okay. The packets open easily enough.  The only think I've noticed is that it takes longer to dissolve than some other ones I've tried in the past, but not excessively so.  It's also fairly low calorie, which is nice.  I'm sure you're all wondering, though, "is it any good?"<br /><br />Well, at the end of the day, it all comes down to taste.  This is where it goes wrong.  It's got a slightly unpleasant undertone of bitterness and sourness to it that I didn't like.  I mean, it's not the most foul thing I've ever drank, but it's not the best either.  It sort of tastes like fake strawberries and fake honey, which is strange because it claims to be made with "real ingredients".  Oh, and even though it's supposedly sweetened with honey, it has added sucralose to it.  Go figure.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm starting to wonder if tea is something that was just meant to be brewed like normal instead of condensed down into a dissolvable powder.  In fact, the best "to go" packet drinks I've had were blatantly fake, but at least they tasted good.  So, do I recommend this drink powder?  Well, if you want a convenient drink powder, then I'd try some other brand.  Although you might like the taste better than I did, so I guess you'll just have to try it yourself!  If you just want tea, then you might be better off just making a big batch of tea and pouring it into some bottles.

I'm not sure if it is the honey or the strawberry but it has a funny aftertaste in my mouth. It definitely is a required taste that would take time to get used to, after one has acquired this case it might be very tasty, however I'm not much for a sweet tea. I have drank raspberry iced teas and have liked them but they to are an acquired taste. If you like flavored iced tea this is the tea for you!<br /><br />Try this iced tea at your own risk.

review/text: This is the second green tea drink stick blend I have tried from Lipton, the first being the "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QH41OG">Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai, 10-Count (1 Box)</a>".  Mango Pineapple Green Tea is the flavor mixture in question.  I must say that the taste is really good and all the key ingredients shine through.  In other words, I can taste green tea, mango, pineapple and even a touch of honey, yet none of the flavors are too over bearing.<br /><br />These drink sticks (10 in a box) are 5 calories a serving and taste like they are much higher in calories. It took me a little extra effort to mix the powder into the water, but nevertheless the powder dissolved.  I must say there is a slight, slight aftertaste.  It isn't bad per se but it is worth noting.  I didn't find it to be a big deal or would prevent me from purchasing in the future, yet it should be noted.<br /><br />I believe that Lipton has stepped their game up with these drink mixes and I love the idea that green tea is being utilized.  Green tea is underrated so it is nice that it is being promoted more.

review/text: The flavor was okay though for my taste it was a bit too sweet, much more so than with similar products from Crystal Light and Propel.  And the other brands have less of an aftertaste.  But the primary reason for the average rating is that this powder doesn't dissolve easily in water.  I had to stir quite a bit yet sometimes there were still small clumps of powder floating in the drink. I've never had that problem with competitive products and for that reason alone I'm unlikely to buy this product in the future.

review/summary: Tastes like a melted popsicle :)
review/text: There seem to be several new products on the market lately that are designed to enhance the flavor of water. Personally, I think water tastes just fine the way it is, but since I'm also a tea drinker (in mass quantity) I thought I'd try this. It's OK, it's fine, I have no complaints about the taste, though it's a bit on the too sweet side. The taste is kind of familiar and I'm not really sure what it reminds me of, but it tastes a bit like a melted popsicle or like Jello. In fact, it tastes a lot like licking jello powder off of your fingers, come to think of it--which is to say that it's not a bad taste by any means, and kids will probably like it. Also, if like me you drink too much sugar, you might want to give this a try mixed with club soda or seltzer--I imagine it would be good that way. One packet only has five calories. Would I go out of my way to buy it? Probably not, but you never know :) I'm going to try making ice cubes from it next :)

review/summary: Nice flavor, but doesn't really taste like tea
review/text: The Lipton To Go Stix Strawberry Acai drink has a very pleasant flavor.  Unlike some flavor additives for water (cough...Mio...cough), these are not overly sweet.  The flavor is very well-balanced and refreshing.  Unfortunately, the flavor doesn't really taste like tea at all.  For some people, this might be desirable, but I would imagine that most people buying this product would be expecting the green tea flavor to come through more strongly.  In addition, the mix is slow to dissolve.  It didn't seem that any amount of stirring/shaking would completely eliminate the powder.  Over time, the powder dissolves more on its own, but this is definitely not ideal for an instant drink mix.  Overall, I'd say this is worth a try, but not quite living up to the quality I'd hoped for.

review/summary: Do not use as directed. This product needs diluted.
review/text: First I want to say that one packet is way too much for 8oz of water. I used 2 packets with 2-quarts of water and this brings a nice, light flavor that does not taste artificial. Using one packet in a bottle of water would make me choke.<br /><br />Second, don't put these packets into your purse or bag.  The starter cut that allows for easy opening of the package is too deep.  I had taken the box to work with me.  When I realized I needed to mix the powder in greater quantity, I put three packets into my work bag.  Between leaving the office and arriving home (with the majority of the trip the bag sat on the passenger seat of my car), all three were open and I had powder everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, the powder does not completely dissolve, even mixing with more water.  It could be that vigorous shaking of the product in a water bottle would help dissolve better than a spoon in a glass pitcher, but I would expect it to eventually dissolve either way, and this is not the case.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is good but only if you dilute it tremendously.  I was reading another review regarding the sweeteners and there are some excellent points to contemplate in that review.  I'm not even going to discuss what is on the label.  I'm just basing my opinion off my direct experience.<br /><br />My rating is a 3-star.  Had I used as directed, it would probably be a 1-star.

review/text: Each packet of this Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple is actually good for two servings, according to the printed instructions on the packet.  This was just fine with me since I don't like my drink to be too sweet.  So I tend to just pour a half-packet's worth of contents into a glass filled with very cold water each time I want to use this product, then give the mix a good stir.<br /><br />The drink tastes sweet.  I can discern the tea but not the mango or pineapple.  There is a hint of honey, but the drink's sweetness is probably due to the sucralose, which is listed as the fourth ingredient.  I didn't discern an aftertaste.  Overall, I think it's a fine drink.  Nothing really special to get excited about.

review/summary: Mango & pineapple are nice, but delicioso on ice
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 4:38 Mins<br /><br /></span>The secret to raising Lipton's Mango Pineapple from a 3-star, ho-hum iced tea mix to a delicioso alternative to plain water is serve this Iced Green Tea over finely crushed ice or increase the amount of water used in preparation from 16.9 fl oz to 20 fl oz. The dilution eliminates the cloying sweetness of honey granules and sucralose, allowing the green tea powder and citric acid to bring the right amount of tartness to the mix.<br /><br />Lipton's new drink tastes better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4CCSQ">MIO Liquid Peach Tea</a> and should please Crystal Light fans. Personally, I don't enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9SS">Crystal Light Green Tea Peach Mango Drink Mix</a> unless I find it as a fountain drink (again, the addition of crushed ice helps a bunch). Peach flavored instant tea is more common to find but I like Lipton's decision to pair mango and pineapple.<br /><br />Patience is important because the honey granules take additional time to break down into the water. Adding crushed ice helps blend the powder mix faster than with water alone.<br /><br />Lipton's box states that the drink is five calories per 8 oz serving with 60 mg tea flavonoids.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.<br /><br />BTW: Please be gentle with the video review. It was a family production. My 9-year old son, Kai, handled the filming and my 7-year son, Kou, was a taste tester.

review/text: I found this difficult to mix. The tea granules didn't dissolve easily at all and I had to "mash" them against the side of the cup several times to get them to mix. However, this was expected. The instructions on the box says to put the powder into a 16 oz. bottle and shake. We don't use plastic bottles so that wasn't an option. The mix did completely dissolve, eventually.<br /><br />I found the flavor way too sweet for my taste. That's pretty impressive since it's supposed to be only 5 calories, makes me wonder about the amount of artificial sweeteners. The blackberry was all I tasted. I kinda missed the pomegranate and tea flavors though. I detected no honey flavor.<br /><br />I'll drink it again, but I'll dilute it more.

review/text: Overall not a bad product, just wasn't what I expected when I read the box before trying.  I assumed I would be getting a "Tea and Honey" drink with a slight flavor of Strawberry.  Instead, I feel as though I received a strawberry flavored water drink less any sort of tea and honey flavor.  For those of you who might have tried other products similar to this (Crystal Light) it is very close to the same in my opinion.  Now, if you hate plain water this might be perfect for you!  Just don't expect a dramatic taste difference because the words "Tea & Honey" are printed on the box.<br /><br />The product does not always "completely" dissolve unless you keep stirring or really shake your water bottle but I didn't notice those particles mattered while drinking it.  You could just see small pieces that didn't completely dissolve at the bottom of your cup/bottle of water.<br /><br />The small packets are easy to use, just tear the corner and add to water.  No problems with ease of use!

The positive is this Lipton Green Tea in Honey, Mango Pineapple flavor is true to taste, offering a real sweet combination of the three flavors.  The negative is that I just couldn't get past the disinct aftertaste from the sucralose additive.  I've tried other lo cal drink mixes, and all basically offer the same flavors with artificial sweeteners to save on the calories.  So unless you enjoy that metallic after-flavor with your drink, pass these up and go with plain and refreshing water or sparkling seltzer.

review/summary: Misleading and far too sweet
review/text: I love tea.  Iced tea, hot tea, green tea, black tea, all kinds.  I was excited to try this product because I am always short on time and thought a powdered, just add water mix would be great.  One major problem, this "tea" has zero tea flavor.  It also claims to be "sweetened with honey" but it is actually sweetened with sucralose in addition to "honey granules".  Because of this, it has a very strong "diet" aftertaste, something I am not fond of at all.  Overall the drink was far too sweet for my liking even though I made it with 20oz of water instead of the 16 recommended.  I was really disappointed by this product.  I also feel the packaging is hugely misleading.  It says, and I quote; "Sweetened with honey" with no mention of the sucralose.  It does mention "no aspartame" but fails to mention it's other source of sweetness.  The ingredients are as follows: Honey granules (sugar, honey), Citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, malodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, and Beta carotene for color.  As far as powdered diet drinks go, this one would be low on my list.  Even drinks like Crystal light do not have this strong of a diet aftertaste.

review/text: These Lipton To Go Stix are small packets of powder which you mix with water to make a green tea beverage.  I tested the Blackberry Pomegranate.<br /><br />Summary:  If you like your iced tea to be very sweet, and you want a diet version, you will probably like this.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Low calorie: only 5 calories.<br />- Taste: Hint of honey up front and a mild green tea flavor coupled with fruit.<br />- Portable:  One small packet makes 16oz<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Very sweet.  This is personal preference.  If you like your iced tea very sweet, you'll probably like this.  I personally like about half the sweetener.  I'm not sure why diet drink makers feel the need to make their artificially-sweetened drinks so sweet.  The main flavor I taste here is the splenda sweetener.<br />- Dissolves slow.  After 60 seconds of stirring there were still a couple of clumps.

review/text: I love the idea of drink sticks, just pour it in a glass and/or water bottle and shake.  A quick and easy way to give water a kick.  I have used plenty of drink sticks and discovered some are better than others.  This blend is by Lipton and the flavor is a decaf green tea with honey and strawberry acai.  The name of this flavor seems like a pretty robust title to live up to.<br /><br />I must say that the flavor is really good, not too sweet but sweet enough.  None of the flavors are overpowering yet all of them are present.  The beverage is only 5 calories a serving and has no caffeine, which is alright in my book.  My only complaint is that it took me quite a while to mix this powder into the water.  I am not sure why that was the case, but in the large scheme of things this is a minor issue.  For someone who is looking for a good way to spice up their water without too many calories, this drink by Lipton might be a good solution.

review/summary: Not bad, has a bit of a weird aftertaste, though
review/text: There's only one thing keeping me from giving this a solid 4 star rating: the aftertaste, which I'll get more into later.<br /><br />First, the good. Other than the aftertaste, this tastes pretty good. I can pick out the different flavors of pomegranate, blackberry, honey, and tea, and they don't clash with each other. They're well blended together for the most part and this is pretty awesome with a lot of ice.<br /><br />It's just that the aftertaste ruins it. There's this slight chemical taste to the product that really interferes with the other flavors, making it so I am unable to forget that this is a powdered mix. It isn't something that would keep me from drinking the tea, but with how well everything else works together it's pretty noticeable. Again, this isn't something that I'd say would keep me from going out and purchasing it on my own, just something I hope that Lipton works on in the future.<br /><br />Aside from this, I only had one gripe that did not detract from the product itself and I didn't change the ratings for this at all. I'm just really irritated at the packaging saying that this is a 5 calorie beverage. It is, but only if you plan on using half of the packet. This is something that is standard for most companies and it's really irritating since the majority of consumers will use the entire packet and many will count the entire beverage as 5 calories when it's really 10. It's not as big of a deal here as it is with some of the more sugared products with higher calorie and carb counts, but this is sort of misleading unless you're someone who scours the nutritional and serving information on everything you buy.<br /><br />Overall though, this is something I'd probably go out and buy with my own money.<br /><br />3.4/5

Lipton at least didn't load this one up with aspartame, which is a shocker,<br />but they did use plenty of other sweeteners, then added SUCRALOSE too. Too much. Way too much.<br /><br />The honey adds a really pleasant smooth taste to the tea. Most of us at our house like pomegranate and<br />love blackberries, so thought how bad could it really be?  Answer - BAD.<br /><br />This tea is more like kool-aid than flavored tea.<br />The color is a medium pinkish red, not anything like tea and more like kool-aid.<br />The taste is overly fruity, with hardly any tea taste at all. We tried adding some<br />other instant plain tea to it, and it helped somewhat so the box was not a total loss.<br /><br />Would we buy it again?  Nope, not this one.<br />What could have been a healthy, refreshing tea drink ended up being more of a glass of kool-aid<br />instead. We'll pass.

review/summary: Blah taste
review/text: So i tried this one day and was naseuous after drinking one serving mixed with water.<br /><br />Maybe it was funky artificial mango pineapple taste? Or the artificial sweeteners in it? Either way it was pretty nasty.. I wouldnt drink this again nor offer to anyone.

review/summary: Good taste but fatally flawed
review/text: These Lipton iced-tea packets are a great concept. Essentially, you can take these little packets anywhere, pour it into a (standard 16.9 fl. oz.) bottle of water, and enjoy some tea. It's quick and easy, but unfortunately these Tea & Honey packets don't seem to actually work very well.<br /><br />The box warns, "Tea takes longer to dissolve so SHAKE WELL." This, however, is a pretty big understatement in my experience. After pouring the powder in, I shook the bottle a couple times and found that the powder clumped together immediately. I shook and shook and shook, but to no avail. Certainly, it flavored the water, but there were also big sugar-particles floating around my bottle. I tried it once more but to the same result.<br /><br />It's really a shame because the taste is quite good, much like a pomegranate flavored-water. But along with this good taste, your mouth is filled with an unpleasant amount of sugar clumps. Of course, it would be possible to filter these out with a strainer of some kind, although that would totally defeat the convenience aspect of the product. It's unfortunate.

review/text: As someone who is trying to lower their caffeine intake, I looked forward to recieving this. I enjoy green tea and thought the taste would be refreshing for the summer. Too bad then that it tastes like mango flavored medicine. I took one sip and gave the rest to a relative.

review/summary: Kool-Aid for adults!
review/text: Blackberry Pomegranate has never let me down before when it comes to flavored drinks.  When I saw this offering and it claimed to be natural I became very interested.  From a packaging stand point, I love the way these little packets can be thrown in a glove compartment, purse, diaper bag or book bag.  They travel well and open easily.<br /><br />Upon opening the packet I would pour the powder into a standard water bottle (16.9 fl oz.) and shake very very vigorously.  I found that if the water was not ice cold and I did not continue to shake vigorously for a minute then there would be flavor crystal sediment on the bottom.  If the water was ice cold, the powder would incorporate well.  The color does stain, so that may be a concern for some.  Now for the flavor aspect...  Personally this Iced Green Tea mix is just too sweet and artificial flavored.  From the first sip I was assaulted by a cloyingly sweet and rather sickening flavor.  I resorted to sort of holding my breath and guzzling down.  When it came to the last quarter of the bottle I would always dump it; just too sweet.  For me, it tasted very much like what I remember red Kool-Aid tasting like when I was young.  I personally don't allow my children to drink red Kool-Aid.  They loved this stuff!  A bit too enthusiastically for my liking.  They would fight over the bottle, which was just plain odd.  Two days passed and when I returned to the cabinet I had discovered that the kids has been sneaking the packets and polished off the whole box.  My husband on the other hand, hated it and he loves sweet drinks.  He didn't like the sweet 'fake' aftertaste (his words).<br /><br />If you like very very sweet tasting drinks and prefer when drinks have that fake 'aspartame' taste then this should be a winner for you.  Our kids aged 9, 8 and 5.5 loved it.  They found it easy enough to mix on their own apparently.  I just wish that the product was a bit more natural and less 'diet'.<br /><br />Recommend only if you fit the the profile of a customer that would enjoy it.  If you love Kool-Aid mixed with way too many portions then you might just enjoy this.  Kudos on the packaging, which is very much like Crystal Light... thumbs down on a very kiddie oriented flavor profile.  Blackberry pomegranate sounds very adult... Kool-Aid not so much.

review/summary: Simultaneously bland and artificial tasting
review/text: I find that these travel-sized "flavor enhancers" are a mixed bag. Some, such as "Mio" Sweet Tea and "Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch" are pretty good for what they are. However, most are just either bland or too artificial-tasting for my palate. Unfortunately, "Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate", falls into the latter category, somehow managing to taste bland and artificial-tasting, all in one felled swoop.<br /><br />In all, there are far better drink alternatives out there. Avoid.

review/summary: Artificial tasting and yet another sweetener in it
review/text: This product is sometimes advertised as having no aspertame in it, which is true. But it still has an artificial sweetener in it - sucralose. So instead of Satan, you are getting the Devil here ... and they also let this product sail under a false flag, by putting "Tea&Honey" in BIG letters up front. So naturally, you might think that this is an actual healthy product, organic even. Just read the ingredients list and you will quickly recognize what it really is: sugared water with some flavors in it.<br /><br />A brave self-test revealed a strong artificial taste, root-canal-pain inducing sweetness, immediate scratching and itching in the back of my throat, chemical aftertaste - just totally and utterly horrible.<br />A burst of flavor, as the advertising claims? Rubbish.<br /><br />And something else happened to me, which was already described by other reviewers - as soon as I opened the package, a very fine dust emitted which immediately made me cough and gasp for air. I just hope, this stuff is just bad tasting and not toxic on top of it ...<br />Very rarely, I bemoan the  fact that Amazon makes you give at least one star at the review. For this product, I would like to have the opportunity to give no star at all ...

review/summary: fake sugar, fake flavors
review/text: Do you like the taste of artificial sweetener and generic fruitiness?<br /><br />If yes, try this product.<br /><br />If no, stay well away.<br /><br />Despite the claims of tea, honey, strawberry, and acai on the front of the box, it's the ingredients list that gives away the true flavors. Malic acid, maltodextrin, and sucralose are pretty much the only things my tongue registered. I think you'd have to be a professional food taster with an incredibly refined set of taste buds to recognize any hint of green tea or honey.<br /><br />What i really can't grasp is why they bothered putting any real sugar in this in the first place. Why not make it 0 calorie and skip the sugar entirely, instead of putting the 10 calories (per packet, which is two servings, hence 'only 5 calories per serving!') in with no effect whatsoever on the taste of the product.<br /><br />And worse yet, if they're going to grossly oversweeten it, why not use a zero-calorie sweetener like stevia that doesn't taste like a chemical factory exploded on your tongue?<br /><br />People who consume enough fake sugar that they've lost the negative reaction to the chemical aftertaste of those products will probably find this product pleasantly sweet and fruity. Everyone else, well, just don't buy this.

review/summary: its like kool-aid for adults
review/text: I found the taste to be very strong, so only using half of the package per large cup of water is a good idea.  Even just using half the package, there is still a real lot of flavor and it is hard to believe there isn't a lot of sugar in it, as it tastes so sweet.  You don't have to worry about mixing it, as the package states, as it dissolves well and whatever is left over will dissolve in the next serving anyway.  I found myself going to the water cooler about two to three times more often than normal because it tastes so good.  Both the flavors I had were good so you will probably be pleased with any of the flavors you try.

review/summary: Weird after taste.
review/text: I added a package of the lipton to go to a 16.9 oz water bottle like the instructions say. I decided not to add the entire package all at once because I have read it is a bit too sweet. The first thing I noticed is the granules are pretty big, and it took a lot of shaking and even letting it sit a bit before it dissolved all the way.<br /><br />Right away I could smell a fruity but chemical like fragrance when I opened the bottle. The first sip it tasted watered down because I didn't use the whole package but at the same time it is overly sweet. Tastes like sugar water. I went ahead and put the whole package in, and it did darken the water to a nice burgundy color. With the whole package in it, it does give it more of a flavor and doesn't taste watered down, but it is still sweet. It has a weird after taste and I taste no honey at all. I do kind of taste the pomegranate but I don't really taste any tea or honey. Every morning I have hot lipton black tea and add honey. So, I know what tea with honey tastes like and this is not it.<br /><br />The weird after taste really gets to me. I don't know what it is but it distracts from the overall taste and makes me not want to really drink it. I don't know how to really describe it, almost a cardboard taste to it. It is funky.

review/summary: Very sweet & a little misleading
review/text: While this is a tasty tea I found that it was a little too sweet for one 16 oz bottle of water. I put it into a larger cup and diluted it a bit more which brought out the mango and pineapple flavors more. It still has a "diet" aftertaste which I'm not thrilled about, but I do appreciate that it doesn't have aspartame in it. These handy packets would be good to travel with, especially when traveling abroad where you shouldn't drink anything other than bottled water. I also thought that the nutritional information is a little misleading. The front of the package boasts that it's only five calories per 8 oz serving, but these are made to be poured directly into a 16 oz bottle of water so in reality there are two servings per packet, making it ten calories. Not a lot of a difference, but for a calorie counting person it is a difference.

review/summary: This is tea? Really?
review/text: What I expected: Something that tasted like green tea with perhaps a hit of honey, strawberry, and acai flavor, finished with the typical sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />What I got: A pleasant tasting strawberry soft drink with very little sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the taste of this drink is quite nice. The strawberry flavor is quite fresh-tasting and at room temperature is very fragrant. It's just not at all what I'd expect for a product from Lipton calling itself "Green Tea Mix". The powder dissolves very quickly, even when stirred with a spoon in an open glass (vs shaken in a bottle).<br /><br />So why only three stars? Like I said, I expected green tea. I got strawberry drink. If you're looking for strawberry, this is very good. If you're looking for tea, move along.

review/summary: Better than most
review/text: This came in a small box of ten foil packages three inches long and a half-inch wide.  There is a cut at one end that allows you to open the foil package so none of the usual difficulties with getting these things open just to spill out some of the contents. The package says to mix with one 16-ounce bottle of water.<br /><br />The powder mixed into the water completely by the time I was ready to put the lid on to shake it up.  It turned the water a light pink.  This flavor of Stix To Go does not have aspartame in it.  The box says sweetened with honey and indeed honey granules are the first ingredients, however there is also sucralose, similar to Splenda.  There is also maltodextrin, which is often used in soda or candy as a thickener, but it is made from real food not chemicals.  The other ingredients are the flavors and hibiscus extract.  WebMD says that hibiscus extract is used to improve odor, flavor, and appearance of tea.  The package also says that a serving size is half of a package at five calories, but you are told to add the whole package to a bottle of water, so beware if you are counting calories.<br /><br />The taste is not bad.  I do not drink anything with artificial sweeteners because I cannot stand the aftertaste, but I did not notice an aftertaste with this.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it did not last.  If think you are getting tea you are not.  This taste like kid's strawberry drink.  If you just can't drink water then you would probably like this.

review/text: I am always looking for new flavors to add to my water bottles.  I like blackberries and pomegrantes.  This flavor stick leaves an aftertaste in my mouth that I didn't like very much.  I have had some better tasting flavors (see my review for the Lipton strawberry flavor).  I really couldn't get past the after taste.  I probably will not be getting this flavor again.
