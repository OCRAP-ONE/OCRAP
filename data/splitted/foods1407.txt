review/summary: Yummy -- like what I remembered 35 years ago
review/text: When I was at school in Idaho 35 years ago, this was my favorite candy of all time.  Unfortunately, I've never seen them offered for sell in any store since then.  Imagine my pleasant surprise when I saw these at Amazon -- at a great price and delivered to my door in Texas.  I lost no time in ordering a box.  They're basically chunky chocolate on the outside that surrounds a cherry concoction that surrounds a whole cherry.  Very tasty and just like I remembered.  If you love cherry chocolate candy, you won't go wrong with these yummy treats.  I think I'll have one right now....

review/text: Another chocolate-peanut coated candy with a whole cherry in the middle is the "Cherry Cocktail" from the Idaho Candy Company. Another bar similar to "Cherry Mash" is the "Twin Bing." With "Big Cherry," there are actually four regional candy bars with their own variations of chocolate and peanuts over a cherry filling.

review/summary: Mmmmm. This Stuff Is Wonderful!
review/text: Yesterday, I went in for a supplies  restocking at a nearby Costco and picked up a few very interesting products. One was a 32-ounce jar of Mezzetta Napa Valley Bistro Italian Olive Antipasto marinated with fresh garlic, herbs and Nappa Valley chardonnay. It appears to be exactly the same product as listed here but my jar appears to be larger. In any case, this product is just excellent! The taste is sensational! Thank goodness it's a low calorie dish! It's a mixture of olives, green peppers, onions, chunks of fresh garlic and it's all marinated in wonderful herbs, sea salt, canola oil, distilled vinegar and Napa Valley Chardonnay. The marination sauce is so good I plan to save it, filter out the herbs and drink the remaining juice. It has good electrolites, plus a wonderful taste. Mmmmm. This stuff is wonderful!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I  Lve my Salba seeds!
review/text: At first when I started using chia seeds regularly, people said to me "chia seeds are chia seeds.....why do you need to buy a brand?"  I did buy bulk seeds in my health food store....I did buy bags at Trader Joe's...and I still went back to my organic<br />Salba Seeds and find they work the best for me.  Here's what I do with them.  I take 1 cup of almond milk (or soy, rice or plain old milk if you wish) and add a few soaked dates (which I left in a pot of water which had boiled but turned flame off).  PItted the<br />dates, threw them (about 4 large ones) into my Vitamix (you can use a blender) and let them blend until totally mixed.  While blender is running, add 1/2 cup of chia seeds (My organic Salba seeds) and a few tsp of cocoa powder and instant coffee (if you like<br />that flavor).  Let the blender or Vitamix run until everything has thickened.  That's it.  Pour into a container.  Refrigerate.  What have you made?  Chia seed pudding.  Sugar free, lots of fiber, a perfect breakfast.  Some people use a banana instead of dates,<br />others leave off the cocoa and coffee powder.  IT's a mater of taste and any sweet fruit works as a substitute sweetener. If you eat super low carb, even an artificial sweetener will work instead of fruit....with or without cocoa/coffee.<br /><br />SO why Salba seeds and not just any chia seeds?  Because this recipe I'm sharing, which I've tried with other chia seeds doesn't seem to work as well or taste as well.  Perhaps it's my imagination, but these seeds seem to be consistently clean, fresh and a blender<br />or mixer like a Vitamix will pulverize them into a pudding perfectly in less than a minute.<br /><br />Just a big fan of this product.  I keep buying many jars at a time. I like that it's organic.  And I think any company that focuses on putting their seeds in a jar and branding them probably has higher standards than chia seeds sold in bulk in bins...where I'm<br />afraid bugs and dirt might have collected.... I always have my high fiber chia seed pudding ready for breakfast and even when I use the last of my pudding up, it's only minutes to make another batch.

review/summary: Put Pasta Back in Your Diet
review/text: Okay, I first came across the "Fiber Gourmet" brand from a vague Google search for "low calorie pasta". I'd previously bought into the shirataki noodle craze and while I admit--calorically speaking--shirataki have EVERYTHING else on the planet beat hands down, I quickly tired of the stuff mainly because I knew I would have to chew the heck out of it before swallowing, lest It Come Out Looking the Same Way It Went In ('nuff said there) and for the cost of each bag (the store brand I found in the tofu aisle was roughly $2.50 ea and the Miracle Noodle brand from online is essentially the same for 8-9 oz bag) my diet was getting pretty expensive eating 2bags a day 4 days a week. I ate shirataki by the bag, after all...<br /><br />So when I happened across the Fiber Gourmet website, I simply bookmarked it and went along my way. Finally, after a couple more weeks of laboriously chewing shirataki, I decided to give it a whirl and ordered from the official website. I have to admit, the first time I tried the Light Spaghetti pasta I wasn't exactly bowled over and that was because I was actually mixing the Fiber Gourmet noodles with another, lower sodium (but still 210cal/srvg) noodle brand and honestly wasn't seeing much of a difference--on the scale or satiety-wise. However, in the past couple weeks I went back to my case of 6 boxes and tried them again, this time wondering why in the world I didn't like them first time! I stopped mixing them with the other noodle and most times have either exactly the 56g serving size or 84g (1.5 srvg) and mix it with veggies, spices and low-sodium/calorie glazes (Captain Rodney's Sweet & Spicy Pepper Glaze being my fav). For a treat I'll throw in a couple ounces of Morning Star Farms fake chik'n strips.<br /><br />The best part about the Light Spaghetti is how absolutely filling they are. I've taken to having the above-described dish for lunch and honestly I don't feel hungry again until several hours later. 18g of fiber is just ridiculous (per serving) but I'm so glad it's there because you really don't need much of the noodles to get satisfied. That's one thing these have over the shirataki. Another is the whole "chewing element"; I found I don't have to count 32 chews (literally; I actually did this w/ the shirataki) before swallowing. Fiber Gourmet also cooks dang close to legit pasta. I found that really leaving them on the stove boiling for a while (over 20mins) is best and you can tell from sight when they're ready. I haven't managed to overcook this pasta yet.<br /><br />But above all the pros, I have to say that the fact they fill you up is the best. I'm on a low calorie diet so having that extra 70 cals/serving these spare you really helps. My faux-lo mein:) meal described above is around 250-395 cals depending on whether I add any meat to the pasta. Since I don't need an afternoon snack on the days I eat Fiber Gourmet for lunch, I can save another 100-150 there for dinner.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend having these more than once a day or having more than twice the serving size on account of how much fiber is in a serving but so far I've had no intestinal issues whatsoever (TMI?). Oh! And even though I bought my first case from the Fiber Gourmet website I'd highly recommend buying them here from Amazon--when I saw the case for $16.92 WITH PRIME S/H I was sold and ordered immediately so I won't have to go even a day w/o these. I paid about $20 for the case from FG's site and then about $7-10s/h on top of that so the deal is DEFINITELY here. Since I've incorporated the FG pasta into my diet I've dropped almost 3lbs in 10 days whereas shirataki 4 days a week had me at a statistical standstill. I highly recommend FG's pasta if you want to taste noodles almost exactly like the real thing and can't stand the thought of life w/o a past dish like I can't:)

review/summary: Real Pasta on a Diet
review/text: Yes, I needed to lose weight, and yes, I did try the noodles. Some of the noodles are semi OK with spaghetti sauce. I needed real pasta. I was pleased with the FiberGourmet Light Spaghetti and the Fettuccine, Short-Cut. I didn't care as much for the long Fettuccine. Elbows will be next on my list.<br /><br />I warm up the Morningstar Crumbles and spaghetti sauce in the microwave, while the Fettuccine or Spaghetti is boiling. When the Spaghetti is done, I drain it and add it to the crumbles and sauce. It is a quick low cal meal. Great for a family or group.<br /><br />I also slice chicken breasts (1 per each serving) in a skillet with olive oil and cook it for 10 minutes while turning it often. I then add diced onions and green peppers and cook that for 10 more minutes. I add a can of diced tomatoes (including the juice) and cooked Spaghetti or the Fettuccine, Short-Cut. Then stir it around for 4 or 5 minutes and add some grated pizza cheese. I serve it once the cheese has melted. This serves two people with some left over for lunch.<br /><br />Pasta at 140 calories (not 210) that tastes like pasta and cooks like real pasta, and eats like real pasta. It has my vote. One box is four or five servings. We cook two boxes at a time and put the rest in freezer bags and put it in the freezer. Cooking the pasta is the part that takes the longest time, so we grab a bag from the freezer and nuke it and put it into our low cal Italian dishes.

And, as an added bonus, it is healthy & low in calories.  I have now tried every version of this pasta & they are all amazing.  Some reviewers complained that the pasta is too firm, but that is not the case.  You simply need to cook it a bit longer than regular pasta & then it is light as a feather. Because of how wonderful it tastes & because it is so light, you would think that you were eating homemade pasta.  Almost hard to believe, that this pasta comes out of a box! :-)

review/text: Like other reviewers have said, a great tasting pasta, sometimes better then "regular" pastas. Plus you need LESS then normal because it is so filling, a double blessing (less calories anyway,  plus less needed). The fiber content is outstanding, FAR exceeded the so called "Fiber" pasta in sttores at the same price. I used to get it automatically shipped by Amazon at a good price, but as usual with my fav foods, they stopped. Now I use Fiber Gourmets web site, at about the same price, and a better selection, MUCH less then these sellers (at this time..of course that changes). Fiber Gourmet sells many different types not shown here. This is greatly recommended, and I make my own version of Mac and Cheese using the Kraft powdered Cheese.

review/summary: love this pasta!
review/text: Like so many, I am fighting to control my weight and pasta used to be a big downfall for me.  No more!  FiberGourmet pastas taste so close to regular pasta that most people will not notice the difference.  And, those that do will not be bothered by it.  My entire family likes this pasta.  It has far fewer calories per 2 ounce serving: 130 vs 210 for Smart Taste pasta.  Since we don't like our pasta al dente, this does have to be cooked a little longer than usual.  I have tried this with traditional red sauce, in lo mein, and just buttered, and it's perfect every time.  Plus, it is so filling!  Each box has 4 servings, and I feed three people easily with one box (each person, including my husband, satisfied with just over a serving).<br /><br />Yes, this pasta is expensive.  FiberGourmet Spaghetti only has 8 ounces per box whereas regular pasta has 12 (or even 16 for some brands).  And, it can be a challenge to find.  None of the grocery stores in my area sell this; I can only get it online and Amazon too often goes out of stock.  That said, most low calorie or healthy-option alternatives cost more, regardless of what the product is.  For me, this product is well worth the cost.  It tastes great, is very filling, and lets me fill that pasta craving without the guilt (or the extra pounds).  I also recommend their other pasta shapes, rotini, penne and the lasagna.  I have tried and enjoyed them all.  Now, if only they would offer plain elbows outside of their Mac & Cheese...

Neither of us were expecting much as it seemed too good to be true but I thought it was worth the chance.  We were both surprised and delighted with FiberGourmet Spaghetti.  It's well worth the price.  It takes a little longer to cook al dente than regular pasta as we usually buy thin pasta but, for the nutritive value and calorie savings, it's just amazing.  This has now become our pasta of choice and I am on the email notice list for the penne.

Flax seeds may lower cholesterol levels, especially in women.[10] Initial studies suggest that flax seeds taken in the diet may benefit individuals with certain types of breast[11][12] and prostate cancers.[13] A study done at Duke suggests that flaxseed may stunt the growth of prostate tumors,[13] although a meta-analysis found the evidence on this point to be inconclusive.[14] Flax may also lessen the severity of diabetes by stabilizing blood-sugar levels.[15] There is some support for the use of flax seed as a laxative due to its dietary fiber content[6] though excessive consumption without liquid can result in intestinal blockage.[16] Consuming large amounts of flax seed may impair the effectiveness of certain oral medications, due to its fiber content,[16] and may have adverse effects due to its content of neurotoxic cyanogen glycosides and immunosuppressive cyclic nonapeptides.

review/summary: Sodium Benzoate is Dangerous- It's in EZ-sweetz
review/text: I was disappointed to find out EZ-sweet uses Sodium Benzoate as one of it's preservatives. This ingredient, when combined with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) creates Benzene which is carcinogenic (cancer causing).<br /><br />I used to use Splenda or generic sucralose packets, but they made a mess on the counter, took up too much room in our pantry when purchased in bulk, and took up alot of space near the coffee maker when compared with concentrated sweeteners.  EZ sweet would be the easy alternative if it weren't toxic. I had to find a better option. I find that the only super easy way around using EZ sweet but also save on space/mess is to use the splenda mini tablets. They are much more expensive than the packets and take time to dissolve, so I've recently found another option. I can purchase 1 oz of pure sucralose powder form from the Splendex site and mix it with 3 oz of water (plus a natural preservative) to make the equivalent of 2,500 packets of Splenda. The cost of the 1oz powder is only $24.95. I found that other companies sell sucralose powder but haven't found a supplier who sells just 1oz and will supply me with a 4 oz bottle suitable for dispensing the solution. Finding the powder wasn't easy. It is not an option on their home/default web page. I had to go to order products and on the right side was an option for the powder.<br /><br />I'm going to experiment with different natural preservatives (colloidal silver, GSE, natural salts, natural acids) to keep the solution from becoming contaminated with bacteria or fungus. If you're going to go this route, do some research on natural preservatives and if you find one that works well, please leave a comment to this review.

Deithylene glycol may be a cheaper ingredient than glycerine, but it causes Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome, especially in childen.  So, non of the white label, non-traceable sucralose that is widely available on eBay for me.<br /><br />I was happy to find this product made in regulated America.  And it's fine stuff, I just have an incredibly hard time getting it out of the bottle.<br /><br />One measures a serving by drops, and the bottle of this product is of such hard plastic.... similiar to the thickness of an extra-large laundry detergent<br />bottle, that is is very difficult to squeeze hard enough to get a drop to form and fall off the tip.

review/summary: Excellent Product - Only 1/2 as Sweet as 0.5-oz Bottles, Though!
review/text: I love this product, but wanted to point out that this 2-oz bottle is diluted in strength compared to the 0.5-oz bottles.  Yes it's very sweet, but not as sweet as the smaller bottles (which I do not understand).<br /><br />Look at the smaller bottles - it will tell you that 1 drop = 1 tsp sugar.  On this larger bottle, it shows that 2 drops = 1 tsp sugar.  SO, just be aware that if you're used to the small bottles, you'll have to use twice as much if you buy this one.<br /><br />As far as price, you are paying exactly the same amount PER SERVING (at the time of this review anyway), so that is not an issue (i.e., one drop from the small bottle is the same price as 2 drops from the larger bottle).<br /><br />Aside from this confusion, this is an EXCELLENT product and I use it all the time.  I make iced tea with this product and people think it's real sugar.  I have also used it in recipes calling for Splenda.  Remember, Splenda is cut with carbohydrates but this product has ZERO carbs even in large amounts.

review/text: This is a great sweetener and a generic version of liquid splenda.  Contains 800 drops. With 1 drop equaling a tsp and 2 drops equaling a packet of splenda.  The bottle was pleasantly bigger than I expected.  After purchasing it last week, bought another one this week to keep at work.  Zero carbs so you don't have to waste any carbs on artificial sweeteners.  Doesn't have a bad after tase.<br />Would recommend to anyone who uses sweeteners.

review/summary: Convenient sweetener, without any filler
review/text: This is a great source of zero-calory sweetener.<br /><br />Sucralose (Splenda) is a great sweetener, with zero calories, no aftertaste, and solid safety testing.  And liquid form is a great way to get this sweetener.  It tastes just like sugar.  And, unlike the powder form sold by Splenda (which comes with filler, malodextrin, which provides carbohydrates and a few calories), this product contains nothing more sucralose and water.  In particular, it has no carbohydrates and absolutely no calories.  Perfect.<br /><br />One thing that's a little unfortunate about the EZ-Sweetz product is that the EZ-Sweetz bottle is not well-designed for adding a large-ish quantity of sweetener.  It seems intended for adding a drop or two to your cup.  Personally, I like to mix a large jug of unsweetened kool-aid and then add sucralose sweetener.  I'd be squeezing the bottle all day long if I had to add it by individual drops.<br /><br />So, here's a tip on how to use this to sweeten in larger quantities.  Unscrew the lid of the bottle, then take your needle-nose pliers and remove the plastic dropper top.  Set it aside.  Now you can pour liquid out into a teaspoon or measuring spoon.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer doesn't provide the conversion factors on the bottle or packaging, but I wrote to them and they gave me the following conversion factor: 1 tsp (teaspoon) = 2 cups of sugar.  This should help you figure about how much to add.  They warned me: "Actual results could be varied depending on the application", so beware; but this conversion factor seems to work reasonably well for me.  Also beware that this conversion factor is specific to the 2oz bottle, which comes in a different concentration than some of the smaller bottles.  With this method, I find the 2oz bottle a perfect way to sweeten a big jug of drink made from unsweetened powdered drink mix.

review/summary: Good Taste and Usually Good Portion Control
review/text: Good Taste and Good Portion Control<br /><br />EZ-Sweetz<br /><br />This is concentrated liquid sucralose plus preservatives.  Unlike the granulated forms, it truly has zero calories.  The flavor is good, but there is a slight difference between this form and the granulated form, which is no surprise because the granulated form uses a sugar (malto dextrin) as a filler.  The product stays in the bottle, even if it falls over with the cap off.  You have to squeeze the bottle to get the product to come out, which is does one drop at a time, so it is very easy to get precisely the number of drops that you want.  Some people may feel that you have to squeeze too hard to get the drops out and may need to use both hands.<br /><br />Update: usually the portion control is good, but sometimes you get one with a hole so big that the product comes out as a stream instead of drops.  Other times the hole is so small that a man using two hands and squeezing as hard as he can, can barely get anything out of the bottle.

review/summary: Great sweetener, but variable dispensers!
review/text: I've been using EZ-Sweetz for a couple years now, and am totally sold on it. I wish I could buy it locally instead of the manufacturer or Amazon (no offense, EZ or Amazon!) just for convenience. I started out with the more concentrated version, then switched over to this 1 drop = 1 tsp container. I reload the smaller sized bottles to keep in my purse and desk at work, and also to cut my losses if I lose a bottle, as I did recently.<br /><br />So just to confirm I'm totally sold on EZ-Sweetz and will continue to purchase it, I want to say that dispensing from this bottle can be quite variable from one purchase to the next. Sometimes it's really quite a chore to squeeze a drop or two out, and the next bottle squirts it out too easily, practically in a stream. I'm careful when using a new bottle because I hate to waste it and the drink I'm trying to sweeten. (Learned the hard way!) There have also been a couple of bottles that seemed to be a weaker concentration than the previous one or the one after. I drink a lot of tea, and it's easy to tell when 3 drops isn't enough today, when it was fine yesterday. It's a little frustrating, but like I said, I'm a big fan regardless.<br /><br />5 stars for the product, 4 for the packaging and product variability!

review/summary: Ok, but not my favorite
review/text: I usually use Sweetzfree, but decided to try this as it was cheaper and I was surprised that another liquid Splenda was available.<br /><br />The taste was only OK and a little bitter, but bearable.  The major problem I had with it was that it actually made my tongue numb.  I usually put it in my tea by putting it in the glass before I pour the tea; even so, the drops seemed to sit on top of the tea and would not stir in completely.  I even cut way back on the amount I put in and it still numbed my tongue.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because once the numbness subsided (after about 5 minutes) the taste was close to sweet and would probably be acceptable to some users of artificial sweetners.  The numbness kind of worries me, though, so I will be switching back to Sweetzfree

review/text: I usually put 3 packets of Splenda in my coffee each morning - a larger cup that holds probably closer to two mugs worth.  Anyway, 2 drops of this equals 1 packet, so I use 6 drops per day.  I'm telling you, it lasts forEVER.  I was almost scared off by the price tag, but when you break it down, it's a great deal.  Plus, the taste is what you would expect from Splenda, but no residue to worry about.  The little bottle takes up no room compared to storing a box of Splenda packets in my desk.  I highly recommend you give this a try - you will be glad you did.  And yeah, I'm that guy that buys a million things on Amazon and never leaves a review, so I took the time on this.  So...there you go.

review/summary: The best option out there at the moment
review/text: Tastes fantastic and 0 carbs/0 cals, recommended by Dr. Atkins himself if that's your bag. Healthier than Aspartame and of course Saccharine. A much better alternative to the packets of "Splenda", because the packets contain maltodextrin or other fillers that add up to about 1g carbs per 2 packets. I like sweet beverages, so using packets really adds up after a while. The taste of sucralose is very *similar* to sugar-sweetened drinks, but there's still a little difference. It might be all in my head, and it's certainly not anything to worry about.<br /><br />One small negative I noticed is that I think they overestimate the sweetening power a little bit. I love the big $1 unsweetened teas from a very popular fast food franchise (just about the only thing I can get away with without guilt on their menu :P ), and I used to use 3 packs of Splenda in them to get a perfect amount of sweetness for me. According to this bottle, that should equal 6 drops of EZ-Sweetz, but it actually takes about 10 to give the same sweetness. Not really a big deal.<br /><br />I'm personally a big fan of Stevia, but it's a relatively under-researched food product. Sometimes synthetic products (Sucralose) are actually better in this regard because you tend to know exactly what it is and isn't. Stevia is all-natural and, while it tastes fantastic and has been used naturally for thousands of years in many parts of the world, I would prefer more modern scientific study on it before making a life commitment to it, especially if there's a better alternative currently out there. This is it!

review/text: I used to use Healthy Cheats liquid sucralose - the one that came with an eye dropper. I thought that was fantastic in coffee and cooking but it seems to have been discontinued.  As an alternative, I tried Sweetzfree but I found it too concentrated and I had a hard time getting the correct amount out of the small bottle.  I have using the EZ-Sweetz for 2 months and it's been perfect. The drops come out slowly enough to be precise, the nozzle doesn't clog, and it's not so concentrated as to oversweeten everything with a single drop.  It works well in  drinks as well as cooking. I will update this review once I try it in baking.

review/summary: A little difficult to manage
review/text: I think that this sucralose liquid may not sweeten quite as much as indicated on the package when used for recipes.  I'll try increasing the drops a little next time I make my sugarfree cheesecake.  Also, it's a little difficult to manage counting out the drops to get, say the equivalent of 1 1/4 cups of sugar.  Maybe I'll eventually figure out how to measure it by the measuring spoon instead of drops.  It would be nice if they would put larger equivalents on the packaging, rather than leaving it to us to calculate by the equivalent of a teaspoon or tablespoon of sugar.  That is, I wish they would say that 1 cup of sugar equals xx teaspoons or parts thereof. It would make using it for recipes a lot simpler.<br />On the positive side, it does sweeten without adding a bunch of liquid or foreign flavors to your recipe.

review/summary: No After Taste!
review/text: When I read that 1 drop equals 1 tsp, I thought, Ok, I'll start with 2 drops in my coffee and then go from there to see how many drops I'll actually need. I put in 2 drops, added my creamer and tasted it. I was amazed!! I didn't need to put any more drops in it. It tastes just like sugar and NO nasty after taste like most of the artificial sweetners. About the only thing I use sugar for is to sweeten my coffee. I just opened my 2nd 2 ounce bottle. The first bottle lasted 5 months. That is NO Exageration!! They state that 1 (2 oz) bottle is equal to 10 lbs of sugar. I have NO doubts about that now. I started using this since I was diagnosed pre-diabetic. Now I'm happy that I found a great substitute to white granular sugar and so is my doctor. I have since ordered more because this is one product I do not want to run out of! Love it!!<br /><br />UPDATE 9/20/12: An added benefit: Since I started using this EZ Sweetz, I haven't used even 1 teaspoon of regular granulated sugar. I also started drinking an 8 oz bottle of Chocolate Flavored Boost Glucose Control. I went to the doctor last week for my 6 month check up and have lost 17 lbs between visits. Since these are the only 2 things I'm doing differently, I attribute the loss to these.

review/summary: Really equal to 5 LB bag of Sugar (not 10)
review/text: I been wanting to quit using Aspertame so I started using Splenda and store brands of sucralose. They put about 85% FILLER in the bags (dextrose for one, which is sugar!). They do that so a cup of splenda will equal out to a cup of sugar, like BIG DEAL! I want to buy sucralose, not FILLER! Anyhow, I love powdered Drink mix, been using KOOL AID and Whylers UN-Sweetened where instead of adding sugar, I added Splenda. This 2.0 fl oz bottle came in from Amazon and I wanted to give it a try. It says on the bottle that 1 Teaspoon = 2 Cups of Sugar. I always make a Gallon of KoolAid, so that 2 cups equal is perfect! I made it as normal, put in the fridge, oh and I left one full glass of the Splenda version that was from the last pitcher I made. 3 Hours later I try the drink and it's not sweet at all. Very under sweetened. So I added 1 more teasoon to the gallon pitcher, tasted about the same as the splenda brand now. So it's really 2 Teasoons = 2 cups of sugar (or 1 teaspoon = 1 cup of sugar). It says this is = to a 10 LB Bag of sugar on the box the bottle comes in, so it's really half of that. Still, you get 11 cups worth of sugar from this bottle (going by the 5 LB Bag usage), it's still alot cheaper to buy this than the big bag of splenda, the price is about the same, give or take a few dollars for the spenda 9 oz bag, that you only get about 6 cups of sugar tops.<br />  I would deff buy this again and will when I run out. Just wish they made this into a larger bottle, I mean like a bottle of Ketchup size, sure it would cost $50, but I'd buy it. This won't last me a real long time and I have never seen this pure Sucralose in stores.<br />  I have also been using Stevia of lates, NOW Foods on Amazon sells a huge 1 LB jar of it for $45. Now thats my style.

This sweetner was ok but I would not buy it again for several reasons. It takes far more drops to sweeten something than indicated (I use 4 drops to a regular cup of coffee) BUT go one drop over and it is too much...just too hard to get the amount needed adjusted. The taste is ok but for me it does leave an after taste and I am an avid user of artificial sweetners, so it is not that I am not use to them. I hate that  stores stopped selling the liquid sweeteners, I like them because of the zero carbs. Anyway, I will purchase the Sweet N Low next time.

It's like each bottle has the same amount of sucralose and otherwise is just diluted with water.<br />My favorite product is Sweetzfree that can be bought at Sweetzfree.com. It's consistently sweet (almost TOO sweet, but you can dilute your own to your liking). It's more expensive but is still a better value because of the amount MORE sweet that it is.<br />To quantify it: to equally sweeten something, you would need 8 drops out of the 2oz bottle of EZsweetz, 4 drops out of the .5oz bottle of EZsweetz, and 2 out of any Sweetzfree bottle (and Sweetzfree is not twice as expensive per ounce; hence the better value).<br />However, EZsweetz is leaps and bounds better, cheaper, and is actually calorie-free as opposed to Splenda which is expensive, nasty (starchy), and actually like 200something calories per cup! That's why it gets 2 stars instead of 1 for inconsistency.<br />Hope this review is helpful!

review/summary: Good for baking
review/text: I'm a low carber and Stevia is normally my "drug of choice" but many of the baking type recipes I've been running across called for either Splenda or the equivalent of liquid Splenda (which is what Ez-Sweet is).  Powdered Splenda still has some carbs due to the fillers they put in it, but the liquid form doesn't so that's where this stuff comes in.  I've used it several times in baking type recipes and had good results.  There is a conversion chart on the bottle that tells you what the equivalents are.. for example, two drops of this stuff is equal to two tablespoons of sugar and 1 tsp is equal to two cups of sugar.  As you can see, a little goes a long way so I feel like I will get plenty of use out of this!

review/summary: Works great in sweet tea and peanut butter
review/text: For years I used powdered Splenda, ignorant of the fact that it was bulked up with maltodextrin and dextrose and most certainly DOES contain calories and carbs. I am on Atkins Induction phase and every carb counts, so I decided to order a bottle of this. So far, I am pleased. I use it in my iced tea and I put about 3/4 of a teaspoon, or about 75 drops per gallon of tea. That's more than most people use probably, but I like my tea SWEET. I think this stuff has a very pleasant sweet taste and is not bitter at all like some reviews have said. It doesn't give me any headaches or any other side effects that I know of. I've tried stevia and truvia, and those REALLY taste bitter to me. But this tastes good. I made a batch of peanut butter and I usually put Xylitol in it, but this time I used a few drops of EZ Sweetz and it tasted fine. I have not tried baking with it. I know sucralose is heat stable unlike Aspartame, so it should work. The problem I would think, is it would be hard to get the right amount of EZ sweetz in a recipe because it's in liquid form, and you only need a tiny amount. I wish it was a little cheaper, but other than that, I think it's a good product. If you already like the taste of Splenda and are trying to cut calories/carbs, this product is worth it.

review/text: I use this stuff all the time in coffee, tea, and baking. There a bit of an aftertaste, but it's not as bitter as Stevia and I only really notice it when I use it make something like maple syrup. I'm also not convinced that the conversion is 2 drops = 2 tsp. I think you need a little more than two drops, but you're still getting a ton of sweetener in a tiny bottle. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.

review/text: When I make steel cut oats I put 8-10 drops in the boiling water and then add the oats. Tastes just like Mom used to make. Sucralose is great for cooking at high temps and the bottle is fine, though I did have to widen the hole out a little with a pin on one bottle. I also use it in my coffee and any time I want sugar. I like to control my processed sugar intake and this does the job cheaply and efficiently.

review/summary: lower aluminum taste
review/text: I consume 2,000 Splenda packets each year, so before I ordered my next case, I decided to give this liquid version a try.  I was very pleased with how noticeably better it tasted in my home brewed Iced <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112GBO0">Dilmah Tea, 100% Pure Ceylon Tea, Loose Leaf, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, though it takes 2 drops to equal a packet's sweetening power.  each gallon of tea I brew normally requires 16 packets (one per 8oz cup), while over 30 drops were needed to match that sweetness here.  As I brew 4 gallons at a time, not having to rip open, tap empty and dispose of 64 packets was nice, but that still does not make up for this liquid's triple net sweetening cost.  Should I find it again under $5/ounce I would get more, barring that - I'll probably go back to using cheaper packets.

review/summary: Weird but it works!
review/text: By weird I mean: here is a bottle that has this sugar replacement that cost a pretty penny and it measures in drops. Yes, two drops from this container equal one packet of splenda? And the container, supposedly, has 800 drops which is quite a statement that in true honesty I can not dispute because it would be really tedious to count every single little drop that pours out from the plastic dispenser. Okey, that aside let's go to the part in the title of my review where I also say: It works! I tried it in my regular daily coffee and must say the taste is very agreeable and I compare it mostly to Splenda (which has been the choice for the past year or more) and it certainly is as good, if not better. No weird taste that I been able to tell and with the added bonus that it has zero zero zero, I think it makes a strong case for consumption. Heard that Splenda does have carbs and calories compared with this EZ-Sweetz. So I like it and now I am trying to see how long will it last compared to the price it cost to buy it. And since it has no impact whatsoever in the glycemic index (don't I sound very informed?) that is a plus to be considered. Perhaps is not even expensive if it lasts for at least a month or more. I found the product by accident and intriguing from the gate go so I was running low on Splenda and instead of going back to Costco and purchasing another 1000 packets I bought this one. The only reason I gave it 4 Stars is for the value factor but in everything else that it is supposed to do, it does with shinning colors. Thankful to the fine, and I mean fine, reviewers in amazon which I have learned to value and trust their helpful opinions (most of the time, anywhoo) and who knew EZ-Sweetz (2oz - Liquid Sweetener 800 Servings/Bottle) existed in the free world? Not me, that's for sure and thanks to amazon and reviewers alike now I have one standing pretty in my kitchen ready for cereal, tea, coffee and why not? Maybe even for baking. 4 Stars but surely 5 if it last like 800 drops?

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: I've been using this liquid sucralose for about 10 months on a daily basis, and I couldn't be happier. If you are on a low-carb diet, remember you are adding carbs to your coffee with every packet you open (from the anti-caking agents). But you don't have to be on a special eating regimen to appreciate this, because it is so cost effective. One 2oz bottle lasts me about 5 months for ~13 dollars. It is easy to over sweeten if you aren't careful (especially when the bottle is full), but you get used to that.

My husband didn't like the liquid Stevia, anyway, and said it had a weird taste, to him (I thought it tasted fine, but was unsettled by the sediment). Enter EZ-Sweetz: this product is great! It's perfectly clear with no "floaties," and my husband says it's an excellent sub for granulated Splenda (without the carbs required to get his coffee to the right taste). I am stocking up, for sure! Highly recommend, especially if you've been looking for a sweetener that makes things sweet, not chemically.

review/text: As other reviewers have said, this isn't as sweet as the smaller bottles. I need to use double the drops, even though it says 2 drops = 2 tsps. It is still a very good sweetness once you get your drop count right, and it is so portable I carry it everywhere. Wish it was as sweet as the smaller bottle counterparts. It does have a very slight after-taste you wouldnt get with real sugar, but it is extremely mild. Just letting people know there IS an after-taste, but it is very small and practically a non-issue. Other than that, great product. I'm buying some extra ones for my dad. He was surprised it was as sweet.

review/summary: Comparable to Nevella Sucralose to Go
review/text: I've been using Nevella Sucralose to Go ($3 at Wal-Mart vs $6.66 + shipping here), but with Sucralose to Go one "squeeze" equals 1 teaspoon, where with EZ-Sweetz, one DROP equals 1 Tablespoon.<br /><br />Having now tried EZ-Sweetz, the conversion chart definitely seems to hold true. While it takes 4-5 long squeezes of Sucralose to Go to sweeten a 12-ounce glass of iced tea or a mug of coffee, about 4 drops of EZ-Sweetz provide the same sweetness.  So the 2oz bottle of EZ-Sweetz should provide about 4 times as many servings as the 1.68 oz bottle of Sucralose to Go.<br /><br />Doing the math, even if this lasts about 4 times as long as Sucralose to Go, as long as I only buy Sucralose to Go at Wal-Mart, EZ-Sweetz through Amazon costs SLIGHTLY more.<br /><br />Also there's no aftertaste, it just sweetens your drinks without the Maltodextrin you get with Splenda.

review/summary: Five stars for sweetener itself, taking a star away for difficult dispensing
review/text: I typically use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LECIDE">more concentrated version of EZ Sweetz</a> that comes in a smaller package, but keeping track of that tiny little drip bottle was difficult, and my wife found that she sometimes wanted less than a full drop of sweetness added in some instances.<br /><br />So we found this larger bottle which has sweetener that is half as powerful as in the smaller bottle, meaning it takes two drops from this bottle to equal the sweetening power of one drop from the smaller bottle.<br /><br />That ratio seems to be correct, and from a taste perspective this stuff is great.  My wife is (usually, more on this below) able to use one drop of this to give half the sweetening power of a drop of the more concentrated stuff, and that lets her control things to the level she prefers.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there is a big issue, which is that it is nearly impossible to regulate the flow of drops from the bottle with any accuracy.  With the smaller bottle, you have to squeeze pretty hard to get a drop out.  With this larger bottle, the drops start flowing out quickly just by leaning the bottle over and without squeezing at all.  The drops come so fast and furious that it's difficult to track them by count, and we regularly end up over- or under-sweetening our drinks because we have no idea how many drops have been dispensed.<br /><br />Note that I have waited a couple of weeks before posting this review, to give us time to get used to the new behavior, but we continue to have the same issues even with practice.<br /><br />So, while we love and will continue to use EZ Sweetz, we will be going back to the smaller, more concentrated packaging because this larger bottle is just too hard to control while dispensing.

review/text: I have a sweet tooth, but I'm also cutting carbs out of my diet. With regular splenda there are bulk ingredients that add carbs and other sweeteners have odd tastes. This one sweetens what I need it to without tasting funny and without unnecessary carbs. I also love how it mixes into drinks easily because it's liquid. I have a big glass of iced coffee nearly every day and 3 drops makes it perfectly sweet for me. I've also used it as a sugar replacement in a cheesecake recipe, and I can hardly tell the difference anymore.

review/summary: My quality of life just got better
review/text: Prior to placing my order, I was skeptical about the claimed sweetness of the product.  In the past, I've tried other liquid sweeteners that claimed just a few drops were equivalent to two teaspoons of sugar, but I have always been greatly disappointed.  From a consumer perspective the level of sweetness is based on taste and not measurement of chemical concentrations in the product.  I'm happy to say that EZ-Sweetz delivers exactly as promised.  Both my wife and I are amazed at how sweet just two drops can make a cup of coffee.<br /><br />This product is important to me because I'm on a restricted diet that very tightly controls carbohydrate intake (15 - 20 grams a day maximum).  Each of the packages of Sucralose (usually the Splenda brand) contains nearly one gram of carbohydrates due to the bulking agents that are added to make the product more like sugar.  If I had 5 cups of coffee and/or tea during the day, I would waste 1/4 to 1/3 of my allowed consumption.  I started drinking my coffee unsweetened, but I really don't enjoy it that way.  Since the EZ-Sweetz product has no carbohydrates, I'm able to go back to actually enjoying my coffee.  Anybody who is on a carbohydrate restricted diet will understand how wonderful it is to be able to use sweeteners again.

review/summary: Amazing tool for the low carb diet.
review/text: Liquid sucralose is so much better to use for sweetening than packets of splenda.  With no bulking agent or anything added, there are no hidden carbs (1 cup of granula splenda has something around 26g carbs I believe?).  I put 2 or 3 drops of this into a big glass of unsweetened almond milk, and it tastes AMAZING.  This is especially good for me (when not low carbing) because something about regular milk doesn't agree with me and makes me retch, gag, and almost vomit.  Even if you aren't low carbing / aren't diabetic... it'll always be good to cut some of the sugar out of your diet ;)

I've yet to try sweeteners like stevia, but so far, this is at the top of my list.  Compared to splenda packets, this liquid form of sucralose does seem to mix faster and better based on my observations.  I like the fact that this form is more concentrated than the granulated form since I prefer my drinks sweeter than average.  And the key perk, since this is virtually zero carbs, there is no penalty for going with a bit extra.

review/summary: Best Non-Sugar Sweetener
review/text: I have been following a low carb diet for several months now, and have been looking for the best alternative to sugar. This is it. Regular splenda has maltodexitrin in it, which not only adds 24 grams of carbs per cup, but also tastes very bad to me. EZSweetz doesn't have this useless bulking ingredient and has a much better taste. Sugar alcohols just aren't as versatile or well tolerated by everyone and every other artificial sweetener has funny aftertastes or usage limitations. The only issue with sucralose is that it won't sweeten chocolate well by itself.<br /><br />I like this version, the 1 drop to 1 teaspoon because it affords more accuracy when baking.

review/summary: Love this sweetener!  Better than Splenda and liquid too!
review/text: I found a great substitute for Splenda!  No after taste.  Two drop has the sweetening power of 2 packets of Splenda or Sweet N Low.  It lasts a looooong time too!<br /><br />Definitely worth the $$.

review/text: It took me a while, but I did it. I finally decimated my bottle of EZ-Sweetz. It lasted forever with light to moderate use. I use this in everything. It's great for the discerning low-carber or calorie watcher alike. I personally think it tastes awesome in Kool-Aid. Try it! I'll be placing my second order in the near future!

review/text: It usually takes me a long time to get used to the taste of new sweeteners, but transferring from Splenda to EZ-Sweetz really didn't feel like there was any difference. 3 tiny drops is perfect for my cup of coffee. Tastes good, not overly sweet and that's close to 300 cups of coffee for $13. Can't beat it.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: Doing the Low carb thing - kind of stalled so looked at this to help with that (refuse to drink plain water!).  AMAZING how the tiniest little drop in my great big travel mug makes it super sweet! Watch out - you will learn you don't need nearly as much as you might think! I bought both this and the smaller bottles (that have more sweet per drop)... using both for different applications - this one is best when I want less sweet since 1 drop is less intense than with the higher concentration. so, with this I can go 3 drops (when I want it pretty sweet) which would equal about 1.5 drops from the smaller stronger stuff.<br /><br />I'll never no back to sweetner with fillers!

I use it mostly in my tea, but I have made baked custard with it and it came out fine.

review/text: I usually use Splenda packets, so this was a bit out of my comfort zone to try. The price and reviews seemed too good to pass. I couldn't be happier! This is very sweet, without the aftertaste. The only negative thing is that the dropper tends to drip at least one serving down the side each use, so it clearly reduces the amount of servings per container.

review/summary: Ah... my new best friend!
review/text: I am changing my diet to one that is low carb, unfortunately I love sweets.  The little yellow packets of sweetner have added bulking agents that up my carb count, and I use way too many of them in my drinks to stay within my carb limit.  Enter EZ-Sweetz: it's so convenient, will last forever, and works in all types of recipes- baked goods, drinks, frozen desserts....<br />I will definitely order this again, and will probably order the travel bottles for use in restaurants.  I highly recommend this product for those who need to cut back on sugar but still want some sweetness in their life.

review/summary: Great deal and taste
review/text: If you are looking to cut out carbs or just calories, forget about Splenda - it still has 128g / cup from maltodextrin (sugar) filler! "Liquid Splenda" is the way to go. I use this in everything. If you are using this to sweeten drinks, it will practically last forever as all it takes is 1 or 2 drops. This is enough to make many batches of muffins, cakes, brownies, etc that would normally require a few cups of sugar. Sucralose is 600x sweeter than sugar so 24 drops is roughly equivalent to 1 cup, making this little 2oz dropper equivalent to about 3 x 5lb bags of sugar. Impressive stuff.

review/summary: FANTASTIC STUFF
review/text: This is a great product.  Unlike some competitive products, it doesn't get clogged or crusty.  The only thing that could be better is that it takes a lot of effort to squeeze out a drop, so I end up pushing a safety pin through the nozzle to open it up more.  Otherwise it tastes great and is way better than using splenda powder.

review/text: This product is far sweeter than powdered Splenda or Fiberfit. I use EZ-Sweetz to primarily sweeten beverages. I also use EZ-Sweetz to reduce the amount of sugar used in certain dishes that call for a large amount of sugar. I detect no after taste. The only CON with this product is the price. Otherwise I would recommend this sweetener to anyone reducing glucose/carbs in diet.

review/text: This works wonderfully in sweet tea and other foods that don't need bulk from sugar.  I was using quite a bit of Splenda each week in tea, and since we have started Atkins we were unhappy with the carbs that the filler was adding...as we normally drink a LOT of tea.  With the liquid sucralose we can have lots of tea again and still lose weight.

review/text: I got so excited when I saw this and people were saying that it is basically Splenda without the aftertaste. When it came, I couldn't wait to try it in iced tea. Well, it has a raging aftertaste. Disgusting. I would not recommend this product. I consider that I wasted my money. I gave it two stars because it does sweeten, but I was tempted to give it one star.<br /><br />Maybe there will come a sucralose substitute that will get rid of the bitter aftertaste, but this is not it.

review/summary: Not So Sweet
review/text: I am a diabetic so am looking for low cost zero carb sweeteners.  Packets of sweeteners have lots extra carbs which also translates into additional sweetness.  I tried this product.  It is nowhere as sweet as advertised.  I use it with a 24 oz mug of coffee.  I add coco, creamer, and vanilla to my coffee.  I like it sweet.  Five packets of equal or Splenda will work.  13 tablets of Equal (aspartame without additional sweeteners and carbs) will give me the same results.  It takes at least 40 drops of EZ Sweetz to get it as sweet.  The bottom line: EzSweet is sweet but nowhere near as sweet as advertised. It does have no extra carbs, however. Also, as another person pointed out, the bottle is awkward to squeeze out drops as the level of liquid goes down in it

review/summary: Not as concentrated  as my usual brand
review/text: I've been using another brand (ordered online) for several years, so I know that product very well.  I use it in all foods in place of sugar.  I like coffee for dessert, so used 3 drops per cup, which is much sweeter than most people like it. I ordered this product only because it was a good price and it comes in multiples of a small size bottle( to keep in different locations).  I had to use at least 8 drops to equal the sweetness I'm used to. There's obviously a lot more water in this brand....hence the lower price, I assume. Maybe this wouldn't matter to some , but it was a deal breaker for me.
