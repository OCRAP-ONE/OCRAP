review/summary: Best candy ever!!!
review/text: I got my first taste when they were giving them away for free at this years Warped Tour, and I was hooked.  These are crack for your mouth.  I can't put them down.  They hit your taste buds where they haven't been hit before.  I'm not going to lie, they are extremely sweet, but very good.  People who prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate will probably not enjoy the candy as much.  But try it, cause it is very good.

review/summary: l'Olivier olive oil from France
review/text: Very hard to find in stores in USA. Used to be sold in Occitane stores all over, that is finished. Very few fancy food stores carry this oil (Citarella in NYC for expl). This olive oil is so good, all of them with herbs, lemon, basil etc etc.. No cholesterol so good for salad, pastas, fishes, etc.. Unfortunately on the web the distributors send this expensive product in  several boxes, each time the price of shipping double price. In NYC you find the product at Citarella for about $14. If you use the web the price is more than 100% with shipping. The product is superb, but I think the exclusif distribution take advantage of their position, I advise you not to buy on the web. Too expensive!

review/text: Trying to snack well is important to me, as one way of maintaining some degree of good health. One tactic that I am trying to adopt is sensible snacking. At the place where I work, I sometimes have broccoli, carrots, and celery with a dip; at other times, I have sliced apples and eat them plain. I also use this trail mix.<br /><br />A combination of nuts (peanuts and cashews) and fruit (raisins, banana chips, pineapple, and cranberries). The combination is crunchy and tasty. I try to make one package stretch across three days rather than eating all at once. But these are tasty critters!<br /><br />Thus, a successful snack for me. . . .

review/summary: Good stuff Maynard
review/text: Everyone seems to have their favorite trail mix, their favorite snack or bag of goodies to either place in their pack or have stashed in a handy place in the house.  Tastes differ, not only from one person to the next, but within the same individual; depending upon circumstances, mood, place and I don't know what.<br /><br />For this reason I buy a lot of different mixes as I tend to get tired of the same old thing over and over and over again.  I gave this stuff a try and I have to tell you that I liked it a lot.  It was fresh and the salt and sweet combination is the one I like.  Like another reviewer, if I were going to use this stuff on a trek, I would probably throw a few bits of chocolate in just to liven things up a bit...but then again, I am a chocolate freak so this may not appeal to everyone.<br /><br />When it comes to mixes such as this a person should try lots of them and goodness knows there are enough of them out there.  If you are not into making your own, then you should give this stuff a shot.  I am glad I did.

review/text: It's final exam time and I read that trail mix, nuts and fruits, were good snacks to eat while studying. So I hopped on my bike and bought these at the store. I guess it is a "win some, lose some." some reviewers complained that there were too many peanuts. I hardly have any. Mostly fruit for me. So perhaps I got lucky, or they were unlucky. Others complained that the banana chips were too hard. They are very hard and crunchy. I personally like them, but others may not. If you like bananas chips that crunch like a peanut or cashew, these are for you. If you don't, look elsewhere. I'm lovin' them.

review/summary: What is this BANANA CHIP MAGIC??
review/text: I grabbed a bag of these at the store thinking one of our kids might like it, but I was in need of a snack for the office today and brought it with. Within only one moment or so my reaction devolved into a gluttonous orgy of OMG NOM NOM NOM NOM! There could be more pineapple and papaya but there are plenty of banana chips, which I HATED before today. Today I LOVE THEM. THEY DID SOMETHING TO THEM. WHAT???! I thought Harry Potter and Hogwarts and Dumbledore and all that was just make believe, but I'm quite sure SOMEONE SPREAD MAGIC ON THEM. They are crunchy, not chewy; they taste like bananas, not chemicals.<br /><br />Sure, there's a lotsa peanuts. And cashews too, to be fair.  Despite the shortcoming of choosing Planters' two most common nuts and nothing exotic, this is really good commercial trail mix. You could roll some awesome trail mix and beat its pants off, sure. You could put good, good stuff like figs and pumpkin seeds and coconut shavings. Yeah, you COULD, believe me regarding this. But for a fruit-n-nut trail mix from a bag labeled Planters... well, color me impressed. especially with the banana chip magic. Better patent that shiznit, Planters!

review/text: I am dieting on WW and need to keep whole grains vs. white rice/pastas in my meal planning. This Kamut is Egyptian whole wheat, so if you like good whole wheat pastas out there, you should like this one too.  The added benefit is 6 grams of fiber per 2 oz serving, very high. And the shape is one you cannot find out there, this is good for soups, sides, and salads with beans/veggies (as I have just made with it today). The taste & texture is very palatable to me and my husband. Box directions say to boil 9 - 11 mins; but once it returns to a boil, I'd simmer it only 7 or 8 mins to keep it 'al dente.'

review/summary: Well, get ready for hungry kitties!
review/text: I have to admit that I barely gave Fancy Feast a second glance until those<br />wonderful commercials where the man proposes by presenting her with a white kitten<br />with the tag that said "Marry Us".  I still melt on that one!<br /><br />So, we started buying some Fancy Feast just to support a company who did such a<br />thoughtful, wonderful commercial! {Really - do we need any more commercials with cats<br />dancing around imaginary poultry?!)<br /><br />Our cats are gravy freaks, so I thought this would be a really good fit for them.<br />First off, there are THREE flavors in the box - chicken feast, beef feast and turkey feast.<br /><br />Neither cat cared for the beef much - they lick the gravy off of it, and leave the food<br />to turn to hard dry bits in their dishes. The like the chicken and turkey okay, but still<br />not their favorite food.<br /><br />Here is my problem with this product:<br />Fancy Feast already costs quite a bit per ounce, but we buy it from time to time both to spoil<br />our kitties and to show our monetary support of the company solely from that commercial. (Yep,<br />they found my soft spot!) We normally feed our cats wet once a day and dry any time else they are<br />hungry. Be prepared to have hungry kitties with this food, because they have replaced some of the actual<br />solid food with a volume of water/gravy to fill the can. We've found that they are actually not getting<br />nearly as much food as they used to, because of the decreased volume of solid food. So, both kitties end up<br />rubbing on the box the cans are in, asking for more long before we'd expect it. They just aren't getting full.<br /><br />The gravy is always a hit, but you can make ANY brand of wet food into a 'gravy feast' most of the time.<br />Just run hot water over the can before opening to loosen up the food, scoop a spoonful or two into their dishes,<br />then add a little bit of hot water to the can after you spoon out the food, and stir up all the bits from the edges<br />of the can to make a little more gravy. This works with packets too - scoop the food, add a little very hot water,<br />stir or shake them, then pour over the food. (There is actually a lot of potential gravy in our pets' food!)<br /><br />All in all, it was my first and last time to buy the Gravy Lover's Fancy Feast.<br />There is not enough actual food in the cans, too much water content, and we ended up going through<br />the food much faster. The other brands of Fancy Feast don't seem to create this problem, so it's just<br />the decreased amount of actual solid food in this version of cans.<br /><br />If you have a cat that loves only gravy, or is a VERY light eater, these might be just right.<br />For us, it just won't work.<br /><br />One note on Fancy Feast in general - it's mostly promotion, but the cats do like it, so we still buy it.<br />You have to watch the TEXTURES carefully when buying it - the flavors don't vary all that much, but<br />they offer pat&eacute;, sliced, bits, etc. If your cat is picky about texture, you do need to read carefully to<br />see what you are getting.

My cat changes her tastes and doesn't eat the same thing week after week so I didn't want to be roped into a monthly delivery set up with this product just to keep the lower price offer.  Maybe they will reconsider!

review/summary: way better than any "goji juice" i have ever had.
review/text: So I have been drinking FreeLife Goji Juice for a month. When I read and saw the video about it being a scam I was very upset.<br /><br />I immediately did some research and came across this "Goji Concentrate". I ordered one bottle and would mix this in with water, juice, or when I was really tired take a shot or spoonful.<br /><br />This juice lasted me 3 times as long as one 32 ounce bottle of goji juice. It isn't the best tasting but for energy and curbing your appetite this concentrate works wonders!<br /><br />Since I have been drinking this concentrate I have lost 9 pounds. Not to mention my sex drive is much higher, I feel more focused than ever before, and have not been munching or eating all day like I use to.<br /><br />I would recommend this concentrate over goji juice any day. Please keep in mind why we take this Goji Concentrate. It's not for the taste but the natural benefits this brings my body, and the harmony it has brought back into my life. Thanks Extreme!

review/summary: Cooking instructions not on package????
review/text: For those of us who want to cook these noodles using traditional Japanese cooking techniques; here are the instructions:<br /><br />Traditional Cooking Instructions for Japanese Noodles: You can boil the noodles as you would any other pasta or you can use the traditional Japanese style of cooking noodles, which takes a little longer but is well worth the effort. This method is referred to as the shocking method, cold water is added to boiling water several times during the cooking process, creating a more firm, tastier noodle. For this method, place 2 quarts of cold water in a large pot, cover and bring to a boil. Remove the cover, add the noodles and stir to prevent sticking. As soon as the water comes to a boil again, add enough cold water to stop the water from boiling (about 1/2 to 2/3 cup). Bring to a boil again, and add cold water again. Repeat one or two additional times until the noodles are done. Periodically check the noodles by removing a strand and biting or cutting it in half. If the center of the noodle strand is white and the outside is darker, the noodles are not done. When the center of the noodle is the same color as the outside, and the noodles are firm yet tender to the bite they are done. Rinse Japanese noodles under cold water to prevent clumping.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Eden doesn't include the instructions on the package but they are on their website.<br /><br />Yes, I put a little peanut oil in the water and do the cool/boil 3 times over the 8 minute cooking time.  I made my own Tsuyu sauce because it's much less expensive than the prepared suace and easy enough to do.  The recipe is simple:<br /><br />3 cups dashi (bonito and konbu (kelp))<br />1 cup dark soy<br />1 cup mirin (or sake with 3/4 cup sugar)<br /><br />It lasts for months in the refrigerator.<br /><br />Enjoy...

review/summary: Works for me--if you add olive oil to the water! And rinse!
review/text: Originally, I felt the same way the other reviewer did about these, but then my boyfriend told me to add about a tablespoon of oil to the water (maybe a little more) as they were cooking and they weren't all clumpy and sticky anymore.  They work great for me as I can't eat gluten and brown rice pasta seems to raise my blood sugar more than I'd like. The corn in quinoa pasta is out for me too! Allergies.  This is a perfect alternative so I'd highly recommend it.  It tastes good in stir fries and with tomato sauce!<br /><br />Update: Oddly, I did the oil thing and they still got clumpy this past time.  We discovered if you rinse them with water while they are in the strainer, as soon as you take them out of the pot, they separate and are perfectly normal again.  Hope this helps!

review/summary: Highest-Quality Soba Noodles in the U.S.
review/text: OK guys, what we have here is a basic misunderstanding about how Japanese buckwheat noodles differ from semolina pasta. This was my favorite food when I lived in Japan, so let me tell you how it's done. The cloudy boiling water means it's high quality soba. Eden is right about adding cold water, but only keep cooking it until it's al dente--sometimes three repetitions is too long. When the soba is done, SAVE a cup or two of the cloudy boiling water for a special treat later. Drain the soba noodles and rinse them. Then, and this is critical, soak them in a bowl of ice water for 3 minutes until they're nicely chilled.<br /><br />Japanese people do not stir-fry their soba noodles, as far as I can tell, so if you want to go that route you're on your own. The Japanese tend to eat all their noodles wet. Soba is often in hot soup, but the best way in the summer is to use a dipping sauce. You can buy one from an Asian market (I like Yamaki brand). Sometimes you're meant to dilute the dipping sauce by half or a third with water. Into the dipping sauce grate some radish, slice some scallions, and put a dab of wasabi paste. Mix it up. Then pick up a small clump of soba noodles, put them in your dipping sauce, and then slurp some of those noodles up into your mouth. Make sure that you take in air as you slurp and don't suck too tightly or the noodles will fly up and hit you in the eye! Repeat.<br /><br />When you've finished your noodles, pour some of the left over boiling water into your dipping sauce. Mix and drink! It's healthy and delicious and all the best restaurants do it. Itadakimashou!

review/summary: just rinse with cold water and it unclumps
review/text: As another poster said, the trick is to just rinse with cold water after cooking. Then the noodles separate and are very tasty.<br /><br />For one serving: I just break the noodles in half (or smaller pieces, just take a bunch and break all at once) to fit into about 1 cup or so of hot water (heated in the microwave), then heat on high uncovered for about 4 min, check to see if it needs a little more zap time (or just leave it for a few more minutes in the hot water). I have a low power microwave (500 W), you will need to experiment. Then rinse with cold water in a collander, and add whatever you want. Then you can warm it up again for a hot dish.<br /><br />The same technique can be used for any kind of pasta, just don't try pure semolina wheat - it disintegrates. A mix with durum wheat or any whole grain pasta of any kind works well. Be careful not to overcook corn pasta, though. Some rice pastas are short-cooking, but Pastariso or Lundgren rice pastas cook longer like any wheat/kamut/spelt pasta. Corn and rice pasta need the cold rinse approach, others might not.

review/text: Great source of carbs and good for the circulatory system.  Being pure buckwheat they will clump together until you rinse them.  I think they are much better this way for variety if you have the unrelated traditional wheat already in your diet elsewhere.  I always eat these plain right after cooking and rinsing them and I could not be happier.

review/text: I am gluten intolerant. Most soba noodles have a blend of buckwheat (no gluten) and wheat (lottsa gluten) - at least those that I've found in our local stores, and I've checked a few. There may be more g-f soba noodles available now; that's changing in leaps and bounds. These soba noodles are great. Cook up just like they're supposed to, taste great and I know they are safe for me to eat. I am enjoying a nice serving of soy-free miso (look up South River Organic Miso - Amazon carries it, too) with gluten-free soba noodles for dinner. I don't think you can go wrong.

You'll notice that the cooking water becomes very murky while cooking it too, and so maybe the noodles are just too starchy.<br /><br />I will never buy these noodles again, but they get 2 stars just because I love this company and their approach to food.

Luckily it comes in two packages, and the unopened one seems to be sealed well. Still, I plan on vacuum packing the packages between refills to help keep the flavor fresh.<br /><br />I can tell you this: I'll never again buy cheap pepper.

It tastes really good, It's not too sweet, it's similar to those little vanilla tootsie rolls in my opinion. It's also very easy to work with and to cover a cake was unbelievable easy, especially for a person like me who never worked with fondant before! I bought the Fondarific in Teal but since I wanted to add ribbons and bows, I used some green food dye to make the fondant a different color from the teal. It turned out wonderfully!

No complaints when I can get them delivered for about a BUCK Fifty a box. They're really yummy and moist.<br /><br />Psst...IF you can live without topping, using your favorite BOX cake mix:<br />In a Mircrowaveable dish or Mug take 6 measured Tablespoons of cake mix + 5 Tablespoons of Water. THEN Mix well. Microwave for 55 seconds on HIGH. Check for doneness at center, I not quite done zap it again for 10 second intervals until done. Then enjoy with a spoon :)

review/text: I purchased this when it was on sale and was not expecting it to be that good.  Folgers coffee has never been my favorite.  Boy was I surprised!  It was excellent. Smooth not too strong.  Did not have that typical bitter, acidic aftertaste that I usually get from most store bought coffee. I would definitely buy this coffee again.

review/text: I was so happy to find that Amazon had this product. I had been purchasing it at a local grocery store and retail store for  my husband, but both of these businesses stop carrying it. I ordered my first 3 pack box and am thrilled with the freshness and the quickness of my order.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I have to admit that I'm a Crystal Light addict. I've probably tried every flavor they make. For a sugar-free product, it has a bold, great taste, and I don't notice an aftertaste from the sugar substitute either. Pink Lemonade is my favorite flavor because I find many of the fruit flavored ones are a little too sweet for my taste. My second favorite is the cranberry flavored Crystal Light and my third favorite is the orange flavored one (these two not yet offered by amazon as of this writing).<br /><br />As well as being an excellent drink on its own, as an added bonus for those who are dieting but still like to imbibe, Crystal Light is a great alternative to the high-sugar, high-calorie drink mixers. The pink lemonade works in any drinks recipe calling for lemonade, the orange is great in a Tequila Sunrise, and the cranberry is great for a vodka & cranberry.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />Anne K.

review/text: I have this thing for Crystal Light Pink Lemonade.  I love it.  I realize that it's fake "stuff" but it gets me to drink more water which is a big plus.  I love that sweet-tart flavor.<br /><br />I picked up 2 of these 6 packs because the price was too good to pass up.  Now the price is more than double of what I paid.  I will certainly continue to buy Crystal Light Lemonades but not at the current price.<br /><br />Oddly, other than the yellow/regular lemonade, and plain tea (none of that fruity stuff, thank you very much), I do not like the other Crystal Light flavors. We all have our own favorites.

review/text: Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies taste like the delicious oatmeal raisin cookies my mother made when I was a little girl growing up in the 1950s and `60s. But Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies had something my mother's cookies did not--a hint of spices and nuttiness, and zero trans fat. As a kid, I didn't know or care anything about trans fat. But my father and I, afraid we would never get my mother's homemade cookies again, didn't dare tell her we could taste the difference the Archway secret seasonings made.<br /><br />My mother learned her recipe from her mother, my grandmother, who had learned the recipe from her mother, my great-grandmother, which my great-grandmother retrieved from the back of a 1920s oatmeal cereal box, altered over many years to satisfy their own tastes.<br /><br />When my mother began working and had no time left for baking cookies, she bought different brands of oatmeal raisin cookies for my father and me to try until we agreed that the taste, consistency and appearance of Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies came closest to her homemade oatmeal raisin cookies. Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies have a delicate golden color, traditional rich spicy aroma, old-fashioned wholesome flavor, gentle sweetness of natural brown sugar, and freshness with that just-out-of-the-oven moist tender texture.<br /><br />My mother served her oatmeal raisin cookies and, later, Archway Classic Soft Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, with a cup of hot, honey-sweetened tea in winter or a chilled glass of the same or lemonade in summer.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XMK6Y">Archway Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, 9.25 oz</a>

review/text: Like the other reviewer mentioned mine were also expired but I would think they have an extremely long shelf and they still taste awesome. I'm so glad that Amazon has just the sour because all the stores sell the punch with the sour. I have tried all flavors but the sours are the best. Favorite mix is a blue and purple. Almost as good as a DQ slushie if you have them mix blue raspberry and purple (easy on the purple). Every time I order from Amazon they always show 2 in stock so I hope it stays that way until I'm 92 or so. On the down side, they do make your fingers sticky so you get a sticky keyboard, sticky game controller, etc. and if you push the gushers up from the package without touching you don't get to choose which flavors to eat. Maybe this next batch I will dump all of them in a huge bowl and use chopsticks (not really but tempting tho).

review/summary: Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!
review/text: These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!

review/summary: Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
review/text: These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!

review/text: I love these Blue Diamond Almond snacks and I particularly like the bold flavors.  This flavor is very good and the smoky BBQ taste just sets off the flavor of the crunchy almond that it coats.  I like an evening snack while I read a book and these for me are just so much better than chips and other snack foods.  It gives you a chance to snack but still eat healthy.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat.  You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones.  I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 7% of your daily intake of sodium and if you are on a salt restricted diet then make sure to watch your salt intake.  The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away.<br /><br />This is a very good product and I recommend it to you!

review/summary: Crunchy almond treat with a sassy Jalapeno kick!
review/text: Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!
