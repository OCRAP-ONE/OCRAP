Well I have purchases the last of Merrick Senior and now I must find another food with low fat, low protein and vegetable to fit my loving Bernese Mountain Dog needs.  Merrick products for Senior was an excellent dog food.  Well balance, with just the right mixture of fresh chicken and vegetable mixed into their dry dog food.  Merrick please take my advise and return to the orginal recipe.

review/text: I love the Einkorn pasta in general and this is easy for me to just have it shipped in bulk to my house. I make a whole box at a time, toss it with olive oil and salt for keeping. I can parcel it out and add it to pesto, marinara or any sauce for lunches. The flavor is really nice, it is NOT Gluten free... how could anyone think that about this pasta?

review/summary: Very tasty, kids loved it
review/text: After reading Wheat Belly, I was convinced to eliminate grains from my diet.  My kids, not so much.  I wasn't really convinced by the book that the older forms of wheat would be that harmful as he didn't have much science to back it up.  Modern wheat, definitely, but for me the jury is still out on the older forms.  So I decided to try this.  We really liked it.  The texture is a bit firmer than the whole wheat spaghetti we used to eat (Ronzinni I think), but the taste is spot on.  The kids devoured it.  We've been grain free for about 2 months now and had no reaction to it (but to be fair, I didn't have any problems with wheat before I gave it up), so we'll probably have this every week or two to keep the kids from revolting at the dinner table.

review/summary: Pricey But Excellent
review/text: I found this Einkorn spaghetti to be very good tasting. Its consistency is like regular whole wheat but I found that I preferred it cooked between 8 and 9 minutes rather than the recommended 10. I felt that 10 minutes made the noodles too soft for my taste. I really like the idea of a food without genetically modified contents so, even though this spaghetti is rather expensive, I plan to continue buying it. I was not able to find any in my local Whole Foods store so it looks like I will also be buying it from Amazon in the future. If it wasn't so expensive I would have given it 5 stars.

review/text: This pasta is everything a pasta should be. Its healthy, whole, has great flavor unlike the wall paper paste we usually call pasta. It has body, holds up to the flavors of sauces and is worth every penny. It is real food.<br />It doesn't have the off flavors some whole wheat pastas have and I had no problems with digestion. Some whole wheat products bother my stomach.<br />You do have to cook it a bit longer. Not a big deal its delicious. Try it!

review/summary: Takes some sdjusting
review/text: I was really looking forward to this Einkorn spaghetti. I'm trying to totally eliminate "modern" FrankenWheat from my diet. It's toxic.<br />So, like it or not, I'm switching  to gluten-free and Einkorn products.<br />The spaghetti is quite dark in color- sort of a nut brown.<br />I live a t 8,000 ft, so it needs to cook longer than the ten minutes in the directions.<br />Even after SEVENTEEN MINUTES, it still does not behave like the spaghetti I have eaten for decades. Your mileage may vary. In my kitchen, it has way more "body" than traditional wheat spaghetti. I can't wind it around my fork as I'm accustomed to doing. It never becomes "limp" enough to do that. Does anyone know of a "spaghetti fork" that will easily pick up these noodles?<br />I like the taste! I like the fact that it's not made of toxic "modern" wheat.<br />I can get used to the unfamiliar behavior of this new product, and I thank the manufacturer for making it.

review/summary: Best Energy Drink Out There!!!!
review/text: I like to think of my self as a energy drink connoisseur. I drink quite a few different ones and seen this at a bar in Lincoln NE. I tried it with Jager and without and it is amazing. The said they special order it and there is no where around here that carries it. Well, they weren't kidding. I've looked everywhere and nobody has it around here. It's much better than Red Bull although I do like that too. More of a fruity flavor which goes great as a mixer or if you just need a pick me up. Try it out, it's great. And with the free shipping you can't beat it. It only comes out to around $1.52 per can which is about half of what they charge for similar energy drinks at the stores.

review/summary: The best energy drink ever created
review/text: Liquid Ice is as effective as Red Bull but it tastes way better and it has a much more inviting FD&C Blue #1 color (aka toxic neon blue) to it.  This product touches almost every area of my life because it's a great pre-workout drink (it contains sucrose, dextrose and caffeine) and it mixes really well with vodka or Jagermeister.  I happen to enjoy working out and getting drunk (not at the same time), so I drink a lot of Liquid Ice.  If you generally like the feeling you get from an 8.3oz Red Bull but you hate the taste, you will fall passionately in love with Liquid Ice.  If you typically enjoy the obscene 16oz or larger Monster, Amp or Rock Star type drinks, Liquid Ice probably isn't your thing.  Either way, I highly recommend that you try Liquid Ice.  If you don't want to spring for an entire case of it, look for it at local bars.

review/summary: Bought for mixing, ended up liking it!
review/text: I bought this beverage as a mixer to make Grape Ape (Liquid Ice, grape vodka, and grenadine), and turned to Amazon since it's seemingly impossible to find locally. I was a bit afraid of ordering a case of carbonated beverages off the Internet for shipping, but the pack showed up with no leaks, dings, or issues. Beverages seemed to still be fully carbonated and just fine.<br /><br />As mentioned, I bought it as a mixer, but found that it actually makes a great energy drink on its own! I'd been drinking Monster when I needed a bit of a pick-me-up, but it often makes me feel hyper - Liquid Ice seems to make me feel more naturally alert, which can be a good thing depending on the situation.<br /><br />I'll be buying more soon!

review/text: Liquid Ice energy drink is probably one of my favorite sources of caffeinated drinks. I was looking for a cheap alternative to the popular Red-Bull, and found this on amazon. Let me tell you this, the ratings do not lie!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great tasting! (almost like candy. pretty sweet, but not too sweet. it definitely tastes better than monster and red bull. heck, its even better than soda! It would definitely be a good mixer)<br />-Great energy! (there is a decent amoung of caffeine, comparable to other popular brands. it also contains CoQ, which might be a factor in the more "focused" feeling that i get from it.<br />-Made in USA!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-none!<br /><br />TLDR: Liquid Ice is currently my favorite energy drink, based on taste and amount of energy. You will not regret buying it!

review/summary: shockenly .... it taste good
review/text: Real talk, I didn't have much hope for this can.  I bought it in a 4-pack at the $.99 store near my house for .99 so basically I got each can for a quarter!  I'm a college student and we're in our last two weeks of school so my boyfriend and I decided to go stock up on energy drinks so get us through long nights and tired morning.  I tried this one can (I won't say the name) that tasted great but was  knock off of red bull.... when that stuff died down I had a fever and felt pretty bad... didn't wanna open up another can.  NOW when I tried the liquid ice, I was shocked with the result.  The taste wasn't extremely great to me but it was good.  It actually taste like some blue slurpee soda flavor I have had from 7-11 that I can't put a finger on but with less fizz.  I didn't feel like a crack head which was important because I hate the bouncy feeling.  The last time I drake it, it got me through a "homework/study" shift of 8pm-3:30am while feeling fine.  I chose to go with energy drinks that are smaller in size because I'm kind of scared to to take something of a bigger dose and NOT be able to go to sleep.  I wouldn't take two of these straight so this  8.3 oz. is good for me.<br /><br />Alright, I wrote enough.... the end.

review/text: This energy drink is my current energy drink of choice because 1) It tastes very good. It is not too sweet or gross like some other drinks. Monster/RedBull/Rockstar all have that yucky side/after taste yet this drink tastes good like Full Throttle. 2) It Works, its an energy drink and it does its job, i havn't really paid attention to whether or not there is a crash at the end but certainly no jitters. 3) It contains no caffeine or taurine but Co-Q10 which is apparently more "natural" and healthy. 4) 8.3 ounces is a good size, i dont understand why some people enjoy 16 ounce monster/full throttles... they like to pee a lot i guess? Liquid Ice is a very good energy drink. 4) Also, its price is about average, not too expensive.

I might if I run out of choices, but in this crowded energy drink market, there isn't too much getting me to return to this soda, aside from the 8 oz cans I do love. I say, try it.

review/summary: Our Cats' Opinion?  So-So
review/text: Our three cats are enthusiastic about Pounce cat treats, so we expected them to be equally enthusiastic about Greenies.  They were not.<br /><br />They each tried three treats and then left.  Our long-haired orange male left to throw up his treats, but being a long-hair, he throws up from grooming his fur so much.  I do not necessarily attribute the vomiting to Greenies.<br /><br />I did search for menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB) as another reviewer suggested, but I did not find in my search that menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB) is a poison.  Menadione is an irritant in its pure form and irritates skin and mucous membranes, but the study I read indicated no adverse effects from menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB)in animal studies.<br /><br />We won't be buying Greenies again because of the lukewarm reception it received, but, if your cat likes it, I wouldn't worry about the menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB) it contains.  It might be a problem if that was all your cat ate, but treats are treats, not standard diets, and should be given in only small amounts.

review/text: We received a free sample of Feline Greenies in the mail today from PETCO. Our 13 indoor cats gobbled the entire 1-oz. package in less than 10 minutes. Even our finicky eaters loved them. We are very careful pet owners, double-checking every ingredient in anything that they eat (in the same way that we watch our own food). Unfortunately, I fed first and checked later (something that I have NEVER done before and will never do again)!<br /><br />Imagine my dismay when I found menadione sodium bisulfite in this product. This toxic, unapproved ingredient has no business in our pet food. Its use is prohibited in many European countries, and our own FDA won't approve it.<br /><br />We have requested that PETCO discontinue the sale of this product immediately, until the manufacturer removes this poison.<br /><br />If you love your cats, you will not feed this product to them. Just do a web search for "menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB)". You'll be a better cat owner, that's for sure . . .

A year ago the vet said that her teeth were covered in plaque and that she should have them cleaned in the following few weeks.  I ended up getting particularly busy, and while I felt guilty about it I never did get the cleaning appointment scheduled.  This year, after a year of a few treats every day, the vet said she had great teeth and wouldn't need them cleaned for at least another few years.  Not sure how much the Greenies contributed - but I'm certainly not complaining!

review/text: LOL.  "Imagine my dismay" ... OK.<br /><br />First of all, this product is intended as a treat, not a meal.  A little candy now and then isn't going to kill anyone.<br /><br />I agree, the ingredients could be better.  I am not a fan of the corn or gluten -- especially as I make a point to feed my cat nothing but grain-free raw food.  Greenies could choose better ingredients - such as potatoes, perhaps instead of corn & gluten - to hold their product together.  It doesn't contain by-products, though, and the first ingredient is chicken meal, so it's not *terrible*.  I wouldn't feed this product if it were a meal.  But it's a treat.  A little won't hurt.  Unless your cat is allergic to corn or gluten (as many are) -- then stay away from this product!<br /><br />The serving size is outrageous.  I don't feed my cat more than 5 a day.  That's plenty.<br /><br />I have yet to see if it actually does anything for my cat's teeth.  Remove tartar?  Doubtful.  These little kibble-bits break together with a little force from my fingers - they won't likely scrape off years of tartar build-up.<br /><br />I've heard great things, though, and they come highly recommended from my vet.  The whole reason I got them was because of the dental benefits -- these came listed as the #1 choice among all other "dental treats".<br /><br />It took awhile to get my cat to crunch down on these, but eventually he did.  It's funny, after feeding your cat raw, they tend to forget that kibble is food - which it barely is.  That's why it's a treat.

review/text: This candy is one of my favorites.  Nice and soft, easy to chew, and has the right about of sourness.  Weighed the candy and exactly 6.6lbs, nice and fresh from Amazon.  Only thing you need to watch out for is eating too many at a time because it will exfoliate your tongue (and then your tongue will hurt).  I prefer these over sour patch kids.

Buyers beware if your concerned where your dog treats are made.<br /><br />Reading the smokehouse home page the following statement says nothing about duck treats so I figured they are safe and made in the USA.<br /><br />"Smokehouse makes the vast majority of our treats at our plant in Sun Valley, Ca. but we do import some of our chicken treats from China. All imported chicken treats are extensively tested here in the United States by an independent laboratory. No product is shipped out until all lab test are back. In the many years we have been importing and testing these products nothing has ever been found that could be harmful to our pets."<br /><br />I received my package of duck treats, opened them up to feed my dog while telling my friends I ordered these from amazon because they were not made in china and looked at the back of the package and saw the three dreaded words  MADE IN CHINA.

review/summary: Best way to buy Duck Chips
review/text: My German Shepherd has food allergies and cannot eat chicken, rice or carrots. It seems all dog treats have one or more of these ingredients so I was very happy to find Smokehouse brand duck chips. But then the pet store discontinued carrying this item. I called the company and was told I could order on Amazon.com. This is the best way to buy Duck Chips. I don't even have to leave the house, the package is delivered promptly to my door and my dog is very happy. You can trust Smokehouse for quality products and Amazon for quality service.

review/text: One, which I believe is the best part, is that this product is produced in the US, not in another country.  After all that has happened to the animal industry with food, health, etc., we need to be more intuned with purchasing products outside the US.  The US seems to have stricter regulations.  The dogs just love the treats even finicky dogs and does not cause stomach upset.

review/summary: My Cats Liked Them
review/text: Got these for free as a promotional gift from The Whole Healthy Pet. Originally was a bit surprised and disappointed that they shipped something marked "dog treat" along with an order for my cats. After examining the package and determining that there were no harmful grains or vegetables added to the treats I decided that they were cat safe anyway and handed them over.<br /><br />They were initially very interested in the treats but the large round size was way too much for them and they quickly grew tired of them after just a lick. Once I broke them apart for them though, it was a whole 'nother story! The cats couldn't get enough of them, have been begging for them ever since they finished the package in fact! And since these are made out of raw chicken and very little else, there's no need to worry about handing them over whenever they want some totally unlike the unhealthy but highly addictive treats you can pick up almost anywhere.<br /><br />They're a little expensive, so I only grab some for special occasions but that only means even the cats are happy when the holidays roll around and they both feel truly pampered on their birthdays!

You cannot see them because they are within the kiss. These are chunks that are not ground up like their terrific bags of "freeze-dried safe raw food". When I broke the kisses apart for my 5 lb dog, there were pieces of these tendons/ligaments that were hard, some long and one of them actually sharp. I believe it could have easily pierced or choked my dog! If you break them apart, it will be fine, but under no circumstances, in my opinion, should these be fed to a smaller dog who could suffer some severe consequences from the contents of these "kisses"!

review/summary: Not as advertised
review/text: I really liked the original recipe and couldn't find this stuff in any local stores.  Original label (as pictured here) reads "Cajun seasoning, great for chicken" and ingredients are: "Salt, Spices (Including Red Pepper), Paprika, Garlic, Onion, and Silicon Dioxide (Added to Make Free Flowing)".  Since that is what was listed on the Amazon page I placed an order.<br /><br />Well the label and the ingredients have changed.  The label now reads "Perfect Pinch Cajun, natural, no MSG" and ingredients are now: "Salt, spices (including black pepper, thyme, and red pepper), paprika, garlic, onion, and celery seed."  While I'm happy the ingredients are still all natural, the celery seed and black pepper really throw both the taste and smell off.<br /><br />The Amazon listing does include a legal disclaimer stating: "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website", but I really wish the description matched the product sold.<br /><br />So before anyone else buys six jars of this stuff, beware, you are not going to get the product as described.

review/text: Amazon only sent me one of them.  They did work with me to make up for their mistake, though.<br /><br />This bombilla is made of relatively light-weight but strong stainless steel and is easy to clean.  That's about all there is good about it.  It might work okay with large-cut leaf-only yerba (like Eco-Teas) or yerba/teas with very little powder and only larger stems, if any.  In my experience it does not work well with yerba with a lot of powder and/or finely-cut leaves & stems.  Perhaps my pull through the straw is too aggressive, but I would end up with a fair amount of fine leaves/stems in my mouth, at least until the yerba settled into the mate after a few cycles.<br /><br />I guess you get what you pay for, except I thought I was buying two and received only one.  Buyer beware of possible disappointment on two levels.

review/summary: My all-time favorite bagel-chips.
review/text: I've tried a few varieties of Bagel chips, and by far, this is my favorite.  Most bagel chips use mini-bagels, cut horizontally.  You can tell because of the hole in the center.  Bagels are typically seasoned on the outside, sliced, then baked as chips.  If you get a chip that is close to the exterior of the bagel chances are good that you will get the seasoning (usually too much).  If you get an interior chip you will likely get too little seasoning (if any).  Some brands season the chips after they are cooked as well, which almost guarantees that you'll get far too much seasoning.<br /><br />Stacy's starts with regular, whole bagels; the same high-quality bagels that you will find on a supermarket or baker's sehlf.  Because these are sliced vertically, you get round chips that are all seasoned correctly on the outside ring.  Each chip is round and perfect for dipping or spreading.  I love regular bagels toasted with cream cheese, which is also good with Stacy's bagel chips.  However, these are good enough to warrant more creativity.  Try them with hummus, salsa, melted cheese--use your imagination.<br /><br />Yes, this is the same Stacy's that makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY">Stacy's Pita Chips</a>.  All of Stacy's products are very high quality.  If you are a fan of everything bagels, you will love these.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ2AZ0">Simply Naked Bagel Chips</a> are similar to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY">Simply Naked Pita Chips</a>--simple, and delicious with dip. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ3XKG">Everything Bagel Chips</a> are standard everything bagels, covered on the outside with seeds, onion, and garlic.  These are my favorite out of all the Stacy's bagel offerings.  If you like a bit of seasoning and don't like all of the extras, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P8FUXA">Toasted Garlic Bagel Chips</a> (I like these, but I miss the extras of the everything chips).

review/summary: Best snack ever made
review/text: These are better than homemade bagel chips and my new favorite snack. So glad these are on Amazon because they are sometimes hard to find in my area and when found rather pricey. The price on Amazon is competitive, with Subscribe & Save it can't be beat. Warning: it takes a lot of willpower not to eat a bag each day, they are that good.

review/summary: Cookies for those Who Will Swallow Anything
review/text: Cookies as health food? Who could have imagined it? These sweet wonders contain as much fiber as a bowl of oatmeal, as much Vitamin A as a glass of tomato juice, and as much Vitamin D and calcium as an 8 ounce glass of milk. And that's only the beginning, for the Whonu cookies also are sources of B12, and Vitamins C and E. With three grams of fiber and "a total of 20 essential vitamins and minerals"  three cookies would seem to be a great start to the day, and six cookies should be even better, offering twice as much fiber and nutrition.<br /><br />Munch on these cookies with a sprinkling of caveat emptor. In addition to all the good stuff, three cookies also provide 170 calories and six grams of fat. Eat six cookies, like I am apt to do and you've consumed 340 calories, 24 grams of sugar,  and 12 grams of fat.<br /><br />The Whonu bakers invite us to compare their cookies with the other leading cookies. Yes, the Whonu cookies have the edge in added vitamins, but it's pretty much a wash otherwise. Three Oreo golden cookies hold 160 calories and seven grams of fat - less calories but one gram more fat than the Whonu enriched cookies.<br /><br />Conclusion - I found the Whonu cookies quite tasty, so tasty that I had a difficult time limiting myself to only three cookies per snackfest. Despite the vitamin fortification, and the low sodium content, don't confuse these sweet confections with an apple or a bowl of oatmeal.

review/summary: Great tasting cookies!
review/text: I guess I will swallow anything according to the other reviewer?  Good to know.  Anyway, this review is based on taste only, not nutritional value or any of the other qualities or selling points of these cookies.  This is for those who are looking for a cookie because they want a cookie not vitamins or fiber or whatever.  I bought them because I have a sweet tooth and wanted some cookies and these were on sale plus I had a coupon.  I purchased the crispy cookies, the vanilla sandwich cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies.  I thought they were all very good and would not hesitate to buy them again. I found these cookies to taste very good, similar to a golden oreo which is one of my favorite cookies!  So if they ever go on sale for a reasonable price and you have a hankering for a vanilla sandwich cookie, try a box!  You might like them too.

review/text: These are really delcious! In fact, I'm eating one at the moment. These cookies are great because i don't feel as guilty when eating one over an oreo. But remember! It is always safe to eat this like you were eating dessert (sparingly) because even though these cookies are some what nutriotious they are no apple. They are perfect as a little treat to jump start your day or a nice suprise for lunch. Overall, AWESOME

review/summary: The Best of the WhoNu Cookies
review/text: Of course that is subjective, but, for myself and my family, we all agree that the vanilla sandwich WhoNu cookies are the best of all their varieties.  We've tried them all and this is the only one that we get on a regular basis.  They taste the most like a normal cookie, with a pleasant sweet vanilla taste, but not sickeningly sweet like most store-bought cookies.  Plus they have the benefit of some added nutrients.  They are still a cookie, so you can't really eat a bunch of them anyway.  But I feel better eating these than say, an Oreo.  The other WhoNu cookies tend to taste like "health cookies"...not all that great.  This one is the closest to a "regular cookie".

review/summary: Organic Darjeeling best with Organic Sucanat
review/text: "Sitting on the porch of a bungalow on a tea plantation in Darjeeling, you can see the peaks of Everest and Kanchenjunga as you sip a cup of this exquisite brew. Life is good." ~tea packet<br /><br />If you want a subtle tea with a smooth, soothing flavor, then Darjeeling is an excellent choice. The slightly floral flavor is much milder than an Earl Grey. I especially love this blend when eating a Caramel Apple Cobbler Clif Bar. For some reason, the flavors mingle nicely. I think it is the slightly nutty flavor of the Darjeeling.<br /><br />While many of the Tazo teas are blends of a variety of teas, this tea is purely a blend of Organic Black Darjeeling teas. The tea is grown near India's border with Bhutan. There are only "true Darjeeling" tea leaves in this tea.<br /><br />This tea is just perfect when blended with an Organic Sucanat: Natural Sugar Cane. You might also want to try using "milk powder" instead of cold milk with your tea. I find it helps to keep the tea strength and adds a creamy element to the smoothness of this tea.<br /><br />Darjeeling is a very satisfying blend for morning tea. You might also enjoy AWAKE and Earl Grey if you enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I just love the packaging of the Tazo Teas. The individual wrappings have a nice crinkly sound and the colors are all so soothing and quite beautiful. These teas are definitely for the aesthetically aware. Drinking Tazo teas literally becomes a magical experience. There is something mysterious going on here. The teas even seem to have a magical glint or luster to them. When you drink Tazo teas the world looks more beautiful and you feel much more aware of life itself. I find that my creativity soars after drinking Tazo teas.<br /><br />For more information on the mysteries of Tazo Tea, read the review for the Tazo Assorted Teas.<br /><br />For a calming experience try the Tazo Calm Herbal Infusion which is perfect for quiet evenings, after completing a yoga workout or just to sip on while you write in<br />your journal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Golden Retriever No Longer Itchy
review/text: I was persuaded into upgrading the quality of our dogs' food by friends that own Golden Retrievers.  Our golden was always itching/chewing at his skin, typical for the breed, but friends said they switched there dog over to gluten free no filler dog food and saw a big difference in their dogs' itchiness.  I found this food at a local independent dog store. I am not a "holistic" person, I do believe in eating well-balanced meals and exercising regularly, but not a lot of the fluff that the "holistic" crowds go for.  I have to say though after a month and a half my golden is not itching any more.  I am so happy with this line of dog food, I won't ever go back to purina.  Also because there are no fillers in this food you actually feed them less, so although it cost more it lasts a little longer, which helps cushion the difference in price.

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: Are you considering buying these?  Let me save you the $13 you are about to waste and describe the experience that awaits you:<br /><br />When the shipment arrives and you open the box, you are greeted by the chemical aroma of recently cast plastics and low-quality paint.  As you pull each of the three artificial bonsai plants from the box, you quickly realize why the product photo is provided at such low resolution above.  You've seen better artificial plants at the dollar store.  The foliage is poorly cast plastic, NOT silk, and although three varieties are provided, their identical coloring and artificial luster spoil any illusion of plant life, even from a distance.  They look even tackier if placed in proximity to one another, as they share an identical casting of a uniquely shaped trunk and root assembly.  Viewing them from above reveals a ridiculous root structure that terminates well above the soil layer rather than sinking into it.  Viewing them from below reveals the large plastic bulbs connecting the foliage and trunk sections.  Lifting them reveals that the pot is not ceramic as you had hoped, but rather light-weight plastic that's been painted black.  Setting them down again reveals that the paint was so poorly applied that it's now been transferred to your fingertips.<br /><br />Staring at them in disappointment, you breathe a sigh of relief (and unpleasant chemical aroma) because you ordered them on Amazon, so you can at least return them for free.  But wait -- you bought them ON Amazon, but not FROM Amazon.  You bought them from a different seller, who is not only planning to deduct the cost of return shipping from your refund, no, they are about to charge for the cost of shipping it to you in the first place.  Remember, that so-called 'free' shipping?  If only you had read the fine print!

review/summary: Excellent Product--mixes well, tastes great, so easy to use
review/text: I'm lazy. I've bought tons of green tea products over the years, but if I have to heat the water, mix the leaves (or bags), etc, wait for it to cool or pour over ice, I tend to flake and just reach for whatever ready-to-drink bottled or canned sort of beverage is handy, super-healthful or not.<br /><br />This solves my tea-sloth issues. Small foil packet that opens easily via a notch. Mix with water. Voila, a really nice cup of tea you can heat in the nuker if you like, or just go with it iced (or room temp) like I do.<br /><br />The tastes is very fresh, no bitterness (like I can get with making hot tea, cause I'm a tea idiot apparently). It mixes so well (no big clumps). Totally a quality product.<br /><br />I ordered three boxes the first time (August 12, 2008). I'm gonna order even more now, though I still have some left, just to have in stock in my pantry.<br /><br />Not only do I love this as a refreshing beverage (that can be punctuated with lime or lemon, or splashed with a healthful ounce or so of blueberry, cherry, acai, or pomegranate juice), but I started using it as my pre-workout caffeine punch. And know what: It works. Having this 35-40 minutes or so prior to my Pilates hour-long session makes me put in some extra effort so I'm wonderfully sore in the core the next day from the boost of energy.<br /><br />This is unsweetened (a plus), so you can sweeten it to your heart's delight, with honey or stevia or, if you're watching calories, Splenda or Equal. And, hey, yeah, sugar works, if you swing that sucrose way. And though I have a sweet tooth, I've been drinking this unsweetened. It really tastes so...greenly refreshing.<br /><br />Totally love this tea mix. I wish amazon carried it in their amazon prime catalog of products so I could get it with "free" 2 day shipping. Still, my experience with this supplier was great. No worries.<br /><br />Mir

review/text: I can't get enough of this tea! I take a packet with me to the office everyday.<br />This is not like those instant teas. These are whole green tea leaves that have been ground into powder.

review/summary: Great powdered green tea!
review/text: This isn't a green tea that you'll normally see in the US outside of a high-end Japanese restaurant on the west coast.<br /><br />It's powdered tea (matcha) made from unfermented leaves. My wife and I really love it, though I must admit that I haven't bought it from this vendor. I used to get it from the local Japanese grocer, but they have some supply problems and don't always or regularly have it. I may be buying some now that my supply is gone!

review/summary: Great for Smoothies
review/text: I've been on a health kick lately, and i pour in a packet of green tea into every smoothie i make....makes me feel healthier....but honestly, i have no idea if this brand is better or healthier than any other...all i know is that it tastes great mixed with cold water, and it's really convenient for making smoothies. Am i healthier for drinking a packet each day? I surely hope so, but who the heck knows...

review/summary: Great for Ice Blended Drinks!
review/text: Forced to master ice blended green tea drinks at home after moving to rural NC, I tried this green tea mix.  It works and tastes great!  The thing is, I moved from Los Angeles where I was never more than a mile from fabulous ice blended green tea drinks at Starbucks or my favorite, the Coffee Bean.  This stuff blends super easily, though I didn't particularly care for it mixed only with water.<br /><br />W a teaspoon of sugar, a few ice cubes, a cup of either soy or rice milk, and the press of my blender's "Liquify" setting, my ice blended green tea drink craving is satisfied.  Last night I even ordered some gourmet coffee syrups for further experimentation.  I am Super picky about my big city luxuries - I have the Coffee Bean and my fave wine store ship their goods here and drive 120 miles to get clean meat.  But w this mix and my blender, I do not feel like I've had to give up anything, except the $4 or $5 a pop at the coffee shops.<br /><br />W this Yamamotoyama mix as a starter, I'm looking forward to sitting beneath my magnolia trees, yummy blended green tea drink in hand, all summer long.  This is a totally worthwhile product for those of you wanting to make ice blended green tea drinks at home.

review/summary: powder core
review/text: These are very sour once you break open the gum .. inside is a sour powder that once disolved quickly loses its sourness.  you are left with little flavor gum.  Not bad for the price I guess and the sour is very intense for a very short burst. I just wish the gum itself had more flavor to last past the burst of sour that came from the inside of gumball.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: At the recommendation of my sister, I ordered this product through Amazon and got it within two days on the Prime program.  I Got two bags for less than one I had previous purchased at Wal-Mart.  I am loving it.  This is a great product to mix with smoothies for colon health.  It really does work for me especially the price.

review/summary: Superb quality flax seeds
review/text: I bought this item based on health reasons, reviews of the product here and all the great information on the internet about the benefits of adding flax seeds to my daily diet.  I also bought a mini coffee grinder just for this product.  At first I tried to chew it, ugh... it takes a lot of hard work, I felt like a cow chewing cud and the flavor is extremely, uh... earthy.  So instead I ground it up in my new coffee grinder and added it to yogurt, YUM... the earthy flavor is gone and a nutty wholesomeness is added to my yogurt.  I add it to everything and it makes a great addition to my healthy diet.  The seeds look fresh, clean and healthy.  They almost looked too perfect with a nice shiny shell.  The freshly ground meal smells very clean and definitely has a nice nutty bite.  There is about more or less a year on the expiration date on the package that I received.  I would recommend this specific product to anyone who wants to add a bit of health to their daily diet.  I'll more likely than not be ordering more of this stuff in the near future at the rate that I've been chowing down on it.

review/summary: Soothing Evening Tea
review/text: I purchased a floral sample pack from Enjoyingtea and this was one of the samples included.  I didn't mix the tea with any other blends as it was wonderful enjoyed as is.  In fact of the six teas included it was my favorite- a light sweet flavor and a wonderful aroma.<br />You don't need to get too fancy with your tea strainer since the flowers are too large to pass through the holes of a tea pot.  Of course the flowers could be added directly to a cup of tea and removed with a spoon if you lacked a strainer or tea pot.<br />Despite my frequent use the sample pack lasted me quite a bit.  A wonderful purchase for any floral tea fan (or tea drinker looking for something that won't keep them up!).

review/summary: the best rose bud tea
review/text: This is by far the best culinary rose bud I have found - absolutely wonderful scent and flavor.  I mix with many of my other favorite teas, and it is especially good with lavender blossoms as a night time tea.  Also nice with Prince of Wales tea for breakfast.

review/summary: Adequate
review/text: I purchased these rose petals for culinary purposes, to flavor tea infusions.  I felt this product wasn't bad, but not amazing.  I am a tea enthusiast and have considerable knowledge and experience with a wide range of teas, and have had better experiences with dried rose buds/petals.  The product's title and description indicated there would be rose BUDS, but I received only petals - not really what I was expecting, and had I known the description were inaccurate I would have passed on the purchase.  I've found rose buds offer a milder taste than rose petals, so the difference is something to be considered if you're familiar with the nuances between the two.  These petals in particular had a spicier taste than what I was looking for, though they do succeed in providing rose flavor.  I find that they're good when mixed with a straight-cut white tea and can last for two steepings before the flavor noticeably diminishes.  Personally, I favor mixing rose buds with oolong tea, but I find that flavor these petals yield isn't hardy enough to last multiple steepings with a darker tea - I tend to add an extra spoonful of them when making darker infusions.<br /><br />I think that for general needs (mine are admittedly specific), this product is adequate - I personally won't purchase them again, though I do plan on using the rest of my bag.

review/text: My daughter loves these. We did get doubles, but that was fine. They come in a bag and not package as shown (as others have stated), but honestly it wasn't a huge concern as they were still brand new.
