review/text: I like many of Amys foods. LOVE her Golden Lentil. This one is very tasty! I add a dash of Cajun spice & Jonnys just to add more spice & a few crumbled triscuits to really kick it up! Yes I reccomend! For those who feel its too bland...Just add some more spices, if its too spicy then perhaps try the mild. Thanks Amys for making some great stuff & Amazon for making it more affordable for us!

review/summary: Bland
review/text: I'm a vegetarian, and generally a fan of Amy's stuff, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G18NSE">Amy's Organic Medium Chili with Vegetables, 14.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> tasted bland to me. I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant of spices. I usually get the medium salsa in the store, for example. A little extra seasoning helped, and I got out the mildly spicy chips to go with it.<br /><br />Although I didn't think it was spicy enough, it certainly was easy to make (heat it up), and it was a healthy alternative to the food I normally fix when I am in a hurry. I think I will try the spicy version of it instead.

Dummy me, I didn't look close enough at the can so I didn't realize it was Vegan. But, really, when it says "Chili, WITH VEGETABLES", why would I assume it was ALL vegetable?<br /><br />In any case, I would have expected a good vegan chili to make me not even notice the lack of meat in the chili. I just found it predominantly bland.

review/summary: Very Disappointed
review/text: Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes. It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored "cake". I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment. After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient. At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes. High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have. One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.<br /><br />I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.

We had a blast until our jaws couldn't take it any more, and we all had gum in our "feathered" hair (it was the '70s after all) what I learned that night was Bubble Yum was the superior bubble gum. And now a days, it comes sugar (and guilt) free! Can't beat that!

review/summary: Buy it for the can
review/text: A generic energy drink with the iconic "Flaming Moe" logo. The cans are, well, cans. The logo is done well, and it's sure to illicit a giggle from any fan of The Simpsons series, especially those who were around during the third season in which the "Flaming Moe's" episode aired. The drink itself is as generic as they come. Tastes sort of like Red Bull, but leans more towards the Monster energy drinks, being sweeter and having flavorings. It certainly doesn't taste bad, but the point of these cans isn't really to drink them, but to have them as collector's items. So, in that respect, I guess it doesn't really matter what they taste like.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you have the money to spend on a superfluous collector's item and you love The Simpsons and/or have a few friends that are fans, then this is a decent buy.

Sure enough, next time we went, there it was. In addition, two of the containers had an expiration in two weeks! All in all, the shipping costs make this a big ripoff. Get it at Wegman's.

review/text: I actually haven't purchased the package on this page, but I did recently acquire a three pack of Mishima's hot and sour soup mix, so I thought I'd leave a review. The person who called it liquid pepper must have gotten a bad batch or something, because there's much more here than just pepper. Dried tofu, mushrooms, and green onions, to name a few things. If you like hot and sour soup, get yourself some of this. It's glorious!<br /><br />If you think it's too spicy, you can always add either more water or, perhaps a bit less practically, extra ingredients like fresh tofu, meat, noodles and beansprouts. I highly recommend this soup powder.

review/summary: Worst instant soup I've ever had
review/text: This soup is horrible.  Nothing at all like Chinese restaurant hot and sour soup.  It is thin, has a funny taste, and isn't sour at all.  I couldn't eat it when prepared as directed.  I had to doctor it up by thickening it with cornstarch, adding sesame oil, adding some thin strips of wood ear mushroom and seaweed, and stirring in some beaten egg.  I had to add more white pepper and vinegar.  At $2.99 a package, that's $1 per serving.  What a waste of money.  I can go across the street to my little whole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant and get 1.5 pints of their soup for $1.89.  This horrible product doesn't even deserve the one-star rating I gave it.

review/summary: The taste... well it may take some creativity
review/text: As far as taste, what can we ask for? Plain with milk it's only passable. But heck, it's a hemp protein. Now there are ways of making it taste better and it's a nutritious product. Not too shabby is adding about a half of a decent sized frozen banana (a natural sweetener, thickener, and flavoring) to 8 oz of milk (I use organic fat free milk) to 3 tablespoons of the product. This tasted pretty good, and I would have no problem drinking it like this every day. So what I am saying is that for products like these that don't taste like a Steak and Shake milkshake or a Wendy's Frosty, one would need to experiment to find something that is suitable as far as taste to the consumer. I did think about giving four stars for taste, but it's not god awful and can be gotten around with a little creativity. Plus we are dealing with hemp here so I don't think it would be fair. This is the first hemp protein I have tried so maybe there are better tasting ones out there. However, since I like the way I made it above with the banana and may be able to find other good tasting concoctions, I may be just running risk and find something worse by seeking elsewhere. If I were to stick with this one, and I may, the bottom line then becomes final price. I am not a pure vegan although I do restrict meat intake and usually stick to salmon and chicken breasts when I do eat meat. So I use a supplement like this to fill in days when I don't get enough protein from animal products. I won't eat soy protein, trace amounts notwithstanding, and I would not put Splenda or sucralose (poison) in my system so I needed an alternative protein shake/smoothy. All the regular good tasting standard bodybuilding proteins use sucralose to sweeten them. Well, the ones I like and have used anyway. Even these latter mentioned ones that have the best relative taste, don't taste like an unhealthy milkshake anyway.<br /><br />Update 3/14/2012: Ok this is how I drink it now, and I love it. 8 oz of Pacific Brand organic oat non-dairy beverage (any kind of milk such as hemp, almond, or soy can be used), 1 medium banana, 1/2 cup of raw organic oatmeal (we buy this in the bulk section at Whole Foods), 4 tablespoons of this Hemp Protein, 1 packet of Sweet Leaf Stevia. This is my breakfast every other day. One can add a tablespoon of organic freshly ground (at the store which make it nothing but ground nuts) nut butter if you are not too worried about fat. To me the oatmeal really makes it great.

review/text: I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn't taste like much.  The organic cocoa powder doesn't seem to mix well, and the hemp...well, it's hemp, got a funny taste to it -- though nowhere near as intense and malodorous as that emanating from the company's Hemp Pro 70 line!  Anywhere, this one is okay.  If you want a plant-based protein from what seems to be a "progressive" company, this is probably the way to go.  Just understand that the taste is at best tolerable, even with cocoa powder and sugar among the ingredients!  That's how awful hemp tastes....

review/summary: Manitoba Dark Chocolate Hemp Powder
review/text: This is very grainy and chalky like most other hemp powders I've tried. The taste is fine ( I like chocolate better than other flavors) but I also mix it with vanilla hemp milk, coconut milk, chocolate milk, or whatever else I feel like adding that morning. Tastes don't bother me as much as textures do so if you're like me then the grainy/chalky feel of this is going to be too much on it's own. I have to mix it up with the Nutiva brand hemp powder to smooth it out a little and make it stretch (because Nutiva is more expensive) but is the best that I've had so far.<br /><br />This is pretty much what I was expecting though and you have to remember it is a HEALTH shake and it isn't going to taste fantastic but you can do a lot to alter it more to your liking. If I actually used a real blender and added fruit and honey and some things like that to it the graininess could probably be cut down but I'm lazy and don't have time in the mornings to do that and I'm fine with what I do.

review/summary: Awful tasting protein partially masked by rich chocolate - 4x as expensive as rice protein alternatives
review/text: As an omnivore with a 100-200 gram daily protein intake, I am always looking to diversify my protein sources.  For protein supplements, I find the best value at Costco when purchasing Cytosport whey protein that costs approximately 2.2 cents per gram of protein.  Yet, it gets boring eating from the same six pound bag for months.  So, I recently evaluated two vegetable-based protein supplements: Nutribiotic Rice Protein and Manitoba Harvest Hemp Protein, both with chocolate flavoring.  While the Rice protein has great economics, tastes fantastic and contains few carbs, this hemp protein fails in all three categories.<br /><br />When I initially tasted Manitoba Harvest Hemp Protein, the first thought that came into my mind was "is this product really suitable for human consumption!?"  Olfactory memories from large-scale grass cutting arose.  Even with the rich dark chocolate, I can't consume this protein straight or even mixed with milk.  The pungent taste needs to be blunted with large amounts of cinnamon and Splenda and/or mixing with high protein cereals such as Kashi or Special K.<br /><br />Another undesirable aspect of this protein includes the large amount of carbohydrates:  2.1 grams for every gram of protein. The economics are underwhelming as well.  It costs about 10.8 cents per gram of protein versus 2.7 cents per gram for the Nutribiotic Rice protein or 2.2 cents per gram of protein for the Cytosport offering at Costco.<br /><br />Cons<br />Terrible taste<br />High carb content<br />Poor economics<br /><br /> Pros<br />Rich dark chocolate flavoring

I also ordered a different flavor at the same time from the same company, and that box was also missing a pouch. So in total, I was screwed out of 2 pouches of gum. I didn't bother sending the product back or complaining because let's face it, the trouble wasn't worth the $2 that the gum was worth. But still, kind of disappointing that someone would steal from their customer.

review/summary: Grape Flavor is the BEST
review/text: I'm reviewing after reading someone's "one" star rating.. I couldn't disagree anymore... It's INCREDIBLE!  Everyone always says "grape is best" - Adults and kids love it!<br /><br />Don't buy multiple quantities of something you've never tried before... Try it at your local candy store first(it's hard to find) and if you like it, then buy multiple packs and enjoy!  Watermelon flavor is good too.

review/summary: One man's grape is another man's garbage
review/text: Ok I have to weigh in here as this is already becoming a contentious discussion.  I am speaking as one of the few people who is legally permitted to be in the presence of children AND enjoys the flavor of Groundball Grape.  Rather than staunchly defending my own predilections, I must say that I have some truly bizarre tastes when it comes to food and sweets in particular.  As a child, I once broke the seal on a bottle of that horrible pink candy-medicine and drank the gooey nectar simply because I found it tasty.  I have bought 1lb bags of fine dinner mints with the intent of sole consumption, and also enjoy orange circus peanuts.  In my adult years, I have been known to eat tacos for breakfast and dunk razor-shaved slices of salami into milkshakes, a la chips n' dip.<br /><br />It is I, dear readers who enjoys the tangy, tart, unfavorably robust and chemical flavor of Ground Ball Grape.  I defend my enjoyment of it as a matter of personal taste, but would never even suggest it as a preference of others. If we are a member of this minority and wish to maintain strong opinions of such a personal nature, we must recognize not only the futility of defending our untenable position, but that it is wrong to do so.  To even imply that anybody 'should' enjoy this flavor is to betray one's own position.  By the very nature of the thing, it is absurd to like this disgusting gum.  Anyone who says that Groundball Grape is a 'good' flavor, or that it should be a 'well liked' flavor is defining themselves as a madman in the eyes of society.  Any opinions held are the product of sheer lunacy.  One must accept that the very fact of liking this flavor is unusual, and exhibit nothing but sympathy for those who despise it.  Members such as CP should be supported and consoled, and should be reconciled with their families, in time.

review/text: I gave Grape Big League Chew to my dog.  He couldn't stand it and spit it out and decided his time was better spent licking himself.  He does however love the original BLC flavor and chews it often.  He even has bubble blowing contests with the rest of the neighborhood dogs.  Overall, grape gum is for sissies.<br /><br />The End.

review/summary: Great product with terrible flavor, potential trip-ruiner
review/text: My extended family and I went on a trip to visit baseball stadiums and thought "What better way to get in the baseball mood than by picking up some Big League Chew and having it at the games!"<br /><br />Well,what was to be a great weekend was ultimately ruined when we found out I had accidentally purchased the Ground Ball Grape flavor.  For those not familiar it tastes like some horrible medicine meant to cure fun.  We tried to put up a brave front and make a game out of who can actually keep giant wads of the awful gum in their mouth for the longest time, but our record sadly hovered around 45 seconds.  Of the three bags we purchased, one and a half were completely wasted and we couldn't even GIVE them away.<br /><br />Lesson learned: be wary of what flavors you pick lest you create an impassable rift in your family relationships and get banned from all future trips.

review/summary: Very good sesame seed after toasting
review/text: I followed the review of other customers to buy this product. It turned out to be very good. First time I toasted too over and wasted a lot. Right now I will just toast on the furnace surface for about 1min until there is some smoke and smell coming out. It tastes quite good after toasting. But do not overcook, it can ruin the sesame and it can taste quite bitter.

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper.

review/text: I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

These 2 purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money.  The meat was so dry I was not sure if I was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey.  The "meat" caused sickness and lock jaw.  Jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes.  It was pretty incredible of them to sponser the WSOP but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price.

review/summary: Great snack....even during battle!!
review/text: I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!

review/text: I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.

review/text: Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.

I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind. I am all for natural products that they enjoy!

review/summary: Great product but the subscription ships old products.
review/text: I love this beef jerky and so I looked everywhere for it, and had trouble finding it readily. So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again.

review/summary: MOLD on Jerky!!!
review/text: I bought eight packs. Seven of those, I hope, were in good condition. One of them looks darker and has mold on it. I didn't notice that after I ate two pieces... That was disgusting!! It says on the package the jerky will be good until 2013. I guess the company is wrong.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon CS. After 5 minute they decides to give me refund. This is probably all that Amazon can do, but I will not buy any kind of food/snacks on Amazon anymore. And I will not buy any Jack Links product on line or in store. Their quality control is really doubtable.<br /><br />MOLD ON JERKY!! Be aware!

review/summary: DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT Eeeeew
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SIY3O2">Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>This order took five days to deliver and this is Florida with high humidity and high heat. Upon receipt I opened each package because I always place in my fridge in gallon zip locks. I ordered two of the mega two-packs and three of the four were fine. The fourth was FULL of mold which was visible through the packaging. I am seriously disappointed (and grossed-out). No returns/exchanges means I will NEVER purchase foods items from Amazon again.<br /><br />Update: After figuring out a way to contact Customer Service despite their policy of no returns on food items, they credited back 1/4 of total purchase price and offered free next day shipping for this item (which I will not use). Never again.

I haven't had this stuff in a long long time but decided to purchase some.<br /><br />Most of the jerky was good, but I ran into 1 too many pieces that was fatty or felt like a salty chunk of fat. I wish I would've gotten pieces or a bag without any of it considering this is pretty damn expensive stuff, but it is good.<br /><br />They definitely need to work on quality control if they want to keep the prices so high for this stuff, or I might have to go to a different brand.

review/summary: Best ever
review/text: I buy a lot of stuff online and only write a review if something was very good or very bad.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that Jack Link's Jerky is the best jerky I have ever eaten (I've even bought some from a meat market before).  I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have "turned on to" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet.

review/summary: By Far The Best Jack Links!
review/text: I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.<br /><br />This is the best deal I've found by far, select delivery 1 time a month for 16 bucks and sit back and wait for your jerky!<br /><br />Now on to the flavor, I usually buy the peppered Jack Links for the touch of spice.  Recently I found the A1 steak jerky, and its fantastic!  It seems like its more dry, like the homemade jerky I remember from my grandparents.  I find the most of the flavors to be to moist, and salty.<br /><br />If your a fan of jerky, and the taste of A1 sauce, you will enjoy this product, use amazons subscription option and save another 15%, excellent deal when compared to store purchasing.

I like beef jerky and Jack Link's especially, just not this flavor.<br /><br />Anyone who is a health nut may not like this because it's loaded with MSG, though I think most beef jerky is.

Way too sweet, doesn't taste like meat, and most of the pieces don't have the texture of meat.  At times, I thought I was eating plastic.  Or some soy meat-substitute.  I couldn't even make it through the whole bag.  I miss the original Pemmican..., before ConAgra sold the brand and it got ruined...

review/text: One of the most disgusting experiences of my life!  Pulled the package out, opened it without looking at it, and smelled something indescribably gross.  Looked through package window, and what was left of my jerky could not even be identified as jerky.  It was white yet covered with mold.  Couldn't see any evidence of a hole in the packaging.  It came in a 2-pack, and the 2nd pack looks fine but has the same date stamp on it, so I'm not sure I dare eat it.  They expire in December of 2013...14 months away.  I'm not sure what happened to it, just that I wasted $10, and I'm still nauseous just thinking about the sight and smell of it.  Is jerky even supposed to spoil at all?

review/summary: Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy
review/text: I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.

review/summary: Pretty Damn Good Jerky
review/text: I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.

review/summary: The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category'
review/text: The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.  I've tried the Jalepeno brand but, it is not as 'hot' as the Peppered brand -but I still make room for both.<br /><br />Again back to the price... it's on the high side.  Which compels me to eventually research more about making my own beef jerky and then make it closer to what I'm looking for - scorching hot!  Something that includes cayenne, habaneros and the like for a taste to remember!

review/summary: Good solid jerky for frequent eaters
review/text: I order this jerky every two weeks on subscription because it is tasty and fits the wallet, too. I like various tastes in other brands from time to time. However, this jerky is the main taste that satisfies the jerky need.

review/summary: If you like Jerky this is the best deal I could find
review/text: I know its not the healthiest snack, but there's nothing as satisfying as a nice quality piece of jerky.  It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.<br /><br />I have order this double package in both Original and Teriyaki, and is the best price I have found when you figure it down to a per oz price.  It's even cheaper if you add it as a "subscription" to be shipped every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months...which you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />One other use I have for this is an extra special treat for my dog.<br /><br />Anyway, this is always high quality jerky.  Only negative is these large backs end up with a bunch of small crumbled shavings in the bottom--guess what then gets poured onto a plate for my dog!!!

review/summary: Over priced but good flavor
review/text: I would like to see this a few bucks less then it seems like it would be more inline with the value.  At least I can save some money and buy it on the internet  instead of at the store. This is also the best flavor based on the other ones I have tried.  in their line-up. I have tried several of them, and this is the best. As long as I can keep getting this flavor, I will keep sticking choices. This is the best beef Jerky I have ever had. I have been eatting it for years now, and another positive is that it is made in Wisconsin. My only wish is that you could buy this stuff in better quanitity discounts. The small bags are nice for day trips, but it would nice to be able to buy in larger bags for additional discounts.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: Pepper adds a nice kick to beef jerky, and Jack Link makes a nice line of beef jerky. Some of the slices are a bit thin and tough, so personally I like the peppered jerky that is sold at Aldi's grocery stores, but if you don't have an Aldi's in your area, Jack Link's makes a good product, with a nice jerky/peppery taste. Yum.
