review/summary: Don't discredit because of the name!
review/text: As others have mentioned this is an oily bean.  The roast is quite dark.  I use the bean for espresso and I love the flavor.  Not bitter and not acidic.  I think it doesn't seem like much on first sip but the after taste is nice and lingering.

review/summary: Good coffee, excellent size
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee (typically 3-5 cups in the morning) so I go through a lot of beans in short time. I also like dark roasts with lots of flavor. Kicking Horse solves two problems for me a) the bag is really big b) it has a really deep flavor that I really like.

review/summary: Wonderful Aroma, Deliciously Dark!
review/text: Just the aroma alone was so intensely delicious you could practically wake up on the fumes! I take it with about 1/2 tsp sugar per 5/6oz cup and this was dark and flavorful without crossing the line into that burnt roast variety (yuk!) My husband drinks espresso with a bit of sugar and he liked it, too. (We also enjoy medium roasts, so enjoy good coffee all around!)<br /><br />We have a 5-year-old automatic Saeco machine and it works great in this (our grind setting is 4, changed to 5 but I can't tell the difference.) The package has all kinds of instructions and precautions on how important grind size, water, machine cleanliness and amount of coffee grinds makes a difference, so if you're not happy with the first cup, be fair and try another with different amounts of water or coffee. :)

review/text: Definately a very high quality taste.  I used it with Cabot vintage choice chedder and it was to die for!  I have used that same cheese with other unsmoked pepperoni sticks and the taste just wasn't the same.  The product is not greasy, and was fairly easy to peel.  Not only do I reccomend this product, but I do recommend it with the same cheese as both flavors are great together.

review/text: We had banned KoolAid in our house because of the problems with spilled drinks. The stains especially from the red and purple colored drinks would not come out of carpeting and cost a bundle to remove. The "invisible KoolAid" was available for a very short time in grocery stores. Then I could not find it anywhere until Amazon.com started carrying it. I wish it was available in more flavors but I buy both the cherry and the grape on a regular basis.

review/text: We move a lot and rent everywhere we go. It seems that most places we rent choose light colored carpet, even in the dining room. So Invisible kool-aid has saved us sooooo much headache from kool aid stained carpets, not to mention that we get more of our security deposit.<br />Kool-Aid had the brilliant idea to remove the artificial coloring. That is the only difference that I can tell. The flavor is the same. It is no difference in preparation, just in the appearance of the product.<br />My kids love the kool aid just the same!

review/text: Found that pre-sweetened Kool-Aid mix takes more to make 1 or 2 quart servings. Unsweetened Kool-Aid mix is easier to make,and tastes better.Presweetened container says makes 8 quarts,but I came up short of that 8 quarts. Don't pay for the sugar to be added,when you can buy it yourself & add it to your own Kool-Aid. Yes,the "Invisible" Kool-Aid flavors are impossible to find,in the unsweetened mix packets.(Raspberry,Cherry&Grape)Watermelon Kiwi can be found.

review/summary: A great finishing sauce
review/text: I bought this thinking it was way over priced, but using a few drops as a finishing sauce bringing out the flavors in the background and it goes a long way.<br />I did a side by side taste test with 3 Crab fish sauce and this is much better, as is the 40 n Red Boat.<br /> The 3 Crab is good fish sauce and I use it in large quantities, but the flavor compared to the Red Boat  and Blis is like fresh fish in salt compared to a can of anchovy paste that leaves an aftertaste.<br />This is a great finishing sauce for dressings or a few drops in a bowl of soup or even some cocktails like the Manhattan.

review/summary: My cats love this!
review/text: This is now one of the favorites for my oldest cat.  I think that she likes the soft texture, as well as the rich smell (which equates to taste for cats).  This flavor seems to agree with her, whereas the last case of Holistic Select (purple label, but I don't remember the flavor name) caused her to have positively noxious bowel movements.  The younger cat is not very picky about canned food, so of course she loves this, too.  Both of them prefer Wellness, but this is a close second.  At a price that I can afford and ingredients that I approve of (although not as good as Wellness), I consider this to be a very good value.  (Especially as long as Amazon continues to offer Super Saver Shipping on cases.)

review/summary: Burgers, Steaks, Chicken + Mccormick Montreal Seasoning = amazing
review/text: Mccormick Montreal seasoning is one of the simplest, best tasting, and versatile seasoning on the planet for virtually any meat. It's awesome on burgers and steaks, but it's also very good on chicken, vegetable kabobs, pork chops, and virtually any other meat. I mix it with soy sauce for burgers, and consistently get asked by my guests what the secret is. They can't believe it when I tell them how simple it is! I also use this in the broiler with a little olive oil with great results.<br /><br />There are few ready made seasonings that I will use when I grill (I prefer to use homemade dry rubs or marinades) and this is one of them. It is the best of the best, and I can heartily recommend it for grilling.

I cannot believe the seller is even charging almost $20 for this when you can get it for under $6 at some discount retailers. But my issue with this product is that it claims to be "Soft" Peppermint when the candy is so hard you might break your teeth biting into one. These are not the restaurant style soft mints that melt in your mouth at all. You literally have to bite into them and continue to chew them to get them to melt. If you don't mind having harder than typical soft mints than this candy does offer an OK minty aftertaste.

review/summary: Flavorful & Satisfying
review/text: It takes me about 10 to 15 minutes finish one of these small, but complex bars. Definitely satisfying.<br /><br />I took my box cautiously from my weight-loss facilitor, who warned that while most program participants loved them, some reported too close a similarity to "bird seed."  I'm squarely in the "loved them" camp.  I've tried two varieties, the organic chocolate & the goji berries. Both were lightly sweetened, barely salted & packed with flavor.  A fan of granola or other nutty bars, will find these similarly enjoyable with a longer-lasting sense of fullness following consumption.<br /><br />Sticking to a low-carb diet is significantly helped by the addition of this snack.  I use it in the mornings w/a bottle of water to get me going, and I have another in the afternoon or evening.  Great for a quick movie snack when I'm tempted by the smell of the surrounding popcorn, or at the office to build resistance to an endless parade of sweet treats.<br /><br />pros: individually wrapped, portable, filling, tasty, satifies sweet & salt cravings<br />cons: crumbles easily, relatively expensive

I understand this is because they have a very short, and relatively healthy, ingredient list; if there were more crap in there they'd probably stick together more. So, understand me when I say that they do indeed taste very good, have a decent crunch and subsequent chew to them, but at the end of the day they're not a full 5 star product. I still eat them pretty much every day though.

However, they are Gluten-free, Dairy-free & GMO-free if you're looking to rid yourself of any of the above mentioned items.  Also, they are vegetarian and possibly vegan depending on your stance on honey.<br /><br />Personally, I just wanted a snack bar that was gluten free, soy free, msg free, preservative free and tasted good.  That's what I got here!  I like the cranberry version too.<br /><br />They do fall apart when you eat them, as one other reviewer mentioned, but I never pull mine all the way out of the package so it usually catches the mess for me.

review/text: This oil is far superior to Spanish or Italian olive oils and to many Greek. A First Cold Pressing, there are no additives or preservatives so the oil has a light, clean taste. I use it extensively in salads and over pasta dishes.<br /><br />I am extremely pleased with the quality of this product.

review/summary: Most versatile olive oil.
review/text: This is by far my favourite olive oil. I used it in a restaurant i worked in, and loved it so much, i started getting it at home. It's fruity and perfect for salad dressing, bread dipping and finishing on you pasta/scrambled eggs/anything! I always cook with it too, and it's beautiful when making pestos. We go through the big tin quite quickly as we use it so liberally! It's great value at this price. GET IT.

review/summary: Iliada Extra Virgin Olive Oil
review/text: This is by far the best olive oil I've had.  I first tried it with bread in a local Italian cafe and I really liked the flavor so we asked the server for the brand name.  I don't know how to describe it, I think it's more on the fruity rather than peppery side.  I can't find it in my local grocery store, fortunately, I can get it from Amazon.

review/summary: Amazing!! Great sauce for everything!
review/text: You have to try this sauce to believe it! It starts out a little sweet with honey then your taste buds become alive with flavors of sweet onion, garlic, whiskey and a mesquite smoked flavor then just as you are analyzing all the flavors, about 20 seconds in, you get an awesome habanero kick that comes up in the back side of your mouth, that slowly rises in heat about 1 stage hotter than their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SASBCW">Sweet Whiskey Habanero</a> sauce, but is in no way overwhelming and leaves no bad taste in your mouth. Simply perfect!! I cant wait to try their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SCMUOA">Smoked Tennessee Maple</a> sauce next!

review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/text: I was fortunate enough to find "Muir Glen Organic Whole Peeled Tomato with Basil, 28-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)" from Amazon.  Initially, I had bought a couple of cans of this product at a health-food store which is almost a hundred miles away, and not close enough and convenient to drive to when I needed more. I have been making "Tomato Soup With Basil" and these tomatoes are excellent to use in the recipe and because they are  ORGANIC makes them safer and healthier for me to use. THANK YOU, Amazon! You are indeed  a "Friend In Need"!

review/summary: Excellent canned tomatoes....and organic, too.
review/text: Subscribed w/ Amazon to get these regularly and am very glad I tried them. Some of the tastiest, freshest canned tomatoes I have ever opened. At the subscribe and save price these 28 oz. cans are as cheap as one can buy them anywhere near where I live-and they come straight to my door instead of me having to go out and buy them. Great for storage, too. I do not like to run out of tomatoes or sauce so this is a big money/time saver for me. I just ordered Muir Glen's chunky sauce, too. These w/ basil have just enough basil to use them in almost any recipe w/ tomatoes. The basil can be tasted as just a hint of herb. The tomatoes are not sour nor are they sweet....tangy might be a good word. Nice, fresh, tomato taste. A bonus-beautiful red color...some canned tomatoes don't have this color! Easy to puree w/ my stick blender in about 15 sec. I think these would make good ketchup; which I plan on trying to make w/ them later. Good job by Muir Glen as to the amount of spice, IMO. A very reasonable substitute to having fresh tomatoes at hand all the time. I recommend these highly.

review/summary: Snack mix is a winner
review/text: I'll preface this with the following. I bought a bunch of these 100 Calorie Packs not because I really care that they only have 100 calories, but because most portions are way, way too huge, and I like miniature food items, or kids foods because of the smaller portion sizes.<br /><br />The Ritz snack pack is good. I took a bunch of these hiking and they were perfect. One pouch is a good snacking amount of mix. There are pretzels, mini cheese crackers, and mini ritz. The crackers are all baked, and in smaller sizes than normal. The thing that surprised me was that the mix is a little spicy. But that makes it actually taste normal, and good.<br /><br />Definitely recommend these for camping, road trips, or if you need a good snack to pack in a lunch.

review/text: I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate, but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift, I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good.

review/summary: Best Almonds and Sea Salt chocolate bar
review/text: I have tried several and this one has just the right amount of sea salt added to not distract from the chocolate, but adds to the flavor.  It is my favorite.  I have many strong favorites for dark chocolate bars, but this one seems to be the only one to get this combination right.

review/summary: Hard to find, glad it's in our local grocery!
review/text: I must warn you - it's taken me 2 years to be quick enough to get a package of this coffee.  It doesn't matter if it's Amazon or the local grocery store with a "k" - I always miss getting one before it sells out!  Then, I'm stuck with going to trader joe's and well, their's just is a bit weak for me.  Anyway, since Millstone, in my humble opinion, makes about the best cup of coffee around, I wanted one in pumpkin spice, seeing that I'm all things pumpkin.  And, what do you know?  I got to the local grocery and picked up the VERY last one (and I even had a coupon!).  The waiting didn't disappoint - the flavor is rich, smooth, and although it comes close to resembling vanilla, the pumpkin flavors come through magnificiently.  It is not too heavy on the allspice and allows the nutmeg and cinnamon to shine. It is robust, never too weak, and has enough body to be strongly highlighted when coupled with cream and sugar.  If you use a frothing machine, no kidding, it beats Starbucks!  I like to buy enough of these fall and winter coffees before they're gone just because I like to enjoy them all winter here in cold, blustery, blowing snow down your chimney, Ohio.  Hope you can grab a bag when this comes in - it's worth the wait!  Highly, highly recommend!

review/summary: Terrible!
review/text: I bought this for my two golden retrievers to share.  I took the plastic off and laid it on the lawn.  One sniffed it and walked away and the puppy licked it once then walked away.  Neither would have anything to do with it.  I had it out a few times afterwards and they wouldn't even go near it.  When I put it away in the garage, I had it on a cardboard box and there was so much grease on it that it soaked thru the box right to the floor.  Last week it went out in the garbage.  It was a waste of money.  I should have looked at the reviews and seeing two people rated it so great and it was not Amazon verified purchase they must be the seller rating it or someone from Hartz.  Don't waste your money on this and if you do, do not bring it in the house or you'll be sorry.

review/text: We were feeding our 8 year old female cat the Blue Buffalo salmon flavored (non-wilderness) and thought we'd try this for a bit. Normally she's a relatively slow eater (unless she decides she's being bulimic that day), but she gobbled up her quarter cup of this in about 10 minutes tops. She went crazy for it, and best part, it didn't upset her stomach!

review/summary: My cats love it - and they are healthier
review/text: My male cat developed what several hundred dollars of tests suggested was a food intolerance or allergy, causing a mass to form at the entrance to his stomach and resulting in him frequently barfing up the food he just ate.  Our vet recommended we try some foods that were grain free and had proteins that would be closer to what cats might ingest in the wild (i.e., no beef).  I did some research and found many anecdotal stories that praised the duck and pea combination for food intolerance issues.  We tried a couple of brands and this was the one he liked the best.  No more barfing.  The local store was out one time, so I bought a different brand - he would not eat it.  After that - it was "Hello, Amazon" where it is always in stock.  Our female cat, who before would only eat the large pieces of Science Diet Oral Care (they were no good if broken into smaller pieces - she just liked the big pieces), has switched her preference to this food, too, even though the pieces are small.

review/summary: Kitties LOVE it!
review/text: Both my cats adore this brand food in all the flavors but the duck is definitely their favorite. When I open a new bag there is much purring and pawing at the bag. My male cat has a really sensitive stomach and this food has helped keep the barfing to a minimum. This brand of food has also helped me free-feed train both my cats which at one point I had little hope of accomplishing. They enjoy eating it but for some reason with this brand they know when to stop and walk away from the bowl. Just read the ingredients to see that its really a great high quality product. I feel good knowing I'm giving them really healthy food. My only complaint is that it is no longer offered through amazon prime, but that has nothing to do with the product.

review/summary: Couldn't get the duck lover to eat this!
review/text: Of all the foods that my Persian likes, duck is by FAR his favorite.  So, since I haven't been able to find much canned these days, I saw this bag of food and thought I'd finally saved the day.  No so! He wouldn't even TRY this stuff and it sat in his bowl for over a month! No kidding, we left him alone for a day while we were swimming and he starved himself over eating this food. About had my leg taken off when I returned home too (and if you've ever seen the size of a Persian's feet, you know that that was a near amputation...). The kibble is a bit larger on this food so if you're buying it for a cat with a smaller mouth say, oh, like a Persian, then this might be an issue. But if not, then maybe you'll have better luck than I did! Thinking the size was putting him off, I actually broke some into smaller pieces.  But, it was the taste - he wouldn't even eat it out of my hand.  It's a great natural food (but the kibble looks dark green, ewww!) without animal by products, but if they won't touch it, well, guess there's nothing you can do about that. Try it - but try it at your local petsmart first because if you get a slap from your cat as you walk by, well, they'll take it back and give you something else!  Comment | Permalink

I haven't been able to find it anywhere near by, so very happy to be able to order it on Amazon!  I think this is the best catfood I've ever seen, high quality ingredients and not stuffed with fillers that aren't really good for cats.  My cat loves it and he can be a bit picky about his food.  He just wants to eat this stuff all the time!

review/text: Thanks to the diet I give her, my pup is very healthy, energetic, and beautiful.  I typically alternate between these and Greenies, and give her either one on a daily basis.  She goes bonkers when I reach for either bag of chews.  The ingredients are very well put together, and I recommend that regardless of what brand you pick, always check the ingredients.  Lots of other companies put quite a lot of filler in their chews and treats.  But not Pegetables.  Grab a pack for your pups - you and your pup will love 'em!

review/text: This is hands down the best quality Guayusa you can buy anywhere today. Rich, fresh, consistent, and not too dry or too dusty.<br />The tea has a slight nutty flavor somewhat reminiscent of Darjeeling tea, and is very tasty and grounding. It has quite a bit of caffeine, but compared to coffee it is much gentler on the body.<br />The quality of the tea is very consistent between orders - I have received 5 orders in the last 4 months and they all were very similar and consistently excellent.

review/summary: An old friend
review/text: I had the extreme pleasure of going to the Ecuadorian Amazon a few years ago. During that time, I stayed in small village named Mariposa outside of Archidona in the province of Napo. I lived with wonderful healers who everyday drank Guayusa. At the time, I had never heard of it. But it became part of our morning ritual. I found that it took my hunger pangs away and gave me alot of energy. The healer I was with was over 80 years old and had tons of energy - more than me at the age of 21.<br /><br />The indigenous people used guayusa to treat body aches and as a mouthwash. I was told it kept their teeth clean. I can attest that during my time in the Amazon, I ate less than usual but had more energy.<br />I was able to bring a small amount of the tea back with me but quickly ran out and was not able to find it anywhere else until last year.<br /><br />I was so extremely thrilled to find it for sale on Amazon. This price cannot be beat! It comes so fresh and pure.<br /><br />Upon reading up on the company how surprised was I to find that Runa, works in Archidona with members of the community that I was able to meet. They work with some members of the family that I lived with as well.<br /><br />How small a world it is.<br /><br />One tip- this tea does not produce any tannins (which create bitterness in other teas when boiled too long) so you can leave it in boiling water for a long time without degradation in flavor - its another way to extract all the goodness in the teas.<br /><br />On to my actual review of this product- I drink it almost everyday. I add a little agave to sweeten it for me. It has replaced any kind of energy drink or coffee for me. I am focused, awake and aware. I love this tea.I actually get to reuse the tea material 2 -3  times before it gets too clear and I have to use a new batch.<br />If you need a pick-me-up, try this out. I don't think you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Child Friendly Gluten Free Bread!!!!!!!
review/text: We stopped into this cute bakery on a recent trip to San Antonio where it is located.  We bought a loaf of their gluten free white bread for our 8 year old recently diagnosed with Celiacs Disease.  He loves this bread!  When I made him a grilled cheese he said it "tastes just like a real grilled cheese!"  It has a great taste and NO BITTER AFTERTASTE as is commonly the case with other gluten free breads we've tried.  Unfortunately, it is much more expensive(about $2.50 more when buying a single loaf)than the Udi's Gluten Free White Bread we usually buy at our local grocer BUT, in its defense, the loaf is much bigger than an Udi's Gluten Free White Bread loaf (my son calls Udi's toy food sized bread).  A slice of this Little Aussie Bakery White Bread is the closest in size to a regular slice of bread that we have found since he got sick.  I wish we lived in San Antonio because I would love to be able to buy him this bread exclusively but with the expensive price per loaf and expensive shipping ($9.99 for 1 loaf) we just can't afford it:(

review/text: The real plus to Lucid is that it's available in almost any liquor store in the USA.  Compared to better absinthes (any of the Jades or Absinthe Duplais by Matter are personal favorites) this one isn't that good.  It IS one of the more drinkable Absinthes, and is a good starter for someone who wants to try this iconic drink.  I usually keep a bottle of this around for Absinthe based cocktails; it's a good value for that purpose.
