review/summary: A bland but healthy and filling pick-me-up
review/text: The first cookie I had crumbled into many smaller pieces once I opened the package and the taste didn't impress me much.  I tasted oats, mocha and molasses. There was no pronounced sugar aftertaste, which many may find appealing.  The dough is chewy, but it does fall apart easily.  The second cookie the following morning tasted better as I had gotten used to the taste.<br /><br />However, the packaging allows for quick conveyance in a purse, backpack or jacket pocket which is a nice convenience for those on the go.  A single cookie is also filling enough with a cup of coffee to get one through the morning.<br /><br />So, in short, the taste is rather bland but the packaging allows for easy transport.  Just be careful when opening the package that you don't toss your cookie!<br /><br />Each cookie is 85g (60 fat calories) with 300 calories total.<br /><br />Each cookie contains whole grain oats, unbleached wheat flour, prune puree, evaporated cane juice, chocolate chunks, lecitin, water, brown rice syrup,expeller, molasses, ground espresso, vanilla extract, baking soda, cinnamon,sea salt, soy lecitin,dried egg whites, baking powder.<br /><br />I will continue to buy these for those mornings when I can't take time out to eat a decent breakfast.

review/summary: Love Baker's Breakfast Cookies-this flavor is OK
review/text: I mean what I say in the title, I always love Baker's Breakfast Cookies. On most work days I have no time for oatmeal, so I eat one of these, an Odwalla or Cliff bar or Fiber One toaster pastries. These cookies fill me up, are healthy, and really keep me satisfied til lunch.  However, this flavor is rather bland. I think it just tastes like the regular part of the cookie, no special treat of fruit or chocolate in there. I really don't taste any mocha or cappuccino flavor in it. So I would recommend Baker's but not this flavor. My favorite two are the peanut butter and the cherry chocolate chunk (seasonal).

review/summary: Awesome toddler snack!
review/text: This product is a huge hit with my almost 2 year old - it's always her first choice for snack.  I love giving it to her because it's so much more nutritious than some other choices she enjoys, like crackers. This is loaded with iron, calcium, and protein (things I'm particularly conscious of since we don't eat meat), and doesn't have any added salt.  Personally, I also like that it's non GMO.  It comes in packets that are easy to toss into my purse or her diaper bag for when we're out & about.<br /><br />I also love taking these along as a healthy snack for myself on days that I work - a good alternative to the coffee shop treats surrounding my office, especially on days when I haven't had the time to put together anything homemade to bring with me.<br /><br />The only things that would make me like this snack even more are: if it was organic (or non-certified but grown as-though), if the packets were made of a recyclable or biodegradable material, and if they sold boxes of larger quantities than 8 packets.

review/summary: Great Product- SLOW delivery
review/text: The product itself was fine- light, healthy and tasty whole beans (not crunchy like soynuts though). My real complaint was with the delivery. When I ordered this product, the web indicated that they were "In stock". And so I waited, and waited... it took two weeks for me to get the order and I have Prime Membership. I would have appreciated some prior notification from the seller but Amazon was very good about dealing with the delay once I made the initial complaint. As for the nutritional stats: 90 calories: total fat:4g; carbs: 7g 2%; fiber: 3g protein 8g; iron 10% calcium 4%. Not too bad for a convenient snack on the go.

review/summary: Unbelievably Delicious
review/text: I never imagined I'd be writing a glowing review for tea bags, but this Lemon Lift tea is FANTASTIC.  I have been a life-long tea drinker, usually plain old black tea, but decided it was time to break outta the box!  (Or bag!!)<br /><br />Finding interesting-flavored decaf tea can be a challenge, but this Bigelow Lemon Lift solved that.  I was lucky enough to find one box @ a local retailer, but when I returned to buy it again found that spot on the shelf empty. Week after week, same thing--no Lemon Lift decaf! After scouring all my local retailers with no luck, I figured I'd try Amazon.com.  Sure enuff, Amazon had it!  I purchased a pack of 6 boxes, and every nite my ritual is to brew a delicious cup before settling down with my current read.  What a nifty ending to my day.<br /><br />The special spice Bigelow uses makes a HUGE difference. If your local retailer doesn't stock this tea, Amazon does!  You won't be sorry!

review/summary: Very tasty and plentiful
review/text: The size of the bags are bigger than any I've seen when it comes to fruit snacks, the next biggest size I've seen is only about half of the size of these ones. That's a mixed thing, when I want something small to snack on - these are normally too much and I only eat half a bag. Fortunately it's not rocket science to save half a bag and they don't loose any flavor with a simple rolled up opening a day later. I normally hate anything mixed berry flavor as far as fruit juices, fruit snacks, etc - but these are the first ones I've enjoyed. I think the flavor of all 3 varieties are great and they don't have that chalky aftertaste I find in other fruit snack brands. Basically it's a very solid snack, and while it's not certainly cheap, I find it's worth the cost easily. I don't think I'll ever go back to grocery store brand name fruit snacks again.

review/text: My first review on Amazon, and It's a real downer. Ever since I walked over the the vending machine here in the office a few minutes ago and dropped my last 75-cents on Kellogg's Cherry Flavored Fruity Snacks, I felt compelled to log on to the first website I can find that sells these and give them a horrible review, and warn everyone and anyone about this poor excuse for a food product. They taste somewhat like plastic, and the "cherry flavor" is worse than the worst tasting cough medicine you can think of. These don't taste ANYTHING like fruit. These are supposed to be cherry flavored, but the word cherry appears no where in the ingredients (apple puree concentrate is the only fruit item listed), and the word "fruit" doesn't appear anywhere at all. They also pull that bait-and-switch telling you 70 calories per serving, but there's 2.5 servings in these dinky little 2.5oz bags. These are disgusting. It's been 60 minutes and I still can't get this taste out of my mouth. Next time I want something fruit flavored, I'll just eat a piece of fruit. Don't give these to your kids unless they did some horrible thing and you're planning on using these disgusting "Fruit" snacks as some form of punishment.

review/text: I used to live in Philadelphia and was a big fan of Bookbinder's, especially for their lobster bisque.  I was hoping that the canned version would bring back fond memories.  I recall the taste as being very rich and 'lobstery", with bits of real lobster. The canned version is more like what Campbell's soup might have done if they did bisque.  It's OK, not bad, but no kick or seafood flavor. I added sherry, but it justs tastes blah with sherry.

review/summary: Great Peanut Butter
review/text: --Love it.  Tastes so good, natural.  And I mean no sugar added.<br />Great supplement for any vegan diet needing additional sources of healthy protein.<br />--It's oil does not separate which is a plus.  I'm sure many of us have stirred some peanut butter up once before, that's a workout in itself.<br />--Can't see a mention a mention for "refrigerate after opening", so I'd imagine it doesn't need it.  If anybody knows please tell me.  I'll check with the company too.

review/text: Since this has no sugar, it isn't sweet, which may be an advantage to some, but not to others. But the Glycemic load is reduced, so it does benefit diabetics. Beware, as always, of the calories. The other benefit of this product is that it does not require stirring (contains rapeseed, cottonseed, and soybean oils). That's a real plus! Good quantity for the price. The taste is excellent: it tastes like peanut butter should taste.

review/text: I had never had this stuff before. It stinks, so I keep it double bagged and it's fine. When you cook it in a pan with oil, it smells much better and tastes delicious. It's really easy to use, I think it adds a lot to dishes like rice or vegetables, but it could be used with anything. It has sort of an onion-like flavor, but way better. I'll never go without this spice again.

review/summary: The commonest hing
review/text: Unfortunately, this is the only asafoetida (hing) that is readily available in the US. It is preground and mixed with edible adulterants to make it easier to handle. Unfortunately, due to this processing, the quality is not high. While it will certainly work for your recipe, it is nowhere as good as the chunks of pure sap that are harder to find in the US. Search out the good stuff if you know a reputable spice merchant.<br /><br />If you're in NYC, I've found better quality hing at Dual Specialty Store in the East Village. It's still not as good as the super stinky chunks of Afghani asafoetida that I picked up in Varanasi, but it will do.

review/summary: Magical, if a little smelly.
review/text: Asafoetida is sometimes called "Devil's Dung," and the name is appropriate (and explains why "foetid" is a part of its proper name).  If you're not prepared for the use and storage of this product, you may be surprised by just how pungent and vivid the smell is--but the flavor it lends your curries and other dishes is totally worth the exposure.  As the Asafoetida interacts with butter or fat, the odor disappears and the flavors really come out to play.<br /><br />The only downside about this product is that the container is somewhat difficult to open.  I actually cut a new hole in the plastic in order to get the product out, and even when I re-sealed the container the smell permeated the whole kitchen.  I ended up resolving this issue by sealing the container within a second--glass-container.  Glass seals the smell in and saves you the embarrassment of having to explain to your housemates why the house reeks of something devilish.

review/summary: Not exactly a substitute for garlic and onion
review/text: I am allergic to garlic and onion, among other things, and found this product after researching on the web for substitutes, as I am tired of bland food!  Articles I read suggested this spice as an alternative, particularly for garlic.  They warned that it was very pungent, and lessened so during cooking.  They weren't kidding!  I had to double zip lock bag them, even in their containers, to tone down the smell!<br /><br />Product arrived on time, but the containers are almost impossible to open, so plan on destroying them and putting the product into something else.  They do add nice flavor, but it is distinctly Indian, so for me, doesn't mesh well with, say, Italian dishes.  I loveIndian food, though, and look forward to finding recipes that I can use this spice in.

review/summary: Great Peanut Spread!
review/text: This is an awesome peanut spread. I'm on a very limited diet (HCG) so it is just wonderful to find something I can have and that still is sweet, yummy, and satisfies my cravings.<br />The texture of this is not like other regular peanut butters. It is smoother, kinda like spreading cream cheese instead of peanut butter. But the taste is amazing! I had this on celery and it was just delightful.I love the fact that it has actual raisins in it, I love the flavor, and I love that it is a totally free food. No guilt! As I LOOOOVE peanut butter, this really helps. :)<br />If it's this awesome on just celery, it must be beyond words on bread. I just can't have any carbs right now...But whatever it takes to fight the bulge. Thank you Walden Farms for giving us an outlet!

review/summary: Simply the Best Fiber cereal, period
review/text: I've tried just about every "fiber" cereal on the market, and this is the only one that is all natural and offers a ton of fiber.  All of the "commercial" brands of fiber cereal are loaded with artificial ingredients.  Read the label on this one, there are only a couple ingredients and they are easily identifiable.<br /><br />The flavor of this product is excellent.  They also make it without the cinnamon, but the cinnamon definitely "makes" this product, and also may help control your blood sugar.<br /><br />I usually eat this with another cereal mixed in, but it is quite edible on its own.  I just don't need 25 grams of fiber first thing in the morning.<br /><br />You could also use this cereal as a fiber supplement and eat a small amount periodically through the day.

review/summary: Little whiskbroom pellets
review/text: Even the dog wouldn't eat this. Seriously. I wanted something healthy, free of corn syrup, MSG, soy this-and-that, and all those multisyllabic mystery ingredients that only the FDA could love. This cereal gains a star for that. The ingredients are "Wheat Bran, Whole Grain Corn Flour, Whole Grain Wheat Flour, Corn Bran, Cinnamon". (The nutrition panel does mention that the cereal is produced in a facility that also handles soy, dairy, and tree nuts.) But there's got to be something natural that can be added to pick up the flavor a bit. As it is, it tastes like pressed sawdust. Any cinnamon included is so subtle as to not be noticeable. Nature gives us fiber in flavorful packages - vegetables and fruits. If fiber is the main goal, there are tastier ways to get it.<br /><br />The texture is pretty much pressed sawdust too. There's got to be a way to at least make it texturally interesting. The drab color is fine, that means the product has no artificial food dyes. I don't care so much about visual appeal but it is a little disconcerting opening a box and seeing contents that are formed like snail pellets.<br /><br />With a name like "Simply Fiber" the appeal is going to be for old folks seeking the grail of an expeditious digestive system. The absence of typical ingredients may also appeal to those who find themselves allergic to many processed foods. My interest was more in just the general "healthy" appeal.<br /><br />To give the manufacturer their due, it's probable that some of nature's flavoring agents might not last long on the shelf. Next thing you know there's the temptation to dump in a bunch of preservatives, and that's not necessarily a good trade-off. You know how breakfast cereals typically liven up the front of the box by populating the cereal bowl with colorful fruits or berries? In this case I think it's not just decorative, it's a good idea. Reasonably expect the cereal to be a little dull, and compensate by slicing in some strawberries, blueberries or bananas.<br /><br />On the bright side, this is only 100 calories to a 3/4 cup serving, according to the side panel. That serving packs 14g of fiber. At first bite I was tempted to toss the box but I'll probably keep it on hand and toss a baggie of this stuff in with my lunch for that hand-to-mouth grazing a person does for a mid-morning snack. That's certainly less fattening than what passes for granola.<br /><br />In sum, the product isn't calorie-heavy and it will appeal to aging boomers with digestive issues. It may also be a product of choice for those with certain allergies.

Now it indicates processed in a facility that handles peanuts and other nuts.<br /><br />So anyone with peanut or tree nut allergy no longer can eat this.  I emailed them back then and they told me they put it on there "just in case".  I just emailed again today and am awaiting their reply.<br /><br />It is a bummer, great product but no longer safe to eat.

Packaging was as expected (four 1lb packages) which is handy when you think I am likely to keep using these for most of their several year lifespan (six pounds of mung beans is a lot of batches of sprouts).  I bought so many because it was only twice the price of buying one pound and dried beans do keep well.<br /><br />The first batch was soaked overnight last night and it looks as if most of the beans have sprouted, with their tiny root just poking through the split hulls.  The volume is about twice original, so everything is looking good.<br /><br />Will update when I am further along with them.

review/summary: Gotta keep this on your pantry shelf
review/text: Although we're not Asian, we have considered this a staple in our household for years. Recipes using Jufran's typically earn raves, though people can rarely believe the sauce is made out of bananas. It has a sweet and spicy taste with the texture of catsup/ketchup but not as sweet. Recommendations: use it as a sauce for your favorite brisket; baste ribs or a pork tenderloin with it.

review/summary: Higher Price,  Very little Taste!
review/text: I love cheese straws!  Anytime I can find them, I usually buy them.  I found these Archer Chedder Cheese Straws in Target, for around #2.90 and bought two boxes.  Cheese straws are usually pricey (going for around $5.99 a box), so I tried these and the taste was okay.<br /><br />Fast forward about 9 months and I picked up another two boxes, this time for around $3.15 each.  They will definitely go back to Target because they're tasteless!  Very mushy, with only a tiny bit of cheese taste and no noticable spices at all.<br /><br />Very disappointing.<br /><br />In this case, you do NOT get what you pay for.  A bag of chips would be a better deal than this Archer product.  I'd rather have one box of cheesy, spicy cheese straws than two boxes of this dog food.

Damn this yeast went straight to zero residual sugar.

review/summary: Low Sugar - No Artificial Sugar
review/text: We eat healthy.  That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda.  By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns.  Enter Honest Kids!  Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like.  Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out).  I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners.  Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down.  In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade.  When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor.  Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in.  At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/text: I bought these at the grocery and was pretty pumped... organic juice boxes! Sweet. Well, not really. They are pretty watered down. After slurping on one, I flipped the grape over - 10% juice. Water and cane sugar top the list of ingredients. Pretty tasteless and I feel like a bit of a sham. I can flavor my glass of water with a spritz of grape or berry. (Beware the Berry Berry Lemonade flavor is 5% juice). I will go back to Apple and Eve (60% fruit and veggie juice) or Juicy Juice (100%, though possibly from China) until I find a better organic juice box.

Not restaurant quality but for about $3 a box it easily meets expectations.<br />Additionally the sodium level is not bad by comparison to other microwaveable quick meals. 820 mg for the box (2 x 410mg a serving) compares favorably to healthy canned/microwavable soup options out there.

review/summary: not as good as the other taste of thai noodles, but not bad either
review/text: I bought these for variety mainly.  Both the peanut and coconut ginger flavours are strong favourites, though it's nice to mix it up once in awhile.  I have to agree with the other reviewers that this tastes nothing of curry and is a bit on the bland side, but I wouldn't go so extreme as to say it tastes like trash.  It does smell of fish, which, if you aren't used to, may be offputting.  It is much healthier and tastier than common ramen noodles, but there are better flavours out there.  I wouldn't recommend this particular flavour to anyone who's trying taste of thai noodle for the first time.

review/summary: Noodles, yes but Thai red curry this is NOT!
review/text: I have had red curry in many places, both in the US and abroad and this is nothing like the real thing.  There is hardly any curry or coconut flavors, and in fact it tastes more like pine sap than anything else.  I followed the stove top directions (cooking food in cardboard seems weird to me) and was slightly put off by the aromas.  They weren't horrible, but didn't smell like curry either.  At first bite, my heart sank.  I was expecting a rich, tongue-wrenchingly spicy red curry, and all I got was an artificially thickened, oddly pine needle tasting and not very spicy concoction.  There are much better choices if you want easy, microwaveable lunches.

review/summary: Taste of Thai Red Curry Noodles
review/text: These noodles are quick, covenient and very tasty. They're nicely spiced with more zing than most packaged foods, although if you're a big fan of hotness, you might want to add a touch of hot pepper sauce. They taste surprisingly good for being pre-packaged, but they do lack the rich complexity of fresh Thai food. If you had a bit of fresh Thai basil to add, that would be a perfect touch.<br /><br />There are two drawbacks to this "meal". The first is the lack of vegetables or protein. I like to mix in some cooked veggies and crumbled tofu after the meal is cooked. There's plenty of sauce to go around, and I think it improves the flavour as well as the nutritional profile. However, you can't do that at work, so if you're going for all-in-one convenience, be prepared for a yummy dish that is lacking in some nutrition.<br /><br />The other drawback is the high sodium content, typical of packaged meals. I don't have a problem with salt, so I'm fine eating this once in awhile. However, my husband has salt-sensitive high blood pressure and has to limit himself to a few bites of mine.

It produces a good amount of noodles as well, so this is a faily substantial snack and almost a full meal.<br /><br />Preparation hints: break all the noodles in half before adding them so they fit better, and make sure the cup of water you add is as hot as possible. The other flavors are all excellent as well, but I think this one is the spiciest of them all.

review/text: I just bought 1 box at Walmart last night and was SO excited to try it today. The sauce kinda scared me, as it was gelatinous and smelled like "fishy" fish. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to see that it LOOKED very appetizing once it was fully cooked and poured onto a plate. That is where it ended--the food tasted absolutely dreadful. I am an avid curry fan, and have tried MANY different styles.....none resembled this one and none ever tasted so bad. I can't even describe it, but I would say a cross between cardboard and old fish with a hint of coconut and spice. I stuck with it for about 6-7 bites and had to throw it out:-(<br />Oh well, back to WW SmartOnes for now....
