review/summary: vino italiano red
review/text: These wine kits are great! I have made most of the reds,and have really enjoyed them.I do however tweak them just a little,and offer the following suggestions to make them really good.First use quality water [not from the tap], make 5 gallons instead of 6,I use red star yeast [it's only .99,and works better] or use a yeast nutrient along with your standard yeast included, and finally I always add a condioner at bottling. The cost is only a few dollars more,but the quality must better. All in all these are great kits both my freinds and family have enjoyed and I will definitly keep buying.

review/summary: Rosso Magnifico - Excellent Wine at 5 Gallons!
review/text: I am not sure if I would still consider myself a beginner, anymore, but I am relatively new to this.  Only making wine for a little over a year... In the past year, however, I made about 11 kits from different manufactures.<br /><br />This wine, Tuscany Rosso Magnifico, is quite fantastic.  I made it at 5 gallons by putting in all of the juice concentrate, but only re-constituting with water up to the 5 gallon mark.  I also added 30 Grams of Oak Chips.  Now, I personally don't like a lot of oak in a wine.  For that reason, I don't like many commercial wines...  30 Grams of Oak is enough not to actually taste excessive oak, but have a better mouth feel.  I got the oak from a home brew close to where I live.  Medium Toasted Oak.  Again, it is just my opinion, but less is more with the oak... You should trust your tongue, and not worry about what others say.  You can always add more oak, you can't take it away...<br /><br />I put the oak in the carboy for the secondary fermentation.  Not in the bucket.  I learned that from copying a Mosti Mondale kit.  Some kits but oak dust in the primary...  So far, I have had good luck with the oak chips in the secondary.<br /><br />The wine does taste much better, if you let it sit in the bottle 6 months after you bottle it.  But, you will most likely not be able to wait that long....  Put 3 or 4 bottles away to age, if you can't wait for the whole batch...<br /><br />To learn about the process, I learned everything I know from looking at the videos on the finevinewines.com website.  It may be helpful if you never did it, to look at the process and once you see it, you will be confident that you can do it...  You can also look to youtube for a few good demonstrations...<br /><br />You will need some equipment to do this, but you don't need more than a beginner equipment kit to be successful.  Once you do it, you will be hooked...  I typically do two or three at a time... At the time of this writing, I am doing WE Nero D'Avalo, WE Chocolate Raspberry Port, Vino Italiano Merlot.  When I get a free carboy, I will do the Rosso Magnifico again.  Mrs.Claus got  it to me for Christmas.<br /><br />By the way, everyone who has tried my Rosso Magnifico loves it...<br /><br />See what I mean.  You will get hooked...<br /><br />I hope this review helps some of you out there.<br /><br />Cheers!

review/summary: Age is our friend
review/text: I bought this kit, not sorry but just a little surprised at the outcome.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good wine kit.  I just expected more flavor when it was "done".  I did discover that a little while in the bottle was a good thing.  I put this as "it's ok" by my taste but have to admit those who I have given it to love it.  I used the directions, and have to admit the bottle I opened after a 3 month rest was quite different, and good.  It's a good wine for the price, but let it mellow. It gets deeper with age.  You can't go wrong with this one, bottle it up and hatch it out at your next grill.

review/summary: A Good Red Table Wine
review/text: This turned out to be a surprisingly good red table wine.  I have made 12 wine kits this year, and at 3 months after bottling, the Tuscany Rosso was the best of them.<br /><br />Most of the other kits I made were 2 or 3 times more expensive.  Those wines may turn out to be better after 6 to 24 months of aging, but at 3 months, the Tuscany Rosso is the most drinkable.  It was also my grown son's favorite.<br /><br />I followed the instructions closely and made 6 gallons, 30 bottles.  It has beautiful deep red color, medium body, and good balance.

review/summary: Tuscany Rosso Magnifico is quite a deal
review/text: This was my first kit wine and it did very well. I mixed the kit for 5 gallons, then added two bottles of concord juice, a little sugar to obtain the right S.G. and after final racking, 1 1/2 bottles of Merlot to top it off. I back-sweetened just a little and WOW...it made a great table wine. I am already planning to do another one. The problem is deciding between the Merlot and more of the Rosso Magnifico...I am very pleased and for a cost of less than $2 per bottle, I have a wine that would be difficult to buy at several times the price...

review/summary: Silver Medal Winner @ 2012 CO State Fair using this kit.
review/text: Been making wine from kits for 15yrs so I know these kits are low end kits and as such the finished product is good but thin tasting. I bought two of these kits and made one with kit ingrediants only but the 2nd kit I added some of my Barbera wine to it. It gave the wine much more body and flavor. I entered this blended wine in the Colorado State Fair Wine Competition last month and was awarded a Silver Medal for my Rosso Magnificio. This is the second Medal I've won using Reserve du Chateau Wine kits. They represent a good value, you get labels and corks with the juice.

review/summary: Nice little table wine
review/text: I have been making kit wines for nearly 15 years so I have a bit of experience with this topic.  I have made kits from all the major brands.<br /><br />This kit has had me puzzled from day one.  First impressions were that it would be an 'OK' wine but nothing special.  As fermentation and aging progressed, opinions ranged from 'pretty good' to 'big mistake'.  Aging makes a HUGE difference with these wines. During the first 3 months in the bottle, the wine was undrinkable - very harsh with horrible aromas.  Then, at about 3 months, it turned the corner to a very nice table wine.  This will never pass as the best wine you have ever had but, as a table wine, it is worth every penny paid and then some.<br /><br />I made a second batch using filtered water, adding oak in primary and secondary and using BM4x4 yeast and have been very pleased with the results.  Became an above average table wine.<br /><br />All in all, buy one of these and give it at least 3 months in the bottle before passing judgement.  I think you will be pleased.  I'm going to try a Barolo next and then possibly try one of the 16 liter Chateau Classico kits.  These are fun.

review/text: I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey.

As far as taste, if you're just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla, then this Tazo brand will do it for you. If you're looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste, then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea, Tazo, will disappoint you.  The raw rooibos taste, without these "improvements" such as vanilla, is full-bodied and has its own unique taste.  I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings, Republic of Tea, and Numi.

review/summary: Refreshing, light-tasting tea ...
review/text: I have gone through about 5 boxes of this tea, and it's about time to order some more! I wish more tea makers would make cold-brewed teas because if you live in a hot climate as I do, the time of year to drink hot teas is very short! So 9 months out of the year, I drink iced or cold-brewed tea. This tea is very convenient at the office as I don't have to get up and go to the break room to boil water. I can simply enjoy the tea right in my own cubicle - just add bottled water and the tea bag, a little sugar for taste and there you go!<br /><br />Though I like the flavor, I would prefer a bit more of a mint taste. However, the taste of the tea is very light which makes it a very refreshing tea. I find myself drinking 2 or 3 of these pretty much every afternoon at the office.

review/text: This is the best cold brewed tea.  The taste is great and I hadn't been able to find in a local store.  Checked Amazaon and voila, there it was.  I've gone through at least 3 of the boxes, gave one to my daughter (also loves it).  It's so easy, just pop in cold water and in a couple of minutes there it is, ready to drink...and COLD!  I received within a week of ordering and felt the price was great.

review/text: I LOVE this tea!  It is so easy to make and it keeps me from being lazy and buying a soda.  I bring a nalgeen bottle with me so I can just fill it with water and make tea anytime, anywhere!  I have a different bottle with a straw that I fill with ice...then I just pour in the brewed tea.  The string makes it really easy to get out and it also keeps it from "steeping" too long after I pour out my first glass (although I have not noticed the green tea/mint getting bitter...haven't tried the others).

review/summary: High quality tuna that's easier on my conscience
review/text: I originally tried Wild Planet tuna back in 2006 when Amazon carried their "minimal mercury" products, and I was extremely impressed by the taste and the quality of the tuna.  I was never a fan of tuna in the past, but I thought their canned tuna was outstanding.  They stopped selling tuna with the "minimal mercury" label, and I drifted away from buying tuna until recently.  I decided to try Wild Planet again.  I don't know if their "low mercury" label is any different or perhaps the standard definitions have changed, but the online discussions make be believe that the mercury content in this product is really quite low.<br /><br />The taste is still excellent, and I'm happy to see that the product is still like it was over three years ago - in that the chunks of tuna are large and nothing is added (besides salt in some versions).  The natural juices from the fish keep it very moist and taste great.<br /><br />I also believe that their fishing practices are more sustainable and have less collateral damage (i.e. killing other animals) than other methods.  That makes me feel much better about buying their products.  Few things make me as upset as needless death or outright cruelty, and so while I enjoy eating meat and seafood, I look for people and brands that strive to avoid those things.

review/summary: Really Not Enjoyable - Wanted To Love It But I Can't Stomach It.
review/text: I wanted to love this because of all its positive aspects. Very low mercury. Sustainably caught. Responsible company and packaging. And - I THOUGHT it was fully caught AND packed in the USA* (*It is packed in Vietnam.)  See their web site, and click on the FAQ page - it tells that info there.<br /><br />I love Genovo Tonno - so I thought this tuna would be even better. Wrong. You open the can and find a relatively dry hunk of tuna that smells a little cat-foodish, with some limited liquid around the lump. Dumping it out, it doesn't break up very easily, but I persisted and succeeded in making it ready for a sandwich. Taste was uninspiring. There wasn't much taste - and what was there was just ever so slightly unappealing. I couldn't finish the sandwich. I normally LOVE tuna - but not this.<br /><br />Thinking it was just me not liking it, I gave the rest to a person who will eat ANY brand of tuna and love it. In fact, he's one of those cast-iron stomach people who will and can eat anything. He didn't finish his sample either, because he said it was dryish and tasted unappetizing. So, it isn't just "me".<br /><br />I REALLY wanted to love this. But I can't stomach it. I'll just buy either the can of Genovo Tonno or Starkist's Yellowfin tuna in foil packets from now on. Those taste like tuna and make me want more. Granted, they're  higher in mercury - full grown yellow-fin is almost as high as albacore in mercury, but I'll keep my consumption down to one packet (2.6 ounce) or can (3 ounce) a week which is below the danger limit for a very small woman. I'd rather eat less tuna that I simply LOVE, than eat a whole bunch of tuna that I can't choke down.<br /><br />This excerpt is quoted from the Wild Planet FAQ:<br /><br />"Why are Wild Planet tuna and sardines caught in the US but packed in Vietnam?<br />We have elected to process our 5oz cans of albacore and skipjack tuna as well as our sardines in a highly respected partner facility in Vietnam. This facility offers state-of-the-art canning expertise in an immaculately clean, accredited environment that produces higher quality finished products than any cannery we have seen in the US."<br /><br />I realize there are no more canneries in the US, but I"m just not comfortable with my food moving from California to Vietnam and then back to California - and then out to the middle of the US to the consumer.

review/summary: Great Tasting - Tested for Mecury & Omega 3's - Read the Labels & Research Yourself
review/text: I've been using this tuna for many months, buying it here on Amazon, and it has always been excellent! I've given away a few cans to friends and co-workers without mentioning anything, and all of them have came back and asked me for more info about it. It is simply the best tuna I've ever had by far!<br /><br />Read the labels and research yourself where your tuna is coming from, and how it is processed. I don't know of any tuna that is completely wild, line caught in the US and hand selected in the 17 lb size, and cooked in the can with no water added. Any liquid in the can are Omega 3 oils, so do NOT drain the liquid! The oils mix together very good with the tuna by itself, or in to a salad. It's like an anti-freeze for the blood, in addition to benefits.<br /><br />Most tuna comes from Asia, or elsewhere overseas, and much of it is wild tuna, caught and kept in pens, and fed by humans to fatten them up. Animal Planet uses sushi-grade line caught tuna, hand selected in the smaller sizes (called "peanut size" to the sport fishing crowd). And the sushi-grade means caught, immediately bled, and put on ice. Ask any sport fisherman, they all know this is the only method to use to ensure good tasting tuna. You will not have sushi-grade tuna unless you do this process, and quickly. It's the KEY to great tasting tuna. Having had wild caught sport albacore locally, and being involved with the sport fishing group, I have learned this. Check out other brands and then read about Wild Planet, and then make the taste taste. I highly recommend this stuff.

review/summary: So Good!  Loaded with Omega 3!
review/text: The first time I had tuna cooked in the can without added water or oil was a place in Eureka, Ca a few years back...I've never had it since until I found this brand.  This is ONLY tuna, nothing added.  When you open the can (with an easy pull-top), you use all of the tuna and the juices, it's really delicious.  I am a big tuna eater and this is excellent tuna at an affordable price.  Upon opening the can you will notice a whole piece of tuna, never flakes or chuncks, and you can break this tuna 'steak' apart depending on how big of chunks you want, or leave it whole on your plate.  No matter how you use it, it's really good eating.  It's moist and has a big flavor, an excellent choice for your tuna sandwiches or salads.  I stocked up on about 10 orders so my pantry will be full and I can eat this to my heart's content...and what a healthy heart it will be with the high levels of Omega 3!  Low mercury because they use smaller fish.  I hope the price and quality never change. $16.62 for 6 cans.

review/text: Overall, pleased with the product.  In particular, knowing it is lower in mercury, higher in Omega-3's, and sustainably caught.  That said, in a taste test done on the first can, I did prefer the Bumble Bee Gold can (their top tuna).  The other reviewers are on point - this one has more flavor.  The  funny thing: it actually tastes more like real tuna (and good tuna at that), whereas the Bumble Bee seems to have been bleached of the flavor somehow.  Anyway, I'd liken it to starting on whole wheat...I bet in a couple of weeks I'll prefer this one.  I will definitely be switching over.

review/text: This is AWESOME Tuna! Since I am a localvore, I spent much time searching and learning for a canned tuna that I felt safe eating. I do believe Wild Planet is a company to trust. I spoke to them extensively prior to buying and they stand behind their product that it is 'wild caught' and smaller tuna so lower amounts of mercury than the larger fish.<br /><br />The only aspect that I am not 100% on is the cans are not BPA-free (but they are working on it). I am supposedly on the list with the company and they tell me they will notify me as soon as the cans are replaced. Until then, I limit the amount of tuna we eat.<br /><br />As for flavor you won't find anything better. This is a full piece of fish that is once canned...not twice cooked and made up of scraps and ground up whatever parts like most store-bought.<br /><br />Finally, the subscribe and Save with Amazon is the best deal ever.<br /><br />Come on Wild Planet...get the BPA Free cans for heaven's sake!!!

Needless to say, the 3rd one was preferable.  I ordered the Wild Place brand because of the BPA free cans but cannot say it is the best tuna I've eaten because it is so dry and "tough" - or seemingly overcooked.<br /><br />I also have the skipjack tuna which I've not tried yet but am hoping I like it better.

review/text: I have to be honest. I bought this tuna for my pet. She is a small dog that eats better than most people. She loves tuna but it was next to impossible to find no sodium tuna. I finally found this product on Amazon and with the good reviews, I decided to give it a try.<br /> When the tuna arrived I opened the can and started dividing it up into portions for pet meals. I was impressed when first opening the can and seeing mostly tuna and very little water. The tuna was beautiful, firm meat. Almost like a tuna steak. I am a tuna lover too so I took a bite. Wow.....great tuna!! The taste was much better than I thought a no sodium tuna would be. Makes me realize that what I have been eating for years in the can bought at the store was simply no where as good as this. This is what wild caught tuna with very little processing tastes like, simply delicious! This tuna would make an awesome tuna salad or casserole.<br /> It might sound funny, but my dog and I will be sharing these yummy cans of tuna. Also, I do feel better knowing that these fish were caught without harming other sea creatures. That is important to me.<br /> I suggest buying more than one pack at a time, it has a good long shelf life. Enjoy!

review/text: This is an excellent product. Tuna was obviously fresh when canned since there is is minimal fish smell to it unlike some brands that smell up the whole house. Aside from liking the way the fish was caught and handled, it tastes very good. Interestingly, the price is not that much higher than other premium  brands at the supermarket. We will be repeat customers. It's worth a visit to the Wild Planet site to check out the details of how this outfit operates.

review/text: I had been trying to locate this tuna in Atlanta but was unsuccessful. Found it in a small nearby town that is not usually convenient for shopping. It is a great product and was 75 cents cheaper on Amazon than the grocery store price. Before the holidays shipping was free (over $25.00). I am happy all around and have ordered 36 more cans!

review/text: We're Polar Tuna fans, but were curious to try this one because of the great reviews. It may simply be personal preference, but we were disappointed with the flavor of Wild Planet. We did a blindfold test of this brand plus two others, and this came in last. We'll stay with Polar Tuna, which is scrumptious!

review/text: I orderd this because of the free SS shipping, and now we love this popcorn! Used to pop in a Kettle Krazy, but then tried a hot air popper and like that even better. (and so much easier to clean) The aroma as the kernels heat up is heavenly. The popcorn has a great flavor, is a little chewey, and almost hulless. We tried the 'Vintage Red', and love that also. Next to try is the white, or baby white. This popcorn has such a nice flavor it can even be eaten plain, but we usually use butter (melted in the microwave) and salt. I have to warn you though, once you try this, it's very hard to go back to Orville.

review/summary: Blue Popping Corn!
review/text: I wanted to try blue popping corn, since I have purchased blue corn meal to make cornbread.  I had read somewhere that blue corn contained a lower glycemic index than yellow corn.  Anyway, this popcorn smells great and tastes wonderful.  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because it takes more of this popcorn (than yellow O. Redenbacher) to fill a bowl.  And because the little kernels are smaller -- and lighter -- it's a bit of a challenge to use the air popper.  I found that if I use a tea towel and carefully tilt the air popper as they are almost popped, then they gently fall into the bowl.  Otherwise, they tend to just pop and stay there (above the hot air) to burn, because they don't "jump" out and into the bowl like the yellow popcorn.  I've also tried to pop the "traditional" method, in a large heavy pot with a small amount of oil.  They taste great, but don't all pop. So be prepared for many "old maids".  However, a great thing, in addition to the taste, is that there are virtually no little hulls that stick in your teeth or gums as compared to the yellow.

review/summary: No sugars added!
review/text: Disclaimer: I am a VINE REVIEWER and therefore I received one item of this product for free to review.<br /><br />I have a marketing background and the marketing here is great, "The Switch" is an ideal name and with consumers looking for healthy alternatives to sodas, this is a good "switch" ;-)<br /><br />This is a tasty beverage made from juice concentrates with no added sugars.  To quench that thirst and you want the feel of carbonation (you know what I mean!) man, this is a good choice.<br /><br />My only gripe might be that it is tiny, just a cup or ~8oz.  It goes by quick.  I have no idea on pricing, again since I'm a VINE reviewer, but it's going to need to be comparable to the price of regular sodas or cheaper, else why make the 'switch' ?  I do wish it came in 12, 16 or 20 oz variants.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor is good with no aftertaste and not too tart, essentially a good tasting soda that is not a soda and it still has carbonation.

review/text: This was OK.  It tastes more like juice to me.  I didn't get much of the carbonation "bubble" or "fizzies" that you get w/o most carbonated beverages.  Could be because I'm a HUGE Diet C*ke drinker, so I'm used to carbonated beverages. It was a little too sweet for my personal preference and it tasted more like definite cherry than "black cherry."  It also left a bit of an aftertaste in my mouth (took a while for the cherry taste to go away).  I don't think I'd buy it again, and I might recommend it to people who like Cherry flavored beverages, but it's not anything I would say "WOW! You just gotta try this! about.  It was just OK

review/summary: the sparkling wine of soda pop
review/text: I tried one of these, and immediately I was reminded of a flavor....what was it? Oh, yeah, you know those bottles of non alcoholic champaign, which are basically sparkling juice? It's just like that taste. I dont drink alcohol, so around New Years I get a bottle of that sparkling juice drink.  The black cherry of course, doesnt taste like the apple/white grape juice in the bottle. Thats cos there's cherry juice.....but of course, you dont want to drink pure sparkling cherry juice, it has to be mixed with apple and white grape, or you'd have indigestion. BUT, if you like that juice like I do, and of course if you dont drink a whole bottle at a time,  (that's just asking for trouble, cos its too much fruit sugar at once), this is the PERFECT SOLUTION. The cans hold about 150 calories of juice, which is the PERFECT SNACK size.  The taste is clean, with no funny aftertaste, from overly sweet juice products. For a sparkling juice drink, its almost  dry, which is another reason I believe I am reminded of those sparkling bottles of juice champaign. Plus, its all natural, and I"m sure we all know what happens to people who drink regular soft drink, with that sugar, caffeine and phosporic acid. Yup, your teeth fall out....really! So, this is good for all people, even diabetes if you count it as a fruit exchange. The perfect after dinner snack size, or put in the lunch, or on a little trip  to the woods, etc.  I have never seen these cans in the store, so here's where you want to  buy them.

review/summary: A nice treat, but no substitute
review/text: I am a moderate drinker of both sodas and juices, so I was intrigued by the promise of The Switch.  I would receive the vitamin benefits of my juices with the fizzy fun of a soda.  The can is slim, so it fits nicely in my lunch bag but would rattle around in my car cup holder if I decided to take it as a to-go breakfast drink.  Once I had it all nice and chilled, I popped the top and listed to the fizz.  It was not quite the satisfying pop and fizz of a Coca-Cola, but that is because this drink has less carbonation.  When I took a sip, I was immediately transported back to grade school field trips where we were given bag lunches with juice boxes.  While it was a nice moment of nostalgia, the novelty quickly wore off.  The juice was nice, but I am not sure the carbonation really added anything to it.<br /><br />My biggest concern really deals more with the people who may not do their due diligence before deciding to purchase this product.  If you have a soda addiction, but you drink diet soda, this would be a calorie explosion.  While it is natural juice, you must remember that natural juice is high in sugar.  If you are accustomed to guzzling three or four sodas per day (or more) then you would not want to replace them with this beverage.  It must be approached with the same dietary caution as you would use with regular juice.  But if you have difficulty drinking juice or getting your recommended fruit servings each day, this might be a fun alternative.<br /><br />The price is high compared to soda, but it is low compared to some other individually bottled/canned juices.  I thought that the black cherry flavor was a little weak compared to my expectations.  I preferred the kiwi/berry flavor.  I think that it makes a nice treat, but it is not going to be complete substitute for me.

review/summary: Good carbonated juice product, but light on the "Black Cherry"
review/text: As a carbonated version of the juice boxes that my children enjoy, this product is good, and reasonably priced.  However, as a "Black Cherry" soda, this product is a bit lacking.<br /><br />Seeing as it is advertised as a "Black Cherry" product, I would have expected cherry juice to be a bit higher on the list of ingredients than it is:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, cherry juice concentrates), natural flavor and color, citric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C).  Unfortunately the taste reflects the ingredients used; though there is a bit of cherry taste in this soda it is not nearly enough to make it distinctive for me.<br /><br />However, at a reasonable price point, and without the sugars or corn syrup of traditional sodas, I think that this is a fine bevarage choice for the kids if they want something "fizzy."

review/summary: Nice Fruity Flavor
review/text: I really enjoy trying new things, so I found the idea of this soda pleasing.  It is essentially carbonated fruit juice, so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink.  I think this might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be.  However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this "natural" drink tastes a bit artificial.  This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always effects the flavor.  However, unlike the watermelon flavor, I found this variety vibrant and delicious.  The fruit flavor really comes through, albeit not as deep as some cherry juice mixes.  It is an expensive treat, but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of fruit juice.

My impression is that the 8 ounce size would be great as a relatively healthy kid lunch item. I found it to be a bit small, only because it was so good that I wanted more!<br /><br />My sense is that the sugar level would be on the order of a Juicy Juice type beverage, but the carbonation makes it taste less sweet.<br /><br />Ordinarily I don't care for apple juice and can often detect an apple taste in these sort of juice blends, but it wasn't apparent here, which is a plus in my book.<br /><br />Recommended!

review/text: I got some of this, black cherry flavor, to try. My expectations were low, given that just about anything labeled "black cherry" that I have had at any time in my life has been pretty artificial tasting.<br /><br />Wow...what a shock! This stuff actually tastes like real black cherry juice. Very good flavor, nice mild fizz. I wish it were diet, but of course then it wouldn't have the flavor. I also wish the can were bigger, because it's GOOD.<br /><br />My main complaint is that this stuff, like just about every other canned/bottled juice, consists of a mixture of juices. There's cherry juice in there (thankfully...and trust me, that's not necessarily a given), but also cheapo apple and grape (typically used to keep costs down). Nonetheless, it actually tastes like cherry, so I can't complain too hard.<br /><br />If you're looking for something a bit different and better, try this for sure...

review/summary: Lightly carbonated 100% juice cocktail
review/text: I was hoping for a covenient alternative to my usual juice + sparkling water drink that I make for a sundowner every evening, however, this falls short.<br /><br />While the drink is 100% juice, it is not 100% cherry juice.  In fact, the flavours of apple and grape over power any cherry juice flavors. (The cherry was more like an aftertaste)  I personally prefer cleaner, clearer flavours and not juice cocktails. The drink is also slightly too sweet.<br /><br />The upside or downside (depending on what you prefer) is that this is lightly carbonated, just like making your own juice + sparkling water drink at home.  It does not have the heavy fizz that sodas do.<br /><br />The 8.3 fl oz about the size of a liquid cup or a small mug, and is smaller than the typical soda can.<br /><br />The aim of the product seems to be converting soda drinkers to carbonated juice drinkers but it seems to fail in that it is not fizzy enough for most soda drinkers and is too sweet for juice drinkers.  While it also claims to be a healthy drink, the high amount of fruit sugars debates that.<br /><br />I would reccomend you try this drink if you like sweet sparkling juices, but maybe in one of their simpler flavours such as grape.

review/text: I loved the Black Cherry Switch.  I received a sample of this and the watermelon as a part of the Vine Program.  I really liked the Black Cherry, but it is a very strong flavor.  The rest of my family preferred the more subtle flavor of the watermelon strawberry.  If you are trying to avoid the caffeine of regular soda, especially for children this may be a viable alternative for you.  You will need to read the nutritional information because there is quite a bit of sugar in the product- but it is fruit juice and fruit juice naturally contains sugar.  I would have no problem serving this product to my granddaughter, although it would be a flavor that wasn't quite so strong.

Packaged like an energy drink and served up like a fruit juice Switch manages to be a little of both. Some people might find their drinks a little sweet, but without a clinging aftertaste or sticky, sugary residue, it is actually quite refreshing.<br /><br />Switch's Black Cherry is one of the few Black Cherry flavored drinks that actually tastes like Black Cherry. The difference is subtle, but it is there, and it is noticeable. Black Cherry fans are sure to want to stock up on this liquid treat.

review/summary: Great alternative to soda
review/text: This drink is super tasty.  I am currently pregnant and I am a dr pepper addict.  I needed something without the crap and cafeine and this did the trick.  It tastes just like black cherry coke.  Tons of carbonation and a very sweet taste.  The size is perfect for me - anymore and it would be overkill.  It honestly is 100% juice and natural.  I love that.  Definitely a great drinks for pregnant women who shouldn't be drinking soda.

review/summary: Refreshing and just the right amount
review/text: I don't generally drink anything but water, coffee and tea, do not like soda, and only use juice in smoothies, so was surprised that I like the Switch juice drink as much as I do.  I've only tried two flavors, the Black Cherry, and the Kiwi Berry; they are pretty similar but I slightly prefer the Black Cherry.  The fruit names are silly anyway as they use a blend of several fruits.<br /><br />The carbonation is very light and the mixed fruit concentrate they use has a very pleasant flavor.  There is no added sugar or fake sweeteners which seem to be in so many prepared beverages these days.  Because it is juice only and a slight amount of carbonation, there is no after taste.<br /><br />Unlike many other reviewers, I did not find these drinks to be too sweet at all, and I fully expected to considering all juice usually tastes pretty darn sweet to me.  I think the carbonation may tone down the sweetness of the juice?<br /><br />I like the 8.3oz amount; it is just the right amount. For me this is a "special" once-in-awhile treat so I don't mind the price.

review/summary: pleasingly natural but a bit candy-sweet
review/text: Switch continues the recent (and welcome) trend in natural beverages-- there's nothing fake or added in the ingredient list.<br /><br />But the flavor is a little candy-sweet for my taste, I prefer more of a tart cherry flavor.  Folks sharing my tastes may prefer one of the other flavors or try the fizzier (and tarter) Izze products such as: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NU6M18">Izze Sparkling Blackberry Soda Full Case (24 - 12 Ounce) Bottles</a>

review/summary: This is a small portion.  Too sweet not enough tang for Cherry soda.
review/text: While I liked this flavor much better then the watermelon strawberry it is still too sweet for carbonated fruit juice.  If I did not see black cherry on the label I probably would have not been able to guess this the flavor.  This is my favorite flavor of Switch they still need to amp up the flavor to be on my short list of black cherry soda.  The 8.3 oz can is a small size but considering the sweetness it is ample.

review/summary: 8.3 ounces of expensive mixed juice
review/text: At around a buck a can, very expensive for 8.3 ounces of carbonated apple juice (with lesser amounts of grape juice, aceola whatever that is, finally actual cherry juice, plus some vitamin C added).<br /><br />With the 100% juice banner all over that can, you might be led to believe it's 100% cherry juice . . . it's not.  Taste is not unlike a typical cherry soda pop.  Expected sugar content (natural).  130 calories.  I'm not likely to make future purchases of this one.

review/summary: Juice, Natural Flavors, Carbonated to Perfection
review/text: "The Switch" is a carbonated juice beverage that is 100% natural.  So, you probably knew this already, but did you know that it's not just black cherry juice in there?  It's actually a blend of apple, grape, acerola, and cherry concentrates, with Vitamin C added.  There are also some natural flavors in the mix, as well.<br /><br />The cans are slightly over 8 fluid ounces, and go down quick and easy.  Very refreshing.  I'm trying to think of something to compare it to... it's like a very fruity (but not overly so) mineral water.  The taste will follow you after you drink it--pleasurably so.<br /><br />It has 33g of carbs, which is about right for this kind of fruit drink.  That doesn't make it a diet drink by any means, but at least it's not as bad as regular cola.  There are 130 calories per can.  There are no funny ingredients like "ester of wood rosen", either.  And, no caffeine or alcohol.  I'm not bouncing off the walls afterwards but it gives you some energy for an hour or so, although it's not really an energy drink.<br /><br />I was given one can to review, and I think I'll purchase the pack of 24 in the near future.  Thank you Amazon, it's wonderful!  Cheers!

review/summary: Deceptively tasty
review/text: Corn products of all types give me migraines, so I'm always looking for soda that doesn't have high fructose corn syrup.  It's difficult to find regular soft drinks that don't contain corn syrup.  I decided to give The Switch a try because it contains ordinary sugar.<br /><br />I liked the taste of the Black Cherry Switch.  It tasted more like fruit punch than black cherry though.  This makes sense because cherries are at the bottom of the fruit ingredients list.  Apple juice comprises most of the fruit juice in Black Cherry Switch.  Marketing this as "black cherry" is a bit misleading.  They should call it carbonated "fruit drink" instead of "black cherry."  It annoys me when marketers employ deceptive advertising.<br /><br />That being said, I did enjoy the taste.  I just recommend that people read the ingredients list before buying.

review/summary: I liked another Switch, but not THIS one
review/text: While we liked another Switch flavor a great deal, this one was VERY strongly flavored, and it was overpoweringly sweet.  Everyone in my family tried it, and NO ONE liked it, although we usually like cherry flavors.  The only use I can think of this is to maybe put a bit in coke, as if it were a flavoring, and not a drink meant to be consumed on its own....if you like a cherry coke.  We didn't try that though.  In fact, we threw the majority of the one can we opened away.<br />The carbonation level was great though, and I like the shape of the cans, the fact it is 100% juice, and the amount in each serving is perfect.

review/summary: definitely not Shasta . . .
review/text: Really, is the generic black cherry soda you can get at the grocery store actually SUPPOSED to taste like cherry, in any way?  I think not.  The Switch offers up an entirely new flavor, one that actually tastes like . . . cherries!  Amazing, I know.  This soda didn't have the sickeningly sweet flavor that most cherry sodas do.  This has probably been my least favorite of The Switch's flavors that I have tried -- I even liked the orange one better!  The flavor wasn't overpowering and goes down easy enough, it just didn't particularly like it all the much.  I do like The Switch products, though, and appreciate that there are no added sweeteners or any of that other junk you find in so many beverages these days.  And as I had mentioned in another review, their products are difficult to find in stores so it is great that Amazon is now carrying them.

review/summary: Not bad, but it should be called "The Switch Apple, Grape & Black Cherry"
review/text: This was a pretty good idea -- it's basically juice from concentrate that's been reconstituted with sparkling instead of plain water.  As such, it's about as sweet and flavorful as regular juice.  The sparkling water gives it a little different sort of fizz from regular soda's.  Although these cans are only about 2/3 the size of regular soda cans, it's relatively filling and a single can makes for a decent drink.  Sure, it has a fair amount of sugar, but it's not a diet product.  And for most people, it's better to drink the natural sugar in fruit juice than the chemicals in most sodas.<br /><br />There are two problems: the price and the flavors.  At nearly a dollar a can, even when purchased by the case, this is expensive stuff.  One could simply buy some juice and some sparkling water and make a fair approximation without spending so much.  The other issue is the fact that the recipe contains more apple and grape juice than cherry juice.  This isn't uncommon for juices made from expensive fruits, but in this case all three tastes are really noticeable.  It tastes as much like apple juice or grape juice as it does cherry juice.  (The apple and grape flavors stand out more in the Switch Black Cherry drink than in the Switch Kiwi Berry drink.  If you're deciding between the two, go with Kiwi Berry.)  If you like all three, then you might like this.  If there's one you don't like, that could be enough to ruin it for you.

review/summary: Not too sweet with a true cherry taste
review/text: I got on can of this through the amazon vine program.<br /><br />I love black cherry soda.  Some of my favorites are IBC's black cherry and Henry Weinhard's black cherry vanilla soda.<br /><br />This soda was very good but different from any of the other types I've had before.  It is not super sweet.  If you have had IBC'S black cherry or Henry Weinhard's black cherry; both of these have a strong vanilla overtone and are deliciously sweet.  The Switch wasn't as sweet as these varieties and had a more pure cherry flavor to it.<br /><br />I also drink a lot of Izze sparkling juices (although they do not have a cherry flavor).  The Izze juices are much more carbonated and tend to have fruit flavors that are less true to the fruit (mainly because I think pear juice is added to sweeten a lot of them, not sure if this is true for all flavors).<br /><br />So to sum up the Switch soda is:<br />- Less carbonated than IZZE; more carbonated than IBC<br />- Truer fruit taste than IZZE sodas.<br />- Less sweet than IBC or Henry Weinhard<br />- No vanilla overtones, just pure cherry flavor.<br /><br />I personally like the IBC cherry soda better; but it is definitely not as good for you, with more artificial colors and sugar added.  I liked the Switch better than the IZZE sodas because I am not big on carbonation and I liked the pure cherry taste.  I am not sure if I will ever buy a case of this stuff but it was pretty good.

review/summary: weird
review/text: I thought this was very acidic and tart.  I don't think that the carbonation did it any favors either, ie carbonic acid.  I couldn't finish this one.<br /><br />I don't really understand any drink this size.  If I were thirsty at all, I would want way more, at least 12 oz.  I guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda/juice.  I guess there is a market for that, I'm just not part of it.

review/summary: Juice Pouch with fizz.
review/text: This drink is a slim 8.3 ounce can.  It's basically a juice pouch with added carbonation.  The black cherry tasted artificial and when I looked it was mostly apple and grape, the two cheapest juices on the market, with cherry being the 4th or 5th item down. It's fizzy and refreshing but it's also 34g. of sugar.  yikes! The benefit is 100% vitamin C, no other vitamins or minerals were listed, but it's a expensive per drink.  I would not recommend, it was just too artifical tasting and if you want 100% vitamin C with fizz then just add ginger ale to your orange juice in the morning.

review/text: The soda was very refreshing.  It did not have the overpowering sweetness of other sodas.  The carbonation helped to give it a nice little kick. The only gripe I may have was the it had more of a fruit punch sort of flavor.  The cherry flavor was not very pronounced.

review/summary: The Best Switch Flavor...
review/text: Having now tried several Switch drinks, I'm quite pleased with how they've chosen to enter the market with this product-line. The flavors they've introduced are well thought out, generally taste good, and are really a good set of drinks I'd consider purchasing.<br /><br />The downsides? It's probably not big enough. 8.3 ounces is quite small. I know it's probably more of a specialty drink, but I did feel like I still needed more after drinking the entire can. It's possible they intended that to make you purchase more.<br /><br />That being said, this flavor, black cherry, was by far my most favorite. Again, these are great drinks. Definitely worth trying and seeing if they can become a part of your regular drink selection.

review/text: Okay, this was tasty and I guess if you had a huge addiction to soda this might work for you.  It's not as bad for you as soda, but it's also not great for you.  The price is also a bit high for what you get.  As much soda as I drink though, I would rather just have it and drink other things in the place of switch.  The taste is great though, but not nearly as fuzzy as carbonated drinks.

review/summary: A sweet but healthier alternative to Colas
review/text: The Black Cherry Switch is an interesting beverage, a cross between the traditional carbonated drinks and fruit juice. As some of the other reviewers have noted, this is a very sweet drink, and I say that as someone with a sweet tooth. Granted of course, black cherry is by definition a very sweet fruit.<br /><br />The 8.3oz can packs 130 calories, which mostly come from fruit juices, not corn syrup or sugar - according to the ingredients box. Interestingly, the box mentions that beyond cherry, there's also apple, acerola and grape juice concentrates in it.<br /><br />One big plus of this drink over traditional Colas is that it has 100% RDA Vitamin C (according to the product box).<br /><br />The can is environmentally responsible as it encourages the drinker to recycle this can, using the same font size as the rest of the text on the box.<br /><br />And a side note: In dealing with the extra sweetness, I tried this experiment: I diluted some of the drink with unflavored carbonated water using equal amounts. At that level, it had a much lighter taste and one that felt more like flavored carbonated water than carbonated juice.<br /><br />In my opinion, this drink should have about 2/3rds of its current "sweetness".<br /><br />Conclusion: If you like sweet carbonated drinks or if you are trying to get off the sugary or faux-sugar Colas, this is a lesser-evil alternative.
