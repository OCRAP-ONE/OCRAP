review/text: As someone accustomed to Lipton and other crappy black teas, I'm giving this 5 stars. The flavor is subtle, and not at all bitter. The preparation was easier than I anticipated: I didn't need to filter out the leaves, as they managed to stay in the bottom of my cup. Anyone who thinks black tea is bitter and disgusting should try this. They'll be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: The only "flavored" black tea I drink
review/text: I'm a bit of a purist with both black tea and coffee. I don't add anything to either beverage. I deny the existence of flavored coffee, and once denied the existence of flavored black tea. I'm not one who is swayed easily, but I was basically forced to just try this once. This tea is so good that it became my one exception.<br /><br />The lemon flavor pairs absolutely perfectly with the flavor of strong black tea. The lemon flavor comes on subtly, and ends pleasantly strong. There is no overwhelming sweetness or sourness. If you smell the tea before brewing, you'll probably note that you can barely, if at all, detect the lemon. When you introduce very hot water, the lemon comes alive and puts a nice, subtle, natural, lemon scent in the air.<br /><br />Anyway, I opened up a little after tasting this, and have now also tried Orange Bliss by Twinings. Nothing wrong with it, but I don't think the orange flavor agrees with black tea quite as well. I'll stick to only non-flavored black tea with Lemon Twist as the one exception.<br /><br />I will drink this tea at any time of the day.<br /><br />TL, DR: I used to be a total tea purist. This is my one exception now. Black tea and lemon go together amazingly well.

Though this cereal is not quite the same, it is also made by General Mills, and tastes as close as you're going to get. Basically Sprinkles Cookie Crisp is to Sprinkle Spangles as to what Vault is to Surge. So enjoy this wonderful cereal!

While it isn't something you should have every day of the month(if you want to avoid the dentist) it is good to treat yourself to it once in a while. I do have to admit though if you want something from the same makers of this cereal that tastes even better I recommend you that you try Peanut Butter Cookie Crisp(if you can find it) which really does taste a lot like homemade cookies.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I saw a case of 6 boxes of the lemon shortbread cookies for sale at the Amazon warehouse online (when did this start? It's great) for $8.99.  I had never tried any of Pamela's cookies.  I love lemon so I decided to buy the case.  I read several reviews.  Most people liked/loved them.  One person said they were really tart.  Another person, one of the few who didn't like them, said they tasted something like lemon pledge had been sprayed on them.  I am writing to share my opinion that they are neither really tart nor taste like lemon pledge.  They are a lemon flavored buttery shortbread cookie. The shortbread does a lot to cut the tartness.  I found them just perfectly lemony without being overbearing. They are a delicate cookie that is easy to eat.  Unfortunately the delicateness caused a couple to break into pieces.  I don't find that to be a problem because I break my cookies into bites before I eat them anyway.  Don't be afraid to try these cookies if you like lemon.  They are definitely worth a try, especially if you get them from the warehouse.  I'll order again even if I have to pay full price next time.

review/summary: An adult lemon cookie
review/text: I love lemon cakes and cookies, and Pamela's lemon shortbread cookies are my favorite because of their appealing texture and natural lemon taste. Warning: they are EXTREMELY tart. Adults with a developed palate will like them, but children and teenagers tend to find them too sour. Spreading them with raspberry or blackberry jam will offset the tartness; the flavors go together nicely. They are especially good with hot black tea served the British way, with milk in it. And yes, you can eat just one of them at a time because they are so rich and filling.

review/summary: Not your typical lemon cookie
review/text: This has to be my most favorite lemon cookie ever. My preferences are cookies with less sugar than others...if that helps anyone. I shy away from fanny may candies, not for the flavor but for them being way too sugary for my palate. So if you have a sensitive palate and like a nice chewy, crumbly, lemony cookie with not too much sugar in it, then you should absolutely love these. I also love those little italian sesame cookies because they aren't too sugary either.

review/text: I don't have to eat gluten free products but picked these up so I'd have something on hand when I had a sweet attack (think once a month).  I pretty much love lemon anything so I thought these would be a great treat!  I do like these cookies; they aren't quite as flaky as say, pecan sandies, but they are nice and light and the lemon flavor packs the perfect punch - yes, you CAN taste the lemon! I do experience a weird sort of snap sound/sensation when I bite into one and I have to think that is probably a result of the gluten-free aspect.  It's not bad, just different from regular cookies. They do satisfy quickly so eating a too many isn't a problem.  Bonus that they aren't overly sweet. I'm going to pop them in the freezer like another rater suggested and see how they taste when they're icy cold!  One more thing...these came packed nicely and I haven't experiencing any breakage (even when eating them) like some other reviewers mentioned.

review/text: I am a big fan of Pamela's Products. Their plain shortbread and pecan shortbread are incredible. So I was optimistic about the lemon shortbread cookies, since I'm a fan of everything lemon-flavored. These cookies were a) too sour, b) soggy, without the crumbly, buttery texture of real shortbread and c) they tasted like someone had sprayed Lemon Pledge furniture cleaner on regular shortbread, then sealed it in plastic while damp. Really, they were that gross. Not recommended.

They were definitely unsatisfactory.  I opened the package to taste so felt that I could not return them.  So I am stuck with 12 boxes.

review/summary: Perfect for making Gomme Syrup for craft cocktails
review/text: The only thing I use Gum Arabic for is for making Gomme Syrup. For this purpose, this item works great.<br /><br />Gomme syrup is a sugar syrup thickened by adding gum arabic. It was often called for in cocktail recipes from the 1860's forward. Gomme syrup makes amazing Old Fashioneds and Sazeracs, with the gum arabic contributing an extra-luscious mouth feel.<br /><br />Gomme syrup is pretty easy to make following the instructions that can be found at [...]<br /><br />Actually its easier to make than the article makes it sound. The short version:<br />1. combine 2 oz gum arabic powder with 2 oz water, whisk or stir to combine. it won't completely integrate as the starch needs to hyrdate. While you could leave it alone for a day, I only waited about 20-30 minutes. it wasn't completed lump-free, but that didn't cause any problems.<br />2. combine 8 oz raw sugar, such as demerrara or turbanado, and 4 oz of water in sauce pan. bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar.<br />3. once the sugar is fully dissolved, add the gum arabic slurry.<br />4. return to a boil, and strain off any scuzz (protein) with a spoon.<br />5. strain (I didn't bother), and bottle.<br /><br />2:1 simple syrups are common in many craft cocktails, and adding the gum arabic just contributes to a sublime mouthfeel. It's easy to make and keeps in the fridge indefinitely.<br /><br />I would certainly buy this particular item again. I don't need to make more than 1 or 2 batches at a time, and this is plenty of gum arabic for that purpose.

review/summary: Difficult to work with
review/text: This is an unusual product. It does work but it needs to be dissolved separately and with heat before addition to what you are making. I tried to make Marshmallow root marshmallows with it and it did not work. This product however will stiffen up gelatin marshmallows so it does work. I cannot say this product is very useful as very few recipes ever call for it but it is cool conversation piece. Also, it might be a good product to rescue your emulsion that you are making if the chemistry is right but you will have to discover that for yourself. Just be careful of lumps when using this product, dissolver thoroughly before adding.

review/summary: My favorite Starbucks blend!
review/text: I have tried all the Via blends, and my favorite by far is still Starbucks Tribute.  It was so sad when they ran out last year.  My back-up is the Columbian, always good, but I have always loved Sumatra.  The cherry is a note, and does not come across as a 'flavor'.  I do not like flavored coffee.  I heat this in the microwave for two minutes in a mug of 1% organic milk.  Yummy!<br /><br />Starbucks writes:  . . . "Spicy & Cherry" and "With beans from all three of the world's coffee-growing regions . . . Aged Sumatra, sun-dried beans from Ethiopia, and coffees from Papua New Guinea and Colombia come together to create this spicy and full-bodied blend with dark cherry notes."

review/text: My husband and I agree that this brew is really ordinary. If you don't like espresso, or strong coffee, this blend if for you! It reminds me of the coffee I used to drink before finding Lavazza, an Italian coffee we've drunk since 2007 when we came home from France with memories of that divine espresso. Now, we've gotten lazy and enjoy the Starbucks VIA italian roast instant coffee--the key to our appreciation being the strong but NOT BITTER flavor.

review/summary: Best Five Gun Flavor YET!
review/text: The black color may at first seem a tad unnerving, but one must get used to it or miss out on my favorite gum to date. The mint flavor seems to morph between types ranging from peppermint to wintergreen, and spearmint. It's soft, luscious, and juicy goodness. I would recommend this over the 5 react fruit flavor, as the taste lasts much longer in this.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 stars, not 5, is that you must beware your pockets! Even body heat is enough to (over the period of one day) heat this gum into a sticky putrefying mess.<br /><br />Other than that one problem, this is some of the best stick gum to date.

My son is 11 months and eats everything I put in front of him, but this Ella's Kitchen chicken meal (along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Z9W4X6">Ella's Kitchen chick-chick Chicken Casserole with vegetables and rice - 7 pk</a>) is something he refuses to eat. I literally spoon it in his mouth and he sticks out his tongue and pushes it out as quick as he can.<br /><br />The only way I got him to eat this is by mixing it with fruit baby food (with a ratio of 2:1 fruit to chicken). I recommend sticking with homemade chicken. I have not tried other meat-based baby foods but given how Ella's Kitchen tends to be incredibly tasty, I can only imagine how bad other brands' food must be.

review/summary: Yummy Myntz!
review/text: These are delish little mints that are sugar free. They do NOT contain aspertame or sucralose. I was looking for mints which contained neither and this is them. I don't know why there is aspertame in gum and mints that is not a sugar-free product but there is. I won't go into a diatribe about sugar-free sweeteners.  Suffice to say that these mynts are great.  The regular flavor is quite strong, I like the vanillamynt blast the best.  Enjoy!

review/text: As someone who does not eat sugar and avoids most artificial sweeteners (like aspartame), I've had a hard time finding a tasty and effective breath mint.  I was so happy when I found Myntz.  Not only are the sugar free, but the sorbitol sweetener is actually good for dental health.  I like the touch of vanilla in this flavor; it smooths out the bite of the mint.  They do the job on my coffee breath, too!

review/summary: Aaah, Lindt
review/text: What's to say about Lindor Truffles?  Yum.  There isn't a bad flavor in the bunch, although I was genuinely surprised to find out Nestle is making Lindt products now.  You do have to make sure the truffles are kept at the right temperature - too cold and the truffle gets stiff, too warm and they get gloppy.  It's a shame they can't make them a little more stable, but hey, it's chocolate, so you can't complain too much.  This is a nice assortment of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, white chocolate, caramel and peanut butter.  The caramel and peanut butter are way too sweet and I suspect a recent addition due to the Nestle connection (not there years ago).  I'd like to see some of the fruit truffles added in the future, but overall, big thumbs up for the big, big bag of chocolate!

review/summary: lack of a center within the balls of candy
review/text: I was given some of this candy as a gift and liked it so much I wanted to share some with my family members during the holidays.  I ordered this bag from Amazon. When the bag came, I open it up as I found the bag a bit wore looking. I did not mind too much as I was going to create little bags out of the large bag. I ended up eating one... I glad I did. I was saved from giving a poor gift to my daughters.<br /><br />Found the inside of the ball had a large hole with only half of the smooth cream stuff the other candies had. Tried few more and found the same thing.  I ended up taking the candies to school and let my students have one on the last day before Christmas break... They all found the same thing.  Some had NO center of the cream at all. While the candy tasted ok - they were not the kind of candy I was looking for and were of a poor and inferior made.<br /><br />Would I buy this again?  NO WAY!

review/summary: Tremendous Truffles
review/text: .<br /><br />I am not allowed to eat much sugar.  My physicians insist that I should eat mostly  complex carbohydrates and protein.  So occasionally I treat myself to a small indulgence.  Recently I tried and reviewed  some chocolate candy and received a comment saying that Lindor Truffles are much better.  So, I had to try some.<br /><br />Lindt Lindor Truffles are marvelous.  I like the white chocolate, it melts in my mouth and leaves a darling after taste that lingers awhile.  The milk chocolate is divinely smooth and excites my tastebuds.  The peanut butter is very tasty.<br /><br />In general each of the five flavors is superior candy.  These chocolates are the best I have tried.  They are a spectacular treat that tickles the tastebuds and soothes the soul.<br /><br />I limit myself to only one truffle every few days.  That way they do not break my diet much while giving me incentive to continue my bland diet without complaint.<br />I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />.

review/text: Lindt Lindor chocolate is so yummy. There are five flavors that come in this bag; and I would say that there is not one type that is in this bag more than than the others. The flavors are very good. Just as others have explained there is a harder outer chocolate shell with chocolate truffle filling on the inside. One of my favorite flavors- hazelnut- is not included in this bag. However, my second favorite flavor is included in this bag. The white chocolate is very creamy and very smooth and is not a heavy flavor. I really like that flavor. However, all of the ones in this bag are yummy. A great mix and assortment for a party or other special event.

None of them think it tastes sugar free.  They go through 6 canisters in less than a month.  We now have 2 different flavors on subscribe and save, so that we can get 12 canisters per month delivered regularly.<br /><br />When made at full strength, I think it is too sweet.  I have a lower tolerance for intense sweetness than most people, though.  I like to use half of the recommended amount of powder when I make it for myself.  It has a nice flavor with no bitter aftertaste.

review/summary: Grape Kool-Aid
review/text: Have been purchasing the Grape and Cherry Sugar Free Kool-Aid on Amazon.com since the Spring of 2010 when I first saw that it was available here as I was thinking of the Grape Kool-Aid that I drank as a kid. Of course that Kool-Aid had to be mixed with Sugar. At my age of almost 60 I need to take in less Sugar then I did as a kid so I decided to give Sugar Free Grape and Cherry Kool-Aid a try and you know what it tastes just like the sugar version to me that I drank back in the day. Can't really tell the difference other then knowing it is Sugar Free. If you liked either the Grape or Cherry Kool-Aid as a kid give yourself a treat. Amazon.com has what you are looking for. Trust me you won't be sorry when you pour yourself a nice cold glass filled with either the Grape or Cherry Kool-Aid. Don't forget the ice but plenty good without it cold. A message to Amazon.com. I also liked the Strawberry Kool-Aid while growing up. Hopefully you will check with the makers of Kool-Aid to see if they have the Strawberry Sugar Free version available that you may want to also sell here at Amazon.com. I will be among one of your first buyers of that product if that happens.

review/summary: petroleum derived FD&C BLUE 1 = extreme GI issues
review/text: Over the years as a child my parents would send me to school and I was just fine until usually either lunch or a snack time with the school or a well-meaning room parent providing grape or fruity colored sugary drinks... or bright colorful candies.. or maybe mom splurged on those bright colorful cereals for breakfast. YUM!  Every kids dream, right?<br /><br />Well each  time I consumed some of these brightly colored cereals or pastries or drinks or candies, over the next few hours I would develop at least mild stomach pain. The deeper the color or the more I consumed, the worse the experience. Eventually it ended with me locked in the bathroom, doubled over in pain, for hours on end, as perplexed school officials called my parents to come get me, as I was AGAIN being sent home from school.  I was soo embarrassed. Pity the few subs who refused me a hall pass - I remember vomiting at my desk more than a few times to the stunned sub who hadn't realized how seriously I had GI issues. If I say I need a hall pass, I meant I *needed* a pass.<br /><br />Growing up as a teenager, dad remarried and my stepmother didn't buy much colorful "kids" drinks n such anymore. Wow, what a change, I even managed a year of perfect attendance! Me?! The kid who averaged 20+ days out sick from school had perfect attendance! My grades improved! I felt better....<br /><br />Then as a young adult, I was trying to kick the soda bucket and went back to the colorful sugary drinks of my youth. The abdominal pain and diarrhea was unreal. I began missing some college classes and my grades slipped. I was having some difficulty at work with a male boss who did not understand, he even implied I was lazy. Really? I was going to college full-time while working in a factory with forced overtime and tutoring on the side. It wasn't my fault I had a sensitive stomach....<br /><br />...until one day I was at home with one of the really bad episodes, doubled over in pain with diarrhea again and it suddenly hit upon me. GRAPE KOOL-AID.  I had consumed a whole pitcher of GRAPE KOOL-AID that day before getting ready for work (2nd shift). I read through the label... RED 40 and BLUE 1 stuck out...  so I stopped drinking grape Kool-aid and went back to Pepsi for awhile. Symptoms stabilized... until one day when I had a tuna lunchable. A small attack convinced me to read labels- there was BLUE 1 again.<br /><br />I was 25 years old when I made the "BLUE 1 DISCOVERY". I am now in my 40s. I have since learned to avoid lotions, mouthwash, dish soap, GRAPE KOOLAID and even "white marshmallows".  Since learning to avoid BLUE 1 including GRAPE KOOL-AID my life has significantly improved.<br /><br />I discovered very serious and relevant information about BLUE 1 from the FDA website... the term "BLUE 1" and "causally linked to fatalities" was significant enough for me that I wrote to the medical doctor who issued the press release; we shared a number of interesting email exchanges.<br /><br />I  have learned some "natural" brands of "children's cereals" are made with elderberry juice for coloring. I wish KOOL-AID would change to natural colors! (If using colors at all...) Oh and I kicked the soda bucket, too. I learned what fresh squeezed lemons mixed in a glass of water with d-ribose could do for both taste AND for energy. I feel so much better!

review/text: Sugar-free (Nutra-sweet) grape has been remade in a cannister form, similar to Crystal Light's packaging.  Each packet makes 2 quarts.<br /><br />This is a better value than what I buy at the store, even when it's on sale.  At the store it's 4 familiar looking packets in a box for $3.35; $2.50 on sale.  The Amazon product has 6 packets for $3.30; so it's like you're getting 2 packets free! I had free shipping because I'm a Prime member so it won't be as good a deal if there are shipping costs.<br /><br />Haven't seen this product in any grocery stores.
