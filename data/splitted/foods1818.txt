review/summary: Not a ringer for Nabisco!
review/text: I can't speak for anyone else, but I am most definitely not a spokesperson for Nabisco!  I love these cookies.  They are super yummy,not too sweet, not too "blah."  They do not taste like a "diet" cookie.  I like these as well, probably better, than your normal, everyday "who cares about weight" cookie.<br /><br />I will say this.  I am not a fan of marshmallow.  I don't like marshmallow peeps, marshmallow in cookies, marshmallow "moon pies," any of that. I DO however, like the marshmallow in these cookies.  So that said, it means the marshmallow in the Snackwells is very different than what you find in the above-mentioned snack/sweets.  Therefore if you do like the peeps, moonpies, etc., you may or may not like the Snackwells.  However, the marshmallow is such a small part of this cookie, I don't think it will matter.  The star of this show is the fudgy chocolate.<br /><br />For the person who felt the cookies were bad, I wonder if there could have been a small hole in the packaging and they were, in fact, stale.  I don't typically have any sitting around long enough to go stale, but when I do, they do lose their positive attributes!<br /><br />I think my only "complaint" about this cookie is the fact they are so good, I end up eating too many, taking away any advantage of the fewer calories they contain.

review/text: With all the talk of Snackwells being low in sugar, their cookies seem to be a little sweet on the flavoring side. I had several of these as a midday snack and my tongue didn't recover until early the next morning the things are so sweet. Don't munch on these before bed either, I guarantee you will up at least until the wee hours of the morning.

review/summary: Unbelievable....delicious!
review/text: It is always enjoyable to give praise to an exceptionable product. I ordered this flavor as well as English Toffee. Both are beyond ANY decaf whole bean coffee I have ever tried. They arrived promptly. They were packaged for shipping as though the seller placed a high value on his product and wanted it properly protected during shipping. It was. The package with the beans themselves was wonderful heavy foil backed by thick plastic on the other side. The beans were visible BUT the aroma was NOT. That meant the package was VERY well sealed. When I opened the pouches...oh man! The fragrance of each was smooth, subtle, and rich. Life is short. Do something for yourself or someone you care for and allow yourself a small treasure....a cup or two of this undeniable quality brew!

I was very surprised that these were excellent and I should have gotten more for him.  This is the first time my grandson has ever had a filled egg in his 11 yrs.  I have never seen them made in dairy free by anyone, so he always just had the Chocolate for Easter.  He ate these first.  He was so happy to have filled eggs like the rest of the kids.  Next time I will buy extra for the freezer.

review/text: I have been drinking this coffee for over 20 years and was so upset when Maxwell House stopped making it.  Thank goodness Maxwell House has reproduced the original recipe but, most stores are not carrying this product in Maine. (Target does carry it.)  I have made a personal commitment to remedy this problem by meeting with local grocery store managers and requesting they bring the Orange Cafe' back to the people who have delighted in this flavor for so many years.  Orange Cafe' is truly the best flavor of all the international coffee made by Maxwell House.

review/text: This is the original cheese that I liked as a kid. The Swiss gruyere or gretzer is a bit harder and less fragrant, I think. The French do great justice to this cheese, and it is versatile beyond calculation. Not only good alone on bread with an apple on the side, it is great in Fondue and superlative as a topping for cauliflower au gratin or any au gratin.

She's generally been happy, but I had yet to find anything I could enjoy with her.<br /><br />Well I've had such good luck with everything else I've bought from igourmet that I decided to give this a try. I  must admit I still like the Beemster xo double-aged gouda better, but this really is an excellent cheese with a very nice, complex taste. Even if you don't like swiss, give this a try!

When this roast is brewed correctly, there is just the hint of the dark side without any bitterness, but brewing this correctly has been elusive for me.  I think this roast is as close as you can get to brewing a full bodied cup of joe that is tasty, teases you with a hint of the dark side yet embraces the tranquility of Kona.

Unfortunately it is not even close.  There is black pepper in this sauce, but the flavor doesn't taste anything like the black pepper chicken sauce in the various restaurants we've been at.  I don't mind the taste, but my wife and kids don't like it at all.  If you are going for the restaurant flavor, this isn't it.  If you simply want a new sauce for chicken, this is an ok one.

review/summary: Made both of my dogs sick!!
review/text: I gave each of my two dogs one of these bones after I picked them up grocery shopping on Monday evening. By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding, of course) and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water. She had diarrhea on the carpet in MULTIPLE areas while I was at work, and then two more times during the night. She was very lethargic and unable to keep any food down at all. Meanwhile, my other dog has now gotten horrible diarrhea as well. Wednesday morning I made them some boiled eggs, but the one dog that was already throwing up ended up losing her breakfast a short while later. I gave her white rice with a little bit of chicken stock for dinner that night and she held that down. But sometime during the night, one of the dogs had diarrhea in the house again! Today is Thursday and both dogs are still loose, but (knock on wood)it seems like the vomiting is under control. I called the vet and she said to split an Immodium AD between the two of them and make sure they are drinking plenty of water, which they have been all through this debacle! I will keep my fingers crossed that my carpert will still be clean when I get home. I will never, ever buy another Hartz product again!

review/text: While lately at my Fresh and Easy  store, a British company, I picked up some imported (from England) Fox's Crunch Creams ginger cookies in  the 200g packet. Mmmmm. These are delicious!. The cookie part is very fresh and crunchy and the interior has a creamy ginger flavor, but is not too sweet. A serving amounts to two cookies and that's 150 calories with 72 of them as fat, so I'm going to have to watch myself. That'll be hard to do. These things are delicious!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I received this as a gag gift from my wife because I like gummy bears.  It's a great novelty gift and everyone that sees it is amazed by it.<br /><br />However, it's a litter harder to chew than a real gummy bear and the taste is a little off.  It doesn't taste *bad* but it doesn't taste like a normal red gummy bear.<br /><br />So I ate his ears and his arms off, and now he sits on my desk at work in his box as a conversation piece.<br /><br />So overall a good idea, just wish they could adjust the flavor a little to match the taste of a normal gummy bear.  Maybe one of the other flavors besides cherry do a better job at tasting normal, I don't know.

review/summary: Shep's Giant Gummy Bear
review/text: This was a great product. It provided at least two weeks' worth of eating pleasure, especially at night when I wanted something sweet, and I didn't want to go the vending machine to get a candy bar. Having this giant gummy was the second time in less than 6 months--the first flavor I had was grape, and I felt like it was eating 2 spoonfuls of grape jelly--the second flavor was cherry. The next time I'll order the product I'll order either the orange or lime flavor.

review/text: We purchased this Giant Gummy Bear in Cherry flavor for our son (who is 16 y/o) for Christmas.  He loves it...it is a bit difficult to cut but he is eating it up and sharing it with all of his friends!  The flavor is much better than the smaller gummies!  He is already talking about purchasing a blue one when he has eaten this one up!  Thanks so much...Great purchase!

review/text: I bought this for my girlfriend who loves gummy bears. She had never seen one before so I thought it would be great. The bear itself is a great idea simply because of its size, although I wish they tried harder to perfect the flavoring. I ordered the cherry one and neither of us were impressed with the flavor. She loved it for its novelty, as did I. I just wouldn't be able to recommend this simply because it doesn't taste good. I ended up bringing it to work and putting it on the break table (anything gets eaten there). If you are willing to spend $30 for novelty purposes, then I suppose its worth it.

review/text: I purchased four 5# gummy bears for our four boys and their families. The gummy bears were a huge hit! I purchased cherry, lime, lemon, and grape. Nobody mentioned an unusual taste and they are all gummy bear lovers. It's interesting how everyone is disecting the bear in different ways--face first, feet first, ears first, and so on. Maybe for Halloween I should consider purchasing the large gummy snake...

It might actually taste better than smaller gummy bears simply because you can get a really good bite out of it!<br /><br />It looks great coming out of the packaging. I was worried that it would just look like a glob of gummy, but it couldn't have looked more like a gummy bear than it did!<br /><br />We kept it fresh by storing it in a big freezer bag and a week and a half later it tasted just the same as the day we unwrapped it.<br /><br />Great gift idea and absolutely scrumptious!

review/text: I am trying to take off a few pounds, and have started to keep a food log, which requires that I have know how many calories are in each meal and plan my meals in advance. One of my standbys for breakfast is Quaker Instant Oatmeal, which I eat five mornings a week. Breakfast consists of two packets of Quaker Instant Oatmeal, which is 320 calories and a good percentage of my carb intake for the day. Add a little soy milk and some real maple syrup, and this keeps me satisfied until lunchtime at about 400 calories. The oatmeal is has a benefit to cholesterol management, as well providing some carbs for fuel for the morning. I've tried several brands, and the Quaker has always had a more substantial "feel" to it, sort of like "real" oatmeal. The budget brands have always had a tendency to "clump up" onme, for some reason. I don't just recommend it, I like the stuff!<br /><br />Also check out the high fiber version: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JXLZG">Quaker Oatmeal Instant Oatmeal High Fiber Maple & Brown Sugar 12.6 Oz - 12 Pack</a>.

review/text: I purchased these at approx $2.50 per box_a great price with free s/h. I sent these to my senior parents house during the cold months- oatmeal is good to naturally lower cholesterol. has fruit with the raisin and dates. extra protien and healthy oils with the walnuts_ and the blend of all those items makes for a wonderful bowl of hot cereal_ it's the closest you will probably get to a healthy raisin/walnut/oatmeal cookie- in regards to this products taste. my almost 80 year old parents enjoy it very much and it was ez for them to make and clean up. added benefit of lowering cholesterol (when eaten regularly), and great source of fiber for healthy bowel movements. it's shelf stabile, long shelf life, good for emergency preparedness kits, college kids that have something to boil water with and a bowl and spoon- will probably appreciate the quick, healthy, tasty breakfast_ but can be eaten any time of day of course. so if you can get it here for less than you can get it at the store (or even same price as store)- i would order extra- you don't have to go out to get it. it's delivered to your door. it's always good to have extra food in the pantry. another food that's good to donate to food banks, food drives.<br />i would have ordered the sugar-free apple-cinnamon from here but it was too expensive_ i found it for $10 for 4 boxes at meijer dot com_ so it's good to compare.<br /><br />it's a good idea to send food to your senior parents or disabled friends and relatives_ incase they can't get out by themselves, don't drive, can't carry much. i send assorted varieties of canned and boxed foods to my older parents during winter months- incase of storms and they can't get out. or if their aches and pains prevent them from going out. or incase they're sick and can't get out. it makes me feel better knowing i can have a variety of food stuffs delivered to their front door- and their pantry will be stocked up.<br />so if you're not ordering for yourself- think if there might be someone else you can help out.

review/text: This is the best tasting instant oatmeal I've ever eaten.<br /><br />I find that most instant oatmeal products have a sticky texture and taste like glue. No so with this flavor. The raisens, dates and walnuts make a perfect combination. It tasted good even without adding milk which was a plus because I could take it to work for breakfast. It's easy to make with hot water from the microwave.<br /><br />I first found this flavor oatmeal at my grocery store and then was dismayed that they didn't carry it on a regular basis. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and at price that was cheaper than my local store.

review/summary: Stick-to-your-ribs goodness ...
review/text: This is one of my favorite instant oatmeal flavors (the other is McCann's Apple).  I love the mixture of dates, raisins and crunchy walnuts, and the ease of preparation makes it a great choice for those mornings when I just don't have a lot of time to spend putting breakfast together.<br /><br />From a diet standpoint, it's not *too* bad, really.  It's definitely filling, so I don't feel tempted to snack between breakfast and lunch.  I keep this on hand all the time.

review/summary: Love it but too sweet
review/text: Raisins, walnuts and cinnamon!<br /><br />Plenty of each<br /><br />Found it too sweet so I mix the packet with plain old rolled oats in milk<br /><br />If you have a sweet tooth, great.<br />If you're like me, reduced sugar options would be better.<br /><br />Also, took me like 2 minutes in the microwave with cold milk to make. Fast and easy! Perfect for breakfast on the go

review/text: This is my favorite flavor and also the one that makes me feel the most satified, there is something to chew rather not just oatmeal (I also have a major sweet tooth which this is good to help curb).<br /><br />I have ordered a couple of times through the subscribe and save and have had no problems with their arriving intact - a bit slower at times then other subscribe items - but within reasonable time.

review/summary: Really Delicious ... Awesome Price!
review/text: I've never seen this flavor in a grocery store, but it appealed to me right away when I saw it here on Amazon, while looking for items to stock up for for a quick healthy meals at my desk. I've ordered it twice now, and it's the perfect thing for an easy breakfast or even a late night snack with a cup of tea. It's not overly sweet, but the added dates, raisins & walnuts give it the perfect flavor. Also, the price is more than reasonable for four full-size boxes ... I will admit that I have been disappointed on occasion in my search for healthy and satisfying options at a reasonable price, but this time? Amazone did it right! Thank you!

review/text: This stuff is addicting.  It has a touch of hops with a strong chocolaty sweet flavor.  Only problem is the price here.  Anywhere you buy it online is going to be pricey, but after shipping this comes out to just over $4 a bottle.  If you do a google search, you'll find another site (everythingtrini) that sells a 24 pack for $30 with $30 shipping.  Still pricy, but comes out to about $2.50 a bottle.

review/summary: My Dog Loves Them!!
review/text: For the price you cannot beat these things, they are a great alternative to regular rawhide, and they are rolls which is great for dogs who dont like the knots on the end of regular hide bones.  Our Golden carries it around and tries to hide it for the first few days then eats them, they last a good amount of time.  She usually takes a few hours once she gets started on it to finish one.  We have started taking it away after she gets about half way cause they are pretty big, perfect for a medium to large size dog!

review/summary: Packaging and Shipping, 5 stars...Cheese will likely please Gorgonzola fans
review/text: I must say how impressed I was with how IGourmet ships its cheese. The cheese is shipped in a styrofoam container with ice packs, to keep the cheese fresh during shipping. The package is Fedexed to ensure freshness. A note in the box mentioned how during summer months, they often pack in dry ice instead of ice packs. Either way, they make a serious effort to ensure your items arrive fresh and ready to eat.<br /><br />The cheese, itself, was not to my taste. This was an expiremental purchase, as I had not tasted Dolce Gorgonzola before. This cheese does not have the same bite as the gorgonzola that most US folks are familar with. The dolce tends to be more tangy rather than sharp. The texture is smooth, almost that of a chevre type cheese, and can be easily spread. It was sampled with fresh french bread, which suited this type of cheese well as its flavor did not compete but rather complimented the cheese. Though I didn't personally like it, that is more because my tastes tend to goat and sharp chedder type cheeses rather than blue family cheeses. If you are a fan of gorgonzola though, then it is definately worth a try.<br /><br />As far as ordering from IGourmet, I was very satisfied. Their selection is broad, packing superb, and their customers include the wine shop that I frequent. That alone is recommendation enough for me, but my experience with their cheeses has always been fascinating. Some tasted good, some not so good, and some were spectacular. And that, is ultimately the beauty of exploring the world of cheese.

review/text: Grafton Village has done a great job with their Maple Smoked Cheddar.  The smoked flavor was not overpowering, and it made an excellent grilled cheese sandwich on whole grain bread, and was also great grated over a spinach and arugula salad.  There are a lot of smoked cheeses out there, and this is one of the better ones.

review/summary: Great pasta!
review/text: I have used a whole variety of linguine over time.  But this is one of the better exemplars.  9 minutes and al dente.  Great!<br /><br />I married into an Italian family and have been entrusted with preparing the family "gravy" recipe most Sundays. A little spaghetti sauce, a little marinara sauce, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, garlic, Italian seasoning, a bit of red wine. Fry up meatballs or pork and add them to the mix. Blend all ingedients together, cook over very low heat for a while.<br /><br />Then, serve the "gravy" over the Barilla linguine.  Yummy! And, better still, you can use this for one or more dinners during the week! Barilla is well worth looking at if you want some good pasta!

Each section is individually vacuum-sealed.  They do come with the skin, and some bones, but bones add flavour.  I use mine to make soup, as well as red beans and rice.  Simmer them for a couple of hours, then the meat falls off the bones and shreds.  Not too salty, but very tasty.  In the winter when I do lots of soup making, I'll use a couple of these a week.  I've also used the ham steaks, and they are good as well.
