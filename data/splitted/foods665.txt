review/text: My girls love raisins as a snack, so we have these on subscribe and save.  Our first batch was perfect- juicy, soft, and sweet raisins.  Kids ate them up.  This shipment, however, I have been disappointed.  Every box we've opened has been full of dry, hard, and very light colored raisins.  They still get eaten, but I'm hesitant to order again.

review/text: These Sun Maid organic raisins are very tasty and moist. I have not found any problems with them and love that the packages are the perfect size for sticking in my purse. I usually combine these raisins with some cashews, almonds, and walnuts or pecans for a quick, nutritious snack or eat in my organic oatmeal for breakfast.

review/text: I was a little nervous at first, trying out this pasta, but it was DIVINE!  I looove this pasta, and have purchased all different varieties/shapes that they have.  Yes, as other person said, do not boil it for the same duration as you're used to boiling regular pasta.  Taste is EXCELLENT, and it's an added plus that they are using rice made in the US, or Can.  One of the two (I believe it was US, but can't remember which one exactly)...I called the company to inquire.  Fantastic product.  If they only made this with organic now..... :)

I have switched our whole family over to it because it is healthier than regular pasta and it tastes great, even though only one of us needs a gluten free diet.  All of the Tinkyada pastas are great. I recommend to everyone without the slightest reservation.  I buy it by the case so we never run out.

review/text: I cooked these for 16 minutes on medium high and rinsed well after draining. These noodles are thick, squishy, and chewy. That might not be what you're looking for in a pasta noodle, but these reminded me of udon noodles I had before going gluten free. As someone who used to love wheat based udon noodles, Takyada noodles are really great. That's why I still give these 4 stars.

review/text: I am allergic to wheat and thought i would die, Italian food was my favortie. All rice pastas are mushy and taste much like health food. This one is far better than all of the rest. The first time I had it, I actually had to check the package to make sure it was Rice and not Wheat. My husband even ate it(without knowing) and didn't notice anything. I would recommend to anyone. It is also half the price on amazon with no shipping so it pays to buy it online. Also, make sure to follow the cooking instructions and rinse very well to get all of the starch off.

The consistency of this pasta is suprisingly good, and really, it is NOT MUSHY.  Follow the instructions i.e cook for 16 minutes then rinse under the tap.  It comes out perfect every time.  It doesnt have a particular strong taste therefore kids wont be able to tell the difference, I couldn`t either.  For those who need to avoid wheat this is a perfect substitute.  This product comes in a pack of pack of 12, so please bear this in mind when you place your order.

We have five kids.  Three out of five can't tell the difference.  One hates all pasta and the other will eat it as long as their is sauce on it.  We make a big batch and reheat in the microwave.  It holds up nicely and doesn't dry out like regular pasta.  Highly recommend if you are looking for an alternative to regular noodles.

review/summary: Tinkyada Brown Rice gluten free products are great!
review/text: Tinkyada Brown Rice gluten free products are simply some of the best imitations of wheat noodles.  Our one child has gluten sensitivities so we're switched to some alternatives.  Tinkyada is one of the best finds.  The noodles cook over a reasonable length of time (around 15-17 minutes) and have a firm texture and a taste that is quite indistinguishable from regular noodles.  We've enjoyed the noodles with spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, and casseroles.  For texture and taste these cannot be beat for those needing something gluten free due to Celiac disease or other reasons.  Everyone in the family is willing to eat these noodles.  There is a slight taste difference when tried side by side with regular noodles but not pronounced at all unlike the yucky after taste of noodles made from bean flour.

When I serve it to my gluten-eating friends and family, they take a bite and say, "oh, too bad you can't eat this..." SURPRISE! GF doesn't have to mean icky-tasting! :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) There's LOTS more great stuff from Tinkyada you can get here (and prices here beat the other online GF grocers as of 3/2008).

The fettucini is wonderful as well as the spaghetti.<br />If one did not know it was not "regular" pasta, they would not tell the difference. It does not get mushy although it takes alittle longer to cook and you need to stir it often so it doesn't get stuck together. I ordered a case of 12 because whenver you have to have a special diet the costs in the health food stores can be outrageous, and this way you get a better price (even with shipping)

review/summary: Not bad as a subsitute, but not the best
review/text: Before being GF, my main pastas were DiCecco, a common imported brand which cooks up authentically al dente, and Barilla, which in American comes from the mid-west (not as good as the real-Italian Barilla that we don't import).  Tinkyada pasta has a pretty strong brown rice tase and a slightly off aftertaste.  The texture is a little slippery, and it disintegrates a bit while cooking.  It's still pretty good if you serve it with a sauce that you would put on a plate of brown rice, i.e., a sauce with its own texture and assertive flavor.  It's not as good if the pasta is the star of the dish.  Of the brands I've tried, Jovial is by far the best.  The brown rice taste is minimal, even nice, and it cooks more al dente than the regular wheat American brands.

review/summary: No need to miss wheat spaghetti anymore
review/text: I highly recommend this to anyone who eats a gluten-free diet. Other than price, it stacks up quite well to wheat spaghetti, though the taste is slightly different. My pasta-loving kids eat it happily and I can enjoy "spaghetti night" with them now. The texture is very good with either the normal or energy-saving cooking directions. However, I've found that there are a few things that make a difference in the final quality.<br /><br />First, regardless of which cooking method you use, after you add the pasta to the boiling water, STIR until you're sure all of the noodles are completely separated. If you don't separate them when you first add them to the boiling water, they might stick together and not cook properly. (This is true of wheat spaghetti, too, but the Tinkyada pasta seems a little more prone to it.) After they are all separate, you don't have to stir again if you're using the energy-saving method. With the normal method, I recommend a quick occasional stir to make sure none of the noodles are sticking to the bottom of the pot.<br /><br />Second, don't skimp on the rinsing. You'll see the water goes very cloudy when the pasta cooks - a lot of starch is being released into the water. You have to get that rinsed off or the pasta will stick together after you drain it. If you do the rinsing right, it won't stick together - even leftovers that have been refrigerated won't be sticky.  The cold water rinse seems to be particularly important. Since I like to serve spaghetti noodles hot, I start rinsing with cold water and then finish with hot water. The result is hot spaghetti with no stickiness.<br /><br />Third, unless you're on a low-sodium diet, I recommend salting the cooking water as directed on the package. Salting improves the taste (it's slightly sweet if you don't salt the cooking water) and it also seems to improve the texture slightly.<br /><br />About the energy-saving cooking method: This is great in the summer time since you can turn off the burner sooner and not dump as much heat into the house. But when it's time to rinse you may find that not only is the water very cloudy, but a skin of starch has developed on the surface of the water. It's not pretty, but it rinses right off. (I mentioned this because it freaked my husband out the first time he saw it; I thought I'd save someone else from that surprise.)

review/summary: I am VERY Picky About Texture
review/text: I have heightened sensitivity to touch/texture. It can make enjoying food a little difficult sometimes unless the texture is JUST RIGHT.<br /><br />And this pasta, in my opinion, is great.<br /><br />I cooked it according to the energy-saver directions (where you boil water, place noodles in, cook for a couple minutes and then turn OFF stove, cover and let sit for 20 minutes). The package says it can withstand a lot of overcooking, but they were a TAD mushy when made this way. They were still VERY tasty, despite being a tiny bit too soft. (I would have subtracted 1/2 star for this, but since we can't do that I decided it was still worth the 5 stars)<br /><br />It had a nice flavor too. Slightly sweet and mild, it's best when you salt the water- it balances this out nicely. The price may seem expensive to some, but my husband is very picky about pasta and usually wants us to buy a certain brand that is just about the same price as this stuff- so it's not much of a difference for us.<br /><br />MOST importantly, after eating a fair amount, I did NOT feel "bloaty" like I usually do after eating wheat pasta. I felt very satisfied without feeling overfull.<br /><br />I don't know, my husband is one of the pickiest eaters when it comes to pasta and even HE liked it.<br /><br />I think next time I will just cook it a little less. Will definitely be getting this on a regular basis now.

review/summary: A blessing for gluten-intolerant folks
review/text: My husband is wheat-intolerant, and I'm always looking for healthy alternatives. Most of the gluten-free pastas I've tried had been just awful, until a friend recommended the Tinkyada brand. It's easy to cook, and has a taste and texture so close to ordinary pasta that most folks can't tell the difference when it's smothered in pasta sauce. (Some of the pasta shapes -- like the lasagna noodles -- tend to fall apart more easily than their wheat counterparts, but still taste great.)<br /><br />I don't have a problem with wheat or gluten, but I do face a challenge managing my blood cholesterol, and Tinkyada pastas -- made from brown rice with added rice bran for fiber -- are much better for me than ordinary (refined) wheat pastas.<br /><br />The one problem with Tinkyada products is their price. As of now (August 2012), the price for a 16 oz package of spaghetti in our local health food stores is close to $5 USD. I was happy to see the product available in cases of a dozen at a significant discount. It's still pricier than wheat semolina pasta, but much more affordable.

review/text: Best brown rice pasta that I ever tasted! It's not mushy at all as you may concern it may be when it comes to rice pasta. Flavor, taste, texture, and pretty much everything, I prefer this pasta over regular pasta! I don't have any problem with wheat or anything, but I keep buying this pasta after I tried once. Great with any kind of pasta dish, creamy or tomato-based. Totally recommended!

review/summary: Wow I love this pasta!
review/text: I am not gluten intolerant nor is anyone in my family but we thought we'd try to reduce the amount of gluten in our diets. I tried this pasta not knowing what to expect. We actually tried the white rice version and the brown rice version (in separate dishes) and we LOVED IT. The kids couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />The one thing I did notice about it is that it is more filling than traditional pasta. So I didn't need as much pasta on my plate to be full (which I also liked). We're switching to this pasta for everything not because we have to but because we love it!

review/summary: We Love it!
review/text: I was diagnosed with gluten intolorence 7 months ago and have had fun trying to find all of the gluten things that taste good and have ran across all the things that taste bad untill now! Our family has some kind of pasta atleast once a week and had a melt down when we didnt think it would happen anymore. Finally I was in a health food store and ran across a long time celiac and she told me about this pasta. The entire family loves this pasta including a very picky husband and very picky 4 and 6 year olds. I live in a small town and after many requests the local store started to carry this for me and the local gf group and they cant keep it on the shelves. I have yet to try the other pastas by this company but I trust they will be good to. The sticky issue I never have bacause I usually add plenty of water and a little oil. love this pasta and always have atleast 2 or three packs stowed away in the pantry!

review/text: I can't emphasize how happy I am that I found Tinkyada. For years I haven't been able to enjoy pasta without the side effects that gluten sensitivity can bring on. I also searched fruitlessly for a good substitute, but alas everything tasted like something from a different planet. Yech.<br /><br />Then came Tinkyada :) It cooks just like regular wheat pasta, and the texture, taste, consistency is the same. I've made this numerous times for people without telling them that it's gluten-free pasta, and they never suspected a thing (always a fun thing to see their post-meal astonishment).<br /><br />Quick weeknight meals are back again :)

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: My attempts to find a healthy alternative to regular pasta were to no avail until I found this "brown rice" pasta in the organic section of my local Publix Supermarket. I had already tried "whole wheat" pasta and even though I eat, and actually prefer, whole wheat products like pizza and breads, the TEXTURE of the spaghetti was awful. I found whole wheat egg noodles and that was better, but I missed the look and twirl of spaghetti. I saw this; I like brown rice, it's organic, it looked edible as I measured it up in my mind and, alright, I put it into my shopping cart. I followed the instructions and boiled it for 16 minutes. I rinsed it well with cold water and added it to a large hot frying pan which had olive oil. After mixing for a minute and a half, I added Lucini  brand marinara and mixed it, covered it and, when hot, ate it. My review, excellent; be proud to serve and not have to apologize that it's healthy.<br />Like that old TV commercial used to say, "Try It, You'll Like It."

review/summary: Best gluten-free pasta we've tried
review/text: I've known about my celiac disease for over 25 years, tried many brands and varieties of gluten free pasta, and Tinkyada - hands down - has the best in this variety and all others they make.  It's not particularly sticky, and very much like "regular" semolina pasta in texture.  The taste is excellent.  My (non-celiac) wife loves it!  She doesn't even bother making two different pots of pasta anymore because she finally found one of "my" pastas that was quite satisfactory for her too.  I don't feel like I'm giving up ANYthing with Tinkyada's products over what I used to to eat in my "BC" (Before Celiac) days.<br /><br />One other nice feature is the price.  It seems to be a bit more expensive than some other gluten free pasta products, but compare the price AND the weight.  Once both are taken into consideration, I've found that Tinkyada doesn't cost much if any more than the much less desirable brands of gluten free pasta, and it's often less expensive.  This truly earns 5 stars, and I try to reserve that for the best of the best.

review/summary: a poor substitute
review/text: Honestly, I cant understand why this pasta gets such high marks.  I tried it and it is nowhere close to normal pasta.<br /><br />Since being told I have to be gluten free, finding a good pasta substitute has been difficult.<br />All these rice pasta brands are glue-y, sticky and slimey in texture.  this one is a little less so but it still has that wierd slimy, sticky quality.  the rice noodles are pasty colored too.  not appetizing at all.  And all this gluten free marketed stuff is hideously expensive so trying all the different brands gets costly.<br /><br />I have found the quinoa+corn based noodles to be the closest thing to real pasta -- The texture is much better.  I'm still trying to find something I can live with but so far, the quinoa pasta seems to be the most acceptable.

review/summary: Not Bad - But Not So Good Either
review/text: The reviews were so good I just had to try this - and the result was the usual fat cold noodles tasting like rice (i.e., nothing much).  Tinkyada isn't any worse than any of the others - but I find the thickness of conventional spaghetti makes the rice taste much more noticeable.  Take this with a grain of salt, since I preferred vermicelli even before I went on a gluten-free diet (about 15 years ago), but to me, vermicelli works a lot better than conventional spaghetti, because it's thinner, making the taste (or lack thereof) less noticeable when coated with sauce.  People not on the diet notice the pasta when I use rice spaghetti, but no one has ever found fault with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLXSS">Ener-G Foods Rice Vermicelli, 10.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> I used to use, or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IAIOS">Annie Chun's Brown Rice Noodle, Pad Thai, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> (more like linguini) I've been using in place of spaghetti recently.  I still buy the Tinkyada spaghetti to use in soups - fine for chicken noodle soup, etc. - but am going back to the above products that I've been using quite happily as spaghetti for years.  Not only is the rice taste less noticeable, but the vermicelli cooks in 4 minutes or so - 1/3 the time it takes to cook Tinkyada spaghetti.  (Given my attention span, this also makes it easier for me not to forget and overcook it into a gooey mess.)

review/summary: The Hype is Excessive
review/text: I really have to question the bias of the people who wrote the previous 25 reviews.  They must have been Tinkyada employees, friends, or family because there is no way that it tastes five-stars.<br /><br />To be fair, I do eat gluten and it is my wife who has the gluten allergy.  So I do have my own biases as I eat gluten on a daily basis.  My wife tells me that she forgets what gluten tastes like after months of going on the gluten-free diet, and she is able to eat alternatives that I believe do not taste as good as the wheat-full version.  However, my wife is not particularly fond of this product either.<br /><br />Based on the reviews, I bought this thinking this spaghetti was going to taste exactly the same as regular pasta, but the consistancy, though constant, is kind of slimy.  Additionally, the "energy saving method" turns the pasta especially gooey, so I do not recommend that method of cooking should you be persuaded based on the other 25 reviews.<br /><br />There are lots of other gluten-free pastas out there, like corn-based, or a mixture of potato, soy, and rice that taste a lot closer to the "real-thing."  I haven't found too many alternatives on Amazon yet, but my local grocery store has a few and my wife prefers them over this brand.  So at the moment, I have 11 packets of gluten-free spaghetti that I would be happy to get rid of.

review/summary: You better like your pasta AL DENTE, otherwise forget it ..
review/text: Most of the grocery stores in my neighborhood sell this product, so I've been buying it locally for the past year. I really enjoyed it up until recently.<br />Tonite, I realized there are two things I don't like about this pasta.<br />#1 - It takes too long to cook.  I have to boil it for at least 20 minutes to get it the texture I like.  That's a long time when you can boil angel hair pasta in 6 minutes and stir fry some veggies in less than 2 miinutes.<br />#2 - Even after 20 minutes of boiling, this pasta is super AL DENTE.  It just always seems like it's not cooked enuf.<br />I wish they had a thin angel hair version.<br />I couldn't even finish my dinner tonite.  After boiling 20 minutes, this stuff was just too hard. It was almost as gross as eating UNDERCOOKED rice.  Yes, it is gluten-free, but, it's got a thick, starchy texture that I can't stand chewing and it takes too long to cook.<br />IMHO, corn-quinoa pasta is better.<br /><br />Edit:  6-28-12<br />Tinkyada's FETTUCCINI in the red package is better.

review/summary: Not even close!
review/text: I bought this thinking it would be nice to eat a spaghetti that was gluten free and not expensive. I bought a few packages because I always follow the package directions first, then I play with it if it's not to my liking.<br /><br />Attempt 1 was like eating a gummy spaghetti noodle with a nasty after taste. I had to add sauce and butter to kill the taste.<br /><br />Attempt 2 wasn't any better. It was still gummy and gluey like and the flavor wasn't very good either.<br /><br />Attempt 3 was a little better in that the water didn't look like a gelatin style mess when we drained it but the noodles were chewy and I couldn't finish the second bite.<br /><br />Attempt 4 was when I finally said no more "pasta joy". I ended up trying to cook it by breaking the noodles in half first, thinking maybe it just isn't that great for cooking as long noodles. Oh no. I ended up having to take out clumps of noodles, tear them apart from each other and put them back in the pot. I gave up towards the end and just threw the clumps of noodles out. The texture was slimy, gummy and sticky and the aftertaste is still like pet food.<br /><br />If you are used to over cooked spaghetti drowned in sauce, I could see how this would be great... But if you want something that tastes and acts like spaghetti, this is NOT it.<br /><br />I can't figure out how this got 5 stars. It was horrible in taste and texture and was nothing close to spaghetti. I bought Hodgkins Mills rice and flaxseed noodles and they are perfect in texture and taste. But I won't buy pasta joy again.

Nice flavor, too.<br /><br />Before I ate gluten-free, I used to eat 100% whole wheat pasta. This is nowhere near as flavorful (and is softer in texture), but I've gotten used to it. If you like white/refined/semolina wheat pasta, there will be less adjusting to do (regarding taste.) This pasta definitely has more flavor than white rice pastas, and it really does hold up much better in cooking.

review/summary: Glute Free Spaghetti
review/text: I really like this product especially since I can't have wheat. The flavor and texture are great. One word to note though is you should eat it the same same day you make it. It holds it's texture better that way. Otherwise it tends to brake down into smaller pieces the next day. Also, I found the best way to cook this is by boiling it for two minutes and then letting it sit in the hot water with a cover for 15-20 minutes (depending on how you may like the texture to be). This seems to be a fail proof way of making it. I found if you boil it for the whole 15-20 minutes it has a tendency to become mushy and breaks apart easier. Otherwise it a very good alternative to wheat spaghetti.

review/summary: Tankyada spaghettis
review/text: Tankyada spaghettis are first quality. My husband has celiac disease and has to eat a gluten free diet, which can be a real pain. We have purchased other brands of pasta before. They turned into mush and were very sticky.<br />So we purchased Tankyada spaghettis from Amamzon, and we are thrilled.<br />They don't stick together and are easy to serve, if one follows the directions. My advice is: If there are leftovers, please, rinse them in cold water again, drain and store in the refrigerator.<br />I hope my review will help others.

review/summary: Finally a wheat free pasta to love!
review/text: YES, you can have yummy pasta!!Love, love ,love it!! just remember to boil it in lots of water then rinse it when it is done to your liking. No one even guessed that it was not regular pasta in my house. I am so glad it is here so that I can get a better deal as it is well worth it in my opinion. To use leftover pasta drop into boiling water quickly and strain and its ready for another meal. The rotini is great too but I have not tried any others from this brand yet. Enjoy

review/text: I've started buying this in bulk from Amazon because it seems to be the only GF pasta that works.  Others fall apart or are simply awfultasting in addition to being overpriced. I have to keep telling my mother in law not to buy the little $4 a bag GF pasta she buys because I've found the one that works.  If you follow the "energy saving" method, it works even better.  That way the pasta isn't torn up by all the boiling.

review/text: Tinkyada is the best brand for gluten-free pasta we have found so far - and I'm not inclined to keep looking, it's that good!  It's made of rice and bran, instead of wheat, so of course it will taste differently, and cook differently, than what some people are used to when they first switch over to wheat-free, but it's thoroughly delicious.  Also, let me say again that it is (hands down) the best brand we've found for gluten-free pastas!

review/summary: The only gluten-free pasta worth eating
review/text: Since I developed a wheat allergy I've tried every gluten-free pasta out there. Most are gross- they either have a strange taste of corn or beans or they get mushy or have some other weird texture. The leftovers have a tendency to turn to a weird sort of paste. Yuck!<br /><br />This stuff, however, is fantastic! You must follow the directions correctly but if you do it has a great texture that is close to regular pasta. While the flavor is obviously slightly different than regular pasta I've served it to people with a properly seasoned sauce who said it was better than regular pasta. It holds up, covered in sauce, as well for leftovers as regular pasta.<br /><br />I especially love the spaghetti with a homemade marinara sauce and the lasagna noodles made in the best lasagna recipe EVER [...] though I alter the recipe a bit by making extra sauce, baking a little longer, and don't bother pre-cooking the noodles.<br /><br />I'm LOVING that I can buy in bulk from Amazon, at a much cheaper price than my local health food store.

review/summary: No More Feeling Sorry for Yourself!
review/text: After being diagnosed with Celiac, I tried many, many brands of pasta. They were all a disappointment. Grainy, squishy, and if they even got slightly cool they'd harden up. Or they'd just fall apart in the pot if they weren't carefully watched.<br />Then an online friend recommended Tinkyada.<br />I bought a package. Just one. I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. My non GF'ers in the house couldn't even tell the difference from their regular pasta. The taste, texture, and ability to be al dente unlike most other GF pasta's makes this pasta the King of All GF Pasta's in my house. We've tried all the various pasta's that Tinkyada makes by this point and not a single one has disappointed us.<br />The ONLY con to this pasta is if you don't use it all at once, and refrigerate it for later. It tends to get stiff and grainy feeling. However, my 15 yo GF daughter microwaves the pasta for a couple minutes with about a TB of water and then puts them in a microwave safe dish to take to school for lunch. Just those few minutes with some extra water fixes the issue no problems.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend this pasta to anyone struggling with a gluten-free diet. This pasta absolutely replaces all gluten containing pasta's, especially with how very many varieties Tinkyada makes! No more feeling sorry for yourself or your child with yucky pasta.

review/summary: REAL pasta at last!
review/text: I've been gluten free for almost 20 years and a cook forever but since I discovered the Tinkyada pastas I'm actually having fun making pasta again. This summer I treated guests from out of town to a picnic featuring pasta salad - no one guessed the dish was gluten free. I've made mac and cheese to die for! And spaghetti? Wow! Don't get me started. Don't know how they do it but this stuff beats the heck out of any gluten free pasta I've ever used. Was ready to order a couple of cases from the factory in Canada until I discovered I could order it on Amazon.

review/summary: Unbelievably Good for Gluten Free
review/text: The only difference between this brand and "regular" noodles is the cooking time. I made these terrified they would be awful, and delighted that my husband actually liked it more than regular pasta. (He doesn't have to be gluten free, so if he likes it, that's a good thing!)<br /><br />When you're cooking these, you'll notice the water gets really white, so be sure you rinse it off and they do tend to take a little longer to cook than traditional wheat pastas. When you think they are done, take a bite of them to make sure they're not too "al dente". Once they are cooked, they have the exact same color and texture you'd expect.<br /><br />The price here is pretty good, especially if you have to travel a distance to find them near you - if 12 is too many, split the case with a gluten free friend or two.

review/summary: Best GF Pasta Brand
review/text: Tinkyada makes the best gluten free pasta. It's relatively inexpensive, takes the same amount of prep as any other pasta, and typically people won't notice the difference between this and conventional pasta. Make sure you add a splash of olive oil before boiling the water to prevent sticking. Also, stirring frequently prevents the pasta from sticking together, too. All of Tinkyada's varieties of pastas are great, even the stuffed shells and lasagna.

review/summary: Don't even bother to try another brand!
review/text: My family has been on the gluten-free diet for the past nine years. I have spent literally hundreds of dollars trying out various brands of wheat/gluten free pasta - that have generally ended up in the trash. I even quit trying to find a good substitute for a long time. UNTIL a friend suggested I try this brand. I was skeptical, but it tasted great. It won the approval of every member of the household, even my husband who isn't gluten intolerant.<br /><br />I have tried 6 shapes of the pasta and they have all been consistently good. I can make spaghetti, mac & cheese, casseroles, lasagna and all of the other foods we used to enjoy before going GF. I follow the cooking times listed on the package, and I have never had a problem with mushiness, or the pasta being undercooked in the center. If I am going to bake the pasta after I've boiled it, I cut down on the boil time by 2-3 minutes. There is NO CORN in this pasta, so if that is  concern for you - know that you can purchase this!<br /><br />I really do love these pastas and I hope your family will too!

review/summary: Best gluten free pasta. Your kids will love it.
review/text: Being gluten free can be a challange to find products that can be fun to eat not just a substitute that reminds you that you are being deprived of what everyone else eats. So far, (and I have tried several) Tinkyada is the only GF pasta that I have found that is close in texture and fun as wheat spaghetti and I am including other pasta shapes in this review. My husband even likes it and I have served GF pasta with chicken and sauce over it to guests and they were suprised it was GF. It doesn't bloat you like wheat pasta. You just feel comforatbly full after a big wad of "sketti". One downside of any of the GF pastas is that they are stiff and breakable when cold so it is hard to use them for cold pasta salad. However, I had some that I had overcooked a little and that seemed to work pretty well for cold salad. You will have to experiment for yourself with that. At any rate, I would definitely suggest you try the spaghetti especially if you have a child who is gluten free. Also the pasta will make great mac and cheese.

However, she was started to get a little chunky, so thought switching her to the "light" version  might be a better option.  I was initially worried because she has an insanely sensitive digestive system, but I've seen no problem thus far, and I've been using them for over a week.  She doesn't seem to notice a difference at all, and I feel comfortable knowing I'm not overfeeding her (in order to assuage my guilt for leaving in the first place!) I would definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: great little healthy treats
review/text: We have two yorkies, one is very picky and one whom we nicknamed a porkie yorkie will eat anything.<br />They both love these. We do not give them one everyday, because we like to give them variety. We do treat them like our kids. The Lite is for the tubby little one, she is 4 and the picky one is 12. They are so spoiled that we have at least 10 different treats for them to keep them happy. And boy it is hard to find treats made in USA!  We have been giving our babies these treats since our 12 year old was a puppy, the vet says she has the best teeth of any 12 year old yorkie she has ever seen. The little one is no slouch either.<br />But Yorkies are nortorious for getting bad teeth. Not ours. They love the greenies and the teenie lites are perfect for their after our dinner treats. And made in America. How much better can you get then that? Your pets are important, treat them  to a greenie!

review/summary: my dog goes crazy!
review/text: My dog absolutely LOVES greenies!!! Started him out on regular ones, but because I give him two a day, I buy the smallest ones in the "lite" version and give him one in the morning as a reward for "doing his business" and going back inside when I ask (it helps that he knows he'll get one if he goes inside) and one at night, once again, for going back inside. I keep them in the freezer and he loves them cold. It makes me happy that these will help with his dental care. Its fun to see him get so excited! LOL.

review/summary: Overpriced
review/text: This tea is overpriced. At asian markets, retail is $6.95. Certainly, wholesale is drastically less. The price asked for here is appalling. It's the exact same tea and Foojoy is considered one of the lesser brands in teas. The product is great, the seller? Doubtful.
