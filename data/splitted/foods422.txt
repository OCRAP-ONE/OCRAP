review/summary: Great coffee, good price, fast free delivery
review/text: French Market is our favorite coffee, discovered on a New Orleans trip.  Local supermarkets don't carry it or carry only small numbers.  We obtained it fast, less expensively and with free shipping through Amazon.  French Market's a robust blend (try putting a sprinkle of cinnamon on the coffee before perking) and a real 16- ounce can (unlike the 11 to 13 ounce of other brands).  It makes twice the amount of popular labels (one rounded scoop per two cups) and is a great bargain and terrific coffee.  We'll be orering again!

review/summary: I've Tried Serveral - This is the BEST
review/text: I've never been a fan of strong coffee or a coffee snob but after visiting New Orleans I got hooked on C&C (coffee and chicory).  I started out with the medium-dark Creole roast (I called the company and found out that Creole Roast in the red can and Restaurant Blend in the white can are both the same exact medium-dark roast C&C - the can thing is just done for marketing).<br /><br />Just for fun I tried a can of the dark roast (City Roast) C&C and to my surprise found I enjoy it more than the medium-dark roast.  For comparison I then tried a can of the Cafe du Monde C&C which is also a dark roast and it isn't nearly as good (had kind of a burnt taste) as the French Market City Roast.<br /><br />Also found that if you make the French Market City Roast a little strong it has kind of a chocolate taste to it.  I've read that C&C has chocolate undertones but never tasted it until I made the dark roast a little stronger than I usually do.

review/text: I love most of the New Orleans/Louisiana coffees -- Community, French Market, CDM etc. but this is the one closest to what my Grammaw Couvillion used to brew up each morning. Dark and delicious. Not a bad price either. I can buy it at my local store but it's $8.99 each there so I just order it.

review/text: I have used French Market coffee for quite a few years.  I have ordered it on a regular basis and have bought it locally as well.  When I was offered an automatic shipment option, I thought this was the way to go, no lines at the grocery store.  Before the second shipment, I was notified that I could change my order or drop it.  Great service, great coffee, great option.

review/summary: The Best Coffee - Ever!
review/text: Make no mistake about it. This is the taste of New Orleans. The oldest coffee company in America still makes the best coffee in America. They actually put a full pound (16OZ) of coffee in a 1 pound can; not 13oz like some brands or even 11.5 oz. like Choc-full-O-Nuts. so you get more coffee for your money!<br /><br />It's delicious and always the perfect complement for any meal. A great product from a great company.

review/summary: Best dark roast with chicory
review/text: I learned to love this Louisiana coffee when I was in college at LSU--beginning in 1957.  I have stuck with it through all these years.  An additional advantage is the value.  It still comes as a full pound, and you use only about half as much.  I feel cheated when I try any other type or brand of coffee--including the other Louisiana brands.

review/summary: Done with Class.
review/text: I bought this as a birthday present for someone who turned 69 who a couple of months ago gave me the history on chicory. After being puzzled with what to get him for his birthday, coffee and chicory fell on my mind. So, I decided to begin my search, on Amazon of course, and I came across French Market coffee. After reading all of the great reviews I decided to order. It arrived so fast it almost scared me. Fedex is a beast when it comes to fast delivery. Upon receiving this gift, he said that he had not been able to find this since he left Texarkana, Arkansas. He went on to say that this was a classy gift. Thanks Amazon and French Market Coffee.

review/summary: Smooth and delicious
review/text: French Market is always a smooth tasting brew.  If you like an intense, bitter, or harsh flavor, it's not for you.  We use a standard drip maker with a thermal carafe - no heater to keep the coffee hot (and cook it down to mud).  French Market can sit in the pot for 24 hours - then microwave it and it's just as good as it was five minutes after it was brewed.  Amazon's price is MUCH lower than grocery stores, even when they are on sale.  And remember, you use half as much French Market per cup as most coffees - so it's not just good tasting, it's a great value!

review/text: I love making this in my french press. It is a little coarser grain than medium so it is perfect for the press. Heating water just under boiling then putting it in a jar to chill in fridge is the best.  It is better than Starbucks iced latte.  Rich, dark, full bodied and smooth with a little sugar and cream served over ice. Just delicious. I have tried different brands, Starbucks Sumatra, French Roast, even good espresso. Taste test in our house FM brand won hands down.

review/text: This is a great coffee, dark, strong, rich and the chicory gives it an added depth. I've been drinking it since my first trip to New Orleans in the 1970's, and brought cases of it back every trip. I started ordering it online as soon as French Market got a website. I use a little more than half as much as regular or French roast coffee. Definitely my favorite coffee, and mandatory morning brew.

review/summary: Not for everybody
review/text: Following the great reviews for this coffee, I went ahead and ordered it for the office.<br />Out of 15 people, nobody liked it. We tried making it with less and less grounds a few times and it always came very thick and with a extremely strong chicory (like burned wood) flavor which is obviously and aquired taste, so if you havent tried chicory coffee priorly and you are not sure if you will like it or not, and you see the great reviews from people that aboviously had already tried it and liked it, do not take a chance with this since you will get 3 cans, maybe buy one at the store to try it first.<br />We ended up with extra cans to give away. It is really an aquired taste.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZOPRT8">French Market Coffee & Chicory, City Roast(Dark Roast), 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />I love coffee, drink about 3 large mugs a day and for over 60+ years have tried nearly every brand and type (Starbucks French Roast, Jamaica Blend and Straight, pure and blended Kona, Sumatra, Costa Rican, Kenya AA, etc., etc.)<br /><br /> This French Roast dark coffee and chicory is a welcome change.  When brewed it is very dark, but is extremely flavorful and smooth and I have recently become "hooked" on it. The three 1-pound cans I order every 2 months is really equivalent to 6 pounds as I use half the amount I would normally use for regular coffee.<br /><br />I have read other reviews which claim that the lower priced French Market C&C Restaurant Blend in the white can is exactly the same as the one in the red can.  I have tried both and find this is not the case.  The red can C&C in my opinion is the far superior and much richer blend.<br />As far as a satisfying cup goes it is as good as it gets.

review/summary: Big Price Increase!
review/text: I bought this French Market Dark Coffee and Chicory just two weeks ago on the subscribe and save program for $17.07. I was going to get 3 more cans before the next due date, cause I love the stuff and wanted to stock up before a possibe price increase. Well, I was too late; cause the price not only increased, but it increased over 40% to $22.98 with the 15% subscribe and save discount! That's what stopped me from buying more and I'll cancel the subscribe and save order if the price doesn't drop back to earth before the auto delivery date. Great coffee, but I'll drink tea before I pay this much for coffee.<br /><br />NEW COMMENTS.... THIS IS BEYOND ME! I noticed the French Market Dark Coffee and Chicory has now dropped way down to $14.05 from $22.98 earlier today. Because this coffee is excellent (the best I've ever had) I placed an additional subscribe and save order. Great deal on great coffee. BTW, with this coffee I use less than half of what other brands require for full flavor.

review/text: Years --decades--ago, my mother bought a Toddy coffee maker: you use cold water overnight to create a concentrated liquid which had NO bitterness and could be used to make hot or iced coffee.  At the strength each person wants. (This was way before Starbucks when weak tasteless coffee was the norm.)<br /><br />I learned to drink New Orleans style coffee after being stationed in Biloxi Mississippi in the Air Force, and much later discovered the Toddy system advertized inside a can of French Market Coffee. I ordered it and used it until I broke the carafe and gave it up for a while--until I realized you can use a regular drip coffee pot OR a French Press if you set it up the night before. Try it-- it will amaze you!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW">Toddy T2N Cold Brew System</a><br /><br />And yes, you can order the Toddy system on Amazon!

review/summary: Love this coffee!
review/text: My favorite Saturday morning breakfast cafe serves cajun wraps, "ben-yays", and this coffee.  My wife loves it so much I had to break down and get her some for home.  This is a DARK roast and even if you like your coffee strong, they aren't kidding when they say it only takes about 1/2 what you usually use. We use exactly half as much of this coffee as our regular coffee to make the same amount and it's plenty strong.  This is coffee AND chicory, so those who tell you they don't like Chicory coffee, may not have had this particular brand.  It is delicious!  We have made it several ways- french press, hot drip, and cold brew.  Cold brew is our favorite, then french press, and hot drip.  Of course, that is true of every brand of coffee we buy.  (If you haven't tried cold brew, you don't know what you are missing!)  Anyway, if you like strong flavorful coffee without too much bitterness or oil, this is a great one.  If you know you like cajun chicory coffee, then you've found the right brand.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Not for the face.
review/text: I wanted to try this instead of my regular face cleaner. Having a moisturizing bar of soap instead of a gel I pumped from a bottle sounded neater, cheaper, like less clutter in the shower, all around more appealing. Even better if it were an inexpensive, cleansing, moisturizing soap.<br />I thought an olive oil based soap was the way to go and I do feel cleansed after using it. However, I don't know about other people, but it is definitely not for my face.<br />I have normal skin, not already dry or anything, and after washing my face with this, it felt clean, but tight and stripped of all moisture. I looked in my mirror and smiled just to flex my face and saw my skin stretch and wrinkle in areas I'd never even had wrinkles before. I had to moisturize for quite a while to get rid of that look and feeling.<br />Not exactly what you want for your face if you're trying to keep wrinkles at bay and a soft youthful glow. This is not a soap you want to use if it's moisture you're seeking.<br /><br />I will keep using it as a body wash just because I have it and why not, but once it's gone, I won't be buying more.

Your skin will feel tight and uncomfortable, and you'll need to use a lot of moisturizing lotion afterwards to make up for it. The only thing that works on my skin is Bag Balm. I highly recommend it. It may be sticky and smell strange, but it smells better than the olive oil stuff and it ALWAYS works. Go Bag Balm!

review/summary: Pay for what you get
review/text: I thought all caramel syrups were pretty much alike. I've tried various brands at local coffee shops and bought some on my own as well. When I saw this brand was being sold a few dollars cheaper than the others, I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, it doesn't taste like anything. It doesn't even taste like sugar. It's unfortunate but a lesson learned.

review/text: I purchased this product only because is was cheaper than the the other popular brand. It tastes the same however if you plan on using a pourer, which I recommend, the mouth of the bottle is too wide for any pourer. I would have given this item 5 stars instead of 4 had my pourer fit. Just a convenience thing is all. Goes great in that morning cup of joe.....

review/summary: The best Earl Grey on the market
review/text: I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />I prefer loose leaf teas to tea bags. There is something in the process of measuring tea into a cozy and letting it steep that makes the resulting cup of tea that much nicer. There is a reason they have tea ceremonies in most of the world (and although less rigorous, so do the British in their own way). Twinings is the quintessential British Earl Grey, and if you've never tried it, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!

review/summary: These seeds are a "Product of China"
review/text: They taste fine, but don't be fooled by the package into thinking this is American-grown and natural. It all looks good - "Woodstock Farms" name, company based in Connecticut, bucolic image of a rustic farmhouse, "Caring about the Land" slogan, all the pseudo-natural, pseudo-green trappings companies use to hook you into buying a product that's not as good for you or the environment as you could wish. I doubt that Woodstock Farms has any actual control over how these pumpkin seeds are grown or processed, and we all know from the news that China isn't overly concerned with food quality control or truth-in-labeling. I will avoid all Woodstock Farms products from now on.<br />I will also not buy any more food products off Amazon unless it is explicitly stated where the food was grown.

review/text: I ordered two different brands of shelled pumpkins seeds from amazon ( plus have tried countless others ). The other brand I ordered from here had fancier packaging and a bunch of reviews. This one had no but I deiced to take a chance on it after being disappointed by the others.<br /><br />Focusing on just the other brand I ordered this one had more constant size seeds, none of the brunt small seeds that if you accidentally ate one of left an awful taste in your mouth. None of the flat worthless taste seeds either or hard break your teeth pieces of what I think were steams. These were just great lightly salted no bad after taste pumpkin seeds that I will be ordering again and again.

review/summary: Yummy, packaging could be better
review/text: Love this stuff!  It makes a French Dip type sandwich what it should be, and it's good for dipping prime rib in too. Like the other reviewer noted you can control the saltiness to some degree by how much you dilute it.  Following package directions I find it very flavorful and not too salty at all.  I was a little disappointed with the packaging and took away 1 star for that.  All the containers were really sticky, and when I went to put them away I realized it's because one lid had cracked and leaked everywhere.  The shipping box and even display cardboard were pretty sturdy so I think the plastic containers the actual sauce is in may not ship well (or, it wasn't handled well in shipping... hard to know). Still a good deal especially compared to grocery store prices.

review/summary: By far, one of the best mustards in the world!
review/text: I love this product.  I grew up using this mustard but then moved to another area where it was not carried by the local supermarkets.  Then I found it again, and life is good.<br /><br />My wife is a yellow mustard person, and dislikes any of the spicy brown mustards I usually eat.  But when I found Kosciusko mustard again just recently I was raving about it so much she actually tried it.  And said she liked it.  Then two weeks ago I walked into the kitchen and found her making herself a sandwich and she was using the Kosciusko's!  I was shocked!  I started to make fun of her, asking if she grabbed the wrong mustard by mistake.  She said she likes it.<br /><br />Imagine that, all those years of living in a drab, unexciting existence using plain old yellow mustard, and she has finally seen the light.  I am so proud.<br /><br />Thank you Kosciusko Mustard Company.<br /><br />PS: There is only one problem I can see with your product.  It only comes in a 9 ounce jar.  That is not nearly big enough.  At the moment I have one half used jar in the fridge, and two unopened back-up jars in the pantry.  Please start selling it in a larger jar.

review/summary: Incredible.  You Will Never Look at the other Mustards the Same Way Again!
review/text: I normally never review products because it truly has to be something exceptional & life changing for me to purposely take time away from my day to rave to the masses about it.  However, the exception is clearly deserved with this mustard.  I can't even remember how many years I have used this & can easily go through roughly 5 to 6 jars of this a year by myself.  It is absolutely the best spicy brown mustard you can find out on the market.  It has enough bite & zing to it, but the complexity of spices used compliment the flavor of the mustard & the all around yumminess factor of this is seriously beyond compare. It is the gold standard of what all other brown mustards should live up to but fail to muster up to the challenge (yeah, I'll go all out corny for this stuff).  Sadly moved to the Southern part of the country & could no longer find this product admist the vast sea of flavorless, lifeless, generic yellow mustards on the shelf. Coming from NY where this product was usually always available, albeit in limited quantities on the shelf as aparently myself & my family weren't the only people engaged in this spicy brown mustard obsession, I usually buy about 7 to 8 bottles of this stuff to bring back with me whenever I go up to visit my family.  Thank you Amazon that if I discover on any ocassion that this product is absent from grocery store shelves that I can come here & order it by the caseful.  If anyone else is as much as a mustard fanatic as me, Olde Cape Cod Sweet & Hot Honey Mustard is also incredible.  Enjoy, but stock up on this.

review/summary: It's a hit!  Woo-hoo!
review/text: Well, I've bought more cat treats this year than you could shake a stick at... literally.<br />I've been trying out different ones, trying to get rid of grain fillers or kitty-MSG in the treats.<br />(When I say "kitty-MSG", I mean the same stuff that sets up the cravings in kitties, like it does<br />in humans when added to our foods, like potato chips.)<br /><br />This treat had good ingredients (although not sure why pea flour and such is needed, unless it is just<br />a binder). We've been through so many treats, trying to find something that our cats would eat. We even tried<br />the Halo treats, and neither of our cats would touch them. They would run when they heard a treat bag, but literally<br />walk away when they saw it was that one! LOL!  they are pretty picky on their treats.)<br />Of course, we had the usual reaction to a treat bag - ecstasy and curiosity. But, I just wasn't too sure they'd actually eat it.<br /><br />Well, I am happy to report that BOTH cats LOVE these treats! Our little one will sit up and catch treats that she loves,<br />and she does that for these. She doesn't have a weight problem, but she doesn't need one either. Our big boy cat really<br />loves these, and has stared holes in me to get the bag back out every day since they arrived!<br /><br />So, whatever Evo is doing, I hope they keep doing it. The cats love them, the ingredients seem pretty wholesome,<br />and we'll be trying some other flavors.<br /><br />UPDATE Dec 2011:  Both our cats love these treats still, and our boy cat tries to casually sneak over to where I have the bag<br />and sneak off with it like we won't see him. (I've had to put it in a drawer!)  I'm very happy they found something they<br />both love, and isn't full of grain fillers.  They both don't care for the herring one, but neither cat is big on fishy flavors.<br />Thought I'd try it anyway. (Not sure where the cat/fish connection got so strong - cats do not hunt in rivers in the wild.<br />They eat mice/birds. I'd love to know why there are no mice-flavored treats!)  Anyway, they both are still loving<br />the weight-management version, so we'll be buying it whenever we can. It isn't available to us locally, but glad that<br />Amazon is offering it. Thanks Evo!

review/text: This is his favorite treat so far! He's an indoor-outdoor cat and, when I shake the little bag, he would leave anything and come home to get some! It's pretty expensive, I agree, but it's grain-free and low carbs - so I decided to stick to them until he no longer loves 'em!

review/summary: Excellent flavor, good value, but some issues to be aware of
review/text: It's hard to find good decaf loose tea that is affordably priced and tastes good. I'm pleased to report that this English Breakfast from Coffee Bean Direct hits the mark on both counts. Excellent taste - depending on how long the steeping process, it ranges from a very light, refreshing taste that goes well as an iced tea, to a very hearty - but not bitter - taste that really hits the spot.<br /><br />I've had better tasting tea, but on a cost/value basis, this is outstanding.<br /><br />The downside is that, as with any decaf loose tea, you're not getting the full leaf format that our caffeinated tea brethren enjoy. This is very fine, almost powdery in consistency. This is where the higher priced teas pay off -- whilie their decaf process also results in broken leafs, it is not anywhere as fine or powdery as this.<br /><br />The fine/powdery nature presents some challenges in brewing, since the typical perforated tea ball will not be suitable. I'm using a mesh tea ball and it works pretty well, albeit there is still some tea residue in the bottom of the cup. If you want absolutely zero leaf residue you'll need to use one of those tea bag systems where you put the loose tea in a bag. Those, however, are not reusable more than a few times. As usual, trade-offs.<br /><br />Of greater significance is that the decaf process for this particular tea is not perfect - there is still some caffeine left. I'm very sensitive to caffeine levels, and this tea clearly has more caffeine than, for example, a bagged Lipton decaf. I'd put the caffeine level below what a regular green tea would hold, but there is still enough there to be noticeable. Again, I'm very sensitive to caffeine, so for most people I imagine that would not be an issue.

review/summary: Perhaps I got a bad bag
review/text: I've been trying various teas since I had to give up coffee years ago (blood pressure problems).  This is the first one that I've questioned whether the dominant taste I perceive is a contaminant.  The taste is quite strong, and unlike any tea I've tasted (and I have tasted a variety of English breakfasts, Ceylons, and Assams, among others).  I've given it 3 tries (interspersed with pots of other tea), and established that the taste is not the water or the vessel.<br /><br />I concede the possibility that some people may value this taste, but I don't.  Now I'm going to compost it and move on.

review/summary: The Taste is Amazing--Update
review/text: The tea is amazing in taste and color. I highly recommend it.<br />The "dust" described in another review is due to the Co2 decaf process they use. It is a natural process that does not use toxic chemical solvents to de-caffeinate the tea leaves.<br />If you want a decaff tea that tastes like regular English Breakfast Tea, give this a try. You will not be disappointed with the taste.<br /><br />"To decaffeinate using carbon dioxide (CO2), water-softened materials are "pressure cooked" with the gas. At high pressures and high temperatures, carbon dioxide is in a supercritical state, acting as both a gas and a liquid. It becomes a solvent with its small, nonpolar molecules attracting the small caffeine molecules. Since flavor molecules are larger, they remain intact, which is why this process retains the flavor of the material better.".  "Caffeine is not removed completely using any of these methods, but under federal regulations in the United States, caffeine levels must not be above 2.5 percent of the product in order for a product to be labeled "decaffeinated."".<br /><br />Update:<br />I am in my second order of this tea.  I have noticed in this batch that the tase is inconsistant.  I take small portions from the 2lb bag and put it in a zip lock, forcing most of the air out and stor it in a dark container.  Some cups will be amazing and some have a rather stale aftertaste.  I didn't notice this with the initial order.  I have downgraded the rating to 4 stars.

review/summary: Great tasting - finer leaf
review/text: I purchased this for a party where I needed a large quantity of sweet tea.  The remaining tea is for me.  I buy about 80% loose tea and this is the finest 'grind' of loose tea I've had in a while.  Perhaps because most of my loose tea is green??<br />The taste was outstanding.  I made a concentrate for 5 gallons the day before and the flavor held perfectly for the following day.  Leftover concentrate came home and hubby drank from that for another 5 days with very little loss.<br />As hot tea... I've been hitting this since then and found it perfectly balanced.  After drinking green teas for so long, I didn't think I would enjoy this but I was pleasantly surprised!  It is not bitter like I would have expected, instead, it has a wonderful full body that seems to be replacing coffee many mornings.  I'm glad I finally tried it!

review/text: My nutritionist says to eat some of this every other day or so. Looking around I found this product with 4 20 oz packages for a reasonable price - and from our neighbors in Oregon. Way to go NW. So my first treat was mixing 4 tablespoons with hot chocolate - hey she didn't say I couldn't enjoy myself - and it went down just fine.<br /><br />Looking forward to sprinkling on many dishes along with adding to drinks. Even thought to try it as a cereal just adding milk and sugar.<br /><br />Then I started thinking about some other uses. Maybe it would work a cat litter or garage grease soaker upper. How about throwing some at the next wedding instead of rice. Rice can be dangerous, besides this floats much better than rice.<br /><br />Would also work sprinkling around the bushes outside next to the house. Costs more than bark, but its very consistent and looks better. Plus, the neighbors will look at you and ask what is that. You can tell them it's your very own latest super fertilizer and mulch mix. Who knows, they may even want to order some from you. If they do, please just send me my 10% commission and your welcome.<br /><br />Anywho it is gritty and that's just what the nutrition lady ordered.

The packaging clearly states on the conatiner net 4oz but when I weighed the product WITH the packaging it was only around 3.1-3.5. Net means what is inside the package (the actual food) so I believe they are falsely advertising. I contacted the company and I got an "I'm sorry you feel this way" response. I ordered 2 different kinds thinking maybe it was just that one box. . . nope the other box was exactly the same. I would go with Jack's Havest brand. They truely are 1oz or 3oz cubes of food, less watery and do not waste plastic containers. They also throw in a free bag of foos sometimes. I will not be ordering from this company again:(

I had some left-over roasted broccoli, purple onion and cauliflower and a couple slices of peppered ham i needed to use up, so i threw all that in the pot of soup, and with fresh homemade cornbread, the 4 of us made complete pigs of ourselves. Again, it was amazingly delish, it'll be great this winter.....nothing like a hot bowl of soup on a cold day; this certainly fits the bill. I admit it was a bit salty, but the texture was thick-n-creamy and velvety.

review/summary: Great cereal with lots of crunch and flavor
review/text: I usually do not like flake cereals because they get so soggy by the end of the bowl.  This Special K, Vanilla Almond, does not get soggy like that at all and has nice crunch all the way to the bottom.<br /><br />It also has a generous serving of actual almonds in each serving, enough to notice and enjoy them.  They are slivered so they mix well with the flakes, unlike chopped nuts that immediately sink to the bottom.  The vanilla flavor is there, but it does't overpower or taste of chemicals.<br /><br />I would describe this cereal as being a cross between granola and regular Special K, it is wonderful slightly crushed and mixed into plain yogurt and fruit -- lower cal and fat than granola, a great substitute.  I like it better than Honey Bunches of Oats because the crunchy bits are pressed onto the actual flakes and not just chunks mixed in with plain flakes, I think is why it stays crunchy in milk.<br /><br />I have a bowl of this with milk and it keeps me full and happy for hours, I think the almonds give it more staying power than most flake cereals.<br /><br />I subscribe to this product and would recommend it to anyone.

review/text: Love this cereal! Have it for breakfast and lunch.  My granddaughter loves it too.  When I ask her what she wants for breakfast she will tell me "Your cereal". Has helped me lose some weight and keep in shape.  Love it even more served with SILK almond flavor. (SILK is in the dairy area next to the milk but it has more calcium then milk - for those who didn't know).
