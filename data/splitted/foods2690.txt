review/summary: These definitely taste like "diet" chips
review/text: After reading several reviews from people apparently on diets I now understand the high star rating because if you can't have the real thing something like this passes for good. These are bland, have a weird texture and aren't very good. I will be sending these to work with my husband so he can give them away. I ate a few from my first and only bag before throwing them in the pantry. They are low in calories and low in taste. Pass.

review/summary: Chili Lime Flavor - Review
review/text: In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.

review/summary: Keep Popping!
review/text: The crisp texture of these PopChips is very appealing.  The chips also stayed whole in the bag, which is a big plus.  They  have a nice sweet potato flavor, with a light hint of salt.  Best of all, no greasy fingers!  I like that they are a healthy alternative to other chips or crackers.  The information on the bag well represents the taste of the chips.  I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.  Overall, I would definitively buy these chips again and look forward to trying other flavors of Popchips.

review/summary: Satisfies a sweet potato tooth
review/text: Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth.

review/summary: A healthier snack
review/text: We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake "healthier" for "healthy."  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those "truth in advertising" points that annoys me so I mention it.

review/summary: Fabulous Taste - can't eat just one but small warning
review/text: These are absolutely delicious and irresistable. The taste is perfect - not heavy or overdone. It actually kind of sneaks up on you before you realize you've just finished the bag.<br /><br />They seem to melt in your mouth even as you are chewing them as opposed to some brands that make you feel like Mr. Ed (the horse). Yes,there is some salt, but it's not like someone just dumped a container of the stuff on them. This time it enhances the chip.<br /><br />Everything in them is terrific except for the inclusion of maltodextrin about 2/3 down the ingredient list. It can have a kind of laxative effect on a lot of people and I just thought you should know it's in there.<br /><br />Other than that - there is nothing about this product that would detract me from buying it for parties, picnics, events, or just enjoying by myself.<br /><br />Seriously, they are that good.

review/summary: Great Crunch. OK Flavor. 100 Calories.
review/text: Advertised as an all natural, gluten free,healthier snack, we tried the BBQ & Sour Cream & Onion flavors.  We have a slight preference for the BBQ over the Sour Cream & Onion because the BBQ has a little more flavor. However, both leave a slightly strange aftertaste shortly after consuming a single serving bag.<br /><br />The chip crunch is great and adds to the satisfaction of eating the chip.<br /><br />Overall, a nice snack.  For flavor; however, we prefer Veggie Chips.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041BSZGA">Sensible Portions Veggie Snacks Variety - 24 Bags</a> (especially the Rosemary flavored straws).

review/summary: Holy Cow!! These Are Scrumptious
review/text: I didn't realize I was getting 20 packets of these chips but I was happy to see them when they arrived.  I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything "popped" but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with "real" chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand.

review/summary: Once again, America's food scientists bring us a new snack!
review/text: POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.  I have no negative comments about the POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO product.

review/summary: Taste more like "Tomato and Basil" than "Chili and Lime"
review/text: NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're "probably" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a "tomato" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like "Tomato and Basil" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.

review/summary: Fantastic Crispy Airy Chips
review/text: Somewhere between a rice cake and a potato chip in texture, PopChips are an excellent low calorie snacking choice. I've tried all of the available flavors and here is my assessment of each:<br />Barbeque - A little too sweet for my taste but not bad overall<br />Jalapeno - High on Spice, not too salty, not much other flavor. I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.<br />Original - Not super flavorful but great for dipping<br />Cheddar - Yummy<br />Parmesan Garlic - So Garlicky. Good but make for stinky breath<br />Salt & Pepper - Good<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Hands down the BEST flavor

review/summary: Life-saver for chip lovers trying to eat healthier
review/text: I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.

review/text: My husband loves medium blends. I love dark roast, I heard that this was the "best". So I bought it for him this past Christmas. Husband thought it was fantastic, I was expecting the "best" and was disappointed, I got him the medium roast. I really liked it, but wished for a darker roast. Coffee really is subjective. Recently someone told me to try a particular Sumatra, said it was the "best" and it was nasty, I tossed it out. Very bitter, it should never be bitter.<br /><br />His birthday is tomorrow and I had to get him another medium pound, but I also added this dark roast. WOW. I am in love!<br /><br />It's the best. Now that I understand how subjective coffee is, we all like diffrent beans, blends,roasts, some in my family like added flavors (shudder), i think good coffee has enough flavor by itself and only inferior needs additives.<br /><br />I love darker roasts, creamy, chocolately, luscious. This is all you'd expect.<br /><br />Having now tried both, all I can say is you will really enjoy both types, but love the roast you normally prefer.<br /><br />The price can't be beat and they don't charge you high S&H rates, that's a nice feature.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/summary: Simply the BEST!
review/text: I had requested my wife look into getting me some Kona Coffee for Father's Day this year.<br /><br />First off I am an avid coffee drinker that can take down anywhere from 2-4 cups a day on average. While we have plenty of great coffee options in my area, I do enjoy making a delicious pot of coffee in the morning as it just seems to start the day off right.<br /><br />Secondly I drink my coffee black. I do not add milk, cream, sugar, Splenda, or any other crap into my cup of natures perfect beverage. As such, there is nothing to mask the taste of bad coffee.  If you have never tried enjoying coffee w/o turning it into a glorified milkshake, this is the coffee to try it with.<br /><br />Blue Horse Kona coffee is my dream come true. It makes me feel like I am relaxing on a resort in Maui. My wonderful wife gave me both the Medium and Dark Roasts and they are both perfect in their own ways.<br /><br />The moment you package arrives you will smell the quality and amazingness I am attempting to describe to you.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to anyone who appreciates the taste and freshness of their coffee and wants to feel like they are on vacation everyday while they drink it.<br /><br />Pros<br />+Awesome Packaging<br />+Wonderful Aroma<br />+Taste, Taste, Taste<br />+Resealable package w/ air lock<br /><br />Cons<br />-None

review/summary: A "Mild" Dark Roast
review/text: After trying Blue Horse's Medium Roast and finding the flavor much too mild/weak for my taste, I decided to try Blue Horse's Dark Roast. The dark roast is perfect for me! I don't like bold coffees (e.g. Starbucks), so I was worried that this dark roast would be too bold. The coffee beans SMELL bold, but the brewed coffee tastes just right! If you're looking for a bold coffee, this is NOT the right coffee for you. This coffee has a smooth consistency and a not-quite-bold (but definitely not weak) taste. Very good! For reference, I think this coffee tastes very similar to Hawaii Roasters' Medium Roast (which I also recommend to Kona lovers!).

review/summary: Almost as good as Hawaii Roasters
review/text: I have tried both this and Hawaii Roasters brand. They are both very good coffees. This brand (Farm-direct) is priced about $4 below the Hawaii Roasters.<br /><br />First, Hawaii Roasters came in a vacuum packaging. The packaging of this brand was not as airtight.<br /><br />I tasted the difference especially on the first time I opened the packages.<br /><br />Hawaii Roasters tastes better and is somewhat more potent.<br /><br />But this brand is still a fine coffee, and it tastes very close to a very fine French coffee. There isn't much flavor here but it provides a fine surge of coffeine rush.<br /><br />The Hawaii Roasters cost almost 20% more, and it might be almost 20% better. But if you want a quality Kona coffee, then this brand will probably meet your needs.<br /><br />I still recommend this coffee but it isn't quite the best Kona coffee I've tasted.

review/summary: Not a great Kona Coffee
review/text: I have to agree with another reviewer that this is not the best of the Kona coffees that I have relished in the past. That includes those that I have had the pleasure of drinking in Hawaii several times. Frankly, I found it to have a bitter aftertaste rather than the smooth finish that is typical of this type of superior coffee. I can't knock the seller for his promptness, though I was surprised the coffee arrived in a bloated looking USPS priority envelope.<br /><br />Now granted I haven't been to Hawaii for a number of years so I am not sure if the criteria for Kona coffee quality has slipped to a large degree. If this is any indicator then I suspect that I will not be in the market for Kona in the future as it is not worth to me the premium price. I've been an avid coffee drinker for over 40 years, and tasted coffee from virtually every global region. Unfortunately, this coffee was a disappointment, and I will not be ordering it again.

review/text: This is, quite simply, the best mint dark chocolate I have ever tasted.  It's not over-poweringly minty, which I appreciate.  Also, it's a spearminty kind of mint, not peppermint, so it's a bit softer, less of a bite.  The chocolate is fantastic, and the overall experience is smooth and REALLY creamy!  I really really love it!  I actually bought a case to just have on hand, which saved me about $.60 per bar below the price at my local grocery store, so that's a plus, too!  Even with the pre-purchase.  You won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Great energy boost, no added sugar
review/text: These wonderful fruits are of a consistency somewhere between apple sauce and baby food. I found this particular flavor to be more "baby food" than some of the others, but I did enjoy the combination.<br /><br />While these are more expensive (even in the store) than the little fruit cups, they have a perfect use ... Traveling!  As any parent with a child knows, kids, spoons, and  liquids are not a good mix. Spills happen!  Since these include only fruit, juice, and natural flavorings, they make a nice snack without added sugar.<br /><br />However, having recently made an extended trip by myself, I discovered they are wonderful in a different way. They make a great boost for the driver as well. And they aren't half bad, even when warm! I am a diabetic, so the 15 grams of carb are a perfect complement to my needs for a snack. I kept a couple next to me, and they were perfect when my blood sugar was dropping and the next rest stop was far away. My only problem using them this way involved getting the lids off!

review/text: I've tried a few different brands, and got this during a special and combined the promo code with a subscribe and save rate, so it was cheaper than what another reviewer had posted was the cheapest price they saw it for at a Walmart (80 cents each.)<br /><br />My 10 year old loves them, and I love them because he eats them. He loves fruit, but sometimes we run out of fresh fruit and I want to make sure he has some fruit each day. I am not thrilled with these - to me, all I taste is applesauce. But again, the point is that he is eating fruit. I would like to try other flavors, but it seems that most of these products, regardless of brand, taste simply like applesauce. Wish they would have more berries and more berry flavor.  I realize this flavor is banana and apple, but other pouches claim to have berries, and I'm pretty sure there are probably 1 or 2 berries in the entire pkg.)

review/summary: Better Than Expected!!
review/text: I just opened one package (came with 3 packages together as a set).  Each package is small and indeed makes me (probably you too) feel the item pricey, in comparison to other Miso products in Amazon.  But this can be compensated by a "Free Shipping" eligibility.  Other miso products from different suppliers often require a hefty shipping charge.  Not only that, 3 small packages as 1 would be better for keeping freshness, especially for those occasional users.  The taste is wonderful.  This miso is red so I expected some bitterness.  I usually choose shiro-miso (more lighter color miso) for sweeter and milder taste.  However, this red miso has beaten my prejudice against my red miso stereo type.  Oh, even though this miso tastes good by itself, please use it with sea weeds, fish stock, and / or "hon-dashi" when you make miso soup.  I am enjoying this!

review/summary: The Rating is for the TYPE of Miso, Not the Quality
review/text: Somehow I purchased this very high-quality organic miso paste under the assumption that I was buying white miso.  This is RED miso.  I am honestly not as fond of red miso, and I would not have bought this had I realized I was ordering the red.  That being said, it is obviously a fantastic product, and it does have a lot of flavor.  Unless you eat miso soup every day, I think the three-pack will last people a long time.  And, truly, I just bumped this up from a three-star to a four-star review because I don't want other people who do prefer red miso to be turned off by a bad rating, when indeed this is a fine product.  But I really want to just give it three stars ("It's okay") because I honestly don't like red miso as much, I wanted white miso instead, and I'm disappointed I made the mistake of buying red.  So I guess you could say I took away a star because I don't think it's very clear on the package exactly what type of miso you're getting when you order this product.

review/summary: You'll never go back to miso packets again
review/text: After purchasing the cookbook Washoku, I was determined to make my own miso soups at home. While I was awaiting my order of both Genmai and Shiro miso, I couldn't help myself from purchasing those convenient powdered miso packets from the supermarket to try it out, too. Big mistake. I was so turned off by the flavor (as I've only had white miso before and the packet was clearly dark) that I was afraid to actually try the Genmai miso when it arrived! I am so glad that my shipment of Genmai arrived before the Shiro because I decided to give it another chance. The Eden Genmai Miso is very good, light years away from the nasty supermarket, cheap powder packets. Very easy to make, it took less than 15 minutes to prepare. I followed the recipe on the back of the package, since I am still awaiting my kombu for dashi. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Delicious drinking chocolate, albeit expensive
review/text: Guittard is one of the best chocolate-makers in the US (i.e. companies that make their own chocolate from cocoa beans). Until about a decade ago, they sold mostly wholesale to chocolatiers, bakers and restaurants, but added baking chocolate and tasting bars, and now chocolate powder to capitalize on the recent trend for hot chocolate, which is different from hot cocoa, much richer and thicker and with a more satisfying mouth feel.<br /><br />This chocolate mix is made from cocoa, chocolate liquor (i.e. containing cocoa butter) and sugar, not just cocoa. As such, it makes hot chocolate, not hot cocoa. You have to follow the instructions and use four tablespoons of powder for one mug of hot chocolate. This may seem excessive, but it produces some of the most amazing hot chocolate you can get short of visiting Angelina on Rue de Rivoli in Paris (you could get similar results by melting half a bar of chocolate in milk, of course).<br /><br />Be aware the powder has sugar already mixed in, and thus you are not paying just for chocolate but also cheaper sugar, which makes this a fairly expensive product, specially considering one box does not go very far, sadly (hence only 4 stars, even if the taste warrants a full 5). The sugar ratio is a bit on the high side, probably to cater to American tastes. Adjust accordingly if you use this for baking. Diabetics should probably opt for other Guittard products like their Cocoa Rouge cocoa powder.

review/summary: high quality chocolate powder
review/text: If I recall correctly, this is 100% cocao powder, so there's no sugar in it.  It's a fine quality, and I love it.  For my hot chocolate, I mix this powder with a tbsp of semi sweet chocolate chips in a cup of hot milk.  I like mine a bit more bitter, so I don't add extra sugar - it comes out perfect everytime!  Enjoy!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Just realized I placed the review for the wrong product.  This review is for this product on amazon.  The correct cocoa powder says it's "unsweetened rear red dutch cocoa".  Sorry for the confusion!<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Guittard-Cocoa-Powder-Unsweetened-Process/dp/B0049BJG8I/ref=pd_sbs_gro_9

My (italian) husband said he wouldn't have known there it was GF if I hadn't told him<br /><br />This "kit" is SOoooo easy. When I really need to be quick, I open up a large can of the Hormel Beef, drain most of the gravey out, warm it in a skillet and follow the rest of the directions on the box. Talk about tasty!!! Even better if you add a dolop of sour cream when it's cooled a bit.<br /><br />I would definately recommend this (and any of) Mrs. Leeper's product.

But it tasked terrible, totally inedible.  No flavor at all, like mushy cardboard.

review/text: This is a pretty good GF dinner, my biggest complaint is that when I reheat it, it tastes weird and sour.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this problem, but it tastes and smells spoiled when reheating just a day later.<br /><br />It is fairly bland.  I use spicy italian sausage and I still add heaps of cheddar cheese and hot sauce.  It's more of a creamy base rather than a strong delicious flavor.<br /><br />I still buy it because it's good for a fairly quick and hearty meal.

review/summary: Handy but Bland
review/text: Mrs. Leeper's Beef Stroganoff is blandly adequate but uninspiring.  Even after I added a liberal dose of cayenne, I could barely taste it.  It's okay as a vehicle for the protein in the beef and the riboflavin in the noodles, especially if you can't digest wheat gluten.  But it has even less flavor than Hamburger Helper, if you can imagine such a thing.  When the best I can say is that it's handy and not unpleasent, that's a thin recommendation.

review/text: I got a bag of this for free from my cousin at Thanksgiving yesterday. Today I decided to sit down in the evening (just now actually) and brew it up in a mug. The first few sips, my first reaction was, "Meh, whatever." As I kept drinking sip after sip, I realized my mouth felt a bit like pepper. I'm not sure why, though, as I don't remember anything in the ingredients being peppery...but oh well.<br />It was alright. You could taste the blueberry but maybe the peppery flavor was just the aftertaste of the bitter cranberries getting confused on my tongue, I'm really not sure.<br />Overall, my rating is "Meh," which means I'd drink this only if it was the only brand and flavor I had in the house :-)

review/text: This tea was a wonderful blueberry flavor.  Since it has the benefits of white tea -- very low caffeine level and a lot of antioxidants, it is a very pleasant tea to drink many times during the day.<br /><br />Since I don't like hibiscus and this tea does not contain hibiscus, this is the perfect blueberry tea for me.  On the other hand, for those who like hibiscus -- especially in their berry teas -- this tea may seem weak, because it lacks that strong hibiscus flavor punch.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea for anyone who wants a nice, tasty blueberry tea -- without hibiscus.

review/text: I first tried Tazo Berryblossom White tea after dinner at a very nice local restaurant. I didn't expect greatness, because I have had indifferent results with white teas in the past, but was very pleasantly surprised. The aroma is beautiful and the taste of tea is accented with berry, not overwhelmed. I brewed for one and a half to two minutes, as it is a bagged tea vs. loose leaf, and found that to be perfect. I took an extra bag home from the restaurant to make sure my experience wasn't influenced by the wine at dinner, and the results were replicated at home the next day. I couldn't find it at the store so am purchasing online.

review/summary: Great specialty plant
review/text: This little tree arrived small but it is growing fast.  One note of caution is that you cannot allow these plants to dry out.  Put a tray under them and allow them to sit in standing water at all times.  I have been doing it for a year now and have had no issues with root rot.<br /><br />These plants are a specialty item for me since they want to grow into trees and as I live in Virginia I cannot plant them outside due to our Winters.  They get scales really bad inside and the dry air is tough on them but as soon as they go back outside in the Summer they perk right up.  I have three of them and have really enjoyed growing them although they are getting really big to be hauling in and out of the house.

review/summary: Just what I wanted...
review/text: It arrived on time in very good shape. I was surprised how the soil was still wet even though it was left in the box for more than a week. Hope to see it grow to a nice big tree.
