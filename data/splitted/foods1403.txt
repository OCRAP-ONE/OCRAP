review/summary: No more breast milk!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.

review/summary: I Love Sage Tea!
review/text: I heard about drinking sage tea on the Dr. Oz show. Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again.

review/summary: Great for colicky acid reflux babies
review/text: We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.

review/summary: Recommended by herbalist--love it.
review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

review/summary: I use this tea for menstral cramps
review/text: I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

review/summary: Birthing Miracle Tea
review/text: I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

review/text: This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.

I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/text: A friend suggested this as I have been taking pain medication which tends to bind the bowels. He told me that this would help keep me regular. He was so right. A cu p of Senna Tea with my dinner has been better then metamucel for regularity. It tastes good, and I recommend it to anyone who has constipation problems due to medications. If you eat out, you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in, and you do not have to worry about missing a dose.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/text: I love Valerian and I love it's earthy smell! But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!

It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/text: Total bummer.  My little pup doesn't like these 'Lamb and Sweet Potato' tidbits at-all.  And I have no idea why.<br /><br />I bought this recipe at the grocery store and everything on the package looked good.  There's 9% protein, a reasonable 4% fat, with 11% moisture and 4% crude fiber.  The approximately 1x1 inch tidbits (about 1/4 inch thick) are made with barley, lamb, sweet potatoes, with organic molasses (yum) and few other good things, and yet, I couldn't interest Ms. Charlene (Charlie) in playing with one, much less eating one.<br /><br />She's a puppy -- Russell/Beagle mix -- so maybe she's picky or maybe she prefers something with more fat content, or with more smell-appeal.  Again I don't know, but I did want to write a review to warn you that you might want to buy a single bag versus a box full.<br /><br />Two Stars for excellent organic ingredients.  No additional stars because my young pup wouldn't eat more than one tiny corner of one. [The neighbors Australian cattledog is in for a treat]<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/#kidlit blogger

This one is especially enjoyed and he jumps around waiting for me to get the package open!  It is by far his very favorite and I have tried many treats since he has some special health needs and cannot have citric acid or high phosphorus foods.  Sweet potato and lamb are great, even though the barley is on the high side.  I think large breeds will go for this treat since even when divided in half it is still a hefty biscuit.

review/summary: My dog loves this and it good for him too
review/text: He loved this cookie as a treat. Not sure if this is available in a smaller size of cookie, but the bars seem larger than the heart shaped chicken cookie treats I have been buying. The lamb one does not upset my older English Cocker Spaniel who has a sensitive tummy, and isn't any more fattening either than the other cookie, but I do break each bar into two or three pieces to feed it to him. He can actually deal with the size just fine, tho this particular style is more appropriate for a large dog vs a middling size dog like him, but he counts the number of treats we give him and isn't happy until he gets three pieces :-) I feed him one bar broken into three pieces, while I feed him two to three of the little heart shape cookies(depends on how much food he's cadged from my toddlers that day) I totally trust the Newman's brand of dog food and have been happy with my baby's silky and healthy coat and no tummy upsets on the Newmans food or cookies.  I wrote this review for a sample from the vine program, but this seems to be the exact same cookie, so I am repeating the review here.

review/text: I have been a long time devotee of White Truffle oils, but somehow I had been out of the gourmet loop, unaware of the growing popularity of Black Truffle Sea Salt.  My curiosity was piqued, when I saw an Iron Chef using it on the Food Network, and, then by the outstanding reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Well, thanks to ALL, unknowingly complicit in leading me astray, I now have an expensive habit; but don't we all deserve to indulge ourselves, once in a while?  Since this is my first purchase, I can't make comparisons, but I can say this, the fragrance and taste are moderately strong for BT infusion, when you consider the contrast in pricing for this product, over others.  It's a great entry point for those without much experience with Truffles, white, or black, to give it a try. Be careful though, you'll likely be hooked, too.<br /><br />Since it takes such a small amount of product to enhance flavor, the 5.5 oz supply should last a fairly long time. The container is nice enough to leave on display. It has a pop-up, sprinkle lid, for convenience. The container does not offer a percentage, nor does the website, so I'm not sure if this Fusion brand is 10%, or not, as some other brands' advertise. So on my next purchase, I will opt for one that designates such, just for comparison.<br /><br />I consider flavor enhancers, such as Truffles, to be a diet aide, when watching calories. If you feel you are having something delectable, it heightens the sense of satisfaction---that somehow your sacrifices are lessened.  For example, I was blown away by the taste of a simple boiled egg, with a dusting of BTSS---and, vegetables reach new heights, as well. And, don't get me started on, plain pasta, with only a little Truffle oil, and sprinkle of BTSS; it's decadent. Actually, I think I could take a chunk of Iceberg lettuce, give it a sprinkle, and feel I was having a treat.<br /><br />If you've not yet ventured into BTSS, give it a whirl. I doubt you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Could be stronger, but price is right
review/text: Fusion Black Truffle Sea Salt has a definite black truffle flavor, that unlike truffle oils, actually comes from real black truffles.  Almost all truffle oils are made with a synthetic chemical that closely resembles the taste of truffles.  For those who want the real thing, this truffle salt is the cheapest way to get your truffle fix.<br /><br />The 5.5 ounce jar will last you a long time, even if you are a heavy seasoner.  I would have preferred a stronger concentration of truffle flavor in exchange for a smaller quantity of salt.  I spent twice as much for 1.5 oz of white truffle salt at a spice market, which i would purchase again over this.  With the fusion black truffle salt, I end up oversalting my food to get the amount of black truffle flavor I desire.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent, allowing for easy dispensing and storage.  Although i prefer white truffles, the taste from the black truffles is excellent.  I actually prefer it to some slices of black truffle I've had from michelin starred restaurants.  You may also want to check out truffle butters, which aren't as economical, but are a little better in practice.

review/summary: Bargain Truffle Salt? I have to see this...
review/text: Ok, so I've been a fan of salts lately. Citrus infused sea salts, Chardonnay Oak Smoked Sea Salt, Alele Hawaiian Sea Salt, etc. But I have to say, my favorite of them all is the truffle salt. I was skeptical of the 'fusion brand' sea salt. It looked mass produced and cheap. I was expecting an inferior reproduction of the specialty boutique brands that specialize in making it the old fashioned way...but I was very surprised with what I found. Rich, Flavorful, and at a bargin.<br /><br />To get to the point, fusion sea salt has great truffle flavor at half the price of the other brands. It is great for anyone who is new to truffles, and doesn't want to spend $30 for something they may OR may not like...but I'm pretty sure you'll be back, and you may even find yourself spending that little extra, for a little more of that special ingredient.

review/summary: loses potency
review/text: We bought a jar of this and use it nearly everyday. At first we were enthralled with the flavor, and I would have given it a five star review, but now, about 9 months later, it barely has any flavor or scent at all. We kept the lid closed between uses, but I don't think the lid keeps a good seal, and perhaps that's why there's no flavor left. Our first time buying truffle salt, we got a little jar at Pikes Place Market, and its potency lasted well over a year until it ran out. If you buy this, maybe put half in a well sealed glass jar to store. We have a tiny bottle of truffle oil we picked up in Italy a year ago, and that's still very potent, not sure why this product loses it so quickly.

review/summary: Fantastic salt and such great flavor
review/text: This salt is just wonderful.  It has such a great truffle flavor and a higher truffle content than most salts.  I love adding this to some angel hair pasta tosses with Roland truffle oil and parmesan.  Pure bliss! This salt is amazing on just about anything except most cooked tomato dishes, the tomatoes have a tendency to cancel out truffle flavor.  Steaks, pasta, onions, butter, subs, cream sauces... the list goes on and on.<br />For the 2 star review, I can't imagine this salt sitting around for 9 months (not even two moths and I have more on the way) but due to the nature of flavoring with oils for this salt that is to be expected if it sits for the better part of a year, especially if in direct sunlight or heat.

review/summary: truffle fries at home? Yes!
review/text: I'm a huge fan of truffle infused french fries and had to have a way to have them at home.  Enter Fusion Black Truffle Sea Salt.  I have made my own truffle fries several times using this salt. A little bit of product goes a long way.  I mix the truffle salt with rosemary and sprinkle on freshly deep fried, hand-cut french fries.  The results are fantastic and truffle fries are a great extravagance to look forward to after a long work week.<br /><br />This salt has two ingredients -- sea salt and black truffle.  It is incredibly fragrant -- even when the jar is closed.  After using the salt, I tightly closed the jar but my pantry smells like truffles a week after I initially opened the container.<br /><br />I love this salt and can't wait to try it with other recipes.<br /><br />This is a product of Italy.

review/text: I have to start by saying this truffle salt is a fantastic deal. It is really wonderful on some things. Stuff like popcorn, eggs, and butter it works perfectly on. A few other things like potatoes and more heavily flavored things, the truffle does not really come out. There is not enough truffle in this salt to truly flavor some foods without making them too salty.<br /><br />Also get a different container to pour this salt into, because once you open it, your whole cabinet will smell of truffles. The container it comes in is not very airtight.<br /><br />I recommend getting this salt for simple things, but getting another more 'truffly' (and pricier) salt for more heavy foods.

review/text: I'm really sad about this. I was so excited to get this particular brand since it was so well received by everyone else. I went w/salt instead of oil so it would keep better and the whole bit about truffle oil not even containing real truffles. I was going to savor every last black bit of ambrosia in this little container. Alas, it was not to be. The aroma is definitely there, but after I put it on steaks, chicken, fries, burgers, pastas, etc, the truffle didn't come through. To get enough truffle flavor, I basically had to oversalt my food with this.<br /><br />Maybe I just got a bad batch. Maybe the seal went awry and the heat during shipping caused an irreversible chemical process whereby the truffle aromatic ringed compounds left my jar. I'm not sure. I'm just sad. And without truffle goodness.

review/text: I was disappointed in this product. I had enjoyed truffle salt from another manufacturer, which had so much truffle that whenever I opened the lid, the delightful aroma filled the room. But it is no longer available, so I was hoping to find a similar product on Amazon. This ain't it; the truffle is barely detectible when sniffing the open bottle and not detectible on food at all. I'm debating whether to just throw it out so I can re-use the bottle to try a different brand. (The bottle is reusable, which is why I rated it more than one star.)

review/text: I love Torani sugar free syrups, but I did not like this flavor at all!  It tasted like someone poured a bottle of perfume into my coffee -- way too overpowering.  It didn't really taste too much like gingerbread to me, either.  I much prefer the pumpkin pie or coconut sugar free flavors to this one!
