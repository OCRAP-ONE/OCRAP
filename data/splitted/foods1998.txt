review/summary: Great Stage 3 Food for Baby
review/text: We love this yummy flavor of food for my baby.  He loves the chick chick pouches and it is a go to for us.  It is great to have an organic and unique flavor combos for my baby.  It seems that meat and proteins are hard for babies to take to.  However, this Chick Chick flavor is a favorite and we keep it on hand for a go to meal.

review/summary: good product, wish there was more
review/text: My daughter is now nearly 17 months old, but when she was eating purees we used these packets for travel. I usually make my own baby food but sometimes when on vacation storage wasn't practical for frozen purees. These worked out great, and were easy to travel with. I love that they are organic but only wish there was more in a pack. She enjoyed several varieties including chicken and beef.

review/summary: We (our dogs) love this!
review/text: We have three dogs, A Great Dane,  a Italian Gray hound/ Boston Terrier mix and now a wire hair fox terrier.<br /><br />We have tried a number of Dog foods, especially with the first two...seeing how they are both very lean with minimal body fat.  We had to find a dog food that would keep meat on their bones, be good for their bowels and something they liked.<br /><br />We have tried the store brands and regular Purina...a bunch of junk that is....  They couldn't keep on weight, their bowel movements were a mess... what else could you expect....<br /><br />We tried the super expensive kind made with great ingredients and it's suppose to make them fuller so they eat less and poop less due to absorbing most of the good nutrients and be better al round.....  Well that didn't work.  Our Dogs dropped so much weight,  you could see their ribs start to be bony...their poop was firmer but we had to feed them way more than recommended...which made the cost go higher  (the price is supposed to average out because your supposed to feed them less.....)  Still, even with more feedings they didn't gain weight....<br /><br />Then our little dog started to boy cote eating because she decided she didn't like it.  She seriously wouldn't eat but a few bites.  We had the vet check them all out, no worms or anything they weren't sick we just had to keep looking for the right food and in the mean time try putting eggs on it or mix in leftovers.  We did that and she would push around the dog food and eat the other stuff...so pick she was!<br /><br />It wasn't until we dog sat another dog who ate Beneful Healthy weight, then she started to eat!  She loved it and would eat his food.  So we went out and bought The Original Beneful and all the Dogs loved it, they ate it up.  They eat once a day and are satisfied, their bowels are firm and they quickly gained their weight back.  We did mix in a bag of  puppy beneful to help with quick weight gain but then after that first bad we just used the original.  We would use a bag of the puppy food during growth spurts and the end of fall to help maintain a healthy weight.<br /><br />We love it and can't say enough good things about it and the cost is sufficient...more than others but less than those high dollar ones.  I know what the others say about the first ingredients and what not...but I know what works for our dogs and this is it!

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself, provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

review/summary: Not a good dog food
review/text: This is bottom of the barrel dog food. You can tell by the ingredient list. The number one and three ingredients are a low grade filler; corn. The number 5 ingredient is beef tallow, which is a low grade beef fat. Scrolling through the rest of the list you find nothing but low grade fillers like wheat flour, soy flour, and rice flour. Wheat is the number 1 cause of food allergies in dog food. Soy is another filler that is a poor source of protein for dogs and another high cause of allergies for dogs. Grains and fillers are not a natural part of the canine diet.<br /><br />You'd be better off feeding your dog nachos.

review/summary: Magic Curry Powder
review/text: This stuff is amazing, 10 times better then generic "curry powder" that you'll find in bulk, or most of the stuff you'll find in jars at stores.  I've had some home made, and some restaurant Indian cooking that equals or betters the flavor of this curry powder, but, to achieve that they have roasted fresh whole seeds in oil and used other traditional Indian cooking methods which are a little more difficult than simply sprinkling a pile of this wonderful powder over a pan full of onions in a pan.<br /><br />If you don't want to use butter in your curry recipe you can use canola oil instead and it won't be quite as good, but still delicious.  I usually make a curry with a couple chopped onions, cauliflower, chicken, a handful of black currents, and canned or frozen peas, everyone LOVES it.  If you want to add a sauce you can saute finely chopped onions and tomatoes with curry powder and puree it.  You could also optionally add any of the following to the sauce: tomato paste, cardamom, tamarind, lentils (dahl), cream, chopped apples or pears, mango, coconut, coconut milk (more of an east Asian style if you add coconut/coconut milk).<br /><br />If you add cream to your curry, that usually goes best when it has a tomato flavored sauce, at an Indian restaurant you'll find this in a dish called "Chicken Tikka Masala" which is a decadent and delicious dish.<br /><br />PLEASE AMAZON, bring this item back in stock as soon as possilbe!!! PLEASE!<br /><br />I was so excited when I found it, but I couldn't order it right then as I was headed out.  When I tried to order it the next day I was devastated to find it was sold out :(  This is such a better deal than the offers from other sellers on here for just one can.<br /><br />If I could give this product an extra sixth star, I would.

review/summary: Makes everything taste better
review/text: If you compare the price of this to one of the bigger-name American spice producers like Durkee or Spice Island, prepare to be shocked.  Especially when you consider that the big named ones have sat on the shelf longer than this one has.  What makes me the voice of authority?  I am a buyer at a small grocery store.<br /><br />Price aside, this curry is far superior.  Just smell it!  Divine... Yes, it is a bit saltier than other curry powders out there; just keep in mind that you don't need to add any more salt to a dish.  A quick meal can be made by dumping a good measure of this curry powder in a pot with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036QLLL2">Thai Kitchen Unsweetened First Pressing Coconut Milk (95% Organic),13.66 -Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and whatever veggies/tofu/meats you have on hand.  Basically, you just stir, heat and eat.  For a lip smacking snack, sprinkle the curry on sweet potato fries. Yummy!

review/summary: The packaging is annoying
review/text: Enfamil is the brand my son drinks and it's been great.  However this new packaging is annoying to use.  I thought it would be like Similac's new packaging (with the plastic container) but Enfamil has a bag inside to keep the formula fresh.  Normally when I scoop out the formula, I like to shake it off to make the scoop even out.  It's really difficult to shake out the formula from the bag and I have to shove my hand in the bag to get to the formula (especially when it's getting low), then my hand gets powder all over it.  I haven't dumped the formula directly in the container because I want it to stay fresh, so scooping out formula is now a messier task.  It takes a little longer too (when I have a screaming baby, I don't want scooping out formula to slow me down).  The only plus side is that there's a little plastic grab thing inside the lid that holds the scooper so you don't have to leave it in the powder.

review/summary: Changed the powder fineness in addition to packaging
review/text: I agree with everyone else that the packaging is a pain in the neck and dump it into a 3-cup sized tupperware container--unlike the container provided, I'm confident the seal will hold (even if accidentally dropped!) and can put the sticker from the refill bag with lot info, etc, right on the lid. And trying to find the "eco-smart" refills on the shelf is a pain in the neck--they are never in stock and are even 4-5 weeks backordered on Amazon!<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that in addition to the packaging, they changed *something* with the formula. Probably just fillers, but it's still a pain in the neck. I have to dissolve the powdered formula in breastmilk to give my daughter higher calories, and this new stuff just doesn't dissolve well and I end up with little "pearls" or clumps of formula throughout. If I'm doing straight formula, I can shake *really* well and let the bubbles disperse before feeding, but you can't vigorously shake breastmilk.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my daughter prefers the enfamil taste, so I can't switch to similac or others.

review/text: Totally agree that the new packaging is a pain in the neck.  I switched to Enfamil after the Similac recall, and I have half a mind now to return to Similac because of the annoyance of the Enfamil container (plus Enfamil is more expensive!).  I'm sure the formula itself is good stuff (hence the 2 stars), but you wind up losing a fair bit every time you empty the stupid bag into the plastic bin. -- It's POWDER, after all, so it practically clouds up and is messy.  And the hinged top of the plastic bin is loose, and the scoop isn't as secure as the Similac device, etc., etc.  HATE it.  And the whole notion of buying refill bags is a racket because they're hard to find and represent NO savings.  What were the Johnson Mead people thinking?!?  I wish they had just copied the Similac design.  Or better yet, I wish the Abbott people hadn't screwed up with the need to recall . . .

review/summary: Crappy packaging. Formula is decent I suppose.
review/text: To add to the pile-on, really really hate the new packaging. Saw the reviews here and thought "Come on people, it's just a package," but then when we actually had to deal with it (after having used the good ole fashioned big round canister). No, it's not world ending, but it's just unnecessary annoyance that you don't need when you're low on sleep and changing poop-filled diapers all day. I suppose on the bright side, the new packaging likely helped to justify the continued employment of a few folks in Enfamil's Brand Marketing department ("Based on our focus group testing, modernizing our packaging will boost sales by .14%!"). In this tough job market, I say good on 'em.<br /><br />As for the formula itself, well, it's formula. Our baby drinks this just the same as if she were drinking generic Costco formula. We put out the extra cash because this mixed better (i.e., it doesn't clump), but the annoyance factor of the new Enfamil packaging actually made us start considering alternatives. Then we saw an article today on Huffpost about infants in China developing breasts because of hormones in formula. It also mentioned the lack of regulation in the US on using milk or milk products (e.g., formula) from cows that have been injected with growth hormones. That was enough for me. Organic formula it is.<br /><br />Ciao Enfamil.

review/text: The packaging is a major bear.  As others noted, you have to dump the bag into a container that is barely large enough to hold it.  Pretty much every time, I dump about a scoop onto the counter.  Also, because the lid is attached, it "swoops" down and actually blows some powder out every time you close it.  Our counter top is always a mess, so I finally just got a secondary tupperware container.<br /><br />Also, it may be a fluke, but when they switched to this new package, my son had trouble keeping the formula down.  He may have had a bug, but I'm guess the change upset his stomach.  Only a few more months of bottles, but if we have another little one, we will be using Similac.

review/summary: very pleased
review/text: We had our son on Gentlease since he was 4 months old due to our son not being able to tolerate Similac Advance. He was horribly gassy and fussy.  His Dr diagnosed him with mild AR so she advised us to add some ceral to the Gentlease. I tasted the gentlease as I taste everything my son eats and OMG it was HORRIBLE!  The cereal helped to mask the bitterness and our son drank it for 4 months.  As our son got older, ate more and more solids, I wanted to stop with the cereal in his bottles. But he wouldn't drink the gentlease w/o the cereal:/  His Dr said she had no problem with us switching to Enfamil Premium.  I was very scared to do so, as I read horrible reviews about the dual prebiotics causing loose stools.  Our son has been on this Premium formula for 3 weeks now and we are very pleased. We noticed larger stools but that is not bad considering the gentlease constipated our son at times.  The cereal our son was getting did contain the Pre and Probiotics so maybe his GI system was already adjusted to them. But I am so glad he is drinking this formula and it tastes so much better than Gentlease.  For those complaining about the packaging.  You're supposed to dump the bag into the container. Yes, it is a bit messy but it's definitely not something I would change formula brands over, that is just plain ridiculous!  If the formula is working, don't go changing it because you get a little bit of powder on your hands, get a grip people!

review/summary: does NOT contain corn syrup!!!
review/text: I've been using prosobbe soy formula and breastmilk, my baby had serious acid reflux... I decided to change to this formula for 3 main reasons: 1. NO added corn syrup, as for soy formula has 55% of CS. 2. She is very constipated, hoping this will work 3. Way cheaper than paying 28-30 bucks.<br /><br />Very important to read the label.  Corn syrup is a  seriously quiet health risk for babies over time. I thought about organic but about 29 formulas were tested with a high level of arsenic which is extremely harmful for babies. Unfortunatly, the name of the formulas tested were not disclosed. I gave it 4 stars bceause I still need time to see my baby's reaction. Also, I found the formula for 22 bucks at Walmart.

review/text: This is the formula we received when our baby was born and that our pediatrician recommended. She was nursing and the formula was used as a supplement. We have not tired any other formula so we can't really compare this to anything else. But I can tell that she liked the taste.<br /><br />The cost of this is comparable everywhere. The advantage of buying from Amazon is that I'm saving on tax. The disadvantage is that I can't use any manufacturer's coupon.

review/text: Tried a couple of different brand name formulas and our son takes this one the best.<br />As far as people complaining baout packaging, get a grip of yourselves.  It's an extra measure to keep the food fresher, AND, if you read the box, you can actually dump the powder out of the bag into the tub, as long as you wash the tub prior to doing so.  If you are really that annoyed with the packaging, then washing 1 extra tub (provided you wash all your baby bottles after each feeding) once a week is NOT a big deal.  Get over it and stop lowering star average for this.  Bottom line, the formula itself is outstanding.

review/text: I think I have tried every sugar free variety of maple syrup made. Carey's is the best!  Most sugar-free syrups have a thickener in them that is supposed to mimic regular syrup. Instead, it creates a gelatinous texture that I don't care for. Carey's is a little thinner than regular syrup, but not too liquid. The taste is also miles above other sugar-frees I have tried. (I even prefer it over a regular maple syrup). My grocery store doesn't carry it anymore, so I buy it by the case on Amazon.

review/summary: Superb quality flax seeds
review/text: I bought this item based on health reasons, reviews of the product here and all the great information on the internet about the benefits of adding flax seeds to my daily diet.  I also bought a mini coffee grinder just for this product.  At first I tried to chew it, ugh... it takes a lot of hard work, I felt like a cow chewing cud and the flavor is extremely, uh... earthy.  So instead I ground it up in my new coffee grinder and added it to yogurt, YUM... the earthy flavor is gone and a nutty wholesomeness is added to my yogurt.  I add it to everything and it makes a great addition to my healthy diet.  The seeds look fresh, clean and healthy.  They almost looked too perfect with a nice shiny shell.  The freshly ground meal smells very clean and definitely has a nice nutty bite.  There is about more or less a year on the expiration date on the package that I received.  I would recommend this specific product to anyone who wants to add a bit of health to their daily diet.  I'll more likely than not be ordering more of this stuff in the near future at the rate that I've been chowing down on it.

review/text: My brother bought a six-pack of this stuff, and I like lemon juice in my water, so I figured I would try it.<br /><br />Boy oh boy am I regretting it. I can see how some people might really enjoy this drink, but to me it was a bit like being punched in the mouth. It's at first mouth-puckeringly sour with just a little bit of that "sparkling" thing, then a strong, bitter undercurrent comes through, like eating the white pith of a citrus peel. Then, finally, once that subsides, this awful metallic aftertaste just sits on the tongue. And now my stomach is hurting from the acidity.<br /><br />If you like strongly-flavored things, you might enjoy this for sure. If you are expecting lemonade, or water with lemon juice, drink something else. This is more like bitter lemon juice with sparkling water.

review/summary: Great sour lemon taste
review/text: I hate sparkling water, so I was reluctant to try this for fear that it would taste like S. Pellegrino's sparkling mineral water...much to my amazement, I LOVE the taste of this! I love pretty much anything with a lemon flavor to it, and although this isn't really a lemon flavor per se, it has enough of a lemon taste to be called "limonata." This looks like a traditional soda, since it comes in a traditional soda aluminum can. This, however, is more of a carbonated sour lemon drink that is more cool and refreshing than any soda without being excessively sweet or syrupy like regular citrus sodas can be. The only catch is that it really is sour (not excessive, but fairly strong in sourness), so if you don't like sour things you will not like this drink. You are better off going with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4">San Pellegrino Sparkling Beverage, Orange, 11.15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, which is not sour at all and is more of a sweet, orange flavor. If you like lemons or if you are tired of the usual Sprite/Sierra Mist/Mountain Dew flavors then give this drink a try. It is a refreshingly different twist.

review/summary: surprisingly good
review/text: I enjoy eating ramen, and noodles in general, and since the powers-that-be took away our lunch break, during the workday I end up surviving on microwave-only, or just-add-water items while sitting at my desk. I try to cycle through various brands and flavors and types.<br /><br />I've had other Myojo noodles before (the boil-in-a-pot-at-home variety) and they've always tasted great.<br /><br />The way this yakisoba is prepared is by first pulling open a designated corner to access the interior. You have to remove four small packets (seasoning/ingredients), lying on top of the dry noodles inside. You tear open and pour in the dried veggie packet. You pour in the boiling water...I used the hot water from a water cooler...and cover the top. It says to wait 3 minutes...I wait about 5 minutes since the water I'm using isn't as hot, but I guess it also depends on what you prefer for the consistency of your noodles. You then remove a sticker tab from the top, drain the noodles through the slits the sticker tab had covered, remove the top, and add and mix around the contents of the remaining three packets into the noodles and it's ready to eat. I hope I didn't make it sound like a complicated science experiment, but when you do it, it's actually pretty simple.<br /><br />Their fill-and-drain packaging works well, I've had other noodle bowls where the drain holes/slits were too big and the noodles fall out into the sink, or the water doesn't drain out properly.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, it's surprisingly good (from looking at the ingredients, it looks like it uses tuna product for flavor, not beef)...when I go out to eat, I order beef yakisoba, because the beef base provides the best flavor (or so I believe). My friend orders chicken yakisoba because she remembers some really tasty beef yakisoba her grandma used to make her, but she no longer eats beef. And the chicken yakisoba she orders always tastes bad (and she agrees).<br /><br />If you're a meat-lover, this yakisoba could be even better if it had some sort of meat-like bits to add extra texture.

review/text: I grew up in Japan and know what really good yakisoba tastes like, and though nothing better than the ones that you can buy at those yakisoba booth at festivals, this instant yakisoba exceeded my expectation! I don't trust the plastic, so I prepare in my frying pan by boiling the noodle and vegetable packet in it for just few minutes, then throw the water (make sure to throw out as completely as possible), mix the sauce packet with the noodle, then finally put it on the dish to add some nori (seaweed sheet), bonita flakes, and pickled ginger to enjoy. The tip is to not to over cook this. It takes only few minutes to prepare and makes great quick lunch! I'll keep buying it!

review/summary: Yakisoba: a savory substitute for instant ramen meals
review/text: Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba is a tasty instant noodle meal that leaves me wistful for Japan's summer festivals where vendors cook mountains of noodles on flattop grills.<br /><br />Yakisoba traditionally is prepared with a sweeter, thicker condiment than Worcestershire sauce. Stir-fried with small pieces of pork and vegetables (cabbage, onion and carrot are the most common), yakisoba is flavored with many different seasonings, depending on which Japanese region the dish is prepared.<br /><br />The Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba package comes with four packets -- dehydrated vegetables, spices, yakisoba sauce and a mayonnaise-mustard blend -- that require more preparation than the typical ramen noodle meals. Don't let that dissuade you from buying Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba though, meal preparation only takes a few minutes; the extra steps are explained clearly on the side of the package (step-by-step illustrations are on the lid).<br /><br />The key to preparation is to drain as much of the hot water as possible. Again, unlike instant ramen, you don't want a broth. These are dry-style noodles. Add the sauce, spice and mayonnaise-mustard packets together and stir thoroughly. The noodles should be covered completely and slightly sticky with no pools of sauce in the foam tray.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: If you have not yet enjoyed Japan's festival food, I highly recommend tomorokoshi (grilled corn on the cob), okonomiyaki (savory, vegetable pancakes), takoyaki (octopus dumplings cooked in iron molds), yakitori (grilled skewered chicken), jaga bataa (steamed potatoes with butter) and, for dessert, either anzu ame (candied apricots) or kakigori (shaved ice).

review/summary: Yakisoba
review/text: I love varieties of microwavable foods.  I guess you can say I'm somewhat of a microwavable food nut, and/or lazy.  Recently, I've come across different microwavable Asian dishes.  From shrimp microwavable soups, to gyoza, but this instant yakisoba from Myojo has to be by far my favorite microwavable item.  After eating this one, I tried my luck with other brands of Yakisoba, and I must say, this is hands down the best tasting one.  Also the cooking process is simple, you put in the hot water, let stand for 3 minutes, drain the water.  With the other brands, the noodles would fall out and keep the noodles wet.  I stock up on these whenever I go to the market.  Personally I like to glob on cupid mayonnaise, makes it so much better.  (red cap mayo at the asian markets) I know the box may look intimidating especially for non asians, but try it any ways, you won't be disappointed.

review/text: These noodles are awesome, been eating them for years in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are hard to find at times because they are imported, so finding them on Amazon is great. Shipping was fast and price is reasonable- I have paid 100 dollars for 2 cases of 12 shipped from other vendors (KOAMART). Please understand, these are buckwheat noodles, not ramen noodles. Packaging was a little weird, they are shrink wrapped 6 to a flat, but these are the real deal.

review/text: I really liked these noodles. The only problem is they are pretty expensive - over $3 each when I bought them. I was able to find a case of 12 at a local Asian store for $27 ($2.25 each). My friend stationed in Japan brought back the Nissin Big UFO Yakisoba noodles when he was on leave once and I really liked those too. It has been very difficult for me to find that particular brand in the US though. These are a very good substitute.

It isn't exactly the healthiest thing, but it has a fantastic flavor that you can't beat.<br /><br />Here in the states, none of the other brands of yakisoba would cut it.  They just didn't have the same flavor.  I was thrilled when I discovered that Amazon carried the Myojo brand.<br /><br />They came promptly and I was very satisfied with my purchase. I'll definitely be getting these again.

review/text: My wife introduced me to these - we bought them at the Japanese store in Epcot.  After we'd eaten the two we bought, I wanted to find them on the web, so I was pleased to see you could get them at Amazon.  This is a tasty noodle dish.  It's not what I first thought - a soup.  It is really noodles, with a spicy mustard, mayo, soy sauce mix.  It's easy to prepare as well - the ingredients are all with the pack and it just requires boiling water.  The container is pretty neat too - a built in strainer that lets you prepare the noodles and then drain the water without needing any additional utensils or bowls.  It's a little expensive if you just want ramen noodles - it's much more exotic IMO.  Try it!

review/text: I love these noodles. They are tender and firm. The sauce is sweet and savory, and the spice has a nice green flavor and gentle heat. I don't like the mustard mayonnaise--it's very tangy and kinda horseradishy/wasabi-flavored. That and the price are why I deducted a star. I was disappointed because this "mustard mayonnaise" seemed very intriguing and is part of why I purchased the product. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised since I don't like American mustard or mayo, but I figured this would be far removed from either of those. It was, but I still didn't like it. To make the noodles even better, add a piece of fish on top.

I prefer letting the noodles sit for a few minutes after adding the spices so it's not so wet when I eat it but that's only because when I make yakisoba, I like it a little dry and crunchy.

The packaging, with it's drain spout is extremely intelligent, the portion size is perfect, the flavours are fantastic together (although i added a bit of spicy chili sesame oil for a bit of heat) ... slightly tangy and very mildly sweet. The noodles have a nice consistency as well and a good flavour (typical instant noodle noodles don't provide much flavour on their own)... And don't be afraid of the mustard mayo. Forgoing it would definitely have you missing out on the full experience of this meals flavour.

review/text: I am very pleasantly surprised by these delicious Japanese noodles. There is no soup, as in ramen noodles, just fantastic taste from combining the four included flavoring packets. These noodles are not spicy at all, just subtle and elegant tasting. I find that the noodles pair well with lighter drinks such as sake, and alternately, apple cider. The self draining packaging container, which is used to cook the noodles, is absolutely ingenious. Preparation is so simple, that from pantry to ready to eat is ten minutes maximum. I am already planning my next order!

review/text: This kind of Ramen can't be compared to the cheap 50 cent one you get in your local supermarket.. I paid for like $3 for one of these ($18 for 6) and this has so many different flavors from the mustard mayonnaise to the sauce and to the spices. Mustard mayonnaise might sound bad but it's not a yellow mustard we have in the USA but a more Asian mustard with more spices. It's around 600 calories, and this filled me up when I had it for supper. If you like Japanese food or Ramen, then you have to get it.

I was expecting a much spicier taste.  They are actually quite mild compared, for example, to the Korean "Shin Ramyun" noodles (different kind of noodles also of course).  These have a more intricate layered flavor, but not much heat.  Also, as someone else mentioned, at three bucks a pop, they are a little on the pricey side considering that for two or three more bucks you can go out and get something fresh.  Item did come quick in only two days...

review/text: I think I received a bad batch( there's no expiration date).  Tried one---made me a bit queasy afterwards; like a fool I tried another( a few days later), this time w/o the mustard/mayo, and felt sick again.  These have probably been sitting on the shelf in a sweltering warehouse for quite some time, which can't be good for the mustard/mayo or the oily soy sauce pack.  That aside, they don't taste too bad actually but nowhere near as good as the other reviews would suggest.  I ordered a couple other Myojo ramen and they seemed fine, so I'm guessing it's just the luck of the draw---ordering food products from Amazon is something of a crapshoot( I've had stale popcorn delivered too).

It didn't take long for the phrase "shoe leather" to pop into my mind. I was a little scared for my teeth.<br /><br />The package claims "Premium Steak". Somehow I would expect this, even jerked, would be more easily chewed. So I'm not at all sure that this is in fact premium steak. I wouldn't mind WHAT cut of beef it is as long as I could eat it.<br /><br />There are several other things I like about this beef jerky beside the flavor. It says it is "minimally processed, no artificial ingredients, no preservatives added". Ingredients listed are:<br /><br />beef<br />sugar<br />water<br />beef stock<br />salt<br />spices<br />natural smoke flavor<br />vinegar<br /><br />In case you care to know, in fine print, the bag says "contains beef from one or more of the following sources - the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand and Uruguay". It also says that for consumer inquiries, you may call 1-877-453-7591 weekdays 8-4 Pacific Time. I give you this extra information in case you (who are wanting to take a chance that I just got a tough bunch) need to check before ordering online due to dietary restrictions.

review/text: I've always bought the standard jars of peanut butter and it was fine until recently.  I'm really not sure when my family upped their PB consumption, but when a jar was being emptied each week I decided to take action. In looking on Amazon I came across the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035N3BEG">Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter 64 Ounce Bottle</a> and it came in a 2 pack. This seemed like the perfect solution and I set myself up on Subscribe & Save. The peanut butter is fresh with plenty of time for use before the expiration date and with the larger jar opening makes it less likely that someone will make a mess. As long as Amazon continues to offer competitive pricing, I'll continue to let them deliver this to my door.

review/text: We eat tons of peanut butter, and have always enjoyed Skippy brand.  I was happy to find this 64-ounce jar sold in a two-pack, and signed up for automatic delivery.  This saves me 15% on the purchase price.  But even if you don't want automatic delivery, this item ships free with a $25 purchase.<br /><br />But back to the peanut butter - we like the creamy texture and peanut-y taste of Skippy. It spreads easily on bread, and tastes good on a spoon too. Peanut butter is a high protein, low carb food that stores well on the pantry shelf, and of course kids love it.  The large jar means fewer times scraping with a spatula to get the last bits out.<br /><br />This Skippy 64-oz. jar is a great value, and we'll enjoy receiving it automatically every 3 months.<br /><br />Edited March 2012:  I've cancelled the automatic delivery since the price has gone up to nearly $50 for two container.  We like Skippy, but we won't be buying any more until the price comes down.

review/summary: Easy access to peanut butter
review/text: This is a wonderful size.  I don't know if others have the same issue, but when I get the smaller containers (16.3oz size) - it is hard to get all the peanut butter out from the sides and the bottom.  This sized container makes it painless to get ALL the peanut butter out.  Plus, at 4 lbs, we have peanut butter for a couple of weeks at least!

review/summary: A great buy on a great peanut butter
review/text: I stocked up on Skippy when I heard the news that peanut prices were going to take a big jump due to drought conditions in the south.  Got it at a great price, enough to last several months, and delivered to my door.  What's not to like about that?  Making peanut butter cookies for Christmas, and love this product for that purpose as well as everyday PBJ.

review/text: This is good peanut butter. Much better then the store brand. And at 0.12 cents per ounce about 60% cheaper then my overpriced small town Nevada grocery store. Subscribe and save is the way to go with this product.

review/summary: "Hydrogenated"
review/text: Wish I'd known before I bought this. "Hydrogenated" means partially hydrogenated means "huge trans fats" but atleast now I've learned something. I had assumed it meant "fully hydrogenated" which is an entirely different thing. Never eaten anything with huge amounts of trans fats and now I know what that's like... I won't say what happened but I won't be touching this stuff again. Worse than paying more for something else at the grocery store. Too bad I ordered another order before I figured out why I was getting so sick. I will cancel my subscription.

review/summary: Made in China
review/text: These dog treats sounded so wonderful.  Didn't know they were made in China!  Wrote email to SmartBones and they assured me the product is safe. I will never trust animal products made in China.  So many products for dogs are made there. My dog hasn't gotten sick from the bones.  I suppose each consumer must make the choice for their own animals.  I looked for the Smartbones on several sites and didn't see China on the ads.  Seems like homemade might be better.  There is nothing like made in the USA.

review/summary: Big Hit With Our Pooches
review/text: Piper and Gabby received some Smart Bones for Christmas. Little Gabby had never had a chew this large and neither had ever had a Smart Bone, so we didn't know what to expect.<br />As soon as the Smart Bones came out of the package, two doggy noses started sniffing the air with gusto.<br />The girls thoroughly enjoyed their bones and were kept busy with them two evenings in a row. At first Gabby wasn't sure how to attack her bone but quickly got the hang of it.<br /><br />LIKES<br />peanut butter taste<br />rawhide free<br />contains real, dried chicken breast<br />fortified with vitamins and minerals<br />easy to digest<br /><br />RESERVATIONS<br />made in China<br />the cost<br /><br />Piper's dental surgeon advised us never to give our dogs chew bones that were not flexible. These bones are a little harder than I would like, but they are more flexible than some chew bones.

review/summary: Made 2 dogs sick
review/text: My dogs (1 5month old and 1 7year old) both got diarrhea and vomitting after eating these treats. They liked them a lot when we bought them, but within a week both dogs had upset stomachs. When the puppy was sick we assumed she had just gotten into something, but she had diarrhea for 3 days and then had blood in her stool. When we took her to the vet they could not attribute it to anything specific. When the older dog got sick a day after eating one of these we concluded it must be the bones. She has never been sick enough to warrant any medications before and we are putting her on medicine and prescription food to get over this. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: makes our dog sick.. be advised made in china...
review/text: So we've purchased this product (not from Amazon)for our Scottish Terrier  and he ate them with gusto. But he has gotten violently ill several times after eating them. regrettably as much as he loves them we're not going to give them to him anymore. He was very ill and I've never seen a dog throw up like these made him. Usually our dog throws up whatever makes him sick and moves on none the less for wear... These however had him shaking and projectile vomiting, and whimpering and crying in pain.. we were very scared for him... As a matter of fact he just got sick and that's what made us write this... we are watching over him right now as he pulls himself together.<br /><br />In any event, unfairly or not, anything foodstuff made in China is suspect and these are made in china . We are not going to purchase these again and would recommend strongly that no one else purchase these or any other treat/food made in China until quality control is MUCH improved...<br /><br />Thanx...

review/summary: Sick Dog
review/text: My lab has a pretty sensitive stomach, and can't handle rawhide well, so I decided to try these. First of all, it is quite brittle, and she finished it in less than a minute. When she bit into it, it broke into shards. Later that night, she starts vomiting heavily, which she hasn't done a single time since I first got her over a year ago. Should have paid more attention to where the product was made.

review/summary: dangerous!
review/text: I ordered SmartBones for my 11 month old American Eskimo puppy. he is 30 lbs. and I ordered the medium size. Within a minute after starting on the SmartBone he had yanked off the entire "end" which slipped easily into his throat. Fortunately my daughter and I were able to save him with a combination of our fingers and the Heimlich maneuver. I contacted the company from which I had ordered this very expensive product and all they had to say was there hadn't been any negative feedback. I reminded them ALL the reviews on all of their products were positive and that the effect was as though I had offered my puppy a "too small" ball to play with. I was able to, quite easily, slip off the remaining "end" of the bone and noted due to the shape( hole in the end) had it slipped into Gerry's throat--- hole end in ---it would've created a vacuum and the outcome might have been fatal. Granted he attacked it with gusto; he is a puppy!, but this product is clearly dangerous. It is described as having a vegetable outside and "real chicken" inside but all I unraveled was a tough, rubbery mess. Never again; back to trustworthy Nylabones which provide months of safe chewing. I wouldn't give Smartbones even one star but that is the lowest rating offered.I plan to show the product to my vet and demonstrate how dangerous it is.

review/text: When I opened the bag I could smell the peanut butter.  And Scarlett the labradoodle loves them.  Wish they weren't quite as expensive though since she pretty much inhales them.

review/summary: Not worth the money
review/text: I got a Smartbone for our boxer/greyhound mix without knowing much about the product, mostly because we don't want him eating rawhide.  We didn't encounter any stomach issued after he ate it.  However, he devoured the large size bone in minutes!  I took it away after he ate half and gave him the other half a few days later.  In total, I would say it lasted for ten minutes tops.  He certainly enjoyed it (he literally skipped across the room when I gave him the other half), but it was a little too pricey for a 10 minute chew session.  I will try something else next time.
