review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001228QWY">Mrs. Weiss Kluski Enriched Egg Dumpling Noodles, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />This is a wonderful product that residents in California have not had much opportunity to purchase.<br />It is readily available in the East.<br />Thanks to AMAZON, they secured a case for me and delivered it to my Brentwood, CA home.<br /><br />The item is a perfect accompaniment to Chicken Noodle soup or just by themselves with a little butter.<br />Their texture is unmatched unless you make, roll and cut your own.<br />The availability of this product, in our home, preserves an old family tradition for us.

review/summary: perfect noodles
review/text: When the grocery stores here (NM) stopped carrying these I asked friends to ship them to me. I was delighted to be able to find them on line. These are like my grandmother's noodles- they are a little bit chewy, they can withstand being re-heated, an they actually taste like something. I have found that most noodles have no flavor, but these have a smooth egg flavor that adds to the recipe instead of just being a filler. I will be ordering more soon- our 12 bags are already gone!!

review/summary: Highly recommended
review/text: The vending machine at work carries this variety in 1.25oz bags.  Great product.  Simple, natural ingredients (Dry roasted almonds, cashews, pistachios, evaporated cane sugar, tapioca syrup, blueberry, pomegranate, sea salt, natural flavors).  And if it matters (in the 1.25oz bag):  180 calories, 8g net carbs (11 - 3g fiber).  Delicious.  There's enough in the pack to make for good snack.  I was somewhat surprised that the price on Amazon was not cheaper (figured I could do better than the vending machine @ 1.25 per pack.  strange.). Guess I've got a good thing going:)<br />Bottom line:  If you want a trail mix that's simple and tasty, this is definitely worth a try.

review/text: My nephew told me about these when he purchased in an airport for a snack.  The description alone intrigued me.  He and I then went on Amazon to see if they had them, and three days later, they arrived.  I love these for a snack during the work day. They are delicious, and give me the crunch I crave, and the pop of blueberry/pomegranate sweetness that I love with it.  The second best thing is that they are healthy, especially compared to the other snacks I tend to grab.  GREAT find my nephew, and thanks Amazon for the reasonable pricing.

review/summary: great dog food!
review/text: my rescue dog has always thrown up a lot. a few times a week at times.<br />he also likes to eat grass. i switched around to various dog foods looking for the answer. after buying blue buffalo life protection he has only thrown up once in a month. he has also quit eating grass. i didn't have to blend blue buffalo with how old dog food. i just poured it in his bowl and he loved it. this is a PICKY dog as well. some dog foods he just wouldn't eat. i know that blue buffalo has superior ingredients to most grocery stores food. this has made a BIG difference in the way he looks and act as well. not having to clean up dog throw up a few times a week is worth the extra cost between cheap dog food and great dog food. the dogs that died from poisons in their food were from cheap, artificial ingredients. i love my dog so much i would do anything and spend anything to keep him around longer. wouldn't you?

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: The Margaret Homes Seasoned Field Peas and Snaps are very tasty and different from any "ordinary" canned beans. The snaps add interesting flavor.  The "field peas" I'm familiar with more closely resemble "black-eyed peas", but these smaller, firmer peas are more flavorful.<br /><br />Margaret Holmes products are "Southern" canned vegetables.  My very Southern grandmother (God bless her) could not cook any vegetables without a thick slab of fat-back (very fatty bacon), which she called "seasoning".  I must admit, her vegies were very tasty, if unhealthy.  I have found that generous use of good olive oil <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FQV5C">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 17oz. bottle</a> and a tablespoon of Hormel Bacon Bits (actually ham chips) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NERTSE">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a> can duplicate Grandma's "seasoning".  These go very well with Margaret Holmes' products.<br /><br />I use the Field Peas and Snaps to make a great, almost instant, soup or stew.  Ingredients: 1 15oz can Seasoned Field Peas and Snaps: 1 1/2 cup water; 1/4 cup olive oil; 1/2 cup wild rice blend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G82L62">Lundberg Wild Blend, Gourmet Blend of Wild and Whole Grain Brown Rice, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>; 1/4 cup of Hormel Bacon Bits.  Mix ingredients and bring to a boil for 30 minutes to 1 hour.  Try it, it is truly a fantastic hearty satisfying soup---especially on those days when you are out of fresh ingredients.  Makes 2 large servings.  The peas are already spicy, so do NOT add pepper unless you are VERY sure you want more pepper.  The peas are also very salty---if making soup, you may wish to drain the beans rather than use the salty "juice".  If you use the juice AND add chipped ham---I guaranttee that the soup will be much too salty.<br /><br />You can use the same recipe with pork hocks instead of ham chips, for a VERY economical, VERY tasty dinner.  Boil the pork hocks (1 per person) by themselves for 2 hours (in addition I usually roast them until they begin to brown), then add the other ingredients and boil on low for 30 minites to 1 hour.<br /><br />For my reviews of the Lunberg Wild Rice, Hormel Bacon Bits, or Colovita Olive Oil, click on "See all my reviews" at the beginning of this review.

Each 1/2 cup serving is 50 cal., 280 mg sodium, 1 g fat, 10 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 6 g sugar, & 2 g protein.<br /><br />It has a garlic punch that is very pleasant, but it is low on real flavor.<br /><br />It contains chunks of tomatos and bits of garlic.  This is not a thick sauce.<br /><br />It taste much like diet sauces, and it is made from mostly tomato puree (water & tomato psaste).  And that's what it tastes like--water & paste.<br /><br />I give this sauce 1/5 for flavor, 2/5 for texture/thickness, 5/5 for organic integrity, & 5/5 for packaging.<br /><br />This sauce will require you to doctor it up to make it palatable.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I'm thrilled with this extract. I ordered it on a Tuesday night and had it by Friday afternoon. It came wrapped nicely in plenty of bubble wrap and tissue paper and was accompanied by a nice little note from the seller thanking me for my order.<br /><br />It smells wonderful. It smells just like cocoa powder, and I use it in all my baked goods and even savory foods. Added to gravy it gives it that little something extra, and it's phenomenal in whipped cream, cookies, brownies, sweetbreads, cakes, even coffee and hot chocolate. It's not a sweet extract so it gives some depth to foods without adding additiona sugar. I will definitely be ordering this in the future and definitely ordering from this merchant again. I am very impressed with the quality and the customer service provided!

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I love chocolate extract, and I'm so happy to have found a source that is cheaper than the outlets I normally buy from.  One warning:  Chocolate Extract only boosts the chocolate notes of products already containing some kind of chocolate or cocoa powder. Used in non chocolate baking, it brings a boost of flavor that may make someone ask "what is that I'm tasting?".  They may recognize chocolate, but you don't have to tell them what it is!

review/summary: High quality yummy treat for dogs!
review/text: My puppy loves these treats! She's allergic to wheat and gluten so it's hard to find treats for her (and ones that she likes). She has naturally dry skin and these definitely help! The omega 3 & 6 fatty acids provide what she needs to keep her coat healthy and shiny. It's great-- they don't contain any wheat, soybean, glutens, bad preservatives, or by-products. Not to mention that the salmon and sweet potatoes in it are known to be easily digestible. She gets so excited when I bring out the bag. Worth the money! Highly recommended!

review/summary: WARNING MADE IN CHINA!!!
review/text: I am downgrading from a 5 star to a 1 star because they are made in CHINA. Treats from China have been associated with kidney and liver failure and rare cancers in dogs. Another series of dog deaths from treats from China has been released. There is no oversight. These treats may be OK but I will not take any chances. I am really irritated with Amazon and the vendor for not disclosing the source of the product. They say in the online description, "read the label carefully". In very small print the country of origin is disclosed. I do not knowingly feed my dogs anything from China.<br /><br />These are great treat. My dogs love them and they are no artificial stabilizers or fillers. However, at most other on line pet websites they are half the price. Usually Amazon is competitive in pricing but not on this line of products.

review/text: The product itself is great, thus my 5 stars. My dogs love these and I think it's helping their dry skin, but ... WOW @ the price! I had no idea the 6-oz. size is the same package I buy at PetsMart for $4.99 - HALF the cost I paid here - and for 3 bags at that! :((((( I had run out, so I didn't have a package to check the size. I thought I'd add these to my Amazon order for convenience, and *assumed* the 6-oz. bag must be considerably larger than the ones I get at PetsMart, given that the price was TWICE - very odd for Amazon, so I never suspected the packages are the same size! People - definitely get these from PetsMart, or check PetsMart or Petco online even - this is WAY OVERPRICED! If I could have rated the price itself, it would have gotten ZERO STARS ~

If they are ignoring me outside, all I have to do is shake the bag and they come running...licking their chops on the way!<br /><br />More importantly, the omega is great for their skin and coat - one of my dogs has issues with dry skin/flaking.  As long as I give these to her on a regular basis - her skin is flake free and her coat is absolutely beautiful!<br /><br />It's a win win - my dogs love them and they are good for them!

review/summary: Duck!  Treats Are Coming
review/text: These two-millimeter long treats don't have the pronounced smell of the tuna treats. Like the other Omega treats these are easy to break in half, but are small enough for many dogs to eat in one piece. The shih tzu pair, with their dainty snouts, prefer to have their duck treats torn or cut in two. Since the first ingredient in these Duck treats is duck liver, the girls are becoming treat snobs and act as if they are actually dining on Foie gras. I don't have the heart to tell them anything different.<br />Often the Omega Duck treats are mixed in with several other snacks on the breakfast plates. Always the duck treats are the first to disappear. It's funny to watch Piper push aside the other treats so that she can pick out the pieces of Omega treats. I have some reservations about the treat's country of origin, but the girls love these things and their lip smacking comments have all been positive.

review/summary: Smelly, but they make my doggies very happy
review/text: First of all, they stink.  Imagine fish lying around in the sun for a couple of hours.  Yeah, they're that smelly.<br /><br />But that, as it turns out, is why my dogs love them so much.  These treats are so special, in fact, that they're only given out when we want to get our girls into their crates, like at bedtime, or if we're going out or something.  They even know the bag...all I have to do it get it out of the cabinet and they're running off into their crates, waiting happily for their treats.<br /><br />I had read the review from the person who wrote that a fishbone had been found in one.  What I do is bend/break them down the middle before handing them out so I can feel if there's something sharp inside.<br /><br />So the bottom line here is...if my dogs love them, then I love them.  :)

review/summary: Oh Danny boy...the matcha, the matcha is calllling....
review/text: Irish cream teas tend to make me sad. What I've found is that they tend to taste like regular tea with a hint of Irish cream in the background, like you had poured a drop or two into your tea. Which is all well and good, but I drank Irish cream straight up when I was in college, and I want something that tastes like the drink itself. At this point, you're probably wondering if I did anything but drink in college. The answer is....no, not really. Ha! I want an Irish cream tea that I can splash into other teas to make them taste like Irish cream.<br /><br />So I cheated a little with this one. Just a little, I promise! I mixed my spoon of matcha with a few drops of my Irish cream agave before adding the water. I was blown away. It was so, so, so good. It got me through an incredibly long day at work and it kept a smile on my face long after it was gone. It smelled and tasted so strongly of Irish cream that my boss side eyed me a few times until I showed him it was just matcha. And then he was jealous.<br /><br />I love this tea. With the milk allergy issues, Irish cream was one of the things I had to give up and it was with a heavy heart that I did so. This is one of those teas I've been searching and searching for and once again, Red Leaf Tea did it right. I am constantly impressed by them...you'd think by now, I'd just expect their matcha to be amazing. But no, every time I get a new package, I'm floored by the tastiness.

review/summary: Creamy Boozy Delight
review/text: I got this one special for my boyfriend as a surprise. Last time he got to pick out a matcha, we ended up with Cola, so this time I thought an alcoholic drink matcha was in order. More sophisticated? Well - more adult anyways ;)<br /><br />He is loving the flavoured matcha as much (if not more!) than I do! This one smelled sweet from the get go - creamy and .. tangy? Smoky? Not smoky! I'm trying to describe what irish cream smells like - it doesn't have the smokiness of whisky - but it definitely is sweet and creamy! I knew it was going to be a real treat - just like the real thing!<br /><br /> What a neat flavour experience! I prepared the matcha straight and thick for the first bowl. In this state I tasted mostly matcha with an aftertaste of sweet cream that lingered after finishing the bowl. It was very creamy and pleasant.<br /><br />Next I tried it over ice with 18% cream and sugar. I thought my eyes were going to roll into the back of my head and be lost forever! This was mine and Mike's favourite way to enjoy it. It's sweet, but because you have control over the amount of sugar, it's not crazy sweet and cloying. You could probably enjoy cup after cup with the only buzz coming from the energy of all that matcha you're drinking!<br /><br />This one is so so good mixed with the Madagascar Vanilla matcha - it just adds a bit of something that takes the creamy flavour over the top. Come St. Patricks day, it would be an awesome drink to mix with mint matcha (Mint is on the way in the mail as we speak!) and hey - it's already green! No need to add any food colouring for your Paddy experience ;)<br /><br />Now - if a Guinness Matcha ever comes out - I know the perfect one to mix it with ;)

review/summary: Interesting
review/text: Same great carbonation as always from kristian regale. Red raspberry color, but almost with a touch of orange, and smells very different from any other juice I've had, must be the lingonberry, and I can get just a touch of the apple, a bit of a tart smell. A bit of a musky, dusty rose scent. It's a bit more strongly carbonated on the tongue, the fizz completely evaporates. Only a hit of the apple gets through the very powerful lingonberry. As typical, it's not as sweet as most juices, but also has a slightly bitter finish, and medium acidity. It had some noticeable dregs at the end.<br /><br />As for paring I'd drink it with something that you'd normally have with a fruity drink, maybe mexican food like fajitas or burritos.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Not as much as Kristian Reg&aacute;le's Pomegranate offering, but it's still a unique drink worth trying.

review/text: I am very happy with this coffee.  I used to have a very expensive Starbucks habit, combined with a heavy sugar habit.  While trying to reduce the sugar in my life, I have discovered that I don't like Starbucks without all of the added sugar to tone down the bitterness.  This decaf is much smoother and tastier to me.  I brew a strong cup, and this worked very nicely in my french press.  Even without sugar, I'm enjoying it very much.

review/summary: Our house decaf
review/text: This has become our "go to" decaf coffee.  It mixes well with regular coffees for a reduced caffeine blend and it is excellent on it's own as an accompaniment to an evening dessert.  The low acidity of the coffee helps to prevent the indigestion you can get from other coffees, especially when they accompany a rich dessert.  While this is billed as a dark roast, it's more like a medium dark roast.  While it isn't super flavorful, it is very good for a decaf.  The price of all coffee has increased recently but the price of this coffee is fairly reasonable when purchased in the 5-pound bags.

review/text: I got some of this from a low sodium foods website. I can't believe how much flavor this has for only 170mg per oz.  I am on a strict low sodium diet and I don't like foods where they have simply left out salt (bland) or they cheat and add potassium chloride, something just as bad as salt to my diet. So I am constantly on the hunt for low sodium foods that are naturally that way. This is a perfect cure for my salty food cravings. I haven't tried the other flavors yet but I plan to.

review/summary: Mung Beans for sprouting
review/text: I wanted to feed my chickens, turkeys and goats just a little extra protein to keep them fit and healthy while the goats are pregnant over the winter and the chickens and turkeys are getting ready for breeding season.  Sprouts seemed like a good idea but everytime I tried to sprout regular beans they would go bad before the sprouts were big enough to interest the poultry.  So I saw that the ones I was eating out of can were grown from mung beans.  Never heard of them before but thought I'd give it a try.  The beans took longer to get here than I would have liked (almost two weeks) but that just tells me the time frame I need before I order more.  And the beans!!!!  Oh my goodness, you'll get 100% germination and sprouts that are easily eaten and really quite yummy in just three days.  I need to get a bigger growing apparatus so that I can make more at one time.  The chickens, turkeys, goats and even my pregnant cow LOVE the sprouts.  I've found the extra source of protein I needed.  Thanks so much.

review/summary: My Favorite is Back!!
review/text: This was my favorite as a child. I would put one in my mouth and let it disolve.<br />Ghiradelli stopped making them when their packaging machine was broken when then moved from San Francisco to San Leandro (about 15 years ago). Rather than repair or rebuild it they just stopped making them. Despite years of protests from candy lovers. Now a new company is making them.<br />If you never had them before you may think "so what?" But if you grew up with them and miss them you will be thrilled.

review/text: I just got back from a trip to England where I had the most wonderful homemade tomato soup at a tearoom in Ashburton, Devon.  I thought I would never find anything to equal this homemade soup. I bought a can of Amy's Organic Chunky Tomato Bisque and one sip of this heavenly soup and I knew I had found something just as good if not better than the homemade soup in Devon, England.  I have now been adding some fresh Basil to this awesome soup!!!.  I hope that Amy's never changes their recipe for this excellent fresh tasting soup.

I was hoping this soup would be a less expensive replacement for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3OA7G">Scarpetta Tuscan Vodka Sauce, 19.8-Ounce Jar (Pack of 4)</a> that I use as both a sauce and a soup. The Scarpetta is unbelievable, with fresh herbs and a light, tangy taste, that in my opinion cannot be beat. I will have to continue to shell out the big bucks for the Scarpetta.

review/text: Last week, "The Hungry Girl" (from the Food Network) was on Good Morning America and claimed this was "The best soup ever! Ever! Ever!". I am not a big fan of Campbell's Tomato soup, but have enjoyed the various Progresso Tomato soups. I had to try this.<br /><br />It was fantastic.<br /><br />I see one of the other reviews mentioned using it as a pasta sauce. I can definitely see that.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me is that the low sodium version of the soup has a couple of negative reviews about it being too sweet. But it has the same amount of sugar in it, so I wonder if the lower salt content makes the sweetness stand out more?

It used to be possible to buy inexpensive edible gold and silver leaf (vark) in Indian groceries, but there seem to be problems nowadays with importing it.  So I was very happy to find this on Amazon.  Great for making a big impression by gilding a whole cake!  It's not hard and you don't need too many leaves.  Just carefully slide them off the paper leaves onto the cake, then smooth using a brush (a cosmetic type brush works well).  It won't be perfectly smooth, but good enough, and it'll wow whomever you're serving the cake to!  They're not likely to have seen something like this before.  Obviously this would be great for a golden wedding anniversary cake!!!

review/summary: Awesome product - learn to use them and you will be in love!
review/text: I first purchased Joulies when they got their start on Kickstarter.  Since I purchased them I have used them almost every day in my coffee on my way to work.  I use them in a Thermos vacuum mug (in my opinion the best way to use them).<br /><br />Before I had Joulies, I would pour my hot coffee into my mug before I left and have to wait for about half an hour to actually drink my coffee.  This is because the mug does such a good job of retaining the heat in the coffee.<br /><br />When I use Joulies, my coffee is ready to drink in about 5 minutes.  The excess heat gets absorbed by the Joulies as the material inside changes phase from solid to liquid.  This heat is then released back into the coffee as the material goes from liquid to solid, so the coffee stays hot for a lot longer (this doesn't benefit me very much, because I drink my coffee pretty fast).<br /><br />I have tried using them in a regular coffee mug, and while it got cooler a little faster, it didn't stay hot for very long because so much heat is lost to the environment.  I wouldn't recommend using them this way unless you really need your coffee one minute faster.<br /><br />So far they have been really durable, I've dropped them a few times and shake them in my mug to circulate the coffee.  They have gotten a little scratched, but it is no different from well used silverware.<br /><br />I have purchased a couple sets as gifts for the coffee lovers I know, and they have been well received.  Perfect thing to get for someone who has everything and can appreciate the nice bit of thermodynamics that Joulies demonstrate.

review/summary: Perfect Temperature Coffee
review/text: Love this product!  If I am completely honest, the first couple times I used them I wasn't sure if they worked the way I expected.  Then I noticed such a big difference when I didn't use them that I became a believer and now use them every time I drink coffee.<br /><br />Depending on the type of cup you use, you get different results.  The one thing that stays consistent is that the coffee becomes drinkable (hot, but not scalding) within a couple of minutes.  I use cream in my coffee, so in a coffee cup I will usually use 2 joulies and with my travel mug I use 3 joulies.  The general rule I have come up with is it increases drinking time to about 2 or 2 1/2 times the original time.  For example, in my open, no cover coffee cup, my coffee stays hot about 20-30 minutes and in my poorly insulated travel mug with cover, my coffee stays hot about an hour and a half rather than 30-45 minutes.  I just recently bought an insulated mug and am very excited to use the joulies with it, because I know I am going to have perfect temperature coffee for hours (much longer than my coffee usually lasts).<br /><br />This is a product I would recommend to any coffee drinker, as long as they know the type of cup you use does make a difference in the results you are going to get!  If you follow the guidelines provided with the product (pre-heating, using an insulated mug with cover, and experimenting with the number of joulies) you will find the combination that works for you.

review/summary: Works like a charm if used correctly
review/text: I have fallen in love with Coffee Joulies. I backed them when they were on Kickstarter and waited months for them to arrive. But since they came I have used them every day. They really do work at cooling your hot beverage down and keeping it at that optimal drinking temperature for longer. However your experience can vary wildly if you do not use them correctly. There is no golden rule as how to use them, you just have to figure that out for your own tastes and your drinking mug.<br /><br />Here are a couple of key things that you need to think about in the order of most importance:<br />*How much beverage you have<br />*How well your beverage container insulates<br />*How hot your drink is at the start<br />*How hot you like your drink<br />*How long before you drink it<br /><br />Let me explain a little bit. The more drink you have to cool, the more joulies you want to use. The better you container is at insulating, the better the effects of the joulies are. The hotter your drink is at the start, the more joulies you need to cool it down and the longer it will stay warm. If you like your drink cooler, use more joulies. If you like your drink still pretty hot, use less joulies or you can preheat your jouies with hot water before putting them in your beverage. If you are drinking really soon, make sure to use more joulies.<br /><br />The size of the joulies has been a complaint I have heard before. But really the amount of space they take up is very surprisingly negligible. If it bothers you, buy a bigger mug or drink less. I have heard people say that they do not work that well, if this is a problem for you get a better insulating mug. When I use these in a standard coffee mug it is usually hard to tell that there is any effect from the joulies. Also try stirring your beverage with the joulies in the mug, this help the joulies absorb heat better and release heat better when they need to. Some people worry that they will fall and hit your mouth when you try to drink the last bit of liquid. Don't be worried this does not happen, I thought it would at first too.<br /><br />Here is my method for making tea with joulies and it has really worked well for me. I have a Contigo 16oz mug for tea. It is great at keeping tea hot (5hrs+) but it takes forever to be able to drink it (1hr). With the coffee joulies I add 3 in, at room temperature before brewing my tea. I add my tea and hot water into the same mug and brew for 3 minutes with the lid on. Take out the tea, add some sugar and milk, and close the lid. I give the mug a few shakes to stir things up. Now in just about 5 minutes after the tea is brewed I can sip it (it used to take an hour for this). I can drink it comfortably in just about 15-20 minutes and it will stay hot at the perfect temperature for about 3 hours. I rinse my joulies between drinks and wash them every week or so.<br /><br />I love this product and would gladly buy it again. The price is a bit high, but they really will last you a long time with good care. They make great gifts and are really a conversation starter.
