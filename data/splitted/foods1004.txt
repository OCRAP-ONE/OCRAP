review/summary: Tasty tea, lacking packaging
review/text: You know your matcha is probably going to taste good when you open up the package and see that the powder is a bright, vibrant green.  However, I really wish the tea powder came *inside* a foil pouch in the tin.  This matcha is just tossed into a tin without any special sealed packet.  Luckily I had an old bag from another tin I just finished.<br /><br />I feel that it would help the powder's color remain vibrant and its quality remain better if it had come packaged in something inside the tin.  Perhaps that is why this product is relatively inexpensive considering it's ceremonial grade.<br /><br />If packaging doesn't bother you, give it a go!  It's very tasty and affordable for ceremonial matcha; however, I don't know how long it will stay fresh in its tin.

review/summary: Not quite what I expected
review/text: This is the first time I've bought Matcha; I've had it in the green tea lattes at Starbucks. This one doesn't dissolve in hot liquid like I expected--most of it sits at the bottom. The seller tells me it isn't supposed to dissolve that way. I tried using a whisk, though a metal, not a bamboo one. Maybe that would have made a difference.

review/summary: Never Again.
review/text: The shipping weight of this product is listed as 4 ounces, but it's not even close to that.  I thought my $24 was buying me 4 ounces of tea, when in reality my $24 was only buying me a little over an ounce of tea.  It's my fault for not knowing at the time that 30 grams is equal to only 1.1 ounces.  But, I think it's misleading of the seller to over-inflate the shipping weight, and then list it in ounces, to suggest you're getting more tea than you really are.  I was also taken in buy all the comments stating that this tea is a "great value."  It's not at all a great value.  It's $24 for a little over an ounce of tea.  DoMatcha 2nd Harvest Organic at Whole Foods is a much better deal at $40 for nearly 3 ounces (it's not "ceremonial" but it blends perfectly and tastes better than this brand.)

review/text: Who has time to worry about world domination when there are Happy Hippos to devour?  Even the most hardened dictator among us cannot withstand the delicate chocolate flakes that surround the light crisp of the sugar wafer.  The smooth chocolate filling is like a mind eraser; gone are thoughts of insurgency planning, citizen mind control, and world domination.  Yesterday was the day to punish your enemies, today is the day to eat more Happy Hippos.

review/summary: Soo Tasty and Cute
review/text: I just tried my first happy hippo a few days ago, and now I don't know how I have gone this long without it.  The name and shape got me to buy one.  I bought some of the cocoa ones at the Kris Kindle Mart in Chicago.  The outside is a perfect wafer crunch.  The inside has a smooth chocolate filling, but it is not completely filled. It has just enough to balance the crunch.  The shape, besides being a hippo, makes it a three bite goodie.  The wafer doesn't crumble when you bite into it, and the filling isn't oozing out.  The perfect candy.

review/summary: Hippos Filled with Chocolate, YUM!
review/text: I first ran across these at a local health food store.  The thought of hippos filled with chocolaty goodness seemed wonderful to me.  They are incredibly tasty - a real treat!  I had difficulty describing them to my friends, they just couldn't believe in the chocolate filled hippos until I bought these from Amazon.com and shared.  I have now started a cultish following for Kinder Happy Hippos in my community - why not start one in yours?<br />Note:  The filling is milk chocolate with some hazelnut flavoring, just in case you need to keep away from the nuts!  Happy Hippo-ing!

review/summary: I want more Cacao taste... not vegetable oil based Nutella
review/text: I bought the Case of 50 pieces. Mostly to give away as gifts since they are so cute. After eating a whole pack of 5 little Hippos, I'm just left unsatisfied. The "chocolate" inside the Hippos is very much like the Nutella paste that has as its main ingredients Sugar and Vegetable Oil, mostly Palm Oil... yuck. I keep hoping that my taste buds will be more grateful to me for feeding them these little treats, but they're expecting more chocolatey... and these Hippos do not deliver that. I definitely prefer the Kinder Buenos compared to these because of the chocolate coating, and those have a yummy crunch as well.

This is not the hottest mustard I have ever had but it is delicious and it adds a zing to your meal.  Don't let my title scare you it is really only slightly above a medium hot spiciness to me.<br /><br />Every time we eat Chinese food at home we get out a bottle of this to add zest to the meal just like in the restaurant. I have attached a photo of the nutrition facts for your information.<br /><br />This is a very tasty addition to your meal and I even add some into my stirfry.  I like it and so does my wife.  If you like spicy Chinese food you will like it also.

review/text: My 3 cats were eating Science Diet (any variety) and they all were puking up within minutes of eating.  So, I called my vet concerned that my cats were being poisoned.  The vet suggested that I switch them to a natural food.  The common denominator in the Science Diet food was GLUTEN.  This food does not have gluten and my cats run to the bowl when it's feeding time.  For the past six months my cats have not gotten sick on this food.  Provide lots of water at all times.  Their fur coats are shiny, they look healthier and have lots of spunk like kittens.  My cats are 2,4 and 5 years old.  I would recommend this food to any cat young or old.  Another plus, the litter box does not have that powerful urine smell.

The cats have sensitive stomachs but do really well on this food. No problems when they are on this. I feed wet food but some dry when I am at work and this food is so so great for my cats.

review/summary: Thank God Amazon Sells this Now
review/text: Been buying this food for 4 years via Amazon; originally it was sold by Pet Food Direct, which took damn near 10 days to ship it out for the first two years, then suddenly upgraded it's shipping processing and started getting the food much faster.<br /><br />As soon as Pet Food Direct cleaned up it's act, Pets Co stepped in as the seller, jacked the price up 35 or 40% (higher price, no free shipping, higher shipping costs, etc.) and I got mad.<br /><br />No sooner had Pets Co screwed up everything than Amazon stepped in, dropped the price back down to what it was, offered free shipping and now ships it out in like 2 days and I'm one happy camper!<br /><br />I reviewed the food years ago; the cats are still on it so that tells you we are still enjoying it. After the Chinese-protein-scare with Evo we never went back and stayed on this; the two foods are really comparable; they even smell a lot a like. So if you are in the market for a low-carb, ultra high protein "natural" cat food, this is the stuff to get.<br /><br />You still need to portion control if you have lazier cats that like to eat; our male managed to put a couple pounds back on even though we've been on an automatic feeder for years because he eats more than our female does when it's feeding time.<br /><br />That being said their energy levels have been excellent (even though they are older now, pushing 8 years), coats are lustrous, bowel movements are regular and solid, no GI-issues to speak of, no strange gas or any other unnatural side effects caused by crap food.<br /><br />This food gets a strong recommendation from us for any feline.

review/text: My cats had a bad bag of another brand food, and refused to eat anything that tasted even remotely similar to that. One of them went from 13 to 8 pounds as we tried different things. This definitely did the trick. Described, it is the closest thing to wet cat food protein content in a dry food. It also smells, not like wet cat food, but definitely has a raw fishy smell to it, not exactly pleasant. However, they love it, and we haven't had a problem since. Be careful with portions, though, as this is without a doubt a food that your cats could get fat on.

review/text: I had been buying "whatever's cheap" at the grocery store for years out of necessity. This food is definitely not cheap, but after a ton of research I figured this to be second to a raw diet due to its high-protein. My three cats weren't thrilled to begin with, and I wasn't either (smells like fish food!) By the end of the first bag they were eating it just fine. Since then I've noticed they eat a lot less than they did of the stuff I bought at the grocery store - they would tear through that like junk food and their bellies showed it. Their coats are more shiny too. The only strange thing is the shape of the food; tiny, round balls. I can't speak for my cats, but I would think that they would prefer it to be like other brands, with more of a flattish surface for chewing.

review/summary: Help for Heavy Cats
review/text: When we lost our 15- and 19-year-old cats we adopted two new kittens and wanted to do right by them. Had been feeding the older boys Prescription Diet per our vet to manage diabetes and hyperthyroid/kidney failure. After one new kitten started putting on the pounds (on Science Diet Light), our (otherwise fab) vet told us Voodoo would have to go on weight loss Prescription Diet soon, which the vet described as "like cat popcorn." That didn't sound too good, so we started researching and found Core. Gave it a shot. Our younger kitten immediately started losing weight (slowly), Voodoo stopped gaining, both boys have more energy and glossier coats and they're maintaining a reasonable weight ... it's a wonderful thing, especially if you've had older cats with health issues. Highly recommend this product.<br /><br />The adjustment isn't too smooth (and it smells awful, especially the wet) but now the boys won't eat anything else. (Even seared ahi tuna left on the counter, which is nuts!) Just mix whatever kibble you're feeding them with the Core dry for a while and they'll be hooked. The wet we presented as a "special treat" and let them share a half can every night. Worth the effort and expense!

From the first day they took to it without a problem. No mixing with their old cat food was needed. They were both a little underweight at first but in a months time I have noticed a huge difference. Their fur is sooo much softer now and they are at the perfect size. They have been using the litter box regularly and in a months time neither of them have had an upset stomach.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great reviews from people who know about cat diets. My cats like it. Soft coats.<br /><br />Cons:<br />High price.

review/summary: Cat's won't touch the stuff.
review/text: I have 3 indoor cats and I also feed a stray. None of the 4 cats will touch the food. The food smells like multi-vitamins. It has to taste awful... For such expensive food, I expected better quality. My cats will eat cheap cat food no problem, but I feel like a bad mommy feeding them a junk food diet. Others have mentioned that EVO works for them, I guess I will try that. I have also tried ACANA and ORIJEN with no success. I like what those companies are doing. it is unfortunate my cats won't eat the food.

review/summary: Never Again
review/text: I bought this food hoping to add a little variety to my cat's diet.  He's been on Felidae and Evo since I took him home.  I hoped this would be a good alternative high protein brand.  I won't be coming back.  When I opened the bag I was surprised to find that while there were some full pieces of food, most of the kibble had fallen apart into a fine dust. After a few weeks of eating this half powder/half round kibble bits diet my cat began to develop acne on his chin from having to rub his little chin in the dusty bits of food.  He hated the food so much he would go pry open the door of the closet where his other foods were kept and rummage through the other bags of food.  He also appeared to have some kind of an allergic reaction to the food which manifested in vigorous licking of his front paws until they were raw.  Poor guy. I understand every cat is different, but I was extremely disappointed by this crumby (pun intended) food.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: I have an older cat and she has never been fussy about foods at all.  She will eat almost anything.  That said she wouldn't eat this at all.  Even when mixed with her old food gradually, she left it on the floor or in her dish. I have fed her other grain free foods and had good luck with them.  But she definitely didn't want anything to do with this one.  Now I wouldn't downgrade this much just because my cat didn't like it.  I down graded it because this is one of the worst smelling cat foods ever.  It is so strong smelling my kitchen, where her dish is, reeked.<br />Sorry I tried this and wasted my money.

review/summary: The best dry cat food. Period.
review/text: I have yet to find a superior dry cat food. I prefer to feed my cat a raw diet, but sometimes it isn't possible. An apartment doesn't have a place for an extra freezer so unfortunately a raw diet isn't feasible. This food is the closest to a raw diet you can get in a dry kibble. NO GRAIN and all meat proteins, exactly how cats want it. And like other reviewers commented, cats LOVE it. My cat always runs hopefully to his CORE storage bin when I start to open it and cries and begs until it is on his dish. My cat's coat is glossy, thick, healthy and barely sheds. His eyes are clear and bright. He has tons of energy and every year his vet is impressed with how healthy he is. No digestive problems, and no kidney problems that are so common in cats fed grain cat food.<br />I strongly recommend this cat food!

review/summary: the best cat food out there
review/text: After a terrible accident killed one of my two cats, I got very concerned about her surviving sister's well-being.  Call it obsessive, but I started reading books on cat first aid and cat health and nutrition, and one day I was filling her food bowl and I happened to glance at the ingredients in her dry cat food.  It was then that I realized that the dry food I was feeding her was JUNK!  No nutritive value at all!  (She was eating Meow Mix, because she seemed to like it, but not anymore.)<br /><br />Cats don't need cornmeal or veggies or soy or "natural flavoring" (by the way, I found out that most pet products are "naturally flavored" with manure...that's right, MANURE).  Cats don't need fish flavored cereal.  They need high quality protein, plain and simple.  And this is probably the best stuff I've ever found.  No grains, no by-products, all natural, and my cat loves the stuff.<br /><br />Before I started her on this food, she was sedentary and overweight, and she was throwing up a lot.  I always thought it was hair balls, but really I think it was her diet.  Since I switched her to this diet, she seems to have a lot more energy, she runs around and plays a lot more, she's lost weight, her coat has gotten shinier and silkier, her eyes have cleared up, and she never throws up anymore.<br /><br />It's a lot more expensive than other kinds of dry cat food, but really, you wouldn't feed your kids junk food with no nutritive value just because it's cheaper, so why would you feed junk to your pets?  I honestly think it's worth the price.  It's a great product, and I think I'll be feeding it to my cats for many years to come.

review/summary: Not for my household
review/text: After doing a great deal of research on feline nutrition and the benefits of a grain-free diet, I decided to switch my three cats from their organic low-grain food to Wellness CORE. I'm not sure if it's the size or the smell or the taste or what, but despite doing the slooow transition method between foods none of my cats seem to like CORE very much. They also have a kind of hard time eating it because the pellets are so small and round that they just roll away from their mouths (this could be a good thing for cats that are prone to eating too fast, but that's not the case with my cats).<br /><br />The bigger issue though was that within two weeks of being switched to this food, my male cat developed urinary crystals and a partial blockage and had to be hospitalized. I don't know how much the food contributed to that, but the vet did mention that she has seen several cats develop crystals while on Wellness. In any case, all of my cats are being switched off of this food.

review/text: I have 3 cats, 1 is almost a year old and the other two are 8 months. I recently did a lot of research as to the best diet for my kitties and came up with this brand.<br /><br />My cats love this stuff.<br /><br />I feed my cats 2x a day. They get wellness wet food once and CORE once. I know that there is nutritional value to each of these options and that there are dangers to completely excluding either wet or dry food from a cat's diet. I also mix in 1/2 teaspoon of missing link vitamins into their wet food to make up for what they can't get without eating in the wild. Between these three things I have healthy, happy kittens. :)

review/summary: Cats can't get enough!
review/text: As soon as I brought the bag inside, my cats were swarming all over it like flies, meowing and sniffing and scratching trying to get it open, something they've never done with other dry foods! I barely got it into the kitchen cabinet without the cats. Needless to say, they HEARTILY APPROVE of the flavor and size of the kibble and scarf this stuff down. Cats are happy, I'm happy! I can also feel good about feeding them one of the few very high protein dry cat foods on the market with premium, wholesome ingredients. As soon as I switched them to CORE, their coats got much softer and silkier and their eyes cleared up, and I know it's not my imagination. They have had ZERO vomiting or stool problems as well. My cats are on their second bag of CORE and will be happily eating CORE for the forseeable future.<br /><br />Cons: The bag's plastic seal is hard to re-seal, it's expensive, and it has a strong fishy odor which my cats love and I don't mind, but it may bother some humans.

review/summary: I love Wellness CORE, well worth the money!!
review/text: I had been feeding my Persian Purina One which he had been doing fine with. We then adopted a Himalayan mix who was constantly throwing up, whether she wolfed down her food or not. She was on original Science Diet. After doing a ton of research I decided that the natural ingredients in Wellness sounded like the way to go for BOTH my kitties. I had considered Science Diet for sensitive stomachs, but the ingredients in Wellness are much more appropriate for a feline's digestive system, so I decided to try it. I slowly mixed their food with Wellness over a week period, and for over a month now they haven been solely on Wellness. I am happy to report my kitty has thrown up only once!! I am so happy.  They both really enjoy it. I also feel better that they are eating food that is so much healthier for them. Highly recommended!!"

review/summary: Core Wellness food is not what it used to be

A note was in our last bag of food confirming this, and with the most recent bag, the food has a whiter appearance and our cats actively refuse to touch it. This leaves us in a bind because we have a cat that requires grain-free food. I will not be going back to this product ever again.

review/summary: my cat goes crazy for this food--- might want to talk your vet to be sure it's right for your cat
review/text: My 5 year old cat adores the food. She scarfed down as much as I put in her bowl, so I had to be careful not to overfeed. She definitely liked this much than the other Wellness brand options.<br /><br />Since this is a very unique, extremely high protein food, you might want to talk to your vet about contraindications (kidney problems, old age?) before making the switch.<br /><br />You might also want to check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X96YIK">Spa Select Indoor Cat Food, 7 lbs.</a>., the only other food my cat goes bananas for. It's a holistic food with human quality ingredients-- another great choice. We've settled on it because I haven't made up my mind about the ultra high protein approach of CORE.

review/summary: Made my girl healthy again
review/text: My 8 year old cat was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. She was having blood and mucus in her stools.<br />The vet prescribed a couple of different high fiber diets, neither of which worked. He also tried giving her steroids.<br />The steroids worked while she took them, but once off them her symptoms returned. He wanted to do more testing.<br />I spent $500 on an ultrasound, which was inconclusive. Next, he wanted me to do a $4000+ procedure (colonoscopy)<br />which would give a complete picture of the state of her disease. The next course of meds would be a combination<br />of chemo and steroids.<br />Meanwhile, after also mentioning this all to the breeder that I got my cat from, she told me to try the Core diet.<br />I had helped all her cats that had similar symptoms. She was pretty sure that all my problems were being caused<br />by grain allergies. So, I made the switch, using both the Core canned and the Core dry kibble. In addition, I<br />add probiotics and food enzyme powders to the wet food, daily. My cat is now almost completely symptom free.<br />Occasionally, I see a little mucus and maybe a smear of blood in the stool. My occasionally, I mean maybe<br />once in 8 weeks or so, where as before, it was every day.<br />I am sure the probiotics and the enzymes help, plus the holistic vet did some acupuncture, but I am thinking<br />also, the Core diet was the most beneficial treatment of all.

review/summary: Great food for cats.
review/text: We have six cats --- a few of whom have bladder, skin/allergy and weight issues.  I started doing research on cat foods and landed on a DVM's blog/website that promoted the feeding of grain free and raw food diets for cats.  After a lot of reading, I started feeding our cats the Wellness grain free canned food and then supplemented with the CORE dry (otherwise I'm opening a lot of cans a day!).  My pickiest eater turned her nose up for a few days without something tempting on top of it, however after about a week she now eats it up --- which is huge as I've been making her food for several years and she has a very sensitive stomach.  My two older cats have gained weight and all of them have better looking coats.<br />Another benefit of feeding raw/grain free is that the solid waste does not smell as bad and is smaller in volume.  This food has also helped relieve the symptoms of cystitis in one of my cats.<br />Expensive, but worth it.

review/summary: Tried this based on recommendations. Very please!
review/text: I am a regular ole cat owner. I was feeding my cat Meow Mix or Purina Indoor. I am not an owner that buys nice food or likes to spend a lot of money on food, but I do love my cat. I noticed that he has a problem with vomiting and saw a post on a message board about this food. The grain free formula made sense to me and I knew I could afford it. I got a 5 lb. bag at Petco for about $20 which is a lot more than my regular Meow Mix. I've only had this food for 3 or 4 days, but I noticed that my cat is not hungry and whining at feeding time. In fact, there is often food left in his bowl when formerly there was none. I attribute this to the fact that he is getting filled up my real food and not grain. Again, I am not an expert. I think this food is great! I would definitely buy it again.

review/summary: Good Product, not so good results,
review/text: The ingredients list is good, the product seems to be made with quality in mind but there are 3 issues with this food.<br /><br />1. The kibble tends to disintegrate quite rapidly, so i have lot of kibble mixed in with lots of dust.<br />2. The food gets stale relatively quickly, its fine in an airtight container, but if you leave it out for over two days, my cat won't eat it because it has gotten too stale, so i have to toss whatever is left in the bowl into the trash (well compost).<br />3. The 50% protein is probably good for some cats but my cats pee went from very little odor, to supper ammonia smell. I think that there is just too much protein for her, and its a little rough on her kidneys.<br /><br />For reference my cat is 2, and has a very good weight which she manages herself.<br /><br />I am going to try the blue buffalo again (i switch because its a little hard to find sometimes) hopefully that will clear it up.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Its been a while, but i tried to switch back to blue buffalo and i got a cat that started and would not stop vomiting at least once a day.  So i switched back to this product, Which i must admit she has gotten quite used to, has maintained a good weight.  However there is still a fair bit of powered, that being said the food lasts a long time for a large bag and the cans doing well.  So whats 50$ once every 3 months for your loved furry friend?<br /><br />not to bad I would say.  THere are other good options out there i am sure, but this one fits the bill for me.

review/summary: Feed your cats the best!
review/text: Having learned much about cat nutrition from my previous job, when I was finally able to own cats - there was no question about what I would feed them. Cats are designed to be carnivores - unlike dogs which are omnivores. Cats do not need (nor should they be fed) grains. Not only does this food contain no grains, it also contains no by-products, and is full of great de-boned meats, fish, and natural flavor. It also contains micro-organisms to aid in digestion. Many cat foods now claim to have pre and or pro-biotics, but they are baked in with the kibble (essentially killing the organisms), Wellness sprays it on after the baking process meaning your cat gets the benefits! Both of my cats love this food, and are always very excited when it's meal time.<br /><br />As a side note: I also like that this comes packaged in a re-sealable (zip-lock) bag for maintaining freshness.

review/summary: Cats hate it, increased barfing episodes, bad smell
review/text: First, I applaud Wellness for coming up with a grain free formula because I think cats are probably better off not eating any grains.  Also I give credit that they left out the menadione.  Unfortunately though, Core kibble proved to be a bomb in my household.  My cats HATE IT with a purple passion.  Also there has been a dramatic increase in barfing episodes ever since I introduced it (and yes I did introduce it gradually).  I could have put up with the very strong and unpleasant odor it fills my house with if the cats had loved it but given the negatives I am going back to my old kibble - Pet Promise.  Mendadione and all.

review/summary: Not what it used to be.
review/text: I got my 2 kittens about a year ago (June 08) and started them on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFEMHK">Innova EVO Cat and Kitten Dry Cat Food (15.4-lb bag)</a>. They both enjoyed EVO and the ingredients are very similar to what is in CORE. But I decided to give Wellness Core a try now that they are older because EVO has a higher fat content and more calories and I didn't think they would need as much fat content now that they are about a year old.<br /><br />They seemed to like the taste of CORE just as much (maybe even a little more), but I will say that CORE has a much stronger, fishier smell than EVO. Also, a 12lb. bag of CORE is about the same price as a 15.4lb. bag of EVO, so CORE winds up being more expensive. Though it is more convenient to just go to PetCo to buy the CORE than it is to go to the specialty feed store to buy EVO.<br /><br />Bottom line: both are excellent dry cat foods, and I will probably wind up rotating between them. Since they are outdoor cats, I plan on feeding them EVO as the weather gets colder so they can build up a layer of fat for the winter, and Core when it's warmer and they don't need as much insulation.<br /><br />UPDATE (10/21/2012): One of our cats started having urinary tract problems. After doing some research online, I found a number of people using this cat food that have complained about urinary problems caused by this food. We have since switched to a different brand (Orijen) and the urinary crystals have gone away.

review/summary: Wellness Core dry food not that much more in the end.  The moist food is a lot more expensive.
review/text: My cat was eating Purina Cat Chow and 1/2 a 5.5-oz can of Friskies per day at the shelter.  I switched him to Wellness Core dry food with ~3 oz of wellness moist food per day (one 12.5-oz can served over four days - stored in the fridge, in the can, and a serving warmed up for 10 sec in microwave).  In the end, the dry food only costs about 25% more than the Purina Cat Chow, considering how much less the cat actually eats.  The moist food is about twice the expense, if you compare the large 12.5-oz cans of Wellness to the 5.5 oz cans of Friskies.<br /><br />If you're giving just a dry diet, the switch to Wellness Core is definitely worth the additional 25% in costs.  The moist food is about $0.54 per day and the Friskies was about $0.23 per day, so that can add up.<br /><br />My cat made the switch easily... not a finicky eater.

After trying several other brands over several months with little improvement, I tried Wellness Core brand in Jan 2007 due to the natural ingredients that seemed to be more like what a cat would naturally eat. Both of my cats loved it and the smaller one stopped having stomach problems all together. I noticed that after they had been on the diet a while that their coats got very shiny. They've now been eating this food for over two years and are both active and healthy, with shiny coats and friendly dispositions.

review/summary: Food caused big problems
review/text: When I first started my 3 cats on Wellness Core, I thought it was fabulous. Suddenly their fur was shiny and bright! They liked it, too! But then reality set in... A couple of bags later, all of my cats were losing their fur in massively scary amounts. I'm not talking basic shedding, either. Their fur was falling out..everywhere. This food was causing excessive hair loss all over their bodies..on ALL my cats!!! I was really worried, because it was bad. The rep at Petco told me when I informed her of this problem that other customers had noticed the same problem in their cats. I've read other reviews, as well, where people complained about a "hairball problem" with this food. This was no ordinary "hairball" problem, let me tell you. In addition, this food is absolutely NOT for cats with weight gain tendencies. I reduced my 15 lb male cat's daily intake to WELL UNDER 1/2c of this stuff plus a TBS of canned daily, and he STILL gained weight on it! My opinion is there is some vital problem with this food that would cause such hairloss. Either there is an ingredient in it that should NOT be there, or there is something missing that SHOULD be there.<br />The Wellness regular dry w/ grains caused flakes in my cats, as well. The Wellness canned is the only thing I highly recommend from Wellness.

review/summary: Best I could find for quality protein and grain free.
review/text: We had a 16 yr old tortie that developed an extreme vomiting problem.  I began to research and found that this can be caused by allergies to corn and various other grain products.  During my research I was also surprised to learn that cats really do eat a 100% meat diet.  Unlike other carnivores, such as bears, who eat berries and other such plant life, it is relatively unnecessary for cats.  After several trips to the vet we also discovered our old kitty had feline diabetes.  I researched this as well and found that diabetes does not occur naturally in cats and is primarily caused by the high grain content (read: carbs) in regular cat food.  Before we discovered the diabetes I had been searching for a cat food that had as little grain (primarily corn products) in it as possible and tried several brands over the course of probably a year.  Once we discovered the feline diabetes I found Wellness Core.  It was grain free and used only high quality protein sources in the first 5 ingredients (note: if your first ingredient is a corn product, pass on that food).  The Core immediately remedied the vomiting problem.  Unfortunately, we found out too late about her diabetes which had caused other health complications and she passed away from those complications.  A few months later we brought home two new kittens and started them on Wellness Core immediately.<br /><br />Once I discovered all the adverse effects that can be caused by standard cat food that was enough for me.  I learned too late with our Aiki, and I wasn't about to feed our new kittens anything but the best.  Now they're about 1 1/2 years old.  They love Core, their coats are shiny and healthy, are energetic, and have healthy weights (recent vet visit, 9 and 10 lbs respectively).  To me the added cost is worth it.  It will save in added vet bills in the future.  I wanted to start our kittens off with the best chance at a happy healthy life.  I still have the guilt of not knowing about feline diabetes and how easy it is to treat if caught early enough and given the right diet.  I would never switch to any other food.<br /><br />In response to some readers concerns about urinary crystals, this happens when you feed cats 100% dry cat food and happens most frequently in males.  You have to occasionally give your cats wet cat food to prevent these crystals.  I suspect if they developed the crystals within a week or so of starting on Core that they had a preexisting condition they may have been exacerbated by the change in diet.  I recommend this food to anyone wanting a high quality grain free cat food.

review/summary: great product!
review/text: My cat loves her food and telling from the ingredients, it also seems to be a very high quality food. I debated between this brand and Innova Evo but ultimately decided on this one as it had some fish in it and my cat absolutely loves fish so I figured she would like it. I don't like the fact that it has potatoes in it but the over all carb count is still relatively low.  I would prefer if my cat ate only wet food but I have tried countless times to get her to eat canned food and have not had any luck until recently (except with fish which she LOVES but I try to give her only rarely). One point to remember with this food is that it is much higher in calories than the crap-filled stuff so it's not wise to free feed with this food. I've always free fed my cat yet she gained some weight on this food her first few weeks. Now I'm giving her measured portions so that she doesn't eat too much. I feed her half dry and half Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken canned which is supposed to be very good for prevention of UTI's and struvite crystals.

review/text: t's expensive, that's for sure -- but well worth it. My feral cats have many health problems, so it's important they eat well. This brand (Core Wellness) is incredibly healthy. I've noticed a shinier coat on both my cats, and they love the taste. It's definitely worth it, especially if your cats are older or have health problems.

review/text: I bought this food after reading extensive online reviews about it's nutritional value. It has everything cats need and none of the stuff they don't. We have 4 cats and they all love the food. The only thing they like better is the Core canned food which we supplement the dry with. Amazon is quick as usual to send it out which is great since I would have to drive for a couple of hours to get it elsewhere. Cats give it two paws!!

review/summary: Best Dry Cat Food, Grain Free--Expensive But Worth It
review/text: My cats really love this food.  Both are indoor condo-dwellers.  The older cat (10 yrs) got really dehydrated on lower quality at foods w/meat or chicken "byproducts" and corn.  Wellness Core is expensive, but super-high quality.  No grain or byproducts.  I introduced it slowly, mixing it little @ a time w/cheap stuff.  It apparently has a very different taste & some kitties have to get used to it.  Once they got used to it, they loved it.  Using this & a Drinkwell fountain (they like much more than water standing in bowl), my babies are both healthy w/wonderful-looking coats.

review/summary: Do Not Purchase This Cat Food
review/text: After eating wellness core, my cat has developed urinary crystals. Now I see that many pet owners have had the same problem. I am so upset that I did this to my cat. I chose it for the no grain/high protein formulation and instead of great nutrition I have fed him something that has caused pain and suffering.  This seems to be a well known issue from the numerous complaints I have now found. It should be removed from production until the formulation is corrected.

review/summary: 2.5 pound older cat doubled weight in 2 days!
review/text: My Siamese cat Angel is 12 years old. She had weighed 2.5 pounds for about 3 months.  The vet's diagnosis was mostly "Old age."  He gave her a bottle of iron and okayed some liver aid tablets I had bought on the net when I saw that her poo had turned yellow, or sometimes beige.  But these things did not help her, nor did it help her to be given raw hamburger (per Dr. Mercola's vet - & frozen 3 days to kill parasites first), tuna & sardines & a bit of grain free (best I could find) canned cat food.  She kept eating all the time but never gained weight.  She looked like an animated cat costume out of the bag.<br /><br />As a last ditch effort I went to a prayer forum and a lady there who used to work for a vet told me about Wellness Core.<br /><br />Angel, & Jet - a younger cat - loved it immediately!  It has been about 2 weeks and Angel now weighs 6 pounds.  I quit giving her anything else but this food - even stopped the iron & liver aid tablets.  Her poo turned dark over night.  Even' Jet's darkened.  I can't tell which is whose.  The only problem is that Jet is starting to look like a puff ball - Lol - since I keep the food down all the time for Angel so that she can continue to gain weight.

review/summary: Wellness Core makes a happy kitty.
review/text: I have two cats in my home, a young male and an older male.  The older male is 14 years old and was born with feline leukemia and has had urinary tract problems that led to surgery.  I've been on a search to find the best cat food I can for him, and I have finally found it with Wellness Core.<br /><br />I used to feed Science Diet to him and separate the younger cat for his food because it was so expensive.  My kitty had greasy looking fur, slept all the time, never played, and was getting extremely thin and bony.  My vet is the one who recommend the science diet, but it just didn't seem to help.<br /><br />After just a week on the Wellness Core, I noticed a change in my cat.  His fur was getting softer and not as greasy looking, and I noticed he was spending more time with me as apposed to just sleeping on my bed all day and all night.  After two weeks had gone by, I caught him playing.  He has not played in years, so I was very excited about this.  I've had him and my younger cat on this food for several months now, and I am going to start incorporating more wet Wellness Core into their diet.  I can't believe the change that has happened in my cat.  He acts like he did 10 years ago, just from changing to this cat food.  He has gained weight and is no longer bony looking, has super soft fur, and no longer sleeps all the time.  He looks healthy, he acts healthy, and he doesn't throw up as much anymore.  He used to vomit at least once a day, sometimes as much as 5 or 6 times (my vet told me this was from his age and the feline leukemia, the Science Diet cat food was supposed to help with this, but it didn't).  Now he vomits on average once every two weeks which is a huge improvement and something I didn't think possible.<br /><br />My older cat isn't the only one who has improved because of this food.  My younger male has seen a noticeable improvement to his coat and level of energy as well and I thought he was very healthy before.  This food isn't cheap, but it isn't as expensive as the Science Diet is in my local Petco.  Ordering the 12lb bag from Amazon is very convenient, but I really do wish this was a "Subscribe and Save" item, seeing that I buy a bag every month.<br /><br />I recommend this cat food to everyone I know who has cats in their lives, and I will continue to do so.  Both my boys love this food, and I love how much happier and healthier they are now.

review/summary: Saved my Cat
review/text: My 15 year old cat had been to the vet repeatedly for chronic vomiting. She would vomit within minutes of eating, although she appeared to feel fine. The vet ran all kinds of tests and couldn't find anything wrong with her. He did these tests on two different visits and couldn't find anything wrong either visit. He prescribed Purina EN cat food for cats with gastro problems. Needless to say, I was getting worried because my carpets were being ruined,the vet visits were getting expensive and kitty obviously had a problem.<br /><br /> I did some internet research and came up with Wellness Core Grain Free.  I went to the store and bought a small bag and started her on it that day. Figured I had to try something and had nothing to lose.<br /><br /> She has not vomited once since then and LOVES the food. She can't seem to get enough.  I also supplement with the canned grain-free version and she loves it too. I don't know if it's my imagination, but she seems to have more energy and her fur is so soft and not nearly as dry and coarse as it was before.<br /><br />I have a lot of confidence in my vet but wonder why he didn't suggest that maybe the cat had some sort of food/grain allergy.<br /><br />My cat has only been on this product for a short time but I feel sure that switching her to Wellness Core was the right move!

review/summary: A great buy! My cat absolutely loves this!
review/text: Cats are naturally picky eaters from what I've read. Although I haven't had my cat for long at the time of purchase(two weeks), I was afraid of going and making this purchase because if he doesn't eat it, it would be a waste of $35. He's already turned his nose away from what his previous owner left with me. And I'd switched several brands already. And they were wet foods too.<br /><br />Thankfully, my fears never came true. It turns out, he loves Wellness CORE. Recently, he got UTI and was placed on medication. I was told to keep him on a wet diet for now until his UTI went away. I placed the liquid medication in his wet food and mixed it very well because I wasn't about to scruff him to force feed him medicine. But he took two bites of the wet food and turned his nose at it. With some hesitance, I mixed in some Wellness Core. He ate the entire thing.<br /><br />Three months later, he's still loving it. He's not turning away from this brand. Thank goodness.

review/summary: Caused Both My Cats to Have Diarrhea
review/text: I have a 15 year old neutered male domestic short hair and a 15 year old spayed female domestic short hair, who are both overall very healthy and happy. I was excited to put my cats on this food after doing extensive research because it was high in protein, grain-free and had several great reviews. I had them on Innova Senior, but it was a little dry and they didn't really "love" the food. However, since starting to feed Wellness CORE a few days ago, my kitties have both had diarrhea every time they use the litterbox. I've owned both cats their entire lives, and they've never had diarrhea before and it's the only thing that's changed in their diet (they also get Wellness wet food at night). Although I already have them on a relatively high protein, low carb diet, I think the even higher level of protein and fat in this food might be too much for their digestive tracts to handle. I have stopped feeding this food and expect the condition to clear up soon.

review/summary: Worth trying if your cat has problems with their current food.
review/text: I've been feeding my cat this food for about 7 months without any problems.<br />I mainly tried it because she was throwing up a lot with her previous Purina cat food.<br /><br />First the pros about this cat food:<br /><br />1. Its grain free, so cats that have sensitive stomachs (which was apparently my cat) can eat it without any problems.<br /><br />2. Since it contains less filler my cat tends to eat less, so I use less cat food overall.  I saw other reviewers complain about cost, but since she eats less I buy less so it seemed to even out.  Also, since she eats less she poops less, which I felt was the second best thing about this food (outside of not throwing up).<br /><br />3.  There's no added chemicals or preservatives in the food, so if your concerned with that its a plus.  Personally, I find that's a non-issue with me.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />1. Apparently this food can cause urinary crystals (a more serious problems in male then female cats), so you may want to monitor your cat at first if you change to this food. My cat didn't have this problem, but my cat is female so it is less of an issue.<br /><br />2. Like other reviewers, I found this food has a relatively strong smell when fresh.  The smell goes away as the food dries out.  In my case, my cat won't eat it when it dries out (she must enjoy the smell).  So I keep mine in an airtight food bin and only scoop out enough when she wants some.<br /><br />3. If your cat is like mine, you won't be able to use an auto-feeder with this cat food as it dries out when open to the air.  When I used an auto feeder, my cat refused to eat the food that no longer gave off the smell at the bottom of the feeder (took me a couple feedings to figure this out).  This is kind of annoying, but its better than cleaning up throw up.<br /><br />Overall, I think if your current food is causing problems than this food provides a good alternative to the major brand name foods.

review/text: It must be said that most of the cat food you find on store shelves tend to be filled with unhealthy cheap filler to save on production costs.<br /><br />After doing research on cat food, based on quality and price, I decided to go with the Wellness CORE brand 6 months ago and I've been very happy with the results.<br /><br />My cat loves the food, the bag lasts for about 3 months so it's not too expensive, and my cat has remained at a healthy weight and has a nice lush coat.<br /><br />Some would argue that it's too costly but keep in mind that if you use cheap food for your cat chances are you're probably going to end up at the Vet a lot more often which can be pretty pricey...<br /><br />Highly recommended for cats and cat owners.

My cats have never been picky eaters, but none of them were particularly thrilled with this food. They used to run to mealtimes but that basically ended with this food and it was like pulling teeth to get one of them to eat at all.

review/text: My cats love this dry food. I've been giving them Core from Wellness for two years now.  They're health and active. There were a few times I tried a couple different brands of dry cat food since Core is not exactly the cheapest cat food on the market but one of my cats would throw up once or twice a week. My vet told me that it could be food allergy...so I immediately switched back to Core and sure enough there hasn't been any incident. Currently I mix other premium cat food (1/3 other brand, 2/3 Core) to my cats and they seem to do ok.  I would have given 5 stars but the high price is the reason that I'm holding back.  I understand that premium products cost more but I feel like Wellness Company should offer some type of discount or coupon for loyal customers.

Along with some other natural remedies I found from generous people who shared what worked for them on a website, one cat is cured from throwing up every time she ate to not at all.  The other one had several bouts of URI.  When I switched from Science Diet to this food, it made a huge difference.  I tried other natural remedies adding organic apple cider to their water & rubbing a 50/50 vinegar/water solution on the nape of their neck that were suggested, but I credit their healthy state mostly to switching to Wellness Core, because I don't give them anymore vinegar.  It was a 2 month dedicated struggle.

review/summary: A very nutritious grain-free brand, but gave my cats diarrhea
review/text: When I adopted two kittens two months ago, I started them off with a combination of canned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKI82">Wellness Canned Cat Food, Kitten Recipe, 24-Pack of 3-Ounce Cans</a> and dry Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul.  Chicken Soup contains grain, and after doing a lot of research on the healthiest food choices, I decided to try a grain-free dry food.  I started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFEMHK">EVO Cat Food 15.4 lbs</a>.  The cats loved it, and I continued to mix it with Wellness canned.  After finishing the bag, I decided to try Wellness Core, since the Wellness brand is so highly regarded.  Although they loved it, they immediately had awful diarrhea.  I can't prove the connection, of course, but the timing, as well as the fact that both kittens were affected, leads me to believe it was the food.  Following instructions on various websites, I did not feed them for 24 hours (after four days of diarrhea), and then gave them a bland diet of rice and broiled chicken until their stomachs were settled.  I am now back to Evo.<br /><br />Although dry Wellness Core did not work for me, I have full faith in the quality of the brand, and I continue to feed canned Wellness.<br /><br />To hopefully save others the time on some research, I'll suggest a few other highly recommended, nutritious options you may want to consider:<br /><br />Grain-free dry:<br />1) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019QIXW6">Orijen Regional Poultry and Fish Grain-Free Dry Cat & Kitten Food, 5.5lb</a><br />2) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001709GF2">Merrick Before Grain #1 Chicken Dry Cat Food, 11.1 Pound Bag</a><br /><br />Grain-free canned:<br />1) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFS442">EVO Cat & Kitten Canned Cat Food</a><br />2) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P8JNG0">Merrick Before Grain #1 Chicken Pat&eacute; Style Cat Food, 5.5 Ounce Can (24 Count Case)</a>

review/summary: Response to other reviews
review/text: My cats have been on this food for the last 5 years after their previous food made them ill.  (If you remember the pet food recalls a few years ago, it was around the same time, but it was a cat food that wasn't recalled.)  I did research and I found this food at the time was perfect for cats.  So we gave it a try, and this is what I learned.<br /><br />1) My cats don't particularly care for the stuff, but they eat it anyways.  Why is this good?  Because it means they eat when they are hungry, not because it tastes good or they are bored.  They have lost/maintained their weight impressively over these 5 years.<br /><br />2) My cats' teeth are in great condition!  Their coats are silky and smooth!<br /><br />3) Less food in and higher quality ingredients means less waste out.  I have noticed a huge decrease in litterbox use, so we go through less litter.<br /><br />Some of the reviews talk about cats developing issues from eating this food.  It's not necessarily the food to blame (maybe the cat would have developed those issues anyways), and it's always best to work with your cat.  Maybe this isn't the right food for them.  That's always a possibility.  But it is the right food for my cats, and I suggest giving it a try.  I suggested that to a friend and she did.  Her cats hated the stuff, they wouldn't even consider eating it even after days of no other food options.  Obviously that means it's not going to work for them.

review/summary: Cats Devour it and Have More Energy
review/text: Our two boys were on Science Diet hairball light for many years. But once we switched them to Core, there was no going back--this even smells like real food. They have much more energy--my 11 year old is like a kitten, chasing, running, pouncing, tumbling. He's always up for a good romp being a manx, but this food took it up a notch. Nice small size helps in digestion too, and no real hairball problems. One downside may be that their waste is bit more, uh, pungent (likely because this isn't just corn and cardboard they're eating).

review/summary: Best cat food EVER!
review/text: I started buying this food last year for my 10 year old Bengal. I had been feeding him Science Diet his whole life, and to my knowledge I was doing the right thing because it was moderately priced and supposed to be good for him. Wrong. Science Diet is full of fillers, corn, and carbohydrates that was making him gain weight. Wellness Core is HALF protein, and since I have switched to this food, he has lost weight, energy level has went up, and feces has changed from these horrible huge stinky piles to little black pellets.  I also have a 1 year old Bengal kitten, and she loves it too! It is formulated for both adult cats and kittens.  I used to spend a fortune on cheaper foods that were not good for my babies, with Wellness I spend $38 and that bag will last me close to 2 months!  Awesome huh?! Go Wellness!

review/text: After doing a ton of research on pet food, I knew I wanted to feed my cat something that didn't have any fillers or bad ingredients, so I knew Wellness Core would be a good option. It's a little pricey, but I store it in an airtight container and it lasts for quite a while. Most importantly, my cat loves it, and she is super healthy. When my roommate and her cat moved in, he started eating Core as well, and his coat transformed! My cat has always been soft, so I didn't know for sure that it was because of the food, but after seeing the change in Sushi's coat, I know for sure that it is the food. His coat became so smooth and shiny within about a month of eating Core.

review/summary: Brussel sprouts for your cat
review/text: Apparently this cat food represents the culmination of exhaustive research into feline nutrition. That may be the case, but good luck getting your cat to eat it.<br /><br />Feeding this stuff to a finnicky cat is like trying to get a third grader to eat his broccoli. I have to coat it with friskies wet-food to even spark my Bengal's interest, and she still eats around the Core nuggets whenever possible. We haven't had this problem with other dried foods (Royal Canin, et al.) so I can only assume it's the specific taste or texture.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board.

review/summary: Cats dig it
review/text: My cats seem to love it. Maybe they are just little fat arses that eat anything, though. All I know is that my one cat used to have constipation issues before Wellness and Wilderness. He'd get a little random butthole bleeding (yuck) and discomfort of which he relieved by leaving lovely skidmarks across my carpet. So far this has been gone since the food switch off of garbage ProPlan. They also seem to have more energy, coats seem shinier as well. I would definitely recommend spending the extra money on either Wilderness or Core Wellness (grain free foods) for your little guys. I'm confident the money saved on crap junk foods like Purina, etc, will not make up for expensive vet visits further down the road. I'm not sure if they have indeed changed the formula, or exactly how it changed, but I switched to Wilderness anyway. My cats went right to it, I don't usually need to transition them.<br /><br />One issue I have had with this food is my cats still occasionally drop a vom-bomb on my floor. I don't think this is due to the food, though. I think they are just little pigs, and sometimes I take too long to feed them. It seems they eat too fast and then -- BLEH, out it goes. Also, I wish they'd package it in more environmentally friendly bags though, there has got to be a way to not make the bags out of thick plastic (or whatever it is). It just has that feeling... like it's an unnecessary amount of material for what it's needed for. It was most likely some art director (I am one) that created the packaging and decided customers would think it feels fancy so it's worth the price.<br /><br />Overall, I've done much reading about various foods, and this food seems great for them, aside from a raw diet. I'd also recommend Wilderness (it's got a sweet looking Lynx on the front).

review/summary: The only dry food I will feed my kitten.
review/text: I have owned cats my entire life and have never particularly been a fan of feeding them dry cat food. It's not nutritionally balanced to meet a cats needs and can cause a lot of urinary and kidney problems when fed exlusively. I have recently discovered Wellness Core dry food and I have to say that I am impressed with the nutritional content. I have a four month old kitten who had a lot of digestive issues when I first adopted her, however since being on Wellness, I have noticed a vast improvement. I give her half of a 3 oz can of Wellness kitten formula twice daily, and a 1/4 cup of Core twice daily and she has been doing quite well on that diet. My goal is to eventually eliminate dry food from her diet completely (I have done a lot of research on feline nutrition, and I really believe it's not healthy for them), but in the meantime, I am happy that I can feed her a dry food that is grain free and not as full of carbs as most dry cat foods. Wellness really knows how to keep their customers (both feline and human)happy!

review/summary: My cats won't eat it.
review/text: I want to love this food, but my two cats turn their nose up at it.  My bag did seem a fair bit drier than some of the other grain-free kibble I've tried with them, so it may have been a purely textural thing for them.  I'm not a cat so I don't know why exactly they snubbed this food.  They did eventually eat the entire bag, with nice healthy coats and all the other wonderful attributes that come with feeding grain free, but they looked at me like I was crazy and meowed incessantly before finally eating each time.<br /><br />Give it a shot!  Maybe your cat(s) will love this, mine did not.  So based on this experience I'm leaving 3 stars and my search continues.

review/summary: Quality Cat Food
review/text: Did fairly extensive internet research in an attempt to find the best quality, affordable food for my fur-kid.  Of course, quality means nothing if they won't eat it.  No problem there as he absolutely loves it (& he's finicky).  The kibble pellets are very small & easy for him to chew.  Not the best smelling stuff, but what cat food is?  Since cats also need plenty of moisture in their diets, I give him about 3 oz of premium canned food daily, along with all the fresh water he can handle.  My guy is roughly 8 years old & his health is excellent.  (Not to get too graphic, but his poop is always nice & firm, so the food obviously agrees with him.)  We also feed Wellness brand to our dogs.  As of the last time I checked various pet food review websites, Wellness had high ratings.  There are some rated higher, but the prices are crazy-high.  This isn't cheap, but so far my budget can handle it.

review/summary: Great food for ingredients/quality, but my cats won't touch it :-(
review/text: Unfortunately my local pet shops don't carry this brand of Wellness, so I was excited just to go ahead and give this a try. Its not ideal for me to have my cats on a raw diet in our small apartment, and many people have recommended Wellness as the next best thing. I'm really impressed with the 50% protein and the quality of the ingredients in this food. However...<br /><br />My cats were not. They just pick at it. I did my best to mix it first, gradually introducing it into their diet, but even after a week and a half, they just prefer their other food (Blue Buffalo). The Wellness pellets sit in the dish untouched. This food does have an odd smell, which also keeps the cats away from their dishes (unless they are absolutely ready to eat-we free feed).<br /><br />I'll be switching them back to their Blue Buffalo diet this Friday. I'm a little disappointed, but also glad that I at least tried.<br /><br />Great quality food, not for my kitties.

review/summary: Best dry cat food
review/text: There might be other good dry cat foods scientifically speaking, but I know my two orange tabbies love this stuff and they both have beautiful coats and are full of energy. What I've read is this is the next best thing to a raw meat diet for your cats--it's not loaded with grains and carbs that can make some cats fat (plus it has vitamins and supplements). Another reviewer said it has an odor to it? It smells like dry cat food smells. Was he being funny? My dogs must think it smells great because as soon as I open the container I keep it in they try to get their noses into it!<br /><br />I would never buy any edible item I knew or suspected of being made in China or having components from China, and to the best of my knowledge this stuff is all made in America. It costs more than supermarket pet food, but you have to pay for quality. And if you love your cat and dog friends--if they are really more family members, then you want to feed them well.

review/summary: Don't buy this food--for your cat's health
review/text: As others have also mentioned, my cat got struvite crystals and this was the primary food he was given. He needed emergency surgery to clean out his bladder, and it was awful to see him suffering. I too bought this because it was listed as one of the best on the market, and both my cats were eating it but one of them nearly died because of this diet. After talking with others that had pets with bladder blockage problems, some indicate that the name "Wellness" in often association. I can't help but think that his ailment must have something to do with this food. While I can't say it was THE cause because my other cat didn't get sick, this certainly didn't prevent it and was most of his diet. I am switching to a wet or canned diet for my cat, and I am definitely not using this brand ever again. And I don't think you should risk it.<br /><br />Also, I hope others who have this experience will write reviews because a food that charges a premium for its purported high quality shouldn't have such terrible effects on any pets--even if it is just a marginal amount.

review/summary: I'm no expert but....
review/text: I'm no expert, but I consulted with the experts to find the right food for my large, male cats. I wanted a high quality, grain-free food that would help to prevent urinary tract infections and reduce shedding. I checked with a couple of vets and also did some research online, and everyone seems to recommend this food. Best of all, the cats love it. They are big fans of their wet food, but I will hear about it all day long if their dry food dish is empty. Now this is a very high calorie, rich food, so I had to buy them a SmartCat slow feeder to prevent them from overeating and eating too quickly. It works perfectly.<br /><br />Pros: grain-free food is much better for cats simply because it's closer to their natural diet. Skin and fur are much healthier, sleek and shiny. The food does not cause smelly feces as some other foods do. Unique cylindar shaped kibbles make it hard for cats to swallow it whole, so they are forced to chew it, which aids in digestion, prevents vomitting and reduces intake.<br /><br />Cons: High calorie, so you must measure and feed the appropriate, healthy amount of kibble. This type of diet is not right for all cats, so consult your vet if your kitty is elderly or has chronic medical issues. Smells a bit fishy, but you'll get used to it. Price is one of the highest on the market, but if you consider the vet bills you'll save from feeding poor quality food, you'll save money in the long run.<br /><br />Bottom line: Try it, your cats will love it.

review/text: I ordered the Wellness Grain-Free Dry Cat food a few months ago. At first, I was less than thrilled, because for almost a month my cat's stools smelled more foul than I could stand. I was ready to finish the bag and then switch her back to her old food, despite the fact that her old food contained less healthy ingredients, but I am so happy I decided to wait it out because once her little system got used to the change (or maybe detoxed), she is a different cat!!!<br /><br />I have had my cat for 9 years, and she has always been a bit grouchy. I chalked it up to her personality and never thought twice. However, since changing her food, her personality has greatly changed! She is so much happier and more content, much more loving. She is a much happier little feline!<br /><br />So, I am now a happy customer. I would recommend this cat to anyone, it is so much healthier than most other cat foods out there. My cat loves the taste, and her behavior shows me she is feeling great too!

review/summary: We Love It
review/text: After some research, I changed my cat to this shortly after I got her from the Humane Society, which sent her home with some Purina, or something. We both love it. She'll eat it all day and night, and she's stayed super healthy.<br /><br />One thing though is to watch portion sizes. When I got my cat, she was barely 5 pounds. I was feeding her 3 times a day, a quarter cup each, and she started growing really fast. When she hit 10 pounds, I dropped down to twice a day, still a quarter cup each. Eventually she got to 13 pounds and was starting to look pudgy. I dropped her down to a quarter cup in the morning and half of that at night, and she's stayed consistent at about 11 pounds and well proportioned. That's about half of what the bag says a cat of her age and weight "should" eat. I feel that if she ate all that she would get fat.<br /><br />Watch how much you feed your cat, adjust portions to their activity level, and be sure they have plenty of water. This cat food is not the cheapest, but it's very good. For my money, I won't buy anything else.

Plus, I have to question the freshness of the product being shipped from Amazon - the bag of food was very meal-like - in other words, much of the small nuggets were no longer whole - but had turned to meal.  A total waste of $40+ dollars.  Makes me rethink ever buying something that needs to be guaranteed fresh - from Amazon.  Who knows how long stuff sits on those warehouse shelves.

review/summary: Not for our cats
review/text: I switched my cats over to this grain free food after being on Iams for 5 years.  They never had any troubles with Iams, I just wanted to give them something healthier now that I could afford it.  They liked the food and ate it, they actually ate less than what the bag said, but they weren't losing any weight or anything.  Their coats were so soft after the first bag, then after the second bag things started to change.  They just wouldn't eat much at all, and one of my cats (4) developed a huge rash on his face.  He had never had any type of allergies before.  This bothered me so much so I immediately switched over to a different grain free food and the rash almost immediately went away. $40 down the drain, but my cats' health are more important.<br /><br />After my cat got the rash, I started to read reviews of this food.  I'm so glad I took my cats off this food.  It may be good for some, but it seems like it can cause a lot of problems.  So far we haven't had any trouble with our new food and we're on bag 2.

She has no problems with it & likes it a lot. I've noticed that I go through the food a lot slower because she gets full much quicker. Also, she poops less because she eats less. A win-win for me!<br /><br />Cat owners should at least give this a try; your cat may thank you later!

review/summary: Made My Cat Sick
review/text: I switched my cat over from a non-grain free food to this food because I wanted to start going the grain free route. Not long after I started mixing in this food with the old food he started throwing up more and more frequently (aside from the fact that he obviously did not like the smell of it). I cut this food out and he's stopped getting sick. Thank goodness it didn't get as bad as some other reviewer's experiences; I'm glad I stopped giving him this one before it did.<br /><br />TL;DR: Grain free seems like a good idea, but this food is a terrible choice. Look elsewhere.

review/summary: Definitely healthy, just maybe not the most tasty
review/text: My cat who I got since 2009 when she was 2 months old had been eating this since 2010.  Her coat is so shinny and soft and had never had any health problem.  Maybe she's just a tough cat but I think I can attribute a lot of credits to this food.<br /><br />As I do a mix of wet/dry food, she prefers the wet (of course) but will eat these.  I don't have to put too much out at a time since it seems to last.  Either she doesn't like the food that much and/or it's a proper amount of food for her to eat because she's eating only when she's hungry.  I'm ok either way because it keeps her healthy :)<br /><br />Like the other review said, sometimes you may get a package where a lot of the nuggets turned into powder.  Hence the one star off.
