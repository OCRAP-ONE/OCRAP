review/summary: Large size!
review/text: Just finished off a bag of Cashews. These are nothing like the tiny bags of salted nuts we purchased as children, these are LARGE 2 ounce bags! You get twice (12) the number of regular salted peanuts compared to the Cashews and Honey Roasted but that's ok, as I like them all.<br /><br />Very pleased.

review/summary: Only thing better is fresh roasted on the boardwalk
review/text: This item is one of my periodic Sam's Club purchases. There's never been a bad pack in the bunch--something I can't say for all the convenience-store & vending machine competitors I've tried, such as Lance. The only thing consistently better than Planters packaged nuts is if you can get them still warm from the roaster (and that always makes me think of Planters, too, because of the shop near 8th Street on the boardwalk in Ocean City).

review/summary: great addition a packed lunch
review/text: I started out the year with a vow to watch my diet and take better care of myself.  These small bags of nuts help me do that.  A good snack for a packed lunch or just something to keep in your desk at work, to help you fend of the less-healthy stuff in the company vending machine or break room.<br /><br />Nice variety to change things up.  Yes, a little more expensive than buying in bulk, but the packaging helps with portion control.  Without the small packaging, I'd be snacking on these things all day!

review/summary: Big fan of barilla pasta, not so much their sauce though
review/text: I love barilla's 51% wheat pasta so i decided to try their marinara sauce. I found it is nothing special. its about average, and the twist with this one is it has carrots in it. having never tried tomato sauce with a hint of carrot taste to it, this one is definately unique. it's still average, but if you like carrot juice, give it a shot. it is still one of the better "average" sauces out there, id probably place it somewhere near the top as far as the two dollar sauces go. unfortunately it's not something i would continuously buy, and i couldve literally pulled any other sauce off the shelves. besides the carrot gimmmick, theres nothing terribly unique about this one. with that said i am still a big fan of barilla pasta, and that, they do amazing. so find another sauce, and put it on barilla's pasta and you're good to go :)

review/summary: AWESOME!!!
review/text: I bought this because my friend told me about it. I'm currently on HerbaLife (diet) and replace 2 meals with shakes. The PB2 is perfect because I can control how much is going in without the sticky mess of traditional peanut butter & can figure calories, protein, fat, etc. alot more easier! PB2 also lasts a long time but I will def order again as soon as I start running low. Awesome idea!! Also, the recipe cards are wonderful too.

review/text: I bought this stuff with really low expectations, but I had been desperately searching for a new peanut butter substitute for a long time, and I was desperate. The first time I tried PB2, I knew I was hooked. I can't go a day without eating something I made with PB2. I would recommend trying it at least once. It's not for everyone, but you won't know if it's something you'll like until you try it! I prefer the original to the cocoa version for most purposes, but the cocoa version has its uses as well.

review/summary: Great substitute for peanut butter...but much less fat
review/text: I have been using this product and the chocolate version for over a year now.  I find it wonderful in protein smoothies I eat each morning, for weight control/management. The texture is great, and taste is exactly what you'd expect. I understand it is literally ground up peanuts, just no oils added, as they would do for spreadable peanut butter. In addition, the lower calories (and fat) make this a useable "diet" enhancement food item. I highly recommend it. Great for any non-dieter too.

review/text: As someone who LOVES peanut butter - I was skeptical about a powder.  So far, I have used it in baked goods and also my protein shakes - both with great results.  My reason for 4 stars - when mixing with water to make peanut butter to use plain, however, will take some practice.  You have to play with the ratio to get your perfect consistency - but overall I am going to recommend this product to all peanut lovers!!It has a very nice nutty flavor.  Best for adding to recipes to add that peanut flavor without the calories!

review/text: I originally ordered these two flavors of peanut butter due to a recommendation from an email that I receive several times a week.  I really like the chocolate flavor because it is really creamy when you mix it with the water and not overly sweet.  It is very satisfying and I don't even use jelly with it.  The peanut butter flavored one was just OK which is why I only gave it four stars.  The chocolate one would have gotten five stars and I have already reordered it two more times.

review/summary: Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter
review/text: I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again "regular" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else.

review/summary: Deliscious and delivered to my door
review/text: A lot of tuna at a great price. Exactly what I was looking for. Haven't noticed any taste difference over regular cans Vs Lower Sodium. If you like canned tuna and know how to make it, this is for you. If you are only used to tuna in bags, then you need to know how to drain the cans.<br />It's really easy. Use your can opener, cut the entire top but don't remove it. Take the can over to your sink. Use the freshly cut top to squeeze out the water down your drain. Squeeze slowly until no more water comes out. Now you are ready.<br /><br />I am describing this only because other reviews of cans on Amazon have labeled them as "tuna soup". reviews written by people who haven't used tuna in cans before, and haven't known that you need to drain them.

It is impossible to squeeze the water out of the can as the tuna mush just pushes out and over the lid.  When you add mayonnaise to it, you cannot have a tuna sandwich as you have to eat it with a spoon, it is so soggy.  I guess I will give it to our feral cats to eat and buy some albacore even though it is twice the price.

review/text: The advertising says tuna in water.  Their web site won't tell you what is in the can!  However if you read the label you see that it is NOT tuna in water, but tuna in water which has been adulterated with genetically modified soy.  This is not good for your health.  It disturbs me when people buy food that they think is healthy but is loaded with genetically modified soy or corn ingredients.  There is no reason to do this!<br /><br />Buy a better brand which is honestly tuna in water only!  Try Natural Sea or Crown Prince brand and see the difference for yourself. There are also other brands that are healthy. You will also find that the tuna is higher quality in those brands - not just watery flakes.

Unable to eat wheat, I brought this pasta with me on a visit to my sister's house, and her husband Paulie "the Goombah" refused to eat it.  At least, he thought he did.  He ate it, just didn't know it.  But here is one warning about this product:  if you are going to have it in a macaroni salad or similar, you should plan for hardly any leftovers.  It does not keep well in the fridge, becoming hardish and crunchy-ish and unappetizing.  I don't think it is the cold that makes it that way, because I store leftovers with marinara in the cold and it does not react the same way.  Maybe it is the salt in the salad dressing, or some other ingredient that reacts badly with the pasta.  But other than that this is a Godsend to folks who can't have regular pasta.

review/summary: Wonderful Wheat-free, Gluten-free alternative Noodles
review/text: Tinkyada Brown Rice gluten free products are simply some of the best imitations of wheat noodles. Our one child has gluten sensitivities so we're switched to some alternatives. Tinkyada is one of the best finds. The noodles cook over a reasonable length of time (around 15-17 minutes) and have a firm texture and a taste that is quite indistinguishable from regular noodles. We've enjoyed the noodles with spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, and casseroles. For texture and taste these cannot be beat for those needing something gluten free due to Celiac disease or other reasons. Everyone in the family is willing to eat these noodles. There is a slight taste difference when tried side by side with regular noodles but not pronounced at all unlike the yucky after taste of noodles made from bean flour.  We would highly recommend these to others and have given packages away as gifts to friends with gluten issues.

review/text: I have tried quite a few GF pastas, but this one is most versatile. It remains firm, and can take just a minute or so longer to cook this that wheat pasta. I have noticed that it seems to soak up more juices in my mac and cheese recipe, so I have to put it a little to avoid it from drying out.

review/text: I have found all Tinkyada pasta products to be good tasting and easy to fix.  You should use the energy saving method of cooking and reduce the set time to around 15 minutes, however.  This pasta can become mushy if overcooked or left in liquid for a long period so we always cook it al dente and it is wonderful.  After dealing with a gluten free diet for several years, I have to say this is one of our favorite gf lines of food.  I am excited to see that Amazon Grocery is now carrying this line of pasta.

review/summary: So yummy Gluten-Free pasta, better than traditional pasta!
review/text: The ingredients are: brown rice, rice bran, water.<br /><br />Excellent texture (basically the same as traditional noodles, just a tad thicker)<br /><br />Excellent flavor, perhaps a bit richer/deeper/nuttier than traditional noodles (like the difference between white rice and brown rice)<br /><br />Cooking time just a couple minutes longer than traditional noodles<br /><br />My sister and I need to eat gluten-free, so we gave these noodles a shot with my mom's homemade mac and cheese recipe that we've always eaten growing up (Velveeta, milk, butter). These noodles actually made it taste BETTER than traditional noodles!  My mom's sauce is pretty runny, which is how we've always eaten it, and for some reason, these noodles either soaked it up more, or caused it to thicken more. It created a nice, thick dish with a richer flavor than white noodles. We let some of the family taste it, and they all liked it better!  Too bad they are so expensive, so we will only use them for the GF eaters in the family.<br /><br />I can't wait to try the rest of the Tinkyada pastas for spaghetti, pasta salad, and fettuccini. Who says you can't have pasta when you are gluten-free?! Not me! Soooo good.

review/summary: Great gf macaroni
review/text: This is so great tasting. I used it to make macaroni salad and mac and cheese and both came out great. It does soak up liquid more so use extra. When I made the macaroni salad I had to add more mayonnaise twice while it was chilling. Leftover mac and cheese after a few hours was a little dry, but still tasted good. My non gf husband said it was the best mac and cheese he's had, and he also enjoyed the macaroni salad. He never likes whole wheat items so for him to like this says something about it. I also love that I can buy it in the grocery store instead of having to order it online. Tinkyada knows their (gluten free) stuff!

review/summary: Larger elbows, more water needed to cook than wheat pasta
review/text: I must say that I was pleasantly surprised when I cooked and ate the macaroni.  The elbows are larger than the traditional wheat elbow macaroni.  However, the taste is excellent, and I don't think that you can tell any difference in both taste or texture.  I made macaroni and cheese with the rice macaroni for my grandson, and he loved it.<br /><br />One thing that I did notice is that it does seem to soak up more water in the cooking process, so I would suggest adding more water to the pan than you would normally use if you were cooking the wheat counterpart.  The first time I cooked the rice macaroni, the pan nearly ran dry of liquid before the macaroni was tender.  But don't worry, it does not come out mushy.  Just be sure to observe the recommended cooking times on the package and you will have a perfectly textured pasta that tastes great.

review/summary: best brown rice elbows
review/text: I've tried many different brands and shapes of rice pasta over the years. Even if you find a brand you like, not every shape turns out to be good. This is one brand and shape combination that gets it one hundred percent perfect! The pasta is tasty and cooks up al dente; works well in recipes like macaroni and cheese, baked zit type dishes and just about any other recipe I've added it to.<br /><br />One exception to the rule - when used in cold salads like macaroni salad, the macaroni tends to get hard when refrigerated overnight. It works just fine to bring macaroni salad to chilled temps but overnight seems not to work.  Tomato sauces and cheese sauces don't seem to have the same problem.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/summary: The best of the best wheat-free pasta
review/text: We have both dairy and wheat allergies in the household and have tried pretty much every alternative pasta you can name, from quinoa spaghetti to brown-rice lasagna. As a rule, they cook up chewy, mush, or crumbly, with (in the case of brown rice) a slightly bitter flavor that can only be hidden with piles of cheese.<br /><br />Of the pastas we've tried, Tinkyada is the clear winner, and this particular product stands head and elbows above the rest. It holds it's shape and texture through cooking (we use the 3 minute boil, 7-15 minute steep method), soaks up the flavors of sauces, and refrigerates well.<br /><br />I also recommend Tinkyada brown rice pasta shells (cute in soup). And their lasagna noodles, which are delicate and hard to handle but produce a very good tasting lasagna.

My only suggestion is that you cook them the way you would normally cook noodles (boil the water w/salt, add noodles, taste test and remove when ala dente).

review/text: I love these and remember them from my childhood. Great coconut taste and crunch. Sugar free but not calorie free. Only problem is limiting the amount I eat of them each time. I need a time delay dispenser that would feed me only a couple and max out at 4 per day ;-)

review/summary: Brings back the memories of the local corner store superette
review/text: Long before convenience chain stores became big business, almost every neighborhood had a corner storefront that was independently owned and operated.  One of the best selling features (from a kids point of view) was the penny candy.  Chic-O-Sticks was a big seller.  It was one of my favorites.  I was so happy to find these bite sized pieces on Amazon.  And although they are sugarless, they taste just like the original recipe.  If you remember these as a child don't be afraid to give them a try.

review/summary: Amazing suprise awaits the opening of this package!!!
review/text: For those of us used to Tuna in the can this product seems very unique and certainly economical if you have several people in your family.<br />What you are getting is a single solid slab of tuna measuring approx. 6 inches wide 9 inches long and 1 inch thick. 2 whole pounds of Wild Planet's low mercury wild caught tuna. As you can see from the reviews of their canned Tuna this really is a very delicious Tuna and they cook it right in the aluminum type pouch that it comes in. When you open the pouch the juices from that cooking are evident. I know many of you probably have bought fresh Tuna in the fish market and find canned Tuna of no comparison. I, myself have only done that once and it turned out very dry and leathery when broiled. I don't know how to compare a Tuna loin like this to a fresh cooked piece of Tuna but if you don't have access to fresh tuna or just want a high quality Tuna for sandwiches or other dishes I truly don't know where you could find a higher quality and certainly more economical piece of fish. This truly is a novel idea whose time has come. Taking a large, fresh piece of fish and putting it in a sealed pouch and cooking it. It is the next best thing to fresh fish, especially when your favorite fish is not in season or available frozen.<br />I wish someone would package Sockeye Salmon like this. The only ingredients in this product are Tuna and sea salt. None of the extenders etc.. in commercial store bought Tuna. Now, Wild Planet's new can's of Tuna are 5 ounces, so you would have to buy 6 1/3 cans to equal this 2 lb. pouch. A cost of $27.00 verses $16.00. So you can see it certainly is a better bargin. The only caveat to ordering this product in such a large size is that once you open it you only have x amount of days to eat it. No problem for a family of 3 or 4 but if it is just one person it may prove to be a bit to much when all you want is one Tuna sandwich, but, I have found that by eating a little each day I can finish a package in 4 days just by having a piece once a day. It's a great way to get some extra protein and omega 3's and I really look forward to having it because it tastes so good. I hope this was helpful.

review/summary: Good product, but canned versions are more moist
review/text: Let me explain that title.  Given how the products are sealed and cooked in the container in their own natural juices, there is as much juice per ounce (allowing for variation in each fish) in both the canned and pouched versions.  However, at least in my experience, the cans keep the meat chunks immersed in the liquid - whereas the pouch allows the juice to pool at the bottom, leaving much of the meat not in contact with it.  I had my pouch laying flat, so it should have kept the meat as moist as possible.  However, the meat seemed quite dry when it came time to eat it.<br /><br />I still give it four stars because (a) the product is of high quality, (b) I respect the fishing practices of this company, and (c) the meat can be moistened by breaking it up and mixing it around in the juices.  Because I use about one-fourth of the package at a time, the need to figure out how much juice to pour out of the pouch for the meat along with having to break it up and mix it together causes me to remove a star.<br /><br />A good product, for sure, but I certainly prefer the canned versions.  I give the canned versions five stars without hesitation.

review/summary: Best tuna ever!
review/text: This is the best tuna I've ever tasted and so versatile!  You can broil it as tuna steak, put it in a casserole, make tuna salad or just eat it right out of the pouch!  It's amazing - no strong fishy taste like some tunas.  It's moist, tender and so very flavorful.  I love that I can eat it as often as I want because of its low mercury content.  Imagine, something healthy, tasty, filling, full of omegas and can be eaten hot or cold, you can't beat it!  Excellent tuna well worth the price.  After all, can you put a price on your good health?  Eating healthy is expensive, but my husband and I can get at least four meals out of one pouch, so when you think of it that way, it's not so pricey.  Plus, this tuna can be taken anywhere, camping, hiking, whatever, and takes up very little space.  Put the leftovers in a zip lock bag and chill and you have tuna for several days.  It makes a wonderful protein pick-me-up for lunch at work.  Wild Planet is the brand all the health experts recommend because of its low mercury, its clean water location and the fact that it is wild-caught.  They tout it as the cleanest, purest, freshest tuna available.  If the proof is in the taste, I wholeheartedly agree!

review/summary: Great product, great value
review/text: I was simply looking for a tuna product that does not contain "vegetable broth" when I discovered I could have that AND low mercury, low environmental impact tuna too.<br /><br />This tuna tastes better than any of the canned stuff (with or without broth) that I was buying at the local supermarket. It does not taste as great as fresh caught, obviously, but it is great for putting on salads or making tuna sandwiches, dips, etc. We would buy the most expensive well-known brands and this tops them all. My first thought was that it tastes "fancy" like it came from a deli. My finicky husband loves it!<br /><br />The fish remains "moist" but not wet like the canned kind. If you squeeze out the water of canned tuna anyway, this is already done for you, basically. And, the foil pouch is infinitely easier to deal with than opening several sharp-edged cans.<br /><br />As for price... I do not live close to any discount stores and the only brand I was buying (which unfortunately started adding vegetable broth recently) would cost me $7.49 for a four pack. If you choose the subscription price, which includes shipping, this tuna becomes very competitive with the expensive supermarket versions. Tasting better and being better for you makes it an easy winner.

review/summary: Great for sensitive tummies
review/text: I tried this coffee on the recommendation of a friend a few years ago.  Due to a problem with gastric reflux, I had given up drinking coffee due to the acid content.  This brand of coffee is manufactured with less acid, and I've been able to enjoy a good cup of coffee again.  However, it has become unavailable in almost all of the grocery stores in my area, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.com.  It is available in both caffeinated and de-caf and most of my coffee-drinking friends have never noticed that they are drinking a "special" brand of coffee.  I've recommended this product to friends and colleagues with the same reflux problem, and all have reported that this product really does allow them to drink coffee again.  I hope Folgers continues to manufacture Simply Smooth.  BTW - I freeze all 6 of the tubs and it stays fresh for at least a year.

review/summary: Works for me - at half dose.
review/text: I am a nurse that works night shift and travels frequently. Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.<br /><br />Then, at the airport in Long Beach, CA I found Dream Water. I was a little shocked at the price but decided to try it anyway. Because it was expensive, I tried half a shot and it worked, well, like a dream. A whole shot makes me do weird things in my sleep, but a half shot makes me fall asleep and get a good 6-8 hours with no hangover effect - even during my severe episodes of insomnia.<br /><br />As a nurse, I would like to recommend that you be careful taking it every day. One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case. I haven't had any side effects, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Also, be careful mixing it with certain other meds used to adjust mood (anxiety/depression meds) or other sleep aids - even natural ones. Just a heads up.

review/summary: Risking your dog's life with these!
review/text: These are VERY dangerous for your dog.  When eaten, these bones become very chewy and sticky and act like glue.  Luckily I was supervising my dog with this treat because she started gagging suddenly and had a handful size ball of sticky chewed busy bone stuck to the top of her mouth and she was trying to remove it with her tongue and was gasping for air also.  I immediately dislodged the chunk from the roof of her mouth with my finger but I shudder to think about what could happen if you take your eye off of your dog when he/she is eating one of these.  The overall sticky consistency when chewed is very hazardous and could cause your dog to choke very quickly.  I would recommend supervision at the least or don't even risk the chances of harming your baby with these horrible bones.  Yes they taste great to the dog but it's not worth it IMO.  If I helped 1 dog owner that is wonderful.  Thanks for reading.

I could not remove the piece lodged in her throat until she was unconscious in the car on the way to the emergency vet.  Only by God's grace was I able to put my hand down her little throat and pull out the busy bone piece.  Don't buy these for your dogs.

review/summary: Made my dog VERY sick!!
review/text: My fiance gave our dog this busy bone yesterday evening, and today our dog has been horribly sick! He keeps throwing up big hard pieces of the bone and had a hard time breathing a few times when pieces were getting stuck in his throat on the way out. HORRIBLE product, and very dangerous. I can't believe Purina can sell these with a clear conscious.
