review/summary: Supressent for herpesvirus
review/text: Missing Link works Great!  I have two cats I adopted from the ASPCA and they were infected with the herpes virus.  It had all of the signs as an upper respiratory infection, but it was the herpes virus.  The virus remains in your cats system; every now and then it will act up and cause my cats to have squinty or watery eyes. It looks like they have allergies. If I keep them on Missing Link they never get these symptoms and look great!

review/summary: Cat's coat is softer and she seems more "bright-eyed"
review/text: I think this is really helping my older cat with kidney issues. I'm using some other supplements but I recently added this and she seems not to mind it as long as I just put a very small bit into her meals (she gets about 3 small meals a day). Her coat is much softer and she seems more alert and energetic - great signs for a short time with the product.<br /><br />Also I had ordered 2 of the product by mistake and the return was easy and the seller quickly gave me a refund.<br /><br />Years ago I used Missing Link for dogs with an abused dog I rescued. She had patchy fur and was just a wreck. Well after giving her the supplement not long after to my horror almost all of her fur fell out. I kept the faith and sure enough it grew back and she developed a beautiful fluffy coat. She regained her well-being and I was able to place her with a forever family :)<br /><br />So I have long been a fan of Missing Link - for some reason I never tried it with my cat and wish i would have been supplementing her diet with this product all along. With a small animal this is a great value and will last a long time - keep refrigerated if possible and remember to go slow to get them used to the extra fiber.

review/summary: Soft and Silky Cat
review/text: Our cat seemed to very interested in tasting it immediately upon opening the bag, he loves the flavor. We mix it in with his wet food in the evenings. After only a couple days, we noticed how much SOFTER he was! His skin is happier and his coat is even more beautiful. I was hoping for less shedding but it seems to be about the same- maybe slightly less, it is hard to tell. I love that it fills in the nutritional gaps that are in most dry cat food brands because we're not always able to afford the most expensive food each month. (Our cat enjoys a food change sometimes with no side effects unlike most felines)Awesome product and benefits are evident within days!

review/text: I use this for all 4 of my cats!  I've seen a dramatic improvement in my 12-year old cat's coat - he's much softer and his color is more vibrant than in the past.  He also had sensitive stomach issues - since using the missing link he hasn't thrown up.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be to offer this formula in a 1 or 5 pound bag.

review/summary: Did what I wanted it to do
review/text: I bought this product to replace another fiber product I was using with my cat, who has some health issues with which fiber has helped in the past.  I chose The Missing Link because it had vitamins and nutrients in addition to the fiber. I'm pleased that it doesn't have the awful smell of the other product I was using, but I can't say I see a difference beyond the benefit of the fiber.  We've only been using it for about five weeks, however. Mr. Grumpy Cat's coat might be slightly silkier, but that might also be my imagination.  He certainly doesn't have any trouble eating his food with The Missing Link mixed into it.

review/summary: I'd know more if the cat had liked it
review/text: I tried giving this to our 18-year-old cat. He's about as picky as a cat can be, and he didn't like the vitamins. I could not find a way to get him to ingest any of it (putting it in food, mixing it with water, etc). It looked like a fantastic product and I had high hopes for it, but there is no getting around a cat who's made up his mind.

review/summary: If the cat won't eat it
review/text: With even the tiniest amount of this stuff in my cat's food, he won't touch it. Says "You cat will love it" on the package, but they should have added that some cats will hate it.<br /><br />That was $15 down the drain. I'll report to my cat's vet that his suggestion sucked. He should have given us a small sample to try out first.<br /><br />My cat is FIV with liver disease. We have to try whatever we can. Be warned that your cat may not love it either.<br /><br />This review is only on the product, not the selling company. The package arrived quickly and in good order.

review/summary: Splendid Blend
review/text: My wife and I are religious consumers of this coffee.  But the grind has to be perfect.  We use a Bunn quick brew system, and we find if the grind is too coarse the flavor is weak... too fine and the coffee maker overflows injecting a bit too much coffee into the pot.<br /><br />I think this coffee is well-rounded and has a wonderful aroma with a slightly sweet, somewhat chocolate-like flavor, with hints of smoke and caramel.  It's definitely a "medium" though as the package indicates. Actually, the aroma after grinding is one of the most enticing coffee smells I've encountered.

review/summary: Organic blend leaves taste lacking.
review/text: Maybe it's because I've warped my tastebuds into desiring only the strongest, blackest coffee. Maybe it's because Starbucks in a bag will never taste as good as the magic elixir you buy directly from their location. In any case, I decided to buy this coffee, sucked in either through declaration of being organic, or the bear. Of course you'll buy coffee if there's a bear on the bag.<br />This was a truly regretful purchase and waste of $14 dollars. The taste is piteously weak, there's no 'punch' you want from your morning coffee.<br />Unless you're one of "those people" that dress their coffee up with so much cream and sugar that you don't even taste the coffee anymore, you'll be far better buying a different flavor, and preferably from a different brand.

review/summary: Teas Please
review/text: This tea tastes perfectly awful:  Kind of like grabbing a bunch of weeds from my backyard and dumping it in hot water!<br /><br />BUT.....I guess that's to be expected.  It is a part of "Dr. Oz's Tea Diet" so that's why I'm drinking it.  It sure does have a diuretic effect, as advertised!<br /><br />The order came promptly to my home.  I am pleased with the service.  The taste of the tea is not the supplier's fault; this is not a tasty tea-- and I'm a tea lover and fanatic.<br /><br />Suggestion:  Once you've brewed it w/ boiling water (microwave doesn't get the same "taste" level out of the leaves), let it cool down and drink it oold.  Much more palatable that way.

review/summary: High quality, great tasting juice
review/text: This is really great cranberry juice.  Granted, it is quite strong and tart, but we add our own sweeteners and dilute it a bit with purified water.<br /><br />We use erythritol and agave to keep the impact on our blood sugar minimized, but you could use stevia or xylitol or whatever.<br /><br />Putting some water into it definitely lightened it up, too, so then it was really delicious.  We then put it over ice.<br /><br />It is also good with sparkling water.<br /><br />So nice to have a juice from organic cranberries NOT from concentrate and not full of sugars and flavorings.<br /><br />The leading cranberry juice manufacturers are putting very little cranberry juice into their so-called cranberry juice blends these days, anyway.  Notice how they say "100% juice cran-rasperry", etc.  NOT 100% cranberry juice, no -- they trick people because most of the juice in those blends is WHITE GRAPE AND APPLE.

review/summary: Big help for back problem
review/text: Several years ago, I stumbled across a newspaper article about how Knox Gelatine helped ease the pain of arthritis in the feet of the writer's large breed dog.  Well, my wife has been struggling with arthritis in her back for over 30 years.  So, I showed her the article and she couldn't wait to try it.  It has worked wonders for her.  She is able to get right up in the morning now.  Before, she used to lay on a heating pad for 30 minutes and do all kinds of stretching exercises until she thought it was safe to get up.  Her back pain has gone away.  She no longer gets those "catches" in her back that would put her out of commission for days.  She started off by taking two envelopes a day, one in the morning and one in the evening.  Now, she takes one in the evening.  We have been buying this through Subscribe and Save for about a year now.  The price is comparable to other stores and ships for free.

I usually go for organic, but I don't eat much gelatin,<br />and the price difference is astronomical .<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DH0CT0">Organic Gelatin Powder - 1LB</a><br />)<br />. after my method didn't make jello with Knox either,<br />I got to looking on the web for a recipe,<br />and found [whats cooking america] had this to say:<br />1 (1/4-ounce packet) of granulated unsweetened gelatin<br />= total of about 2 3/4 teaspoons<br />. for a thick gel that retains its shape<br />you need 2oz (2/16 lb) of granules per pint .<br />Use 1 envelope (1 tablespoon or 1/4 ounce) unflavored gelatin<br />to 2 cups of water for standard firmness.<br />Add the gelatin to a cool liquid:<br />Sprinkle or rain the gelatin powder evenly over a cool liquid<br />(usually the liquid amount is specified in the recipe).<br />If the liquid is warm or hot, the gelatin cannot soften properly.<br />Scattering prevents it from forming clumps.<br />Firmness varies on the ration of water to gelatin and to temperature.<br />Too much sugar can inhibit the gelatin from firming up<br />Gelatin takes twice as long to dissolve when used with cream or milk.<br />Definition of "Blooming" gelatin:<br />As the gelatin absorbs the liquid, each granule becomes enlarged;<br />this is known as "blooming."<br />ensuring the smooth texture of a finished product.<br />It involves sprinkling the powdered gelatin into a liquid<br />and letting it sit for 3 to 5 minutes.<br />Then, when the mixture is heated, the gelatin will dissolve evenly.<br />Avoid the fresh juices of tropical fruits<br />such as papaya, kiwi, mango, and pineapple<br />as they contain an enzyme that will eat the gelatin.

review/summary: it's cheap, but have some odor
review/text: ok. this is really cheap, can be a good substitute for those expensive gelatin sheets i got from japanese super market. First i used it to make jello, it gave a fishy smell. although my friends quite like the jello and didn't notice any odor, I felt fishy compared to the gelatin sheets i used to use. So afterwards, I only use it in pudding or other strong flavored food so i won't notice the smell.

review/summary: Does the Job
review/text: MAKING YOUR OWN GELATIN DESERTS<br />As the package advises, you can make "better Jello" with Knox Gelatin and fruit juice.  This also gives you the opportunity to use the sweetener of your choice---or mixtures.  Although I use Pure Stevia <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84">Pure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 oz</a> in my coffee, I find that Spenda tastes better with sour fruit juices <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIRYS">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated, 1.2-Pound Bag</a>.  If you buy "store bought" juice---it usually has enough sugar in it for ordinary "jello", but if you add sour fruit, you need to oversweeten the gelatin.  This is a great way to use sour fruit which is not appealing to eat "out of land", and a great way to get kids to eat fruit.  Cold reduces the sensation of sweetness, so you need extra sweetener. Generally, I cube sour fruit and embed the fruit cubes in over-sweetened unflavored gelatin.  A layer of mixed fruit and berries in sweetened gelatin above vanilla pudding in a champaigne glass is a very special desert---and can be both low-calorie and healthy.<br /><br />The basic Knox recipe, gelatin/cup water (or juice) produces firm gelatin, firmer than jello (following the instructions).  You can make very firm "jigglers" for kids by doubling the gelatin.<br /><br />Be creative:  You can make "iced tea" gelatin, or coffee gelatin.  Sweet mint gelatin (made with fresh mint leaves) is very refreshing, a few embeded mint leaves and perhaps a few thin slices of strawberry can make it special.  Almost any non-sparkling beverage can make great gelatin.  Most adult "mixed drinks" can be gelled.  Can you imagine serving "jello" to your guests at a fancy dinner party, and then they find that it is fabulous?  Base your recipes on mixed drinks you like.  Almond "jello" made with Amaretto, perhaps with shaved almond on top, is a nice surprise.<br /><br />OTHER DESERTS<br />You can add gelatin to almost any puddling-like desert (including pies served cold) to make it firmer and more healthy.  I use Knox gelatin to make "chocolate" pudding with a tropical fruit called "black sapote".  In such cases it is best to make a very strong gelatin and water (or juice, or milk) mixture, and add that to the other ingredients.  If you try to mix the gelatin directly with the other ingredients, chances are that it won't dissolve property.  The rule is "Make the gelatin first, and then add 'stuff' to it."  Don't overdo the gelatin, most of these deserts are best "thick creamy" rather than "chunky".<br /><br />WORKING WITH KNOX GELATIN<br />Individuals who are used to jello may find Knox Gelatin difficult to use.  It isn't.  The trick is simply TIME.  Typically, I microwave 2 cups of fruit juice in a 4 cup measuring cup for 5 minutes---that gets it up to boiling or very near boiling.  Then sprinkle a little gelatin on the surface and stir, repeat until you've added all the gelatin.  At this point there will be many large globs of gelatin floating in the measuring cup.  DON'T PANIC. Just give it a little time.  Stir gently for several minutes, and you'll find most of the gelatin dissolved.  If you don't have the patience for that, then take out the garbage or do some other 5 minute chore.  After 5 minutes, you'll find that most of the remaining gelatin will dissolve with a little stirring.<br /><br />> Tempted to use a hand blender or cake mixer?  Don't. Mostly, that just makes a mess to cleanup.  However, I've found that a little mini-mixer works well and cleanup is easy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E39LYO">Norpro Cordless Mini Mixer, 5 Piece Set</a>.<br />> Tempted to add the gelatin to a (puddling etc.) mixture and then heat the mixture?  Don't.  In my experience it is very hard to get the gelatin to dissolve.  Again: The rule is "Make the gelatin first, and then add 'stuff' to it."<br /><br />PREPARING FOR A COLONOSCOPY<br />Take a steak, cut into small strips, and then boil it to heck in 2-3 cups of water.  Add a tablespoon or so of Braggs Aminos instead of salt.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006Z7NNQ">Bragg Liquid Amino - 32 oz - Liquid</a>  Strain.  Discard the boiled meat (or use it for cat/dog food). Chill the liquid.  Remove the solid layer of fat from the top.  Walla!! "beef jello" (aka jellied consumme).  Really! Gelatin is animal connective tissue---and there is lots of in a steak.  "Beef jello" is surprisingly satisfying and filling, and will easily hold you overnight until the terrifying "event" is over.  Obviously, beef jello is a terrific food for older folks who can't chew or have trouble swallowing.  You can also drink it hot as a broth, however chilling and gelling has the advantage of separating out the fat (on the top) and the fine solids (as a layer on the bottom) which could interfere with your colonoscopy.<br /><br />What does this have to do with Knox Gelatin?  The alternate (easier, faster) way to make "beef jello" is to dissolve gelatin in water and add bullion concentrate (beef bullion is the same thing as "boiled to heck and then strained" steak), and chill.  Bullion is already salty, so you don't need the Braggs. Or you can make "chicken jello".  If you are a vegetarian---well forget it---gelatin is an animal product, so just go with the beef or chicken "extract".<br /><br />SOUPS AND STEWS<br />Homemade broth from bones and scraps is the basis of great soup or stew, largely because of the "body" it adds to the soup.  You can use Knox gelatin for the same purpose---to add body. The soup will remain watery while hot, but and the gelatin per se has no flavor, but you'll notice the "body".  Make up a gelatin solution first, then add the soup ingredients.  Homemade broth also has alot of dissolved proteins, which enhances the flavor---you can use bullion or Braggs for this purpose.  Another important flavor component of good soup is fat. If you've chilled your broth and removed the animal fat, replace it with vegetable oil, ideally olive oil. I usually add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to a pot of soup or stew.  Most grocery store olive oil is harsh and bitter---but ironically, that adds complexity to soups and stews.  Colavita is a better general purpose olive oil which can be found in some better grocery stores, which is also great on salads, and even for dipping. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLB16">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />To repeat: the key to good soup, stew, bean dishes, chili, etc. is: 1) gelatin, 2) dissolved protein, and 3) fat (vegetable oil).  You can get all these components by boiling meat scraps (including bones).  But you can also assemble "broth" from the ingredients (gelatin, dissolved protein, and fat) if you don't have home-made broth on hand.  Most people only think of making beef broth.  However, I save every chicken bone (along with the giblets) and freeze them until I have several quarts, and then I boil them for 6 hours or more (with a little white vinegar) to make chicken broth.<br /><br />If you are one of those strange people who likes an occassional bowl of broth made from bullion cubes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5ADG">Herbox Beef Boullion Cube, 25-Cube Canister (Pack of 6)</a>---next time add a packet of Knox gelatin.<br /><br />FOR HAIR AND JOINTS<br />20 years ago I was diagnoised with arthritis in my hip, confirmed by x-ray, and had begun to get aches in my shoulders, knees and elbows. I began taking 1 citracal tablet <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LRPUMY">Citracal Maximum Caplets with Vitamin D, 180-Count Bottle</a> and 1 glucosamine/chondroitin tablet daily <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V2JBEK">Kirkland Signature Glucosamine HCI 1500mg Chondroitin Sulfate 1200mg 220 Tablets / New Increased Count</a>.  Now 20 years later, I'm a geezer without arthritis (or at least without symptoms).  I also take a biotin suppliment for my skin and nails <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BY2N7S">NOW Foods Biotin 5000mcg, 120 Vcaps</a>.  I've noticed a striking improvement of the "lizard skin" on my hands, and a softening of my brittle nails after eatting a cup of gelatine dessert daily for a couple of weeks.<br /><br />VALUE<br />1 oz packages (of 4 envelopes) sell at my local Publix for $1.49 each.  1.49 x 12 = 17.88  (half the Amazon price)  Actual Jello or Royal Gelatin may be cheaper.  E.g. one 2.8oz package of Royal Gelatin is the equivalent of a 1 oz package (4 envelopes) of Knox (not counting the sugar and flavoring), and at my local Publix sells for $0.89 each.  0.89 x 12 = 10.68 for the this 16 oz box of Knox Gelatin = a little more than 1/4 this Amazon price for Knox.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LURIJ0">Royal Bilingual Gelatin, Cherry, 2.8-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: The Baskin-Robbins sugar free mint chocolate chip flavor really reminds me of mint chocolate chip ice cream, but it's not cold (obviously).  I like mint chocolate chip ice cream, so I like this candy very much.  That being said, I think that my favorite flavor is the pralines and cream.<br /><br />Because they use Splenda as the sweetener, the candies have no bitter after-taste.  This candy allows me to have all of the sweetness of regular hard candies with none of the guilt.  The package says that the serving size is four pieces, so it works out to just a bit more than 10 calories per candy.  It's a guilt-free treat!<br /><br />The Baskins-Robbins candies are made in the USA. I prefer to save an American job when I can, so for me that's yet another reason to buy this brand of candy.

review/summary: Great lingonberry preserves
review/text: I have always loved the taste of lingonberries and the health benefits.  The Ikea preserves are very heavy on the berries and light on the sugar, best value I have observed in Swedish lingonberries.  I will definitely buy this Ikea product again.

My wife started using it that day. she has tried it on everything from flat bread to crackers and loves it. It is fresh and a new taste for her.

review/summary: Ikea Lingonberry Preservres
review/text: These preserves are so tasty and functional.  We eat them on toast, put a Tablespoon in Greek Yogurt for flavor or use them in a smoothie.  Since they have 3 times the antioxidants as blueberries and taste good, why not eat them more frequently.  I am sure they would also be good on pancakes, waffles or french toast.  Not too sweet, not too tart, just right.

review/summary: best price for super berry
review/text: After seeing the Dr OZ show regarding lingonberries, I had to try them, but they were so expensive. This Ikea version is the cheapest I could find at this time. It makes a good peanut butter and jelly sandwich and good with just bread or cracker. I believe it is a tart fruit, so they do add sugar. From what I could find on line it is 7g for 0.7 oz. I would prefer less sugar, but could not find a low sugar option.

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/text: Tao Kae Noi, purveyor of the spicy, crispy and yummy nori snacks makes this snack as well, but these are not sold here @ Amazon by anyone, you can however get the Thai manufactured version 25gram package for $1.50 american at your Walgreen's that is if they carry this item, I'm fortunate that my San Francisco branch does carry this Tao Kae Noi version, so for $@7.50+tax, I can get 150grams of this, for less than I can get of the "Wasabi Nori Ten" from Japan; this item is NOT superior to the Thai version, more that is available to me at a reasonable price, so if you can't get this in a local J-town, or your local Walgreen's, then this version is reasonable.  I bought this 4 of this product @ Amazon from this vendor this once to see what the ounce-age was and now I know, so do you if you're reading this.  Once again, the vendor is providing service on an item that is not easy to get anywhere, so a premium is due.  Just wanted you to know both sides of the coin on this item in all fairness.  My taste-buds thank me, though my waist is throwing a fit!!!  Mmmmm, super-crunchy and tasty!!!  Bottom-line:  product=yummy!!!  service=par for the best vendors using Amazon!!!  Value=depends on how difficult this is to get where you live or how hard-up you are to have them.

I love the price and how easy it is to find in almost all supermarkets and if you are craving some lovely, plain but not boring tea then this gem is a great choice.<br /><br />The brew produced is the color of soft umber with no red tones and goes with anything form sandwiches to cookies and dinner entrees.

review/text: I discoverd this hot sauce at a local restaurant (before they went under new management).  I love this sauce.  Like the other reviews stated, this sauce enhances the flavor instead of covering it up. A little bit goes a long way.  We drive a truck over the road and I take it in with me to restaurants to spice up my food.  I bought 5 bottles as it is hard for us to get in and get our mail.  Shipping and handling cost was $12.00 and total was $41.95.  At $5.99 per bottle that is a steal!  If you like spicy food this stuff is great!  It is hard to compare, but it is much hotter than the "Fire" sauce at the Bell, and has a much better flavor!  Two Thumbs Up for this one!

review/summary: Hell hath no fury...
review/text: Every couple of weeks my wife and I go to Firehouse and get subs. I have a weakness for them... Truth is though, I have just as much of a weakness for this stuff. This stuff is hot, but not ridiculous. To give you some comparison, I had Firehouse tonight and they were out of this stuff (big time disappointment), so I went with Dave's Insanity Gourmet Sauce. Dave's is rated a 9 for heat, this stuff an 8. Dave's was hotter, no doubt (not leaps and bounds hotter though), but it ruined the sub in my opinion. I had no trouble dealing with the heat, despite the fact that it's noticeably hotter, but it just tasted hot to me. It did nothing to enhance the flavor, and if anything it just detracted from it. On the other hand, this stuff (the Scorned Woman) just enhances the flavor and brings it out. If nothing else... Go to Firehouse (if you've got one around) and order a Hero Sub and put some of this on it. Unbelievable. I never get anything else from there, and it's among a very short list of things that I don't have any desire to mix up.<br /><br />I have a feeling my run with Firehouse and Scorned Woman has come to an end though because each time I've went there, the bottle seemed to get lower and lower and now it's gone. It doesn't seem to get used much (can't understand why), so I have a feeling they've replaced it. No one there knew when I asked. That's why I'm ordering a couple bottles of my own tonight. It's good... If you're looking for heat that will enhance flavor, this is it. IF you're looking for something "insane" then you'll be better of looking elsewhere. Easily the best stuff I've ever had.

review/summary: Best Hot Sauce EVER!
review/text: Tried this sauce at Firehouse Subs. Was rated 8 outta 10 for heat, but it didn't destroy my taste buds; however, my cheeks were sweating and my nose running... ASBSOLUTELY the best hot sauce in existence.

review/text: It's my favorite.  It's really that simple.  This sauce is hot and full of flavor.  There are hotter sauces to be sure, but this is the best combo of heat and flavor I've ever had and I've probably had 20 or so.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Hands Down My Favorite Hot Sauce
review/text: Years ago my husband bought a case of this Hot Sauce because of the name.  He would give it as a gift.  I opened a bottle and used it in a few recipes and it is awesome.  I have a special salsa recipe that people ask me for and I tell them this is a must ingredient.  Then when they tell me their's wasn't as good as mine and ask if I gave them the "real" recipe, I asked if they got Scorned Women.  Of course they didn't and it makes all the difference.  It taste like no other Hot Sauce I have had and actually has an great smokey flavor not just hot.  I think I have to hand it out with the recipe, LOL.  A little does go a long way.  I have searched in every grocery store and never find it but was thrilled to find it on Amazon.

review/summary: AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS HEAT!
review/text: This is the best Hot sauce I have ever eaten. It is hot but not so much that it will turn you off on Hot. Tried it the first time at Firehouse Subs and now I'm hooked. I keep a bottle in the cabinet all the time for emergencies. It doesn't anihliate the flavor of your food like most hot sauces, but it is Hot!!!Love it!!

review/summary: Numbingly Delicious
review/text: I added this to some chili that my wife made and it definitely made it hotter (the chili)!  :)  Not only does Scorned Woman hot sauce have the best name of any hot sauce, it adds a tasty lime flavor in with all the hot peppers.  I think I added too much because my mouth went numb after a couple bites and I caught the hiccups.  This little bottle will last a long time; I used the bottle cap to measure out a little bit for a big bowl of chili and that was still probably too much!  Best hot sauce ever!
