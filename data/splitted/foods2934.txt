review/summary: Bad Tasting
review/text: When I first opened the bottle it smelled medicinal. I added it to some iced tea and it tasted just like it smelled, very medicinal and only a trace of fruit flaver. I ordered 2 other flavors and they're the same. I gave it an extra star because service is good, but I can't recommend the extract.

review/summary: Little PEACH flavor
review/text: I ordered primarily peach(16oz) bottle to make ice tea. It had very little peach flavor, and smelled like propylene glycol(the agent they use to carry the flavor.) I added an ounce of flavoring to 1 gal and still didnt get a peach flavor to the tea.The other 3 flavors were also very poor quality. They definitely are not"extracts", so I returned them all.

review/summary: A Somewhat Healthy Juice
review/text: This is a juice with less than half the calories than most juices (mainly because of its lack of sugar), and less than a third of the sodium of regular V8. Campbell Soup accomplishes the latter by dropping the amount of salt added, and compensates by doubling the level of potassium. That's good, in that lower sodium and elevated potassium levels may reduce your chances of heart disease and stroke. It's not so good if your kidney function is marginal.<br /><br />The taste is similar to regular V8, but less salty. I suspect this is the healthiest juice product out there (which isn't saying much).

review/summary: No-Calories but Tastes Good
review/text: Highly recommended for those people on a diet, but a good choice for non-dieters as well.<br /><br />The taste is elusive.  The name "sweet onion" is apt.  There's a sweetness to it - perhaps artificial, but pretty good - and also a distinct powdered onion taste.  I've used it on salads and as a dip for vegetables, and it works either way.  Guilt-free, but not taste-free.  I can tolerate, but do not enjoy, the Thousand Island dressing, but the Sweet Onion will always have a place at the table.<br /><br />Note:  I have found it at Food Lion for under four dollars, so try there first.

review/summary: Delicious???
review/text: Other reviewers have mentioned that this dressing is "delicious".  I beg to differ as the initial taste is a bit odd.  I guess it's an acquired taste.  I'll keep trying it (for the sake of it being calorie/carb/fat/sugar free), but right now, I'm not big on the flavor.<br /><br />**edit**<br /><br />I mixed this dressing in w/ another dressing and it totally got rid of that initial funky taste.  I know it totally defeats the purpose of it being calorie/carb/fat/sugar free, but at least it cuts my regular dressing calories in half.  Plus I was worried that I'd have to toss the bottle.  Now it can be salvaged without having to waste any of it!

review/summary: So Good, We Keep Running Out
review/text: I typically get this at my local grocer for around $4 or $5, and while that's a bit steep for us, it is sooo good, and, a little does go a long way. It has a sweet flavor, much like the Asian "mayonnaise" offered at some of the Asian restaurants. Although it is thick, it does pour, and does not have the texture of typical American mayo. We especially use this on rice, our children want this for their rice more than anything else. It can also be spread around in a salad, although it is rather thick, so you'll need to the salad some. It is also good on chicken, shrimp, pretty much anything. I think my children would put it on just about anything if I let them. We can't keep this in the fridge, we keep running out. I wish I had found this when my oldest child was a toddler, (a very picky eater)-I think I could have gotten her to eat more of what I served with this yum yum on it.<br />This of course, absolutely blends beautifully with Asian-seasoned/styled foods/stir fry. You get the creamy-sweetish flavor of the Yum Yum Sauce that enhances and balances the saltiness/soy flavoring of your stir fry and vise versa. Ying/Yang of flavoring. I really enjoy this, it is not too sweet (duck sauce is too sweet for my tastes, this is not as sweet as that) and the creaminess keeps it delicate and such a treat. Keep in mind that: a little goes a long way, due to it's thickness, and it does have quite a few calories: 170 per 2 TBSP and 17 grams of fat. We love it and TRY to keep it on hand regularly.

review/summary: Good candy and better medicine!
review/text: I came back here to order more of these after my 13 year old tore through several bags.  I want to stock up before he goes back to school , and inevitably, brings home the usual colds.<br /><br />As candy goes, these are very nice and better for you than most.  It is basically honey inside a sugar shell.  I like that there are no weird unnatural ingredients (like high fructose corn syrup) and, honey being a natural antibiotic, makes these the ideal cough drop.... which is why I am writing this review.  We somehow misplaced (that is, I put away) 5 of the 6 bags.  I went to get one, having a sore throat from a bout of awful weather, and my son told me "There is only 1 left and I am saving it for when I have a cold," which is when I realized I ought to come back and order some more.<br /><br />Now I should warn you, if you have not gathered as much, that these are highly addictive ;)  Amazon sells these in 5 packs, which could be trouble for some.... so maybe hide them from yourself for when they are needed.  For me this will be something of a challenge as I have to hide them from myself and my kids.  If you like honey you should enjoy these as that is most of what is in here.  It is however, more portable since it is wrapped in a candy shell and plastic.  I plan to keep some in my purse for when I have a dry throat and keep some on hand for cold and flu season.  Unlike the drops which are advertised for colds & flu these actually could speed your recovery as well as offer symptomatic relief.

review/summary: Best honey-filled hard candies I've tasted!
review/text: I decided to try these Cedrinca candies mainly because they are eligible for free shipping (many of the "gourmet" products are not).  They are REALLY GREAT, and have the most intense honey flavor of any filled or unfilled honey candies that I have tasted.  The filling consists of quite a dollop of honey, so the candies are fairly large, and for a hard candy addict like myself, it's not practical to suck on them when I'm trying to carry on a conversation, or just have a hard candy discreetly in public.  For those situations I would recommend the Go Naturally honey candies, which are much smaller, and also eligible for free shipping.  In fact, the Cedrinca honey candies are so addictive that I keep them in an inconvenient drawer, so that I have time to think "do I really need another one?" before getting them out. On the downside, in addition to sugar and honey, the Cedrinca candies do contain "glucose syrup," which according to Wikipedia is the same as corn syrup (I don't know if it's high-fructose corn syrup or not).  The Go Naturally products contain just "Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Brown Rice Syrup, & Organic Honey" - so they might be more suitable for people who are trying to avoid corn syrup.

review/text: I received this as a gift, although it was a 32 oz bottle purchased elsewhere.  1 1/2 teaspoons makes an 8 oz glass, so it goes a long way.  This mix gives you a true ice tea.  Any other mix I have tried has tasted between not-so-great to terrible.<br /><br />This mix is unsweetened which is how I like it (I add lemon), but if you want it sweetened you can just add your own sugar or honey.  You can't tell the difference between tea made with tea bags and this.  It has no artificial anything; it's just concentrated black tea, which is what most tea bags are made of.  If you have a restaurant this would be great to have - you can give your customers real honest-to-goodness ice tea without having to brew then cool the tea yourself.  If you like iced tea you can't go wrong with this product.

review/summary: It's bean flour.  Good stuff.
review/text: While there's not much to expect from bean flour, Red Mill does an excellent job with pre-sifting it (it won't clump in batters as the Indian gram besan flour I'm used to does).  It is a pricey doll compared to the gram besan, but you can tell the quality is much better in terms of consistency and texture.  Like all bean flours, high in fiber and protein, lower in starchy carbs, and thus healthier for most people.<br /><br />Use tips: *NOT* a good substitute for wheat flour in dough-based breads, though, as your dough will crumble.  Much better used in thin batters... pancakes, crepes, etc.  One good use is making crepes (use a normal crepe recipe, substitute bean flour for wheat flour, omit egg, and fry crepe at a lower temperature for a bit longer than normal to get rid of the beany taste)... then fill with whatever you want, for dessert I like farmer's cheese and then topped with honey, very healthy!).

Garbanzo flour to the rescue and this brand is the best I've ever had. It held the patties together fully as well--or better--than eggs did. I'm a happy camper. BTW, I do the "throw together" method of cooking. Ingredients are quick oats, garbanzo flour, chopped fresh mushrooms, chopped onion, Braggs, coconut aminos, olive oil, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, sea salt and enough water to combine everything.  Baked them on an oiled cookie sheet @ 350 until brown, turned once. The mushrooms keep them moist. YUM!!

review/summary: Protein-packed, gluten-free, egg replacer--and a recipe for you
review/text: Garbanzo flour is known as "Besan" in Indian cooking and it's simply the ground flour of chickpeas, so it's a bean flour, not a grain. it is slightly yellow in color and has a somewhat nutty and sweet taste. Due to the high protein, a batter of chickpea flour and water can behave rather like an egg batter when you use it to dip foods for frying. In addition, it's used in a number of Indian sweets that are somewhat like fudge or nougat.<br /><br />If you want a really great recipe for zucchini pakoras, or fritters, it's so simple, you'll want to make these frequently. You can also use large white mushroom slices, Vidalia onion rings, even thinly sliced potato or sweet potato. Slices of cauliflower, carrot and whole trimmed green beans work, too. Here's the recipe:<br /><br />1 cup Chickpea Flour<br />1/2 cup water<br />1 tsp Garam Masala (Indian spice mix)<br />2 tsp each, grated gingerroot and mashed garlic<br />1/2 tsp ground chili pepper<br /><br />Mix this up until it's nice and smooth. This is your batter.<br /><br />Thinly slice (1/4 inch) zucchini, or mushrooms, onions (make into rings), potatoes or use a mix of these vegetables. Dip each piece into the batter and coat well. Fry in a cast iron skillet with a shallow layer of vegetable oil (you don't need more than a 1/4 to a 1/2 inch of oil.) When the fritters are caramel-brown on one side, flip and cook the other side. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle lightly with coarse sea salt, if you like. I use tongs to flip the vegetables. These are fantastic as appetizers or a quick snack.

For those who also have issues with most all grains, either allergen or blood-sugar issues, this flour allows you to have some of your favorite foods without causing your body harm.  It's also a great way to add fiber to your diet, so it's great for everyone who'd like a little variety in their diet.

review/summary: makes the meal
review/text: We like this a lot, using it primarily as a table addition to chicken/vegetable stir fry with rice. It is reminiscent of the hot sauce we've had on restaurant Thai food, and adds some delicious zip. In our case, the dish wouldn't be complete without a dollop or two added at the table. Yum. There seems to be some variation in this product, as an identically labelled  jar we had in the past was thicker, darker, and a more intense paste.

review/summary: Amazing flavor for picky kids
review/text: We like both the original and vanilla flavors. Our very picky eater loves this flax milk and now prefers it above his beloved cows milk. We've tried many different ways to get omega fatty acids into his diet and this has been an easy slam dunk -- 1200mg of omega 3, and about 350 each of omega 6 and 9, in 8 ounces of flax milk. We are thrilled. Plus the flax milk has about the same amount of calcium, and less sugar than cows milk. No protein though.

review/summary: A great soda alternative...
review/text: Being half-Cuban, I had heard of Iron Beer before, but I had never actually had a chance to try it. Unlike Materva, which is relatively easy to get (even in South Carolina), I've never so much as seen Iron Beer on a shelf here. I went ahead and took the plunge, ordering it online, and was ever-so-pleasantly surprised. It definitely reminds me of a mix of cream soda and orange soda (another reviewer said it tasted like orange dreamsicle, which is pretty dead-on actually), but somehow it manages to be a lot more than the sum of its parts...maybe it's that "hint of island spices." Highly recommended for those who want something new, or those who simply want a taste of home.

I have a teacup yorkie, who like most fur babies is spoiled rotten, but most products out on the market and readily available are too big for tiny bite, and those we do find tend to be discontinued by local stores. We use to give my dog the mini dingo bones, which she loved but really had to work for. The goof balls are better for her size and age, really easy to get to the chicken meat. these are great for older dogs or puppies.

review/summary: Great Bread for a Sandwich...
review/text: I usually buy this at WalMart but, they are often out.<br />This bread is really good. I have added Olive Oil to the water and I also add garlic powder and it makes some of the best garlic bread ever.<br />This is a good standby for your breadmachine. You don't have to measure anything but the one cup of water.<br />My family ask me when I am going to make more???<br />I have some making right now...

review/text: I bought this, to be able to use my Sunbeam 5891 bread maker quickly.  This simple mix makes a perfect loaf every time.  The &lt;sort of> bad news, is that it is surprisingly bland.  The bread I make using an on-line recipe is much richer in taste.  I'm going to tinker with some flavors, and what I can do with this mix.<br />If you just want sandwich bread, this mix is fine.

review/summary: They don't taste like peanut butter at all
review/text: I'm going to be honest here, I was intrigued by the marketing, packaging and general assumption that this treat would at least somewhat taste like peanut butter, after all, I only give my dog the best. I consider myself a first line of defense of sorts for my dog. After purchasing this product, I was sitting in my car and my curiosity got the better of me. I tried one. It didn't taste bad, but it definitely didn't taste like peanut butter AT ALL. Zero peanut butter taste. How does a company get away with such blatant false advertisement like this. It's shocking, shocking I say.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, there is no peanut butter flavor at all. Why say it when it's not true?<br /><br />Dog still loves them though. But then again, the only thing he doesn't like is olives.

review/summary: This Stuff Works
review/text: We had this stuff in Germany and did not find anything similar in the US. So we went online and were surprised to find it on Amazon. It takes a few days until it arrives, and we order a few more to keek the supply chain intact. The taste is not overwhealing honestly especially if you compare it with the sweet serial stuff that you find in the supermarket. However it does make sure that your digest system works properly and you see the success a day later. Thats why I give it five stars. There are many flavors so you have to eat the same every day.

review/summary: I am a now a lifelone customer of Beanilla
review/text: When I ordered this product, my order was shipped very quickly and I recieved it within a week of ordering. Unfortunatly my order had gotten mixed up with someone with a similar name and I recieved 12 Madagascar Vanilla Beans! But when I called Beanilla they VERY quickly sent me my correct order of 1/2 Tahitian Vanilla Beans and I was able to keep my Madagascar Vanills.<br /><br />First, both products I recieved were in beautiful shape. Vacuumed sealed and still plump.<br /><br />I have taked a star off of this because I discovered that my personal preferance goes to the Madagascar Vanilla, which has a more 'traditional' vanilla flavoring. I do enjoy the Tahitian Vanilla Beans, but I did find them to be fiberous when scraping the bean and that would cause little lumps of fiber in my product... ick... But they do have a unique and delicate taste and aroma that I would otherwise love.

Very floral and deep, rich and exotic.  All the beans were in great shape, no imperfections at all.  I'm going to make my own vanilla extract and vanilla sugar with mine to give as Christmas presents.  I can't wait to use some for my own baking!

review/summary: A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!!
review/text: I've been VERY impressed with Beanilla Vanilla here on Amazon! I made a GALLON on vanilla for this past Christmas Gifts and it's been amazing! I used 80 beans for the gallon and it's truly the best vanilla I've ever had and I'm a vanilla fanatic! After I pulled them out of the vanilla I let them dry for a few days and then I placed them in layers with a gallon's worth of sugar and a few months later I had amazing vanilla sugar that I use all the time! I totally got my money's worth :-) The beans made my house smell so yummy for DAYS after opening the package and they were so plump and oily! I had a few beans left over and I forgot out them for a few months in the package, found them again and though they were a bit dried up, the inside was still moist and one bean flavored a batch of creme brulee perfectly! Try them, you won't be disappointed! I'm getting ready to place another order of about 100 beans to make my own Vanilla Bean Caviar and use the pods to make another batch of vanilla!

review/text: This is a delicious tea.  I am very fond of flavored teas, but this is one of the highest quality ones I have tasted.  The mint is very crisp and the chocolate adds a truly robust flavor.  There are a number of chocolate teas that you can barely taste the chocolate flavor, or that taste artificial, but this one has a very natural flavor.  I recommend it to tea drinkers and chocolate lovers alike.

review/summary: LOVE This SO Much I Bought a Case
review/text: If you like balsamic vinegar dressing, you will love this glaze.  It is thick and viscous--and it pours slowly out of the bottle.  Looks like a slightly thinner version of molassas.  And it tastes amazing--someone else wrote on a review here that is balsamic vinegar on steroids--so accurate!  I use it in several different ways:<br /><br />1.  As Marindate/Sauce for Chicken or Fish:  I pan fry a few pieces of skinless chicken breast, and towards the end, I drizzle a little of this glaze on the top--It helps it carmalize AND adds a great flavor.<br /><br />2.  I use it instead of salad dressing and struesel this tasty glaze on the top and mix it with the salad tongs.  A little goes a long way for me, and it has a wonderful pungent kick.<br /><br />The very best thing is that this glaze is very low calorie if you are watching your weight.  It has no fat, which makes it easy to add to any diet.  And if you are like me, andnot a fan of leafy green vegies, it masks all those horrible rabbit-loving green tastes.<br /><br />This glaze can be expensive in the stores--and hard to find (at least in my area).  I ended up buying a case directly from the manufacturer, which turned out to be the best deal.  But Amazon's price is not out of the range of what I would pay for this incredible tasty, low calorie glaze.  YUM!
