review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: Great coffee and I just adore Amazon for getting my favorite coffee here before my long weekend!  Thank you Amazon!  Coffee is a very personal thing.  What one likes, another won't.  This is a strong, bold tasting coffee.  It is excellent. It is not bitter and has no aftertaste.  However, your mileage may vary....

review/summary: Very smoky and nice flavor.
review/text: After trying The Spice Lab's Danish smoked salt, I was a little hesitant to try something else by them.  However, this salt really does have a good and fairly strong smoke taste to it.<br /><br />One of the other reviewers said that it tastes a little bacony which is what tempted me into trying it.  I would say that review is accurate.  Of course it doesn't taste just like bacon, but it certainly does have a baconesque flavor to it.

review/text: I love the smokiness of this salt. I have tried others, and found them to be good, but this salt is great! When I open the package, the smokey scent is very apparent. A really great product, and I will definitely re-order! Do try this one out. Great on everything, in my opinion. Has a kind of bacony taste!

(Stop using Splenda which contains three Chlorine moities. It's essentially bleach, folks.) Enjoy, lentils are so healthy, and this way they really have flavor!<br />FYI: This costs $3-5/PER PACK at our local stores when you can find it. It is Not overpriced, as someone here said.

review/text: As a celiac, I am always looking for tolerable and filling and easy to digest forms of gluten free fiber and protein. These are yummy (if you want them spicey, add some hot sauce to them after heating and after putting in your serving dish/bowl). Quick to fix; heat up in package so no pans to clean. Great for college kids as a meal on the run. Good to take to work, if your facility has a microwave.

review/summary: Very tasty even for a non-vegetarian
review/text: I first tried this product at Costco and enjoyed it.  Purchased it on-line to send to a vegetarian niece.  By the way, it's cheaper at Costco if they still carry it.  But the lentils are very flavorful and have a good consistency.  I would swear there's ground beef in it if I didn't know better.  The downside is that the product is NOT low calorie.  Too many calories for me to use as a side dish but not enough quantity to be the main course.  My skinny niece will probably be fine with portion size to calories.  A serving suggestion was to use in tacos -- that sounds good and may take care of my issue.  But the product lives up to its name of Tasty Bite.

review/summary: Yummy Vegetarian Lentils
review/text: Tasted this at Costco and bought a package right on the spot, it is that good! At a price tag of 4 for 6.99 for two servings. The whole package only has 300 calories and really only feeds one unless you add rice or other grains to it. I usually just saute fresh spinach and add that. It is a bit skimpy on the lentils and beans, lots sauce, so I agree with the previous reviewer about adding a can of kidney beans or maybe more lentils.<br /><br />I have quickly become addicted to this product, however with lentils and beans being so cheap I am searching for a recipe to replicate this one. Anyone know a good recipe, or where I can buy this cheaper in bulk?

review/summary: Surprise Benefit in 2 days
review/text: I heard about Mangosteen Juice from my daughter (a Reiki Master and massage therapist) and a friend who is involved in alternative medicines. I liked what I read about mangosteen100 by Genesis Today, so I decided to order some. I ordered 2 different brands to compare. mangosteen100 by Genesis Today arrived first. I took a 2oz dose before supper and 3 doses the next day. The following morning I was fixing breakfast and all of a sudden it dawned on me that my low back pain that I have had for about 40 years, was gone. That sold me! Everything else it fixes is gravy. The other brand, which I tried for the next 4 days lost whatever Genesis Today's Mangosteen100 had gained to eliminate my low back pain. The pain was back. There are a lot of imitations out there that play with adding flavor which dilutes the Mangosten and is in a smaler bottle--that means less medicinal benefit per dose and fewer doses per bottle. I think I found a winner. By the way, when I went back to the orginal (first) product, the pain was gone again unless I really overdue it.

review/summary: Simply the BEST mangosteen product!
review/text: I rarely take the time to write reviews but this product deserves the time.  This is simply the best Mangosteen product available.  I have been a long time advocate of the Mangosteen fruit and it's health benefits.  I have been a long time sufferer of chronic tendonitis and severe arthritis from numerous surgeries on my ankle.  This product does not solve all of my pain BUT daily use creates an extremely significant improvement!  The Mangosteen juice allows me to function normally and with a noticeably reduced level of pain.<br /><br />This product is SUPERIOR for 2 reasons.  First the product consists of Mangosteen WHOLE fruit.  The rind (or Pericarp) is where the majority of the Xanthones (the main benefit of the fruit) are found in the fruit.  Many companies exclude the Pericarp because it doesn't taste as sweet as the rest of the fruit.  "The Genesis product contains 100% wild harvested WHOLE fruit including the thick tough and bitter inner and outside rind (Pericarp). OTHER INGREDIENTS: NONE"<br /><br />The second reason which may not be as noticeable at first glance but Thailand is notorious for it dangerous and harmful use of pesticides.  Pesticides are poison.  If you already have health problems chances are that they're from ingesting toxins.  Many Mangosteen products use fruit sprayed with these poison and don't tell you anything about it.  My girlfriend sells one of these products (which is how I originally became interested in the Mangosteen fruit) and is upset b/c I switched to the Genisis brand.  I told her that as soon as her company removed all of the additional apple juice and filler crap, provided information on exactly how much Mangosteen juice is actually in the product, and provide information about the pesticides sprayed on the fruit they use, I would never switch back to a substandard product that may actually increase health problems rather than help.

review/text: I bought this because have chronic Lyme disease and many tick-borne diseases along with Fibromyalgia and other issues. I have many cognitive issues so I will keep this short and hope it makes sense...<br /><br />I started taking 2 shot glasses per day of this product because I hear for Lyme it helps with cognitive (head issues) and eye problems from the disease. About a week into drinking this (and stopping all antibiotics for a month) I noticed my head pressure was a lot better. I did notice many head issues going away. It was not due to stopping my antibiotics because I have stopped them before and felt just as crappy while on and off the meds. I really think this helped me. I was able to blog again and talk to others. I am back on meds and all of the issues came back so I recommend trying this drink while off of the meds. I truly believe it did help me for at least 2-3 weeks to feel well enough to write again.

review/text: The only reason I got interested in mangosteen juice is the claim that it brings histamine levels down. My 20 mos old is allergic to histamine and I don't want to give him antihistamine medications. Since he still breastfeeds 3 times a day I also started drinking this juice.  I previously bought cheaper brands , dynamic health and smart basics because of lower price. I have to say  this one from genesis today is way better. Doesn't taste bitter and is not diluted with so much water than others. It is expensive , but I will buy another bottle if I have to. This time from vitacost. I think is worth buying. It seems like it works for my son , until my irresponsible husband ignores my warnings and feeds him with food containing spinach or tomatoes which are high in histamine.

review/summary: The cat, the dog, nor the grackles would touch it
review/text: I bought a can of this for the novelty of seeing how my cat would react to a can of cat food that cost almost a buck fifty.  He's normally not a picky eater and routinely eats canned Friskies or 9-Lives.  I opened the can and placed the contents into a clean feeding bowl and presented it to him in his normal feeding place on the counter (up away from the dog).  He took a sniff and recoiled from it.  I then offered him a can of his regular food that he happily ate.  Well, that didn't go well.  So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.  Nope, the grackles wouldn't touch it either.  But the fire ants love it.  They are all over it and within a few days it will be gone.

review/text: I chose this for the quality ingredients.  At first my cats liked it but about halfway into the case they stopped eating it.  I left it out, thinking they'd get hungry enough and eat it eventually, but they never did.<br /><br />After a while, I pulled out a can, hoping they'd want it again, but nope, they're done.

review/text: This stuff smells bad,and looks worse. My cat will eat anything and is not finicky. She was hungry but wouldn't eat it. We disposed of it, and replaced it with another Newmans Chicken product. She disposed of it quickly. I now have 23 tins of useless stuff. Normally, I try before I buy in quantity, but I thought the brand would be safe.

review/summary: Nasty Stuff
review/text: This stuff is pretty nasty. I live in a household with two cats. I supplement their diets with wet food and thought I'd make the change to a organic brand.<br /><br />First of all, this stuff turned my stomach upon opening it. It smells disgusting, like something died in the can. The consistency was gross too. This stuff was sloppy and fibrous. It looked like spoiled tuna salad and smelt even worse. I thought it had possibly gone bad but the date on the can indicates that it's still quite good and nowhere near the expiration date.<br /><br />I really shouldn't have given this to my cat but I gave him a portion of it (not the whole can) to see how he took to it. He actually did eat it very happily, gluttonously in fact... But he was ill after and the remnants of this come up all over the kitchen floor. That's the first time I've ever had this happen when sampling a new food.<br /><br />I think I'm going to stick to my usual brand. This stuff was not worth it! I am very disappointed and quite disgusted.

review/summary: None of the five cats will eat it
review/text: I looked closley to see what the stars meant with one meaning "I hate it." I. personally, do not eat it, but none of my 6 kitties,including 2 ferals (last time I wrote, I had only one feral, but now have two and neither feral will eat this. They may be wild and not let a human close to them, but they know their cat food tastes. Two stars means "I don't like it, and since I am the one doing the buying, I figure it is OK if I state that that "I don'tlike it" because I do not like buying something that the 6 cats that I feed will not eat it. I feed the ferals outside the back door and I can watch them "eat or not eat" by watching through the window. My kitties always announce the arrival of the ferals by jumping up and down at the window when my regular "orange and white kitty" and my "sometimes I deign to eat here 'black and white Kitty'" arrive for dinner! My, My, What an exciting life I have!!!...The high point of my evening being watching the ferals eat and then writing a review of their eating habits up on Amazon!<br />Anyway, I have made it clear as to how I keep tabs of the ferals and their eating habits. The inside kitties are pretty easy to manage. When trying a new variety of food (new to us) I just put that bowl in the kitchen where "the special eating" bowls go. Dry food and water are in the kitchen and whatever "speciality of the evening" is also located there. No, they do not get a new flavor every night! But one bowl goes there so they always go "aLookin" in the kitchen area for their night's extra bowl of wet food! Spoiled???  Yes!!!! Then I know if it is eaten or not. The specialty bowl gets 3 nights of trial...not in a row...to avoid "nose sticker uppers." But kitties know a wet bowl is always placed alongside the water and the dry in the kitchen. Water and dry are also located elsewhere, but the kitchen ONLY gets the wet nightly special got trial/accuracy purposes. Nothing is TOO much for the trial and accuracy information for Amazon!<br />It has been 3 weeks now with the Newman Chicken and Brown Rice. There is no question. None of my cats eat it. Not even the birds seem to care for it...or any other animal...as the birds generally eat the dried out left overs and if the bowl is chewed to death, it means a coyote has been by, but I haven't had any coyotes all winter.(Somebody is putting out vittles more to their liking somewhere else, or they have gone further south this winter.<br />So, there, my friends, is how I ended up at this choice of stars for Chicken and Brown Rice Rice Formula Newman's Own. Oddly enough, everyone likes the beef and brown rice:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXT278">Newman's Own Organics Adult Variety Pack Canned Cat Food</a>, but that is a whole "nother" story for a different time.<br />Sorry that we have a disappointing story to tell: Gabby, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, Orange and White Kitty and Black and White Kitty...as told to and documented by "Cindy O". Bye for now on the cat food trail tale until we "come upon" something else good ole mom thinks should be tried.

He acted like it stunk and backed away.<br />he then went over to eat his day old dried cat food rather than eat this junk.<br />Im concerned that someone wrote it might be tainted and be recalled later. well ill save it in case it does get recalled-maybe then i can get a refund. i dont like how amazon wont let you return food items(unless recalled), especially when they are just unopened cans.<br /><br />alot of people gave it good ratings but alot of people didnt.. I think if you only have one cat like me, the odds are bad... and you shouldnt buy it.

review/summary: Multi Cat Family - All Of Them Love Newman's Own Pet Food
review/text: We switched to Newman's Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets. Yes, we have cats and dogs all who are rescues. Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman's Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.<br />My brother-in-law has a 14 year old Siamese who was on Science Diet Food for diabetes. He looked like he was on his last leg, the cat not my brother-in-law. Anyway, we started supplementing his food with Newman's Own and I swear the cat looks 2 years younger. He is more active, his eyes have cleared up, and he has lost weight. The vet is amazed as well, as his sugar levels are better. I am not suggesting anyone use this food as a replacement for what a Vet has suggested. But if you have an animal who is not responding well, it is worth a try to add this product to their diet.

review/summary: Cat loves the flavor
review/text: Kitty loves it! Happily eats 1/2 can in one setting (13.5 lbs cat), 2-3 times a day. His fur does look fluffier after 2 months on this food and he seems more content and alert. Wet food does make him urinate more (he used to get a dry/wet mix of Urinary SO prescription diet), but I am glad, because this should help to keep his urinary tract healthy.<br /><br />I researched various options before settling on this one. Among other brands (wet food only), he wouldn't even touch "Organix;" he likes "Evo" fine, but not as much as Newman's own and leaves one-third of food uneatten in the bowl. As far as other flavors of Newman's own, he didn't like the Brown rice flavor (too much rice--the cat kept picking out individual grains out of his food one by one), and strangely, after eating a few cans of store-bought Chicken&Salmon flavor, he refused to eat the same flavor from Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent product... until Amazon ships it!
review/text: I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.

review/text: *Note to Amazon.com,<br /><br />Pretty please put this Liver on Subscribe and Save! You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S but not the Liver yet. THANK YOU SO MUCH!<br /><br />Now on to my review...<br /><br />My cat has been slowly switching to Newman's own beef products over from Wellness brand cat food (which is a great brand and will still be reserved for treats occasionally). I was ecstatic that there was a totally NO grain-and-NO fillers ORGANIC cat food I could feed my 9 year old cat who is prone to crystal formation in his bladder and also plaque build up on his teeth (even though I brush his outer teeth every evening).<br /><br />So far I've tried the beef & Liver and the Liver and he LOVES it. I just ordered the beef today for him which I'm sure he'll love too.<br /><br />This product *IS* very thick and concentrated (the beef liver alone has the consistency of a concentrated pate' and the beef & liver has the consistency of a gelatinous, thick beefy oatmeal), so I scoop it into his bowl and blend a bit of hot water to the product to warm the fats and make more of a 'gravy' for him (he also prefers to eat his food a bit warm anyhow). He barely wants to nibble at his Wellness brand cat food now (which I've had him on for over four years, so I guess that means he's one 'sold' cat. It might be unusual for a cat to love beef so much but my cat goes crazy for beef (especially if I make him steak when I can afford to). So, for me to find him a organic, no grain, beef based line of cat food made his day (and one of his nine lives no doubt)!<br /><br />Anyway, if you know your cat already loves beef and beef liver then he/she will probably be just peachy keen with this product.<br /><br />Here is the ingredients list for Newman's own canned beef cat products:<br /><br />Beef:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................12.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................4.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/3oz can)...........156<br /><br />Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef Liver, Organic Liver Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................11.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................2.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................83.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.5% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........129<br /><br />Beef & Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Liver, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................10.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................3.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........140<br /><br />Here's to Kitty's health!

review/summary: Fine Food for Diverse Cats
review/text: I have two special needs cats.  One is very small and could stand to gain weight.  The other is too large and needs to loose weight.<br /><br />The smaller cat likes this food. The overweight cat does not over eat on the food, which is a plus for us.<br /><br />We tried Wellness, C&P Organix, Innova Evo (they loved the dry food), Pet Promise, the Whole Foods brand and a few others.  Our cats did not like those brands of food.  Some they wouldn't even eat.<br /><br />They prefer the chicken and salmon brand to the other Newman's Own canned cat food flavors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Organic<br />* Peace of mind for the cat owner<br />* Liked by cats with 'special needs'<br />* Preferred over other brands by two very different cats<br />* When I open some canned cat foods, the smell nauseates me. The smell of this brand doesn't have the same effect.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* None that I can think of<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a good organic canned cat food.  Cats differ in their food preferences.  It's a good idea to give this one a try.  By the way, for a while, one or more of the flavors were only available in the smaller cans.  If that is still the case, you may want to try those flavors as well.

review/summary: Newman makes nutritious pet food
review/text: It is sad to see people rating on a pet food product based on whether or not their pet likes the taste, but not based on the ingredient of the good. When their cat doesn't eat, they give one star. When their cat loves to eat, regardless of the nutrition of the food, they give 5 stars. It is unfair to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, this seems like the trend of pet food rating.<br /><br />Newman always make good healthy and nutritious pet food. They contains no corn gluten, animal by-products, etc that will be harmful to cats. Yes, they are pricey because they are organic. Once a while Amazon runs a promotion on Newman's Organic cat food, and it will be the good timing to stock them up.

review/summary: My cat's favorite
review/text: My cat is prone to Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease, and needed a good quality canned cat food to prevent blockages. Newman's was the first I tried, and he loves all of the flavors except the Beef and Beef and Liver.<br /><br />I recently tried to switch him to Wellness, which is grain-free, and smells much better. But instead of cleaning his plate like he does with Newman's, half the can of food was left untouched. So I'm now subscribing to Newman's because I think it's a great deal for organic cat food (which Wellness is not) even if it has grains. I guess my cat just likes grains!<br /><br />I recommend this food, but keep in mind that cats are finicky (well, most cats anyway). Buy one or two trial cans before committing to a 24-pack!

review/summary: 3 for chicken& brown rice- 0 for beef flavor
review/text: Both of my cats like the chicken & brown rice and Newman's dry food flavors which I buy when they are heavily discounted. Neither of them would touch the beef flavor I bought on a gold box special. It has a faded milky slightly greenish pale brown hue, not medium brown as one would expect and oddly not much of an odor (I know why complain about that, but my point is is should have some type of aroma or odor to it.) Because of the color I did not donate it or feed it to the strays as I think it may be a bad batch. The reason for the 3 stars is for chicken & rice is at the price point there are better organic cat food values that do not contain so much brown rice. I like Organix and By Nature ingredients and my cats do too. Sometimes I'll buy Natural Value or Natural Balance canned foods since they offer more variety of flavors.

review/text: We have a cat with a liver problem who needs a low-purine diet.  As a result, we are trying to switch her off of her Wellness food and find poultry alternatives that do not contain any organ meat.<br /><br />The ingredients listed on the site are accurate except that they exclude "chicken liver" as the second ingredient in the chicken and brown rice food and "turkey liver" as the second ingredient in the turkey and vegetable food.  Thus, I just bought two cases of food that will not meet my cat's needs at all!<br /><br />Other than that, it seems to be a high quality food.  It is a pate-style food with a meaty, but not unpleasant odor.  Cats ate it right away when offered.  Will be donating ours to the local animal shelter, where I am sure it will be loved!

review/summary: Super high quality for the ones you love
review/text: Besides the fact that it's the only food my fussy bunch of four agree they like...there are other reasons why I love Newman's Own. Check the label.  The first, and most abundant ingredient is organic turkey.  In fact, ALL of the ingredients are organic.  When others pets were sadly dying from contaminated food connected to China, I could rest assured my cats were OK.  Again, check the label...Newman's Own meets the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO...a factor my vet cautioned me on when I went looking for a high quality food. Finally, I buy it because Paul & Nell Newman produce a great line of products.  If you want to treat yourself, pick up a package of Newman's Own Organic Cookies.  It doesn't matter if you go for the Newman O's or the Orange Chocolate Chip Cookies...they're all terrific.

review/summary: My cat wouldn't eat the beef
review/text: This is the first catfood I've had in a can that didn't smell strong of aromas when I opened it, and perhaps that is why the cat wouldn't eat it.  Catfood is notorious for having artificial aromas added to attract finicky cats.  This stuff is all organic and even when hungry, the cat just walked away from it.<br /><br />So the case I bought for the cat literally went to the dogs, who all gave this stuff two paws up.  The dogs saw the small cans as special treats and would woolf it down fast.

review/summary: Fresh & natural
review/text: Great product.  Even my very picky kitty (has digestive problems)liked this flavor.  She always loves salmon-flavored wet food but not usually chicken-flavored wet food, so I was apprehensive about her reaction.  It took her a few days, but she got to like it (not love it).  It looks different from the wet food we're used to, but that's apparently due to the lack of artificial preservatives.  Also, I feel good about buying it since proceeds go to charity.

review/text: I really cannot give this product a bad review.  My cat would not eat it, so I gave it to someone else and their cat loved it.<br />My cat is an adopted stray that was eating the birds in my yard. I started feeding him Purina Cat Chow in a dish on my breeze-way. Ordered the Newman's so he would get more protein. He just didn't go for it.

review/summary: Chicken and Salmon
review/text: My six month old kitty (Tinker) loves the Newman's Chicken and Salmon moist food. I was buying another commercial brand and even though he would eat some most would be left to dry up and most of the can was being wasted. So paying a little more for a quality organic diet and not a bunch of by-products is well worth it.  Plus the Newman's organic brand certifies that ingredients have been grown on farms that have not used artificial fertilizers or pesticides. I have bought two other flavors of the food but this one is his favorite.

review/summary: great high quality food
review/text: Pros: organic, grain free and a reputable company that gives back to the community<br />cons: my cats needed a few days to get used to this. yes the meat looks grey. but that is because it is all natural.<br />What I do is mix a 3 ounce can with half a can of Wellnes Beef and Chicken. (so its 3/4 meat and only 1/4 chicken) This seems to work. They love this combo. If I just give them the newman's, they eat but don't finish it. Out of all of the grain free beef canned cat foods, I've had the most success with this. My cats didn't like Nature's Variety Instinct or by nature organic. (Both great brands) But its really important to rotate protein sources so that my cats don't develop allergies (my six year old cat recently developed a seafood allergy after only eating seafood for 5 years...) so I push the beef on them.<br />Give it a shot. It might take some work or creativity but eventually you should win. Both my cats are v finicky and I found a way to make it work. Organic beef! I don't even eat organic beef all the time! LOL! ITs a bit pricey but its worth it. Healthy food = healthy cats=longer life=less disease/health problems.

review/summary: Cat won't eat it
review/text: I feel really bad writing this review since I am a big fan of the Newman's Own brand for human food. Their salad dressings are amazing. However, my cat would not eat this product. I purchased the beef flavor because she loves her beef flavored cat treats. I give her organic dry food most of the time, but after talking to some other cat owners, they informed me that I should be mixing some wet food into her diet because wild cats get most of their moisture from their food in nature and don't drink a lot of water. I thought it couldn't hurt to give this to the cat as a treat a couple times a week, but she won't even touch it. I tried mixing her regular dry food into it to give it some texture, and she just ate the dry food around it. I am not sure if this is just a textual preference for my cat or if it is this particular cat food.

review/summary: The best
review/text: I have tried every "good" cat food on the market.  My babies only would eat the dorito's of the cat food market, F**** F****.  Usually chicken sometimes turkey sometimes beef, sometimes I would have to go thru all three flavors until they honored me with eating.... I know, I am a mess.  The two adult babies (6lbs and 17lbs) would eat 4-5 cans a day with dry also available.  The poo was horrible smelling.<br /><br />Wally world was clearing this out one day so I bought a couple cans.  OMG they both scarfed it down.  I went back to get the rest but it was gone.  No longer were my babies interested in the bad food.  This is shocking since I had tried everything after the pet food debacle a few years ago (even tried the frozen meat) and they wouldn't eat anything else.  I only use one of the larger cans a day and their poo smell has drastically lessened.<br /><br />I cant get this local so am thrilled to find it here with free shipping.  I LOVE Amazon, anything I need I come here first and what is better than having your purchases delivered to your door???<br /><br />I cant say your cats will eat this but if they are not hyper picky they should.  (I tried turkey/chicken and no go, has to be chicken rice) And you really DO feed a lot less with this food! I am saving money and getting better food.  YYYEEEEAAAHHHH!

review/summary: Great food, Great price, and no more food allergies!!!
review/text: My cat had the worst food allergies. The way she dealt with it was by vomiting on an almost daily basis. Getting special foods (i.e. Science Diet or Purina from the veterinarian) didn't help at all. Finally I tried Newman's Own dry food figuring it couldn't be any worse. It worked like a miracle! No more allergies and no more carpet cleaning except the occasional hairball. When my cat got older I started supplementing her dry food with the Newman's Own wet food and she loves it. She's been eating this for several years, same flavor and everything, and she still comes running when she hears the food being prepped. If you want a healthy pet don't look any further than this! It's organic and there isn't a single ingredient that I can't pronounce. That's definitely something I want when I'm feeding my cat.<br /><br />The price through Amazon.com is cheaper than buying in the stores and the cans come well packaged and undamaged. I won't be going to the store for this again. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: the proof in truly in the pudding (Newman's Own- Chriken formula)
review/text: "Only my hair dresser knows for sure,"  Well I don't know about that, but the folks at Amazon know how much cat food I order (on account), both dry & wet foods.  Before I even offered Newman's Own Organic Chicken & Brown Rice formula to my five cats, I could see the difference.  Upon openind the first can, I was so pleased to see real chicken broth (organic of course). It was clear broth just like boiling chicken on stove top. It was really fresh looking too., So then the real test when offering to the three indoor cats.  All three approved.  I given only small portions at one time, yet my kitties cleaned the bowl, eating right up!  Never, ever do I recall when my kitties have been so accepting of their wet food. I've owned and cared for cats for over 25 years, and this food really impresses me! I now order it via "Subscribe & Save" (Amazon program) and it will be delivered at regular intervals.  The first case was damaged in shipment (3 or 4 cans were damaged so bad that the contents were running and dripping from the carton. I contacted Amazon and they were gracious as usual and are sending a new case for my accomodation. The only concern I have at this time is that this particular formula is "out of stock" and currently not available from Amazon, though it can be purchased from WAG.com.  I also make purchases from WAG.com and though their prices are slightly higher (most of the time), they are also a great company and have a good variety of foods for both Cats & Dogs, as well as other pet items.<br /><br />If you've never read Newman's Own QA report and product description, be sure to do so. I think you'll be impressed. I was.

review/summary: Cats Like it
review/text: I have been feeding my cats dry food that is supposed to be minimally processed. I have found that they have been much healthier. Recently I took in my moms cats that are geriatric. I was looking for something minus all the by product and fillers that was a soft food for them. Newmans seemed to be it but at Wal-Mart it was 1.35 a can. I was able to get it here for about 1.00 a can with free shipping with Prime which made a small savings buying by the 24. The cats like it and as I have found with the other dry food they tend to eat less and go longer between feedings before they get hungry again. I am happy with the product and will definately continue to buy in the future.

review/summary: Why the fillers and guar gum? Sigh
review/text: Unfortunately, I can't afford a raw food diet for my cats and they want nothing to do with Felidae, the only affordable truly healthy food that has an ingredients list that makes me feel comfortable. My cats love both turkey formulas of Newman's brand. I always have dry food available which they like but they become vocal to be feed this stuff, they are Siamese so I must do their bidding or the racket doesn't end. I always smell the open product and for six months now, no irregular smells or coloring.<br /><br />Concerns are the fillers that I see in the ingredients, brown rice and oat bran are better than wheat and corn I agree, but it still irks me that a company makes such a commitment to be organic and then uses fillers. Also, Guar Gum makes me a little nervous, though guar gum is one of those fibers that are everywhere, it is basically a thickening agent (think cornstarch) and like any fiber it has its positives along with its negatives. A plus for this brand is that its carried in my local supermarket which is very practical and the price I find reasonable for an organic brand.<br /><br />Since I don't want them to become dependent on any single brand I also feed them Natural Life (same filler issues) which they like but don't love as much as Newman's Turkey flavors. To balance my concern that perhaps there are too many carbs in their diet, I insure that the dry food I purchase is low in carbs such as Before Grain dry food.

Newman's Own Organic Chicken and Wild Rice is a fine product and I've ordered it through Amazon's subscription program so that it is sent to me on the interval that works best, and shipping is free.

review/summary: Great Deal, Great Product, but Confused About Auto-Ship Ordering
review/text: I put my OCD to efficient use in researching the best organic cat food at the best price and this is what I found, and with which I am utterly delighted, BUT for one thing (there's always a thing) -- when I signed up for this auto-ship service it stated that I would be able to change the frequency and duration of my auto-ship order at any time.<br /><br />I LOVE the auto-ship service as it saves 15% and you receive free shipping but I DON'T love doing errands. At all. And especially in these cruel and seemingly-endless winters. It's a fabulous idea and saves running to the bodega in the scary 'hood at midnight when I realize that my princely master (I have learned that the adage -- 'people have dogs and cats have people' is all-too-true, though I am struggling to remain in charge) is out of food. I also seem to really love parenthetical asides, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />Anywho,(here's *that* thing) when I received my first shipment and realized that this was far more than my cat (this is my first cat, a stray whom I had no choice but to take in -- so I am new at cat-ism, previously being a dog person) would eat in a month, I immediately logged in to change the frequency and/or amount of the auto-ship order and it seems my only option is to cancel. This is pesky and bothersome because that leaves me with two choices, as I see it; cancel the auto-ship, or, let the cat food pile up till I have enough cat food to last a year and then cancel. So I give the product 5 stars because my finicky little Prince Wonderfluff loves it and it is healthy and free of the chemicals which are all-too-present in food in this country, but I think Amazon needs to fix the auto-ship options so that when you click on the impending subsequent shipment, you can make such changes to frequency and amount. There may be an existing way to do this but I can't figure it out and I make web sites for a living so I can generally figure out how to do such things.<br /><br />I suppose a third option is to contact Amazon Customer Service but that's not a quick and easy task and I am busy trying to maintain order and earn a living.

Other than that, this product seems to be good, and I like the fact that it's organic.

review/summary: Kitty approved
review/text: I have a senior cat (18 years old) and her teeth are not in great shape.  I switched her to an all wet food diet about 2 years ago, and Newman's is the best wet food that I've found on the market.  She is also fairly finicky, and LOVES the Chicken and Brown Rice formula.  I've tried a lot of other high-end cat foods, some more costly than Newman's, and several of them she has had problems digesting.  Not Newman's!  She really seems to enjoy this food and I don't have to worry that it is upsetting to her delicate stomach.  I've also found that it doesn't have that stench that some other wet cat foods seem to have.  The food is a lot cheaper here on Amazon than in my local store.  Shipping and delivery was fast and pain-free, the box was well packed and none of the cans were dented.  I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I have three cats and with Newman's Own chicken and rice I have finally found a brand and flavor that all three love.  Granted it has a foul smell, but then. . . it's cat food.  What do you expect?!  I'm happy that they are happy with it and it is much healthier for them than most cat foods.

review/summary: Firm stool
review/text: Following a year with my adopted 8 year old Persian mix and his incredibly loose stool, three weeks after adding Mr. Newman's to his diet he has a firm stool. We tried Science Diet IM and WD a combination of wet  and dry.  I continue to  feed him the WD dry with a 1/3 of a can Newman's twice a day. Not that this cat is a picky eater but he cleans the bowl with Newmans and he always left a bit behind with ID. My cat is happier and I am  so happy that his obligatory butt cleaning scoots have ended.

review/text: My senior kitty is able to digest this quality cat food.  Other brands were an issue in terms of an upset stomach and vomiting.  It is well worth the incremental cost for the peace of mind it brings.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: all three cats love it
review/text: My cats think this food is the cat's meow.  I think that cats who have been fed grocery-store-type foods that have added ingredients, some completely artificial, might need some time to adjust to the natural taste.  But my cats have only been fed higher quality food--most recently before trying Newman's Own they were exclusively eating Doctors Foster and Smith foods.  Even though Foster's is completely natural, it is not organic which is why I've switched.  It's a good feeling to know that I'm doing everything I can to give my cats health and long lives (my Siamese is 21).

review/summary: If You Love Your Cat
review/text: The results we have had since we switched to Newman's Own Pet food are phenomenal. All of our pets look and act younger, their coats are shiny, their noses are wet, and they have a bounce to their step. All natural and healthy ingredients seem to suit them as well, before Newman's many of our pets where picky eaters. Now we have no trouble making sure they get their daily quota of healthy food.

review/summary: Different Consistency
review/text: We have 6 cats and 2 dogs presently and they all get Newman's Own Organics.  The only one we have had our cats walk away from is the 3 oz can of Turkey Formula for cats.  They love the 5.5 oz. can of Turkey and the other two selections.  They also love the 3 oz. chicken and salmon.  The only difference besides the size of the cans is that in the middle of the turkey formula 3 oz. cans there is now a dark pink or reddish colored spot(that was not there originally) that is not in the 5.5 oz can.  All the other dry and can food varieties are very nutritious and are eaten very quickly.

review/text: I have three cats, and even the chow-hound (the one who will eat anything, even, frequently, the inedible) will not touch this stuff.  The same is true for the only other flavor in the Newman's Own Organics line we've tried (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139C3P2">Newman's Own�Organics Chicken & Salmon Formula For Cats, 3-Ounce Tins (Pack of 24)</a>).  I'd like to donate the rest to an animal shelter, but I wish I knew why my own cats find it so offensive!

review/summary: confused about this product
review/text: I ordered this product knowing that my cat loves Newman's Organic Turkey formula.  However, he refuses to eat it, and I am concerned that there is something wrong with this batch. I have offered it to him over a several week period thinking he would change his mind, but no luck.  I usualy have good luck ordering from Amazon, but this time I am totally frustrated not being able to speak to anyone.  I would donate the case to an animal shelter, but I am afraid that it could hurt the animals.  You see....I unknowingly fed another pet bad canned food a number of years ago, and there was eventually a recall.  Later she had health problems, and I believe it damaged her kidneys.  It was, in fact, a high quality pet food, so one never knows.

review/summary: Newman's Own
review/text: My cat eats well and has good digestion.  Last spirng I switched her from Science Diet to Orijen, which had been recommended to me by the owner of one of those fancy pet stores in downtown LA.  He said the it was low in carbohidrates and all natural. Within months she began bleeding.  I took her to the vet who recommended that I start feeding her plain canned turkey cat food until they could find out what was going on, which I did.  That episode costs me $600.00.  After a course of antibiotics I went back to Orijen and she immediately started bleeding again so I threw the Orijen out.  I started with Newman's Own six months ago and have never looked back.  My cat is happy with the food and there is no sign of blood anywhere.  I recommend Newman's Own.

review/summary: All our cats love it!
review/text: I've tried a number of all natural/organic wet food brands for my fur babies, and they seem to like Newman's the best. They wont' even touch some brands, and when I'm spending over $1 per can, I can't afford to buy food they won't eat. Newman's seems to have really good ingredients that I can feel good about giving them, they all love it, and it's priced reasonable on Amazon, compared to the $2/can for organic stuff at my local stores.

review/summary: Watch for dented cans. I will re-rate this product later
review/text: The last 3 cases I've ordered had some dented cans located in the center of the case. I've read other coplaints about this also and wanted to warn potential buyers. The problem is not with amazon but with the manufacturer and how the cans are selected to be stocked inside the cardboard flats. I keep ordering for convenience and love Amazon. My cat loves the product and it is hard to find locally or stocked in a store far away. I sift through every case to make sure the seal hasn't been broken on any dented cans and usually throw away a few. My next case arrives in about a week. If it is dent free, I will revise my review and rating.

review/summary: Inconsistent in product quality
review/text: This is my fist batch from amazon of the salmon and chicken formula. Purchase 3 cases from another pet food store and our cat loved it. When we opened this new one from Amazon, it didn't smell the same as the last batch, this one smelled like rotten fish and the last one smelled good. We have tried to give this new one to our cat and he refused to eat it (when he would beg for the other one and finish it promptly). I inspected both a can from this new batch and a can from the old batch and everything is the same including all ingredients. The only difference I could find was the older batch had a 2014 date on the bottom printed a little differently from the 2015 best by date the the new one....? I don't understand why this product has such inconsistent quality or maybe Newman's is not making the same quality product as they used to. Too bad since I would like to find a organic cat food that is not super expensive cause I'm not going to buy this one again.

review/summary: Very Happy with Product
review/text: I am very happy with this product. Not only is it organic without any by-products but my 2 older cats love it! I bought a case shipped and sold by Amazon LLC so I got free shipping and a good price. Unfortunately when I tried to buy another case the next month Amazon was investigating a problem they were having with the shipping or something and so I am going to have to look elsewhere for my Newmann's Own cat food until they resolve the issue. I am pretty sad about that but otherwise the cat food is great!

review/summary: I wish this worked with our little darlings!
review/text: I do all the research before buying pet food.  I had high hopes that this one would work with out kibble eating cats as one of them needed to eat food containing more moisture as well as healthy ingredients.  When I opened the first can it smelled and looked good.  I was confident our cats would scarf it up and beg for more.  No way.  They made dainty little burying movements and then walked away.  All I could think of was how much I had spent for such puny results.  Now we are back to using the top grade of kibble and Fancy Feast, which our cats will eat.  However, the good news is that everyone we gave some to from the first case reported back that their cats loved it and they were going to keep using it.  Fancy Feast is cheaper so that is good, but I have no idea what is in the product.  I just trust that our cats are getting enough moisture.  I do regret that we are not using  Newman's Own product since I like their philosophy.
