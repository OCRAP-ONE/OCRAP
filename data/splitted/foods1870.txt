I had to buy some hazenut syrup and put it in my coffee to finish the box. I have had mudslide before and this does not have the taste at all. Please save your money and try the Toffee flavoured k-cups as they are smoother and delicious.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Just the flavor that I was looking for.  Like the malt milkshakes.  It has the consistency of honey.  Adding sugar helps to enhance the flavor and allows for using less syrup.  Tastes great in coffee, and any milk product.  Great for pancake syrup or over cereal.  I'm going to try the powder product (NOT the barley flour), hoping for less of a mess.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I switched to dark malt extract powder (Munton's) because:<br />1) shipping is high for a small bottle of syrup (hence the 4 stars)<br />2) the syrup must be refrigerated after opening<br />3) the powder is easy to work with if kept sealed in a ziplock immediately after use--buy 3lbs and repackage it into smaller bags<br /><br />A couple other  points to save your money, after having spent mine:<br />1) light extracts lack enough malty flaver<br />2) extra dark extracts have a bitter aftertaste<br />3) I chose Munton's (UK) over the other brand (USA) for the flavor

review/text: Here is the next in a series of Kristian Reg&aacute;le, look to the sidebar on the right to find the others.<br /><br />Almost clear, it just has the tiniest yellow tint to it, lots of tiny bubbles adhere to the sides of the glass, and there is no foam on top. Pretty strong carbonation. It's definitely got a green apple taste to it, and is ever so slightly bitter due to the carbonation. I think it's sweeter than the peach, but it has a tangy, sour taste also. It's good, a little more acidic than most juices, just like all the other Kirstian Reg&aacute;le's we've tried. We had it with tilapia & pesto. It's actually a lot like a Green Apple Jolly Rancher, but not as sweet.<br /><br /> It paired very well with the food, which is always a good sign, and I think it pairs well with lots of lighter meals.<br /><br />Did I like it: Yes, 7 out of 10.

These precious babies have a $4.99 MSRP and sell for that at my local stores so the price above for 8 must have s/h added on to it of $3 each to assure getting it to you fresh... if you want agave, purchase this item; if you want the best tasting plain gluten-free cheesecake, choose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LLJKAC">Pamela's Products New York Cheescake, 3-Inch Cakes (Pack of 8)</a>!

It is not over whelmingly hot, but nice.  I was happy to see there was no trans fat in the product.  My friend from Oklahoma said she liked these, but I could not find them.  Someone from Japan gave them to her.  She is really picky, so I thought if she liked them they must be great.  She is not really very experimental and I love all kinds of things.  I like them.  They are good.  I like them better than some of the more expesive wasabi snack products I have tried from eden foods.  I like the pea form.  These peas are addictive.  When I ran out I thought I was going into shock.  I kept craving them.  I buy more now that I like them.

Target's are horrid- burnt until browish, wasabi falls off and lousy flavor, taste burnt and wasabi tastes like American Horseradish, it probably is. Sun-Luck's have a strong Nutra-Sweet flavor, ewww. Kusugai have a nice roasted pea flavor and a real nice wasabi *bang*!! that quickly fades, leaving you none the worst for wear and wanting more. Honestly, I have tried about 5-6 different brands and none of them can compete. Grab a bag and get hooked-

review/text: Well.  There must be some reason why you want to buy comparatively expensive wasabi peas.  A longing for a specific "taste" of Taiwanese style peas, the need/desire to have a gluten free snack.  So, I'm going to assume that you've already assessed how much these peas are worth to you...and are seriously thinking about buying them anyway.<br /><br />These peas do the job.  They are good quality peas.  Crunchy.  The wasabi flavor is good...a nice bite, but not too much.  And they are visually appealing.  Its not a huge amount...there are "30 packets", but those packets are small--like airline peanuts small.  So, they are best savored rather than gobbled!<br /><br />*The basic ingredients list is in English, but there is no English information about cross-contamination, etc...so if you have actual celiac disease and don't read Chinese, this is probably not the product for you.  But if you just want something that is wheat free, these are great!

review/text: Delicious and beautiful cookie platters! Love the bakery and so happy they decided to offer online ordering. Love this cookie tray to bring to dinner parties or any special occasion. If you live in the area, you HAVE to try their cakes. I had one at my baby shower and EVERYone commented on how amazing it was.

review/summary: Very good for a Boxed dinner
review/text: I received a box of this product from a sample program I am in, so did not have to pay for it.  I don't love Orange Chicken, and usually choose something different, but of course tried it since it was free.  I liked the meal quite a bit.  It was very easy to prepare with clear instructions.  You do need to buy and prep the most expensive ingredient yourself - the chicken, but most everything else is in the box (with the exception of water and oil for sauteing.)<br /><br />The chicken was very tender and flavorful - you toss it in a seasoned cornstarch mix which makes it feel almost breaded (not quite) and keeps it very tender.  I used half the oil called for it and it was enough.  I also used half the orange sauce mix, because I didn't want the orange flavor too strong.  I will use the rest of the sauce later, because it was very flavorful.  The chilies are included with a few seed for some heat, but not too much.<br /><br />I like to cook, so I don't normally get this type of thing, but I will definitely considering purchasing more of these kits.  I do wish they were a little bit cheaper - if I ever see them on sale, I will snap them up for easy tasty dinners when I don't have time for cooking from scratch. If the product was a little cheaper, I would have given this 5 stars.  For me, it is a priced a little bit high, but definitely a quality product.

review/summary: Perfect Dish
review/text: I purchased this for only a few dollars at the local Sharp Shopper, I was iffy at first as most home Asian food kits suck, but that might be bias as I am married to a Filipino, anyways, it was very good.<br /><br />First off, don't bother using less pepper, I've tried both ways, as I've bought this several times, it doesn't change the spiciness much if any.<br /><br />Secondly, those peppers, are not red peppers, a suggestion from someone who competes in spicy food contests and has lived move his life on the stuff, do not eat these, and more so, don't give them to your kids. I ate one, made the mistake of chewing a few seconds too long, and ended up vomiting and drinking half a gallon of milk all to end the pain. If you absolutely want to eat these, chop them up prehand, and cook them into the chicken that way, that will dilute the strength, though also increase that of the chicken itself.

review/summary: The kids loved it!
review/text: My picky eaters aka my children said "yuck stir-fry" until they tried this dish.<br /><br />They both loved the mildly spicy orange flavored chicken.<br /><br />The kit comes with orange sauce, red peppers and rice. I omitted the red peppers as the kids don't like spicy food. The chicken was mildly spicy and just right for our tastes.<br /><br />The meal was easy to prepare. I defrosted and cut up the chicken while the rice was cooking. It takes 20 minutes to cook the rice. I tossed the cut-up chicken in the seasoning mix which I added to a resealable food storage bag. I then stir-fried the chicken cubes, added the sauce, a bit of water, and simmered the chicken to finish the dish.<br /><br />It was very easy and quick.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: TERRIFIC CHINESE!
review/text: We also bought the sweet and sour, which I fixed first. To cut the time by 10 minutes, I made instant rice instead of cooking the raw rice included. The company could cut the prep time by including that instead of the raw rice. Or not include rice. The most important things besides cooking the chicken are coating the pieces thoroughly with the flour mix that includes various spices (I placed the cut chicken pieces in a ziplock bag, poured the flour mix into it and after zipping shut shook the bag) and after adding the sauce to the mix stirring everything thoroughly while the skillet is simmering.<br />The cooking time can be further reduced by cooking the meat ahead of time, as my wife did earlier on the day when we got these dinners. This cuts off at least 5 minutes, so the whole process can be cut to 15 minutes from the 30 the package states.<br />Eadh packet makes an excellent chinese meal for 2. YUM, YUM, YUMMY!

review/text: I discovered this as a clearance item at my local store and have only found it here in packs of 4 ever since.<br /><br />I find that using only half the peppers in the pack makes it plenty spicy, I have kids and they shy away from truly hot foods.<br /><br />I was very hesitant about buying this item based on the price. However I've priced Orange Sauce alone and now I see why it is so expensive. Still at the price you pay they should through in a pack of Oolong Tea (which I consider to be essential for this meal).

review/text: I love this product.  While the taste is much more sweet than following orange chicken or beef recipes from a cookbook, it is much easier (1 or so additional ingredients instead of a dozen) for everyday cooking.  As the matter of fact, the only issue I can think of about the Orange Chicken or the other flavors is with the box.  When you put them in the pantry there is no way to tell one box from the other unless I label the boxes.  They should label them as Orange Chicken, Cashew, etc on the the side as well so you can tell them apart.

review/text: We opened the box to find the jelly beans sitting directly in the box.  No bag, no plastic container (as the description states)...just literally a cardboard box full of jelly beans.  How clean are cardboard shipping boxes?  The box was taped on top to seal it but air, bugs could easily get through the unsealed edges.  The jelly beans were good and still tasted fresh but we were very disappointed in the packaging.

review/summary: Great Filling for Almost Perfect Pie
review/text: While its not the same as FRESH Huckleberries, this pie filling in a jar does fill a 9 inch pie, and produces a wonderful, genuine Huckleberry flavor and color that was quite close to the "real thing", i.e. making it directly from fresh or frozen berries. The pectin set nicely and the filling after backing was both moist and firm, not runny. While the berries were mostly crushed in the pectin, there were berries, round with skin on, that could be detected by sight and on the tounge.  The result was a sweet and moist pie filling that was great.  I asked people what they thought, and they said it was "SWEET."  Though each modest size piece of pie is a $4 cost (just for the filling!), I plan to buy again!

review/summary: This Pie Filling Rocks
review/text: We were first introduced to huckleberry products while vacationing at Glacier National Park.  One of the most enjoyable things we ate while there was a fresh huckleberry pie.  So I ordered this pie filling to make our own pie here in Colorado.  The pie turned out great retaining that unique "huckleberry taste" we remembered from Montana.  Using this pie filling rather than frozen or fresh huckleberries avoids a big problem many people encounter and that is huckleberries are so juicy they can soak through and saturate the pie crust and many people have reported the pie can turn into mush. Treat yourself to this very unique pie filling, you WILL NOT be disappointed.

review/summary: Dense nutty bread
review/text: This bread is tasty, and despite having a long shelf life, has no preservatives.  I feel good about the simple ingredient list:  whole kernel rye, water, rye flour, sunflower seed, salt and yeast.  The plastic packaging is very thick and difficult to open so I assume it keeps so well because it is air/water tight.  I was disappointed slightly that there are only seven pieces (servings) per package, because it seems like it should be the equivalent of a whole loaf with many slices by the weight...but the dense bread is very filling and I am still happy with this purchase.  I have bricks of bread lined up in my freezer now and can just take one out each week (though it says shelf stable...I just like putting it in the freezer).

review/summary: Excellent Green Tea
review/text: *****<br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

I cannot taste the slightest bit of seasoning anywhere, not even salt. They taste burnt nuts....yum right!?! I would not order again and will not ask for again. That said, peanut brittle flavor was not so bad, but I still wasn't impressed enough to try them again.

review/summary: Great Product.  Looks great and functional
review/text: We received this pet feeder yesterday and assembled it right away. It was easy to put together and it looks really great. We have cherry cabinets in our kitchen and it looks nice alongside of them. Our dog is a 1yr old, 56 pound Golden Retriever and she really seems to like the new set up. She even seems to eat her food a little more slowly and has been drinking more water. I would definitely recommend this product. One note - one of the bowls had a very sharp piece on the underside of the lip. I was able to file it smooth and it's fine now, but it would have definitely led to a cut at some point during a hand washing.

review/summary: Better tasting than whole wheat pasta
review/text: Since wheat was about the only grain on my menu, I decided to try some new ones. For pasta, Kamut is my favorite. Whole wheat is great for bread but does not work well in pasta. Kamut pasta is great. Don't be put off by the darker color. The flavor is very mild and it tastes better than semolina pasta. Also, the texture works well for any dish. My kids like this pasta plain with a little Smart Balance and sea salt on it. Once cooked, I like to saute this pasta with some vegetables and olive oil. I've also thrown this pasta into soups and chilis. The elbow shape works well and this pasta doesn't expand too much and get soggy.

review/summary: Disapointed
review/text: I was really excited to try these, since Kamut noodles have great health benefits and I don't really care for traditional whole wheat noodles. These seemed to be well reviewed so I took a chance and ordered a case (I wish you could order just a box at a time...). The flavor is actually pretty nice, they have a really subtle buttery nutty taste to them and taste better than traditional whole wheat noodles I've had in the past, but I just could not get past the TEXTURE of these things. The best way I can describe it would be "gritty". Maybe this is normal for whole wheat but it was just very unpleasant in my mouth and chewing them was just....icky. If you aren't picky about textures you may like these but if you're a super taster like me, don't bother, they'll drive you crazy. Now I have to find someone to unload all these noodles onto.

review/text: I used the thermometer about 7 or 8 times and it stopped working.  I have seen several reviews complaining that the probe fails so I'm hoping that's the problem.<br /><br />Update 2/27/08: I ordered a new probe from Brookstone for $25 (incl. shipping) and it is a much sturdier design than the original.  I assume they were getting a lot of complaints and returns so they redesigned it.  So far the new probe is working fine.  Interesting to note, I gave a negative review of this product on their web site and they never published it, although they sent me a thank you note for my review.

review/summary: IT ACTUALLY WORKS!
review/text: I received this for Father's Day last year.  I was skeptical - but it actually works.  I can put some tri-tip in the smoker and hang in the pool or chat with guests while keeping an eye on the large LCD display. The range is very good, I can sit in the pool with the display next to me on the deck (at least 20-30 feet away) or go back inside the house. It beeps and talks to you a few minutes before your food is at the desired temperature.  I use it primarily for beef, and the settings (rare, medium, etc.) are pretty accurate. This is especially good for large cuts of beef since it is often difficult to gauge whether the meat is pink inside or not.  I would highly recommend this.  Easy to set-up, then all you do is select the type of meat and the desired cooking level.  Pork and seafood default to only one setting choice (well-done) but you can just use the temperature readout to cook to the desired temp.

review/summary: Extremely bad longevity
review/text: I have owned several of these and given a few away as gifts. I LOVE how well they work when they are brand new so when mine failed I bought new ones assuming I just got a lemon. THEY ARE ALL LEMONS. My observation of several units is that the average service life is from 3 to 6 uses. Sometimes a new probe fixes the problem ($20 ea) sometimes nothing (including hitting the reset button) helps. Look at other product reviews on different web sites; they all complain about how quickly the unit fails. You may also notice that several different brands all look alike with the same screen indicating that they are all the same unit sold under different brand names.<br /><br />With all the bad reviews of these things the firms selling these things should consider the ethics of selling something this expensive that only works a few times. Unfortunately the other brands of remote thermometers, from what I have seen, all seem to fail after only a few uses. This is a real drag because when they work, they work great, and I guess that's why I am so annoyed.

review/summary: Here's The Real Story
review/text: Have I owned one of this make and model?  No.  But I have owned 4 or 5 of the Webber units that are essentially the same design.  I have also owned 8 or 10 of the probes that stick into the meat.<br /><br />The thermometers are great when they work.  They are so good that, even knowing the design flaw, I keep buying them and replacement probes.<br /><br />The receivers and transmitters all work well and seem to have an expected long lifetime.  The probe is the Achilles heel in every make and model of wireless thermometer.  Within the metal, flexible shielded cable that runs from the probe to the transmitter are small wires.  Small weak wires.  Small fragile wires.  Small worthless wires due to their failure rate.<br /><br />If the user closes the lid of the BBQ or smoker on the metal shielded cable between the probe and the transmitter, the internal wires WILL fail.  It may take 2 or 3 times, but they will fail.  If the metal shielded cable is kinked or bent too sharply, the internal wires will fail.<br /><br />A couple of years ago I was on the Webber customer service line (again) requesting a new probe because the wires failed.  I asked the customer service representative if she owned one of these wireless systems and, to my surprise, she said "Are you kidding?  I would NEVER own one of these".  I asked her why and she said "I have a full time job, 7 days a week taking calls just like this one -  people complaining 8 hours a day, 7 days a week because the probe failed".<br /><br />Now, if I were her boss, I would have fired her on the spot.  From a consumer's point of view I found this conversation somewhat alarming.<br /><br />This summer I will probably buy another and attempt to keep the smoker's lid from crushing the tiny worthless wires - but eventually I will fail and so will the probe.<br /><br />In short, this is a great product with a major and easily correctable design flaw.  Be prepared that the wires within the shielded cable can and will fail.

review/text: Mine stopped working after about a dozen uses in about a year and a half. Now, when I turn it on and insert the probe into a piece of meat, the temperature jumps to 199 degrees within a minute or two -- and that infernal piercing voice insists that my "entree is ready!" The unit is older than its one-year warranty, but since I'm sure that the product was designed to last longer than one year, I called the company and asked that the warranty be put aside, and that they do the right thing and replace the unit. The agent said they couldn't because their policy says they can't. I tried to explain circular reasoning to her -- but I did not succeed. Hung up and threw the thing in the trash.

review/text: I got this for myself (I'm gadget freak) figuring that it would give me a shot at grill-roasting without needing to periodically open the grill, quick-read the temp. and then wait 20 minutes for the temp. to rise back again.  This thing works.  It cuts my grill roasting time in less than half, talks through 3 courses of brick, and gives pretty accurate temp. readings.  As long as you set it up right, make sure the batteries are good and that the 2 units are on the same wavelength (there's an indicator for that) you're going to be good.  Just keep the probe in a meaty place and away from any bones.  I've done chicken, pork, lamb, beef and yesterday's 20 lb. turkey in the indoor oven.  This will be a Christmas gift for my neighbor; I don't trust the cheaper ones; I know this works.

review/text: Bought this for my husband for Christmas and it was the greatest gadget ever....but like others - it has failed after about 25 times and it says the meat is ready before I even insert it into the meat.  Of course I have every single receipt to every item but this one....so, having owned it for a matter of months....it proved to be a non-lasting, expensive toy.....  If anyone does find one that works - please enlighten me!  Brookstone service sucks.  Even though I do have the credit card bill to Brookstone with just the one item....all I got was a 'sorry, should have kept the receipt'.  Thanks for nothing Brookstone.<br /><br />I wanted to update my review for this product and move it to a 3.  I finally got a hold of someone again at Brookstone and they said that it would be no problem to look up my receipt.  Well, they sent me a copy via email, I brought it to the store and bam - got a new thermometer.  So, took this one home...it worked great....about 5 or 6 times and then it crapped out again just the like the other.  So - brought that one back, got another one and the gentleman offered the extended warranty.  I took it for $15 or whatever it was.  I hate this product...and love it.  When it works it is soooo great that I have now forgotten how to cook things, but that's when it works.....I really hate when it doesn't work.

review/summary: JUNK!!!! Brookstone is not helping with warranty issues...
review/text: Cool idea for a product but the one I got is junk unless you don't mind a meat thermometer that jumps from 60 deg to 299 deg and back again within a few seconds and alarms every time it give an erroneously high reading, which is every few minutes.<br /><br />I purchased this product for my Father who has used it twice.  We tried all the tricks to get it to work, reset the transmitter and receiver, fresh batteries, moved the meat probe, etc.  Nothing worked.<br /><br />It has been more than 90 days since I ordered this product, so I called the Brookstone Limited Warranty Service at the 800 number listed in the manual.  A very nice but obviously frustrated gal tried for 25 minutes to find my order in the system but couldn't pull it off.  I asked her if she could just add me to the system since I obviously had a Brookstone product and a receipt from Amazon.  She said no, it doesn't work that way.  After speaking to her supervisor I was told I needed to contact Amazon for support.  Amazon said I had to contact the seller, TLC Stores.  I sent a email to TLC stores, well see what they say.<br /><br />As of this posting I have spent $65.98 for a product that doesn't work and over an hour and counting trying to get warranty service.<br /><br />For now I would say STAY AWAY FROM BROOKSTONE PRODUCTS!  My, albeit limited, experience has not been a positive one.<br /><br />If the situation is resolved I will update this posting and let everyone know the results of my quest for even marginally adequate customer service.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/27/11<br /><br />Brookstone will not warranty this item because I purchased it from TLC Store (amazon seller).  Brookstone only warranties their items to the "original purchaser".  Brookstone told me that by purchase this item from TLC Store "you effective bought this item at a garage sale from the original purchaser so the warranty is null and void."  I purchased this item thinking it was "new" with a warranty to back it up.  TLC Store has a 30 day warranty, or so I am told.  This effective took the 1 yr manufacture warranty and turned it into a 30 day warranty from some gal selling stuff from her garage.  I sent repeated emails but only received two replies neither of them came close to resolving the issue.<br /><br />Bottom line, this item is junk.  TLC Store has done nothing to help rectify the problem.<br /><br />2 LESSONS LEARNED<br />  1.  THIS BROOKSTONE PRODUCT IS JUNK AND THEY ARE UNWILLING TO BACKUP THEIR PRODUCTS.<br /><br />  2.  ANYONE CAN SET UP AN AMAZON STORE FRONT.  BUYER BEWARE, YOU MAY BE BUYING STUFF FROM SOMEONE'S GARAGE WHO<br />  IS JUST TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK AND DOESN'T CARE IF YOU GET SCREWED IN THE PROCESS.

review/summary: Great idea, terrible implementation
review/text: First, the good;  Not having to run outside into the rain to check the temperature of what I'm cooking is genius.  It also has preset temperatures for the meat type you are cooking, be it chicken, fish, beef, lamb, etc.<br /><br />Now, the bad;  Aside from the Beef setting, there is no way to set what your desired cooking level would be.  For instance, if you want to pull the chicken out a little earlier than the thermometer recommends, you have to watch it constantly and not rely on the alarm.  For Beef, you are allowed to set rare/medium/etc.<br /><br />Finally, it stopped working after about four months, and nothing I've done wants to revive it.  We bought ours from Brookstone, and they haven't responded to our queries for help.  Two stars max.

review/summary: probe does not last
review/text: I have had my grill alert for a few years and have had to replace the probe about 8 times. The company will replace the probe if it's under a year old.  I have bought about four and the rest were replaced for free however it's unreliable as others have stated.  I recently got 2, after 2 uses one of the probes failed, I have a back-up because I expected this but I'm now looking for another brand. The company says the probes are sensitive but this is ridiculous. It's sensitive alright; to heat. Useless
