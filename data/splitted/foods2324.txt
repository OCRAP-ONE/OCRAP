review/summary: very easy to make in the microwave
review/text: i was real happy to finally get to try these noodles out. i used the microwave to cook the noodles and the little packet of dried veggies at the same time in two cups of water. after they finish cooking in the microwave pour off most of the hot water from the bowl and keep at least 7 or 8 tablespoons of hot water to use in making the sauce. after you add the sauce powder and the oil it will thicken. stir slowly until thickened. i really enjoyed eating them. the taste was very mild. there was nothing hot about it at all. other favorite items could be added to it to make it exactly the way you like it to taste. i am very happy with this purchase and there is nothing to lose if you buy this product. you could always cook the noodles and add the flavoring that you desire to it. i cooked a second bowl of noodles after i finished off the first one. i am so glad i bought this noodle product and it is very quick to make. mine was not salty at all.

review/summary: Delicious.
review/text: This is one of my favorite Korean junk food/quasi meals.  If you're not used to this product, it might be weird to you, but I find it delicious.  You make it like a typical package of ramen at the beginning but you leave out the "sauce" packaging.. which kind of looks like finely ground coffee beans.  Then when the noodles are cooked, you drain almost all the water, add the mini oil package and sauce, stir until you have a thick sauce and enjoy.  yum.  I am jazzed that Amazon offers this online, otherwise I'd have to drive so far away to Korea town to get it which is a huge hassle.  Yay for Amazon, yay for Chaps!!  I heart online shopping.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised!
review/text: This is an interesting idea for Korean ramyeon noodles: ramyeon (ramen) noodles served almost like spagetthi.  The flavor is not tomato sauce, but more like a sweet black-bean sauce or something similar.<br /><br />I tried one of these and was skeptical until I actually tasted it.  It doesn't look that appetizing, but holy cow was it good and with no MSG either.  This was a surprise hit for me, and I will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: not traditional chinese chajang mein
review/text: I bought one package just to give this a try.  I love chajang noodles.  I figured nong shim makes my fav instant noodle Neoguri, they probably make a mean chajang instant noodle.  Not the case.  This one lacks a strong black bean taste and is too sweet.  I can see how some may really like this but if you are thinking traditional chinese chajang, this is not it.  I would recommend Kung-Fu brand chajang if you are interested in a good one.  It is labelled as "soybean paste flavor, oriental style noodles" box of 30.

The flavor packet was flat tasting, with a bit of weird added in...can't even describe the unusual flavor.  (I've had black bean and like black bean paste, this wasn't the flavor here)<br /><br />I tried this with half a pack of seasoning, added Parmesan cheese (not a winner), tried plain (strange taste was more pronounced), and added beef (still hard to get used to).  I will just add the noodles to another flavor packet of ramen when I cook it and at least this box will be salvageable.

review/text: Flavor is a bit bland and something I'm not used to.  Smell and appearance is not very appetizing.  This is the only Nong Shim instant noodle I've had to throw away due to the taste.  It's probably just me not being used to Korean cha jang noodle (at least the Nong Shim one).  I'm more accustomed to the Chinese one where it's more flavorful/deliciously aromatic and not black.  I've had 5 other people in my apt agree that it's the worst instant noodle they've tasted from Nong Shim.

I'm sorry people, but you have some messed up taste buds if you think this is the best ramen you ever had. It taste very strange, like seaseme seed oil. It smells terrible. I should have never order this product and continued to order Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun. I really don't recommend anyone actually drink broth for It's a very thick dark fluid that stains anything it touches. It will probably damage your liver. Not to mention all the sodium and MSG. Now I don't know what to do. If anyone can tell me how to make it taste better please tell me so I don't waste the rest of these.

review/summary: Flavorless non spicy crap stick with Shin-Ramen!
review/text: Honestly I had never seen or heard of this type of Nong Shim noodle before, but I've been a die hard red packsge Shin Ramen fan since they were first imported into the US years ago.<br />It was on sale at local Ranch 99 Asian Market so I decided to try it. I trust Nong Shim to in the very least deliver a quality product.<br /><br />These quite honestly were the blandest non spicy packaged noodles I've ever tasted, and I even used less water to make the broth stronger. FAIL The noodles were the same as Shin Ramen. There were three little packets in the package. I'm guessing dried veggies or seaweed, a light oil and the broth base, looked like beef? (dark brown color)<br />This tasted like mushrooms to me. No spicy flavor whatsoever.<br />Not exactly sure what Chajang Noodles are supposed to really taste like, but I'm not a fan. This is what happens when you try to mix two different cuisines (Italian-Spaghetti) and Asian (Chajang) Epic FAIL!!<br />I'll stick with the good old Shin Ramen. Same price and way better taste in my opinion.<br />Avoid Avoid Avoid unless you just prefer boring bland flavor in your noodles!

review/summary: we're mostly nuts about this snack!
review/text: a local gourmet shop sells these for $3.50 each and just can't keep them on the shelves so I have to visit that store every week in hopes I catch the day he gets fresh stock.  since these sell on the web for over $5 each, I was thrilled when Amazon had them for almost $2 each when you buy a 12-pack carton.  I have only tried a half a dozen nutty flavors thus far, with my favorite being the Pumpkin.  However I stocked up on the Almond because they are very dense in healthy high fiber toasty almonds, just a hint of sweet and coconut, and you need only a few of these 1-2cm almond cubes as a snack to tide you over between meals.

review/text: My son has loved puffs since he was about 6 months old (now 11 months).  We use this brand as well as another, but feel this one has more flavor.  He doesn't seem to have a preference, but when my husband and I are sampling we prefer these since the others are a little like cardboard.  Puffs were the first "finger food" he tried and they really helped him to master his pincher grasp and be able to move on to other foods.  Amazon has these at a great price compared to individually in stores.

review/text: My 10 month old daughter absolutely loves these things.  I originally bought the gerber puffs and she liked those as well but we use the Plum Organics baby food so I really wanted to stick with the organic stuff so I switched to these.  The strawberry and beet flavor is one of her favorites and she can sit in her high chair and feed herself these with ease.  They are also great on the go.  If she gets a little fussy in the car or while in her stroller these are great to keep her calm.  I also really loved how they come in a 4 pack.  It is really convenient not having to go to the store when one container of puffs is gone.  Also the price is great!  This 4 pack came out to be cheaper than they are at my local grocery store.  Would definitely recommend these for your little one.

review/text: My daughter loves these puffs. I was hesitant to purchase them initially because the most cost effective option was a box of six. Luckily, she is crazy about them! I feed her an all organic diet, and I find these to be reasonably priced. I wish there was a variety pack option though. Also, she has just started to feed herself, and when she drops the soggy puffs on her shirt, they leave a red residue. It seems to wash out though, so it's not a major problem.

review/text: My 1 1/2 year old gobbles these right up.  He had a friend over & they plowed through an entire can.  He makes me eat some & they actually taste pretty good.  I like that they are organic & are a good for you snack.  He has severe food allergies & this is one of the few things he is not allergic to.  There's no dairy, no eggs, no wheat & no nuts.<br /><br />I would pick them up at Whole Foods or Babies R Us but Amazon has the best prices, not to mention it shows up at my front door.  So we don't have to have the mommy/baby wrestling match to get in the car seat, then in the stroller, then when he sees the puffs on the shelf & wants me to open the puffs at the store so he can start eating them NOW & then back into the car seat to go home.<br /><br />I did set up subscribe & save.  It's supposed to come monthly but it doesn't quite happen that way.  I usually have to come to the site & order more because once a month has been more like every 6-8 weeks.

review/text: We absolutely love these snacks for my daughter. When she was old enough to start the puffs, we wanted to keep her diet organic in nature and these fit the bill.  They seem to be delicious and she loves them.  She gets excited when I get the container out and they do taste great.  Kind of like fruit loops!

review/summary: Great munchies
review/text: My daughter was around 9-10 months old when I introduced her to these puffs. She loves them and for a while meal times became easier as I could bribe her with these :)<br />I'm not sure about the nutrition value they provide so would refrain from giving them in subsitute of a meal. These are great for snack time though. My child loves them.

review/summary: Power Puff for Digestive Health Leads the Pack!
review/text: Searching for a low-sugar wheat-free puff to offer my baby girls, I discovered Plum Organics with much joy. Clearly superior to all other major brands of baby puffs for digestive health, who's better than Plum for my family? I've successfully battled to contain a serious digestive disorder called Ulcerative Colitis for over a decade in part by special attention to diet. In that time I've learned even moderate amounts of wheat causes problems by creating an overgrowth of Candida yeast in my system. Some know this as a sensitivity to gluten or sugars, others suffer without realizing as so many foods contain wheat or high amounts of sugar. For me it's cumulative folks, a little in nearly everything really piles up. I notice my body getting too much as soon as I begin to heavily crave breads or sugars.  Before you know it, that gummy gluten renders me 90% incapable of absorbing nutrition altogether.<br /><br />Back to the Puffs... wheat is high in gluten, but the oat and rice based Puff offered by Plum Organics stands out with ingredients more gentle on digestive function. This is in addition to providing all the stuff HappyBaby remains conscious of, like sugar and vitamin content. Rice is gluten-free and minimally processed oat may be too, but many still leave it off the list of gluten-free foods due to typical cross-contamination issues with lots of wheat growing and processed alongside oats. Small amounts are ok with me anyway -- I'm looking for regulation rather than elimination here. So I'm happy to introduce all these foods to my daughters at healthy levels.<br /><br />How about the sugar content? Super low, and only natural organic fruit, vegetable or cane juice is used (not corn-syrup as another reviewer erroneously reported -- [...]. And can we really get upset about a little blueberry or sweet potato juice temporarily staining a cloth when you account for their health properties? Regulate, read the labels for yourself and take joy in offering your kids a simple, low sugar, high vitamin, low gluten snack.<br /><br />Oh and must say, I love that they're mainly just puffed air with a fantastic balance of nutrients. 1/2 cup or about 75 pieces per serving keeps my little dears engaged in motor development and feeding skills for a while without concern for dietary imbalance.<br /><br />Bunch of facts, all packed up to help someone out there enjoy a little extra peace next time they offer Plum Puffs to their kids.  Live well!

review/summary: Organic, tasty, but pricey and with sugar
review/text: This is the second brand of puffs we have tried, the first being the felicitous infant brand.  The things I like are that they are yummy (this is the only flavor we've tried) and the ingredients are all organic.  The other brand has a strawberry flavor, but the strawberries are not organic, which is important to me (especially for a baby).  But they are pricey, with a smaller tub being more expensive than a larger tub of the other brands.  Organic is not cheap, I guess.  Also, they have added sugar, whereas the other brand seems to be fruit-juice sweetened.  I don't know that that is SO much better, but worth noting.  It's probably also related to which one is yummy/sweet enough that my older kids will eat them as well (not that I want them to anyway, but I'm just saying).

review/summary: 4 stars for taste, 5 stars for being fat free
review/text: The selling point of this mayo is not just the taste, but it being fat free. I LOVE mayonnaise on sandwiches, and since I eat a sandwich for lunch every day, I tend to eat a lot of mayo. By far my favorite is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UQBL9Q">Kraft Mayonnaise with Olive Oil</a>, but when trying to lose a few pounds and cut back on the excess fat in my diet, regular mayonnaise is a fast way to just add more in. That's where this Kraft Fat Free Mayo comes in. Not only does it cut all the fat out, but it also tastes good. It's not as creamy or rich as original mayo is, but it still tastes great on a sandwich. It's not oily and still spreads smoothly. By just switching from my regular mayo to this kind, it cuts out several grams of fat from my diet every day, and it's been so worth it. In a world of hit or miss products that try to taste good while cutting out the fat or calories, this Kraft Mayo is a hit!

review/summary: More crumbs than crackers
review/text: I was really disappointed when I opened this package up.  Over a third of the crackers are already crushed or cracked or even slightly burnt on the edges.  I am using them for S'mores favor bags for a birthday party and it's too late to send them back and try to find other individually packaged graham crackers.  I had enough to do what I needed but what a waste of money on the rest of the damaged goods.  I guess I can make a graham cracker crust out of them.....

review/text: I must admit I was disappointed at first when these arrived. Having just been in the hospital and given grahams in individual packs I expected the blue pack of Honey Maid Graham crackers. These are the RED packs of the original graham crackers. They do taste great and only 60 calories a pack make for a nice snack when you want cookies but know you shouldn't.<br /><br />Great for lunches and keeping in the car and your purse.<br />Not a bad price with the subcribe and save. Those popular 100 calorie packs are usually 6 for $2.50+++ and these you get 200 packs.

review/summary: Not as good as they use to be ;o(
review/text: I had gotten these last year and they were not very good at all.  The receipe must have changed as I purchased a regular box and those tasted great!  So when I saw these individaul packages I just assumed they taste the same as a full size box and these do not.  I called Nabisco to complain and was told that each manufacuturing plant is processes differently sometimes as the equipment differs. I use to love these graham crakers but not anymore.  These were burnt on oneside, cracked and do not have that rich taste that they use to.  Nabisco has been around for years but at this rate, they will go out of business.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I forgot I had selected auto shipment and now I am getting yet another box that I never wanted to begin with.  Be very careful on what you select when it comes to shipping.

review/summary: product received in bad shape
review/text: I previously submitted a complaint with no response - the graham crackers came in all crushed and broken - I had planned to use them for a meeting or snacks and they were in too bad a shape to use.  Only about half were not crushed enough for a person to open the package and get large enough pieces to use.  The package should have been packed better to keep them from getting crushed.  I asked what kind of compensation could be made or another package be sent packed better.  I was very disappointed to receive them in such bad shape and more disappointed not to receive any kind of response.  I wanted the individual packages to pass out but that didn't work out. I wouldn't recommend these packages for anyone else to order.

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free cake mix I've found
review/text: I went gluten free in 2008, and my family has been testing cake mixes ever since, trying to find a cake they can make Mom for her birthday or Mother's Day.  Betty Crocker makes a decent chocolate cake mix, however, their box makes only 1 layer and requires 2 sticks of butter.  Also, their yellow cake mix is not very good, texturally speaking.<br /><br />This mix is much more economical; it states that the box makes 2 layers or 12-16 cupcakes. I successfully made 18 cupcakes with it (and could have made more if I hadn't run out of muffin tins!).  The mix calls for 2 eggs, a reasonable amount, half the butter of the Betty Crocker, and a cup of buttermilk.  I only had almond milk on hand, so I used that with some lemon juice to 'curdle" it.  I also followed the instructions to make it into chocolate cake.  Very easy, and the batter was the best tasting GF cake batter I've tasted so far!<br /><br />How did the baked cakes fare? My husband, who can usually tell the difference between a regular and a GF cake, couldn't tell the difference.  The kids all loved them.  They baked up perfectly, and the texture was soft and fine, not coarse or gritty.  This is now my "go to" cake mix.  I may even use it for the whole family's birthdays, so I can enjoy the cake as well!<br /><br />The other things I liked about this mix: no soy flour, no garbanzo bean flour (I am intolerant to legumes as well as gluten), and no dairy, so if you wanted to make it dairy free, using margarine would probably be an option to replace the butter.  Or even shortening, maybe.

review/summary: Great, versatile, reliable mix
review/text: Hodgson makes good basic cakes. Makes 2 round cakes (layers) or cupcakes. You can dress them up as desired. They bake well - no mushy centers. (Follow times on mix. They are right for their product.) Since I make these primarily for hubby, I freeze the second layer for later.<br />Note: Seal cakes up after cutting or they will dry out in short order.<br />They are GF, have no MSG or related products or aspartates. Good for the glutamate sensitive crowd.<br />Buy on Amazon's subscription plan and they cost about $3.57 per cake mix. Not bad for GF. I buy the yellow cake for everything. It has directions to make it chocolate so I don't need to buy those separately.<br />Very adaptable. Check out pics. Pineapple-orange-walnut cupcakes. Substitute 1/4 cup Saco buttermilk pwder & 1 cup OJ for buttermilk. Add Chopped fresh pineapple & chopped walnuts. Drizzle with orange-pineapple glaze. Make your own variations. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1L3Y">Saco Powdered Buttermilk, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a><br />Can be used for sugar cookies by adding a little sugar or frosting after baking.

review/summary: Tastes great!
review/text: I think these taste better than other non-gluten cakes.  perhaps it is the ingredients you need to add to the mix:  1/2 cup butter softened, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 large eggs, 1 t vanilla and 1/2 t almond extract.  You can make chocolate cake by adding 1/2c cocoa to dry cake mix and increasing the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups.  One box makes two 8: cakes or 16 muffin cupcakes.  Mix is cheaper here than at Albertsons and Whole Foods.  Hodgson Mill batch tests using an ELISA Gluten Assay test.  all natural, gluten free ingredients that are both additive and preservative free.

review/summary: Great product and right price through external provider
review/text: Allergy warning: This product contains cashews.<br /><br />After trying Artisana's Cacao Bliss and Macadamia Cashew butter, I wanted to sample some of the manufacturer's other products. As I am not opposed to pecans, I thought the pecan butter would be a good product to try. This product is made with just two ingredients --  pecans and cashews -- and I can say that this product demonstrates what a healthy, good for you food should taste like.<br /><br />Unlike Cacao Bliss, which is a solid product at room temperature, the pecan cashew butter is easily retrieved from the container. There was no oil separation and the product was ready right out of the jar -- no stirring required. One can take a butter knife and quickly spread the substance on a piece of toast or apple slices; the product is incredibly smooth out of the jar. When looking at the butter, you will see little pieces of nuts which makes this product product have some texture. The pecan butter is not as chunky as most chunky peanut butters; the chunks in this product are much finer. I found the flavor to be very much influenced by the raw cashews.  Unlike the macadamia nut butter, Artisana did a better job maintaining the pecan essence.<br /><br />It is recommended that this product be refrigerated for a longer life.<br /><br />While not noted explicitly on the product's label, I could see nothing that would contradict my belief that this is a vegan product. There is no milk, honey, eggs or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product. According to the product packaging, this product is "made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO's."<br /><br />This is my third good experience with Artisana products. For holiday gift giving, I'm definitely going to be packaging several of Artisana's products in gift baskets. They are tasty, natural and unique.  My biggest complaint with the product is that the jars are fairly small -- smaller than a typical peanut butter jar.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States<br /><br />Finally, a note on my purchase.  I purchase a lot of Artisana products through iherb.com. Amazon has begun to sell Artisana products (Amazon is directly fulfilling Cacao Bliss and the Macadamia Cashew Butter, at least at the time of this review).  Artisana offers many products but many are only offered by third party Amazon sellers.  These sellers typically want a premium price for what they are offering.  iherb.com offers competitive prices, free shipping over a certain threshold and thousands upon thousands of natural foods products and supplements -- many of which are not yet sold directly by Amazon or are being sold by third party Amazon sellers that are price gouging.

review/summary: Goji Gold
review/text: I decided to try the Goji juice on recommendation of a few people. I have tried it before, but with no regularity, so this time, I decided that I'd give this supplement a real trial. I've been taking it regularly for about a week. My basic observation is the juice does not taste, nor smell bad. It is pleasant to wake up and take my dose of Goji, versus choking down bad smelling vitamins and supplements. Score 1 for Goji!<br />Secondly, I do have more energy with the Goji supplement, however: It is no substitute for a good night's sleep. Also, sometimes it takes more than one dose to keep me going throughout the day. Granted, I've only been taking it for about a week. Lastly, I notice that if you take the supplement on the higher end of the dosage, you will not get a full 32 days out of it, which is something to keep in mind if you're watching your budget. Overall, not a bad purchase, and I will be anxious to see if the benefits from this product are cumulative. Good luck!

review/summary: A staple for me...
review/text: I started drinking Goji juice a few months ago, per the request of an acupuncturist, and ever since I tried it, I've been hooked. Supposedly it's a "blood builder," but don't expect super fast results for that function. While it might kick in eventually, it does take awhile, but the overall nutritive qualities of this food are near close to being unparalleled: it is a super food and anyone looking for an ULTRA healthy pick-me-up would do good to try this out. It is chock full of Amino Acids and many vital minerals and is deeply fortifying. It also adds a nice dose of Vitamin C, which is helpful in the cold and flu season. Drink to good health!

review/text: This juice holds a special place in my heart ...no really !<br />I had terribly dry eyes and thought that I would have to be putting in drops and running to the specialist for all time until the day I drank this !!! Yep my condition eased from day ONE.I took more than the recommended dose that day (maybe 4x the recommended dose)'cause I thought "Hey it can't hurt .It 's just fruit juice !"Since the second  day I have taken the dose, recommended on the bottle .As long as I drink this, I have no problem with dry eyes and my normally dry ,chapped lips are magically transformed  !It is a very pleasant sweet-tasting juice .I have tried other types of Goji Juice, but ,so far ,this is the only one, that has alleviated my dry eye condition.Love it ,love it love it .

review/text: Got 10 bottles from Vitacost about 3 months ago.  I mix it with the smoothie and give it to my son.  When I finished the first bottle and opened the second one, I found the juice was bad and tasted like vineger. I sent an email to Vitacost but I couldn't return them because it passed one month period.  I wouldn't know the juice is bad unless I open it.  I've had this juice for 2 years.  This is the second time the juice went bad.  The first time I got replacement but not this time.  You can also see the photos I uploaded.

review/text: This is my second time buying Goji juice from this account. The 1st 2 bottles I bought were red, sweet, and tasted fruity. The 2nd time I bought 2 bottles the juice was orange, tasted like a smokey rotten fruit, and the lable was different. I'm very disappointed because I thought if I bought from the same company, I would get the same product. How do I get my money back for this trash I was sent? I will never buy Goji online again. It's a great product but being stored wrong and sent to the buyer wrong. I'm very upset with my purchase. SUCH a waste of money. DO NOT BUY GOJI ON AMAZON!

review/text: I will have to give this 3 stars.  Now I'm a fried Vegie lover and I do love Fried Green Tomatoes.  But this mix did not do it for me.  I wanted to try this batter becasue of the name and the movie.  I'm from the south and I do love the southern taste.  But I have always used a dry mix when I fix my Fried Green Tomatoes.  Drop the green tomatoe in an egg mixture and then into a dry mix coating both side.  This was a wet mix you mix with water.  It had no flavor.  It might be better if you added Onion and Garlic and Celery Salt and some Ginger Spice.  But it need a little more then just dipping into the batter.  I had to try it to see if I liked it and I don't.  I really like Calhoun Bend Fried Green Tomato Coating.  It had everything in it and it was great

review/summary: Warning - Contains an Artificial Food Coloring that can cause health issues
review/text: I haven't had Thai tea in several years because the restaurants make it too sweet.  I purchased this one and a green tea version.  I had the green tea version and I developed a migraine that required medical treatment.  I totally missed that both teas contained FD&C Yellow 6 food coloring, also known as Sunset Yellow.  It is not listed on Amazon's description for this tea, but it is on the package if you look at the picture closely.  I later learned that it can have several potential health issues.  There have been calls for the withdrawal of Sunset Yellow from food use from the British Food Standards Agency.  The Center for Science in the Public Interest has requested the FDA ban it in the USA.  Sunset Yellow is banned in Norway and Finland.  I have gotten migraines from other artificial food additives, mostly artificial sweeteners and food preservatives.  I try to be careful, so I only blame myself.  I read every review, but didn't look at the photo for this one.  The green tea version had it listed in the description, which I didn't read that closely.  Its package had a sticker over the ingredients, so I didn't notice it before I drank it.  Beware before you buy.  If you are looking for a healthy drink, this isn't it.

I sweeten it with sugar and sweetened condensed milk and then add half and half, heavy cream or even just milk to it!<br />my recipe is 1/4 cup tea to 4 cups of boiling water and then after it steeps about 10 minutes I strain it and add 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup condensed milk and chill it in the fridge. When I serve it I mix it with half milk and a little cream on top. you can also add ice if you want to drink it right after making it or to water it down a bit. I make it in my french press. Its a great drink!!

review/summary: Will save you a lot of money
review/text: I love Thai iced tea, which is why I get excited every time I see it on a restaurant menu. But, I rarely get it because too often it can cost $3 or more which for a drink is pretty expensive if you plan on buying these frequently. So I decided to try my hand at making my own and saving myself some bucks which turned out to be a great decision. Buy this bag of Thai tea leaves, steep in boiling water, filter out the leaves with a strainer lined with a coffee filter, chill the tea, add condensed milk, put in a sippy cup, prop cup against your pillow, and enjoy your drink as you fall asleep at night without having to worry about spilling it when you wake up the next morning. It's affordable and doable. Only downside is that now that I can have it whenever the drink has lost some of its appeal since it is no longer a challenge to get. First world problems.

We made it 1tbsp tea to 1 cup water, with 1 tbsp sugar added in. We steeped this for 10 min, and then cooled it and poured over ice. Add in a splash of evaporated milk, and a spoonful of sweetened condensed milk and it was delicious.<br /><br />I'm just a little disappointed that the ingredients read "tea, yellow dye". Is all thai tea made with yellow dye? Or is there another ingredient that usually makes it this colour?

review/summary: SOURED ON THIS CHOICE !!
review/text: The case arrived with the pieces mostly broken and the confectioner's sugar "dusting" all moist, gummy and barely coating the cookies (most of the coating had fallen off). They looked gross, so they ended up NOT being served to guests as a light dessert. Some tasted stale even though they were (barely) in date. The lemon flavor is quite unnatural and the pieces of hard lemon candy baked into these "shortbreads" contributed to this very unnatural flavor. Not a plesant experience and I actually ended up tossing them after tasting the first few boxes. The fact that the shortbreads were broken--very few were whole cookies--added to the disappointment of this purchase. I can't recommend them for these reasons and won't purchase again.

Could someone give me the nutrition count on the flavored ones?<br /><br />The plain ones are:  76 cal,  2.5 fat,  5 carbs,  less than 1 protein,  0 fiber.  Serving size 3 to 4 cookies.<br /><br />On weight watchers these are only 1 point a serving.<br /><br />Thank You,  Eileen

review/text: Maddy's Key Lime Cookies are like the ones your grandma used to make, when everyone used real butter and really staked their reputation on the cookies they could bring to a gathering.  To taste one of these melt-in-your-mouth cookies is to travel back in time. If you want to give your family a really great cookie without baking it yourself, this is the one!

review/summary: It's key-lime-time!
review/text: If you're looking for something to serve at your next afternoon tea, you've just found it! These cookies are premium key-lime pie in finger-food form. The texture is light and slightly crunchy, with a moderately sweet and somewhat tart key-lime flavor. They're truly sinful and addictive. For this reason, buy these only if you intend to share, lest you'll find yourself devouring the entire box in one place.

review/summary: These may just be the best of these lemon cookies.  Try the Key Lime!
review/text: The flavor is more uniform than others, the confectioner sugar perhaps adheres better.<br /><br />Light and flavorful. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Buying in quantity enables simple gift-giving. The package is very nice and makes a good presentation.

review/summary: Great Taste
review/text: I've purchased the lemon, raspberry and shortbread cookies and liked them all. What I like the most about the brand of cookies is that they are not too sweet--perfect for my taste.
