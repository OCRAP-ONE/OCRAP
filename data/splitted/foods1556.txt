review/summary: A box on the table...
review/text: This product is tried and true.  Although delicious, the cereal's most astounding property is the calming effect it has on literally anyone who eats it.  You will find yourself, after enjoying a bowl of Gorilla Munch, simply laughing at jabs that may have thrown you over the edge on another day.<br /><br />And you know what they say, a box on the table keeps your jimmies stable.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone.

review/summary: NOT full of sugar, but delicious for kids and adults alike
review/text: A previous grossly uninformed reviewer, stated that this cereal is FULL of sugar (aka. evaporated cane sugar).  She / he could not be more wrong.  Here's a little educational, factual information (sugar content in grams, per serving size in cups):<br /><br />Gorilla Crunch:  9g per 3/4 cup<br />Mueslix:  17g per 2/3 cup<br />Abundance:  9g per 1 cup<br />Kashi - Go Lean  8g per 1 cup<br />Cherios Banana Nut  12g per 1 cup<br /><br />What you DON'T get with Gorilla Crunch, but DO get with most other non-organic cereals is (put your reading glasses on):<br /><br />Partially hydrogenated soy bean oil, malt flavoring, high fructose corn syrup, distilled monoglyceride, alpha tocopherol acetate, niacinamide, vegetable glycerin, "natural flavor" - yeah, sunflower oil, canola oil, pal oil, caramel color annatto color, soy lecithin, various coloring (which BTW is benzine!), freshness preservatives ..... and the list goes on.  Do people not read the Nutrition Facts on the back of the box anymore?<br /><br />The Gorilla Crunch ingredients are:  Organic corn meal, organic evaporated cane juice, sea salt.<br /><br />Add some bananas, strawberries and blueberries to this cereal, and you've got yourself the most wholesome, nutritious, healthy and delicious breakfast on planet Earth!  :)<br /><br />Decide for yourselves people, but do your due diligence and your homework.  Ignorance is NOT bliss!  :) This is a wonderful and gunk free cereal.  Do you not all wonder why cancer is so rampant now days?  Do all the chemicals and preservatives and hormones (in meats and dairy) and things we can't even pronounce not play their part in it?  Think again....

review/summary: Gorilla MUNCH!
review/text: I just wanted to point out a few things before I begin my review. Someone happened to complain that in the cereal there is no strawberries as pictured on the box. The fruit pictured on the envirokidz cereal boxes is just a suggestion of a fruit you can add to the cereal, it does not mean that there is fruit included in the cereal. Also I wanted to thank Sophie for pointing out the nutritional information, :). (and no I am not related to the makers of the envirokidz cereals) Okay, this cereal, as many people in other reviews have already pointed out, tastes like Kix. Has a nice texture, but since I am allergic to corn I can only have this cereal in small amounts and usually eat some of the other envirokidz cereals. I wish they would make a raspberry or cinnamon cereal. But this cereal is very good and you should try it! :)

review/text: We have switched to an all Organic diet for our son with autism and it is hard to find kid - friendly cereals. While I am not certain if the sugar content may be high as one reviewer disliked , it is an all natural sugar and not high-fructose corn sugar or GMO modified beet sugar - So I am happy and feel good about letting our little one enjoy this cereal!  It stays super crunchy in milk or soy milk...PLUS it is gluten free and my husband can enjoy it as well!<br /><br />:)<br /><br />(Also, this is not a peanut butter flavored cereal as some people have reviewed - it taste like Kix or corn pops)

review/text: I was hoping for, and expecting, this to be like Kix...however, it's closer to Cap n' Crunch. It's got that sweet coating vs. dry feel to it.<br />It's definitely not something I'd serve as a breakfast cereal(too sweet and not high fiber or protein), but it makes a convenient snack or special treat option. It holds it's shape well in a baggie so when we're out and about, I don't end up with a bag of crumbs in my purse come snack time for my preschooler.

review/summary: It's "ok"
review/text: So my parents were visiting and happened to give my 18 month old some corn pops.  I have never seen a kid eat things so fast so I decided to google an "organic" type of corn pop.  Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE the peanut butter and the peanut butter and chocolate cereals from EnviroKidz so I thought the Gorilla Munch should be good.  I still have 3 boxes left in the pantry.  My kids don't want it- it was kind of bland, I wasn't impressed with the "flavor".  I will continue to buy EnviroKidz but just not this type.

Well it was a big hit he loved it, but it is very expensive $5.00 a box. This is a great deal especially with subscribe and save.  It's still junk food, but without the chemicals.

review/summary: Organic junk food
review/text: When my toddler ate this cereal (about 5 times) the same thing happened each time: he loved it while he was eating, had an initial boost of energy right after having it, and then "crashed" and became irritable and cranky fairly soon afterwards (when the sugar injection wore off). This cereal is loaded with "evaporated cane juice" - also known as SUGAR. Calling it evaporated cane juice may sound healthy, but it's just silly. You can smell the sweetness when you open the box, for heaven's sake!<br /><br />Another reviewer commented that sugar is everywhere and exists in fruit naturally, which is true. However, when children eat fruit they are getting vitamins and nutrients as well as naturally occuring sugar. With this cereal there is very little nutritional value. Children need protein paired with this level of sugar in order to even out their blood-sugar levels. Again, I won't buy this for my child again. The fact that it is organic and pesticide free means nothing if it has an adverse affect on my child's day by not giving him the nutritional fuel he needs to play and be happy in the morning.

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.

Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.  I'm hoping they'll introduce more fruit flavors in the future.

I limit myself to less than 4 per day but have had stomach rumblings even after just one.  I dont know what is causing the stomach upset but I had to remove 2 of my 5 stars because of this.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  The problem with these candies is that they taste so good you have trouble stopping at just one or two.  Unfortunately, I polished off a whole box of them the day they got here.  After reading the review from the person with stomach cramps, I worry about whats in store for me but I feel fine so far.  They are quite good but they really should be limited to one or two a day.  Sugar-free doesnt mean calorie free and sugar alcohol in excess will have the same affect as real sugar.

review/summary: Sugar Free...? Really?
review/text: I love Werther's and these little buggers satisfy my sweet cravings without the sugar and extra calories! I have read other reviews and it just amazes me that some will eat the whole box! I think you can get a tummy ache eating too much of anything sweet. I don't care for artificial sweeteners with the recent exception of Stevia products. I had the big sugar free Werther's before and I could swear they tasted different. These are so yummy. The little box is perfect for purses or on the go.<br />I have not experienced any stomach issues and I will eat up to 3 one after the other (because they are just so dang delicious). I looked for regular (sugar full) Mini's and did not find them so I thought I would try these. I hesitate eating artificial sweeteners in general.<br />As with anything sweet or artificial or candy, I enjoy in moderation.<br />Now that I have read everybody's tummy ache reviews, I will crack up if I get a stomach ache. The power of suggestion is crazy. Some people may just not be used to the Isomalt or the Acesulfame. I just recently developed a sensitivity to RAW almonds due to the enzyme in the skin of the almond. I get horrible stomach pains that last 6-8 hours! So I feel bad if this candy does this to you. Everyone's stomachs/bodies are different.

The brine is not at all salty which allows the true flavor of the artichokes to come forth.  If you like artichokes, I highly recommend these as a simple, easy way to serve a unique vegetable at the table.  I don't know about you but actually peeling a fresh artichoke is daunting!  And the 80% waste from preparing a fresh one is disturbing.  To me, getting multiple hearts all prepared and ready to serve is fabulous!  I highly recommend this canned vegetable.

review/summary: Sooo good!!
review/text: I love this particular flavor of the Larabars (peanut butter chocolate chip). I've tried other flavors and this one is definitely my favorite! My 16 month old son's nutritionist recommended that we buy them for him for snacks and he loved them! I tried them and love them, too! Definitely recommend them.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: These bars are pretty filling, and taste very good. It almost feels like eating a candy bar, in fact, except much healthier. I don't eat these as part of a diet or anything, so I don't know if they are healthy enough to qualify for that. Most likely not though, since they do have sugar in them. However, they have a fair amount of protein and vitamins, so if you aren't looking for something especially healthy, these can make a good snack. I mainly use them as a quick meal in the mornings when I'm rushing to class, and they serve perfectly for that. However, if you're hungry, eating just one won't be enough, so they're no replacement for real food.<br /><br />But overall, for the taste, nutrition, and convenience, I think they're well worth having around for when you're craving a snack or simply in a hurry.

review/summary: Raspberry taste TOO strong
review/text: The taste of raspberry is pretty much all I get out of this.  I do not taste nor smell chocolate! The raspberry is too overwhelming which ruins the coffee.  Now I have 2 boxes of this which I'll probably never finish.  I love coffee and hate the fact that this flavor destroys the coffee taste.. and completely leaves out the chocolate!

review/summary: Tastes like licking a charred raspberry
review/text: Imagine you took a raspberry, drizzled chocolate syrup on it, and then put it on a frying pan.  You turned on the frying pan and let it sizzle for about 3 or 4 hours.  Put that in a coffee filter and brew it.  Sound good?  I didn't think so.  Thats what this coffee tastes like to me.  I bought a double pack, and I don't like it.  I tried to like it, and even gave it a second shot.  I wish I knew what to do with the rest of it, but I wouldn't subject my friends to this, so I can't give it to them.

review/text: Starbucks Caramel Brulee Latte (that's available around Christmas) is my favorite coffee ever.  I wasn't expecting this to be the same, but I hoped I could "doctor" it up.  It is actually very weak and with adding anything I just made it weaker.  I still have a whole box so I'll continue to try to tweek it, but unless a miracle happens, I wont' buy it again.

review/text: I was surprised when I opened the box and found that some of the K-Cups were not properly sealed.  Coffee was spilled all through the inside of the box and some of the K-Cups were obviously unusable.  This is the first and last time I buy this brand.  Although the coffee tastes ok, paying for K-Cups that go from the box to the trash can is a waste.  Very poor packaging... where's their quality control??

review/text: My husband loves the coffee, but this is the only one he's had that he has to continually clean out the machine because the cartridges don't remained sealed. The coffee grounds get inside the machine and in the coffee. After closer inspection, some of the cups aren't well sealed when they come out of the box. The price sounded good, but not for the quality and aggrevation. We will not purchase Van Houtte products in the future.

review/text: I just recently got a Keurig machine and I have tried out many different coffees. I have tried different brands and different flavors, and this one has by far been one of my favorites. I don't always like flavored coffees because I often find them to be overpowering in their smell or taste....but this one is just right. It smells great and the flavor is smooth and tasty. I was expecting not to like it before I tried it because I am not usually a fan of flavored coffees, but I was so pleasantly surprised with this one. I love it! I went through the first box very fast because I couldn't stop drinking it, so I had to buy more. It is one of my new favorite coffees and I am so glad to have found it!

review/text: I was looking forward to this flavor. I don't tend to like a very strong brew, but a nice light coffee flavor with a touch a vanilla is something I enjoy. This coffee was awful. The coffee reminded me of cheap Folgers with some international delights creamer thrown in. Typically that grosses me out, it's so artificial tasting and that is what I got with this. Glad it was just one in a variety pack and I didn't have money wasted. I think I'll stick to a good regular brew and add my own vanilla.

I do add sweetener, which may not be everyone's taste, but to me it makes the coffee taste like I'm eating a real raspberry flavored chocolate truffle.

review/text: I bought a 48 pack of this through Amazon when it was on special.  I normally drink medium blends and stay away from flavored but my wife likes the flavored coffees.  Her favorite is Pumpkin Spice from Green Mountain.<br /><br />What we found is the flavor of this was artificial.  I almost think it tastes a bit like maple syrup.  Too sweet...it would be better with less of the flavor.  I tried making it on the largest cup setting on the B70 but that just waters down the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the flavored liquid coffee creamers, this might be something you will like.

review/text: The name sounded great - chocolate raspberry truffle - but would it taste as good as it sounds? Well, I was impressed. This has to be one of my favorite flavored coffees, along with some hazelnut ones, even though I typically prefer unflavored coffees.<br /><br />UPDATE 2011-01-03: I don't like this as much as I use too... it's not bad, but I'm just not "excited" about the flavor as much anymore. Plus I find it leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. I'm not "wanting" it in the morning, instead preferring to desire mostly unflavored coffees - like "Van Houtte Caf&eacute;, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast)", which is really good... so I'm reducing my rating to 4 out of 5 stars.

review/summary: Pretty good!
review/text: I actually got this flavor for my husband who really does like flavored coffee, usually I'm not a fan of them. After trying a French roast K-cup in my brand new coffee brewer and being very disappointed, I decided to give this one a go. Brewing a cup with 5 ounces of water makes a very nice medium strength, vanilla flavored coffee that tastes pretty good in the morning.<br />Usually when I have vanilla coffee, I grind an inch or two of a vanilla bean that's leftover from cooking into dark roasted beans and brew coffee in a regular drip brewer. Compared to that, this coffee is a lighter roast but with a nice flavor, and the vanilla flavor is mildly sweet. This is a coffee k-cup I would serve without hesitation to my dad and I think my husband will love it.<br />Definitely planning to try more of Van Houtte's flavors.

review/summary: VH choc raspberry truffle k cups
review/text: recently tried the choc raspberry k cups.  I am not fond of the flavor.  It smells delish, but, definately not enough chocolate flavor for me.  I find that by combining a hot chocolate k cup, along with a bold coffee, I get the desired flavor that I enjoy.  For someone who enjoys a hint of flavor, the VH chocolate raspberry truffle k cups would be excellent. Thank you.

review/summary: Drinkable Flavored Coffee
review/text: A sample of these Van Houtte "French Vanilla K-Cups" were included with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a> and, sadly, it was fairly disappointing. This seems to be a "hit-or-miss" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.<br /><br />When made on the "Large Cup" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I tried all the samples in the box when I first purchased my kuerig but there was only 1 or 2 that I really took a liking to. I like flavored coffees as I'm not a coffee purist and found this one to be very good. The vanilla flavor is smoothly blended into the coffee which makes for a nice smooth coffee. This will be my standard coffee from now on.

review/text: We bought a case of these based on the positive reviews, but quite frankly no one who has tried it has liked it at all. It's a bit bitter, and the raspberry is tart tasting. Smells OK when it brews, but so far of all the people who have tried it (wife, myself, friends, relatives), no one has really liked it. So we have a half case of it sitting around collecting dust.

review/summary: Must have gotten a bad batch :(
review/text: I must have gotten a bad batch, Both the roast and the cup quality were poor.<br />2/10 cups so far have failed and dumped grounds into my cup.  The roast does smell great though. I like all the other varieties I have tried and I enjoy various flavored coffees, this box though, the flavor came out quite burnt tasting.  I bought it based on the overwhelmingly great reviews.  I will drink it but no one else in the house will touch it.<br />I am not impressed with this brand as there are much better ones listed right h  ere on Amazon.

review/summary: Great French Vanilla Cup
review/text: I've tried so many K-cups. The greatest problem I have with K-cups is many are too weak for me and I've never liked a "strong" cup of coffee. You know the one's that make your grow chest hair. I've tried many flavored K-cups but all are a milder coffee for some reason. However, I'm so glad I found this vanilla k-cup. I can actually taste the vanilla and coffee in my cup of coffee with this k-cup. I enjoyed my sample of this so much that I bought 2 boxes of 48ct in addition to the Hazelnut. I hope the Hazelnut is just as good.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this, but I can't
review/text: I love raspberry and chocolate.  I could live on Sees Raspberry chocolate truffles.  But this coffee, ugh.  Brewing it smells pretty nice, a bit fruity, not much chocolate.  In the mug- awful chemical processed cleaner/air freshener flavor (not that I am in the habit of eating those) but hot it just tastes artificial. It does have some sweet taste to it, but even adding milk and sugar do not make it drinkable.<br /><br />If I let it sit around (and really, I bought the Keurig so I could have coffee NOW when I wanted it, not in 10 minutes) and it cools, it becomes passable.  But only barely.  The chemical flavor dissipates and it is drinkable, but only because after spending that much on coffee, I feel obligated to.<br /><br />Spare yourself the torture, skip this coffee, unless you like the taste of lysol, then it might be for you!

review/summary: smells better than it tastes!
review/text: I purchased this product after reading great reviews on here.  I really like chocolate / mocha flavors, and was interested to try the raspberry.  Got the two boxes, checked the dates (sometimes an issue with K-cups I have found), and eagerly popped one into my brewer.  Smell was amazing and I was excited.  But when I tasted it, I was so disappointed.  Not strong on either the chocolate or raspberry fronts, and the coffee flavor was weak as well.  Now I am stuck with 47 cups I don't want.  I wish I could recommend these, but I must dissent against the popular reviews.  I realize everyone's tastebuds are a bit different, but these are not for me!

review/text: I've been trying to duplicate Baskin Robbins Capuccino Blasts for years. So I have come close using this Keurig coffee cup, then add a little artificial sweetener, a tablespoon of Hillsbrothers English toffee mix and a little heavy whipping cream. Once the coffee is brewed I mixe everything together and let it cool off and then stick the freezer safe glass in the freezer for an hour or so until the mixture is almost frozen. Then add some crushed ice and have a delicious cold drink. I am not fond of hot coffee, but love this refreshing drink when I need a pick me up.

review/text: I have enjoyed creme brulee on many occasions and thought that this coffee would provide a hint of that delicious dessert.  It has a strange and unpleasant aftertaste.  If, after tasting this coffee, someone offered me a menu featuring Creme Brulee for dessert, I would avoid it at all costs.  There is no flavor in this coffee that bears any resemblance to Creme Brulee.
