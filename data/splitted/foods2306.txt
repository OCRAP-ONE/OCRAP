review/text: This is the best drink to have over ice on a hot day..Really any of the Ice Tea's have a great taste to them. You make them as sweet as you want or add no sugar at all. My husband seems to be drinking more than me in the Ice Tea world which I find hard to belive.. Time to play catch-up :)<br />Its also a great drink to offer company instead of coffee, beer, wine, ect...

review/text: To start, I did receive a sampler of these as a BzzAgent but I am already purchasing more on Amazon since they were so delicious! It tasted fresh brewed and was extremely refreshing.  Perfect blend of tea and lemonade and light enough to please most tea drinkers.

review/summary: This is a first for me
review/text: Wow, I've never not liked one of the coffees or teas that are made for the Keuring...at least until now.<br /><br />Weak and flavorless and is the best I can say about this. You get neither a good tea taste nor a lemonade taste.  You do seem to get a bit of a bitter after-taste though. This may be due to  how much the ice cubes melt during production.  Frankly it is easier and less expensive to have a gallon of a good brand pre-made combination drink on hand.<br /><br />Brewed on 8 ounce setting as per manufacturers recommendation.<br /><br />*SAMPLE PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER*

review/summary: Best Tea Ever!
review/text: I love this tea! Although I'm a sweet tea lover, this tea is not too sweet but sweet enough to satisfy your taste buds. I used to buy it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, but they don't carry it anymore. It's not overly flavored with lemon--just the right amount. Out of all the teas and coffees I have, this one always runs out first.

review/summary: Daily ritual now!
review/text: After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about this iced tea.  Being an "Arnold Palmer" fan, I used to make my own at home.  A pot of brewed tea and store bought lemonade.  It was great, but it took some too time to make, and the store lemonade had a lot of sugar.  So, needless to say, when I got this, I immediately made a cup.  I found that the 6oz. setting was the best.  Everyone that has tried it, has really liked it, even the pickiest of my friends and family members.  I don't know what the "chemical" taste that some reviews are talking about, nor the fake sugar taste.  I like the fact that it's real tea, and that the lemonade side isn't too overpowering.<br /><br />I drink this probably at least twice a day now, and will keep it stocked in my Keurig pod holder!

review/text: I bought these by accident, but I'm glad that I did. I intended to buy the Southern Sweet Tea flavor, but clicked on the wrong product (I was shopping by image, saw the little ice symbol, and didn't even notice I ordered the wrong thing until it arrived). I decided to give it a try anyway, and I was surprisingly pleased with it. I will say that I think it needs to be sweeter (so I add some stevia or splenda), but otherwise I think it is pretty good. If you like Snapple or Arizona tea with lemon flavor, you will like the Celestial Seasonings Half & Half K-Cup.

review/summary: Is this rubbing alcohol?
review/text: I was looking for a good, alcohol free rum flavor to make daiquiri sorbet.  This is not it.  It smells like isopropanol, and, although I've never sampled rubbing alcohol, it tastes like what I imagine the flavor might be.  My wife made the face of a disgruntled canine when she sampled the sorbet and exclaimed, 'what is in that!'  When I followed the same recipe with an alternate rum flavor, her face illuminated like that of an angel and she stated, 'that is delicious, although could be a bit more tart.'  Furthermore, I contacted the company to obtain more information prior to ordering the product, and they never responded.  If you want an alcohol free rum flavor that actually tastes like rum, I would recommend looking elsewhere.

review/summary: Worse than cough medicine!
review/text: What a disappointment!  The beautiful jar and packaging was wonderful.  I kept it along with the other two varieties (peaches and apricots) on the stove top until Easter for a big Easter surprise.  When I opened the cherries and took a spoonful or two out to taste I was expecting something sweet and delightful.  Instead I had the most horrible tasting experience in a long time.  The taste was sour, bitter, and foul.  There was absolutely no sweetness to the fruit itself.  It is as if while sitting in the jar all the sweetness of the cherries had disappeared.  As for the vodka, I have never tasted vodka like that.  It was as if the vodka itself had spoiled.  Even if you put this on ice cream or add sugar to it, it is like trying to sweeten anti-freeze.  This is one of the most disappointing purchases from foreign grocery items that I have ever made on Amazon.Com.  I will probably just keep the Apricot and Peach ones for decorations and not even attempt to taste those.

review/text: This flour makes the 'BEST' Gluten-free bread in the world. Here is my recipe which is a variation on Betty Hagman's recipe:<br /><br /> Arrowroot (or Corn Flour) Bread '<br /> * 1 cup arrowroot flour<br /> * 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese<br /> * 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br /> * 1 cup cornstarch<br /> * 2/3 cup potato starch<br /> * 1/3 cup tapioca flour<br /> * 2 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum<br /> * 1 1/2 teaspoon salt<br /> * 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin<br /> * 1/2 cup dry milk or nondairy substitute<br /> * 1 large egg<br /> * 1 teaspoon cider vinegar (non-gluten)<br /> * 1/4 cup vegetable oil ( I use Spanish olive oil )<br /> * 3 tablespoons honey<br /> * 1 1/2 cups water (scant, at temperature suggested by your breadmaker manual)<br /> * 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) dry yeast''<br /><br /> * In a medium bowl, combine flours, starches, Potato Buds, Parmesan cheese, brown sugar, xanthan gum, salt, gelatin and dry milk.<br /><br /> * In another bowl, beat the egg slightly and add the vinegar, oil, water, honey.<br /><br /> *<br /> * Place in your bread machine in order suggested in the manual.

review/summary: Reunion Island is a fine coffee
review/text: Reunion Island SWP decaf is a nice, bold tasting decaf coffee. Drinking it you would be hard pressed to tell that it is a decaf and not a regular coffee. Just note that this is for pod coffee makers, like the Bunn MCP, Bunn My Cafe, Opod, Senseo and others. This is not for K-Cup or T-Disk makers like the Keurig or Tassimo. Some single-serve pod coffee makers may have a hard time with this coffee, as it is a 10 oz pod, whereas the standard seems to be 8 oz or less. This pod is problematic in Senseo makers, as they have a shallower pod holder. These will work fine in the Bunn or Opod makers.

review/text: I buy my coffe pods in three-packs.  I suffered through my last purchase because I mistakenly bought a coffee I thought was from the Blue mountains of Jamaica but was really just flavored coffee with a Jamaican theme, Ack (think cat with hair ball)!  So, this time I made sure it was NOT a flavored coffee.  I am glad to say this coffee is just what it says, coffee.  It smells good and tastes like fresh coffee.

review/summary: Poor customer service
review/text: I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one thing since I'd never ordered from them before.<br /><br />I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.<br /><br />I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective.<br /><br />NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Amazon.com.<br />Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on.

review/summary: Low carb diet for your cat
review/text: If you have a cat with diabetes consider EVO canned food since it truly does make a huge difference in their carb intake. My cat had been on insulin for several years and is now insulin free because of the change to EVO.  If you are a responsible cat owner eliminate any food that has grain in it for your feline friend.  You will ultimately save your cat a lot of health problems and it will be easier on your wallet with fewer trips to the vet!  It's not easy to get some cats to eat this food and it might have to be mixed with a small amout of another type, i.e. Wellness canned or pouch works for us and it's also grain free. Always monitor your diabetic cat's glucose levels especially if you transition from grain based food to food w/o grain.  This review if intended for use of CANNED food only NOT dry.

review/summary: Our Cat's Can't Get Enough!
review/text: I heard great things about this cat food by word-of-mouth from several people we know, so we decided to try it out.  Our cats, without exception, LOVE EVO cat food.  We even purchased a small bag of their dry food locally and they loved that too.<br /><br />I must say that we'll be buying this again and with the price of gas these days, Amazon is a great way to order this cat food and other items.  Everything shows up on your porch and no need to search anywhere.<br /><br />I did notice a negative review for this product.  With cats things can be a big hit or a big miss.  If you can buy one can locally to test things out with your feline friends to see how they'll take to it first, it may be best.  Or you can buy a small case and if it doesn't work please donate it to a local shelter as I'm sure they'll welcome the assistance.<br /><br />So far, feeding them EVO 95 percent meat, they still love it and ALWAYS show up at dinnertime two months down the road.  We've noticed that our cats' fur is softer too, possible a result of the higher protein content of this food.

review/summary: Good, but warm up first
review/text: Great food for my cats.  Gives them lots of energy, doesn't smell too bad in the litterbox.  Only thing is that it congeals when cooled and the cats won't eat very much if it's put out cold or cools off after it's put out.  I've found that adding extra water to it and heating it in the microwave so it's warm to the touch greatly increases how much my cats will eat per meal. (which ensures I only have to feed the cats 2x per day, and don't have to leave the food out all day to rot just to avoid being my cats constant personal chef.)  For what it's worth, I feed each cat about 3 tablespoons of this food, 2x per day.  So one one big can lasts one day for me. I have 2 18-month old indoor cats, about 10 lbs each. It's enough to keep them maintaining and not gaining weight, and have lots of energy throughout the day.  They do welcome their mealtimes though, and if I'd let them, they'd be a lot fatter than they are!

As they get older I will still feed them this, but might mix it with another premium dry food lower in fat, since the fat content in EVO might be a little too high for adult cats. The only ingredient I'm not 100% happy with is the potatoes they use as a binder. But I'd much rather have them use potato than the rice or corn most other dry cat foods do.

review/summary: Cats got very sick
review/text: Our Vet suggested that we changed our cat food to no-grain wet food. So we changed it slowly to grain-free 95% Chicken/turkey EVO by progressively mixing it with their old food for a couple of weeks. However, as they started eating mostly this food they got very sick and started vomiting after every meal. Our cats are not picky with their food as we have changed their food numerous times without any issues. Yet after they got sick they stopped eating this food all together. We changed the food back to their old type as soon as we realized what was happening and within a day they started eating again. If you decide to try this food, especially if your cats are not used to eating such high levels of protein, etc, you should monitor them closely and make the change very very slow.

review/summary: Best Spaghetti
review/text: Many whole grain pastas are difficult to cook, and come out heavy and/or sticky. Not this product. Easy to cook.  Wonderful flavor and texture. Extraordinary. It is to white-flour pasta as whole wheat bread is to white bread: More flavor, texture, and health benefits.<br /><br />I deviate from the cooking instructions slightly by bringing the water to a boil, lowering the heat, then adding the pasta* (and never return it to a boil). I usually cook for about 14 minutes, which is four minutes longer than the instructions, but at a lower heat.  I add sliced mushrooms to the water while it is cooking. After draining the water off, i add freshly crushed garlic, 2-3 tablespoons of heart-healthy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FLCOUQ">Nutiva hemp oil</a>, and basil leaf puree (when available) or rehydrated dried basil leaves (when fresh basil is out of season). Add a glass of red wine, some vegetables & sardines, a dab of raw sauerkraut on the served pasta, and this is the perfect meal.  And it's heart-healthy too.  I don't add any salt to the water while it's cooking, but do salt the pasta to taste when served.  Occasionally (rarely) i'll use a little tomato based spaghetti or antipasto sauce, but this pasta really doesn't need it.  Most pasta sauces contain sugar, and more salt than if you just use a salt shaker and salt your pasta to taste.  (Most people don't realize that sugar is metabolized to fat by the liver, and can be bad for the heart.)  Hemp oil has nearly a perfect ratio of Omega-6 to 3.<br /><br />I've been buying this pasta by the case for years now, at local grocery stores, when it goes on sale.  Just noticed that Amazon carries it.  Amazon's price is as good as most of the sale prices, so will probably start ordering it on-line and save myself the trouble of looking for sales and special ordering it from my local store.  I just bought four cases last week.<br /><br />_________________________<br />* I add about 1/10 of the package of pasta at a time, letting the hot water soften it so it'll bend in my pot.  I add each subsequent bunch of pasta in the same manner, but staggered from the other bunches.  Maybe this isn't necessary for this product, but it is a habit -- developed from cooking other whole wheat pastas over the years -- to ensure adequate hydration of all the pasta & prevent clumping.  I then stir the pasta about three or four minutes later, once it has softened up, to ensure none of the bunches have clumped (have never found this pasta to do so, but again habit).  I add the mushrooms about half-way through cooking, and stir once more.

review/text: I know whole wheat pasta is better for you, but I've always disliked its heaviness and chewiness - its lack of buoyancy. Then I found Bionaturae. Forget all other newcomers in the "healthy" pasta sweepstakes. This organic supplier of the Italian fundamentals (pasta, tomatoes, olive oil, etc.) is really good. The whole wheat pastas are a game-changer. They'll have you experimenting with sturdier sauces that complement their delicately nutty flavor: try saute&eacute;ing broccoli with bits of sun dried tomatoes, capers, pine nuts, lemon zest, olives, then combining it and the pasta with nothing but a cup of pasta water (add some dried currants if you like). Out with the white stuff and in with this more nutritious, more delicious Tuscan brown product. You won't go back.

review/summary: Best spaghetti ever
review/text: Unlike other brands that barely use 50% whole wheat, these spaghetti are 100% whole wheat, organic and absolutely delicious. I always try to stay away from the unhealthy white flour but I never imagined that, on top of being nutritious, these 100% whole wheat spaghetti would have such great taste.

review/summary: Good Whole Wheat Pasta
review/text: I hate whole wheat pasta.  I hate multi-grain pasta.  I'm Italian, and I want pasta made from seminola wheat.  And I want it cooked al dente.  No more than al dente.  Having ranted on about how picky I am about pasta, I have to tell you this is pretty good stuff.  I will cheerfully eat this 90% of the time, and celebrate very occasionally with white seminola flour.  Why be unhealthy if healthy tastes this good??

review/summary: I like this even better than semolina pasta
review/text: I have tried many different whole wheat/whole wheat blend pastas in the quest to eat healthier. With previous w.w. pastas, I often thought the flavor was not great, but palatable if used with a red sauce that masked some of the pasta taste. I would still use semolina pasta with white sauces or olive oil/garlic preparations. I tried this pasta after reading about it in Cooks' Illustrated, and it is as good as they said. My children, 7 and 9 years old, love this pasta. We use it in all of our pasta dishes; we even used it to make stir-fry Asian noodles and it worked very well. We have also tried bionaturae penne and fusilli, but did not like those products as much (we think it was due to the thicker pasta shape). I prefer the flavor of this pasta even to semolina pasta. Try it--you'll love it and it's good for you too!

review/summary: Never Knew What Spaghetti Tasted Like Until Now!
review/text: All my life, I simply ate the pasta that was prepared for me by my mom, friends or in restaurants; I liked it, but I didn't know any better. Then one day, I tried this Bionaturae w/w pasta that I picked up at an organic food store. I was blown away! So this is what spaghetti is supposed to taste like?!?! What is the tasteless cardboard I've been eating all my life?? Bionaturae is the only spahetti I'll eat now. Until recently, I was purchasing it at a local health food store which doesn't carry it any longer, so I'm getting it on Amazon which has turned out to be a fair bit cheaper. I eat my spaghetti with my favourite Italpasta tomato sauce and topped with parsley, dill, cilantro and romano cheese. YUM!

review/summary: There's wheat and then there's bionaturae
review/text: I thought I hated whole wheat pasta...I really did. The way it tasted. The way it lacked any sort of chewy texture and just broke off at the slightest pressure. The horrible things it would do to my digestive system afterwards, causing pain and nausea. However, I am trying to slow sugar release from carbs so I stuck with it as much as I could, barely tolerating a half and half mixture now and then.<br /><br />Then I stumbled across a website rating whole wheat pastas. I am ashamed to admit I never thought there was a difference. All of the dried white pasta tasted the same to me, so I thought whole wheat would too. What can I say, I'm a small town gal whose only access to pasta is what I can find on the Prego aisle. So bolstered by the reviews and affordable pricing of this brand, I placed an order.<br /><br />So glad I did! This pasta is fantastic. The taste, the texture...oh so good. Others mention a nutty flavor, and there is a slight difference in taste, but what I love about it is the texture. I can twirl spaghetti on my plate again and not worry about half of the strands breaking off before it makes its way to my mouth. And there's no discomfort or nausea afterward. I'm never going back to white pasta again. Cleared out my shelves and donated unopened boxes of Barilla and Dreamfields to the food bank. Bionaturae is here to stay.

review/summary: Made me eat whole wheat pasta for the first time!!!
review/text: I am going to start this out by saying I HATE (before trying this product) whole wheat pasta. I cannot stand to have a crunchy grainy texture to my pasta which before now I was unable to avoid with whole wheat pastas. I LOVE this stuff-it has a completely smooth texture that is the same as traditional white flour pasta and then a little bit of a unique tasta to it which I would describe as almost a little nutty or something but it is not very strong and adds flavor to your dishes. I had absolutely no problems with stickiness on my pan or the noodles sticking together too much-highly highly recommended. If you have been going nuts trying to find a whole wheat noodle that is edible this is it!! I absolutely am blown away that this is a ONE HUNDRED PERCENT whole wheat noodle and if you put it next to a traditional white flour noodle I would probably pick this one every time.

review/summary: Best Whole Wheat Pasta!
review/text: I had tried whole wheat and brown rice pastas in the past and found them horrible.  I read the recommended whole wheat pastas and this one top the list in all aspects.  I mixed half semolina and half of the Bionaturae Organic Whole Wheat.  It was outstanding is all I can say.  It did not break apart, could have used about 2 minutes more of cooking overall, but let it sit in my homemade marinara sauce and came out perfect.  I only use the best pasta which is DeCecco for semolina. I am so happy with this, so now we can eat more pasta while keeping our glycemic index in check. Thank you.  Forgot the most important thing, my husband was very pleased with this pasta!

review/summary: Best whole-wheat pasta out there!
review/text: We first heard about this brand of whole-wheat pasta on the PBS show, America's Test Kitchen. They tested several brands of whole-wheat pasta on the show, and determined this to be the best tasting whole-wheat pasta, the equivalent of the best of the regular pastas. As whole-wheat pasta is ostensibly easier on the endocrine system of the body, it is healthier for you than regular pasta, so we thought we'd give it a try.<br /><br />And I love pasta.<br /><br />We've made the Bionaturae a couple of times so far, and I can say it is our new favorite pasta. We've made it with a light tomato sauce, and second time with just some olive oil, garlic and parsley, all with the goal of really letting the taste of the pasta come through. The result? We agree with America's Test Kitchen; this is the best whole-wheat pasta out there! We will definitely continue to purchase this product.

review/text: I wish I had found this a while ago- I definitely would have made the complete switch to whole wheat pasta instead of only eating it with powerful sauces that covered up it's nastiness.<br /><br />Everything I didn't like about Barilla, 365, Ronzoni, De Cecco, and Hodgson's Mills is addressed in this.<br />It makes smooth, wonderfully textured pasta that I can prefer to white pasta.  It has a sweet nuttiness to it, much like how brown rice or whole wheat bread tastes a bit nutty but unlike some it doesn't overpower your sauce.  You can still have this with a little olive oil and parmesan.  You can still have this with fresh tomatoes.  You don't have to drench it in super garlicy marinara just to palate it.<br /><br />For years, I preferred whole grains over processed grains in every case except for pasta- and now I can be entirely and happily whole grain!<br /><br />I still want to try Bella Terra to compare, but no matter what I try I now have a WW pasta for a pantry staple.

review/text: Bee venom was used by the Egyptians thousands of years ago for various ailments, A friend recently brought back Manuka Honey with Glucosamine & Bee Venom for me to try, Bee Venom releases Cortisone & Hydrocortisone in the body, helping to heal and making one feel fantastic. Glucosamine, although wonderful in helping rebuild Cartilage, tends to also increase Cholesterol but that might be in much larger doses. I have never felt this good in my life, I started with an 1/8 of a teaspoon but was able to increase it to a full teaspoon in about 3 weeks. I recently bought 3 additional jars and have started my 2nd one last week. Bee Venom can sometimes have an effect on one's blood pressure, causing it to rise but in my case, I just lessened the amount I was taking and things got back to normal quickly. I test my blood pressure daily, just to be on the safe side. My Father, his wife & my wife are currently also taking Manuka Honey with Glucosamine & Bee Venom.
