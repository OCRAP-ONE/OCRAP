review/summary: Good ground coffee at a great value
review/text: This purchase was an Amazon "Today's Deals" that we took a chance on because of the price. We purchased three bags for $10.<br /><br />We brewed our coffee in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YY9X">Bodum Columbia 8-Cup Stainless-Steel Thermal Press Pot</a>, which we purchased from Amazon in 2007 (see our review!). The pot holds 34 ounces, so we started with three rounded scoops of Community Coffee. Later, we switched to two heaping scoops and enjoyed that, too.<br /><br />How does it taste? Well, Community Coffee is on par with brands like Millstone and Seattle's Best. My wife liked Community Coffee better than Eight O'Clock Coffee.<br /><br />We brew two pots each morning. We each drink a cup and then pour the rest in our own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009V4FM">Thermos Nissan 34-Ounce Stainless-Steel Vacuum Insulated Briefcase Bottle</a>, another great purchase from Amazon that has helped us significantly reduce our coffee bill - no more $4 lattes!<br /><br />Since the coffee arrives in ground form, it is important to use it up quickly and keep it sealed in an airtight container.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars.

review/summary: This is NOT smoked salt!
review/text: This salt is NOT smoked. Read that again. It is a 2 pound bag of white salt that has a fake hickory smell. It is small crystals, about the size of table salt crystals. My guess is that they tried to infuse flavor into the salt rather than smoking it. The hickory flavor is very faint, and very fake tasting. You are much better off buying real smoked salt, such as Gourmet Hickory Smoked Sea Salt by The Spice Lab Inc. I am not in any way affiliated with The Spice Lab - I bought their salt simultaneously with Faerie's Finest in order to compare the two. Not only is it inferior to The Spice Lab, but Faerie's Finest is the worst smoked salt I have tasted.

review/summary: These shrimp are really tasty!
review/text: I could not get over the fact that when I opened the first can.....it wasn't filled halfway with water.  Cans of small shrimp from most other companys, by the time you drain the can, are at least 50% empty.  This can was really packed to the top with tiny, cleaned shrimp.  They taste great and make a really great salad with the addition of a little lettuce, onions, celery, and mayo of course!  The price is a little more since you only get 6 cans as a case from Amazon but when they have the 40% off sale....it's worth it.  I will be buying these again!  I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Surprised at how good these are
review/text: These are definitely the best canned shrimp I've ever had.  Actually I tended to avoid canned shrimp, since it's usually a pretty icky product.  But I like shrimp, and I wanted to be able to have something like this on hand to throw into salads etc. conveniently.<br /><br />I was really surprised by these.  The can indeed is pretty full of shrimp, although of course is does have some fluid in it.  I suppose you could use the broth for something if you wanted to.  The shrimp are small, but they are also fresh looking, very well cleaned, plump, and smell good.  They have natural looking color tones, which canned shrimp usually lack.<br /><br />They taste very close to regular, larger fresh shrimp.  Granted they are canned and cooked more thoroughly than one would with fresh shrimp.  But even considering that, they offer a nice, full, true fresh shrimp flavor for a canned product.  They don't taste fishy, too strong, weird, metallic, old, salty, or any of the other negative flavors that other canned shrimp I've tried usually have.  The texture is also appealing, like fresh shrimp that have been chopped, so they have a nice, meaty but delicate texture - not mushy or rubbery.  The overall effect is that you are eating freshly cooked, nicely flavored shrimp that's been diced.<br /><br />It's nice to be able to keep a convenient canned shrimp on hand, since shrimp is such a healthy and low calorie, high protein food.  It's surprisingly adaptable too.  So far my favorite use is mixing the shrimp with hearts of palm, sun dried tomato strips, some mixed cooked beans, a few olives, and French dressing.  That goes together in about 60 seconds and makes a delicious and nutritious salad.

review/summary: The only flavor I like
review/text: This is the only flavor that I like.  For some reason the sweetness goes well with the the softer consistensy of the dried chickpeas.  I would buy this flavor again, but not the other ones.  These have a slightly chalky, soft consistency compared to nuts. I was expecting something a little crunchier. I love that they are beans and have fiber (6 grams). The #2 ingrediant is evaporated cane juice and #3 is brown rice syrup. And if you are watching carbs then nuts are lower. These have 23 grams total carbs and 6 grams sugar. The fat on the other hand is much lower then nuts - only 2 grams of fat. 140 calories for 1/4 cup so about the same calories as most nuts.

When I read some of the negative reviews, I thought to myself, "Well, I guess these people have never eaten roasted garbanzo beans before they do have a strange consistency," and I went ahead and ordered some any way.  It seemed pretty impossible to me that these could be messed up.  Well, congratulations!  They are horrible.  The person who said they were like chalk was 100% correct.  I have never made garbanzo beans at home and had them turn out this way.  They are like powder.  Yuck!  I wish I could return them; they are that bad and disappointing.  Please save your money, and if you really want to eat chalk, just go to the school supplies section of Target.

review/summary: Sweet Taste but Too Hard to Eat
review/text: I have purchased three brands of chickpea treats and loved the other two. However, I like the sweet flavors and The Good Bean is the only one that sells the sweet flavors without the variety pack. I am unsure if maybe the shipping played a part, because the beans were not expired, but they were rock hard. It actually hurt my teeth to try to bite and eat the chickpea. Maybe I just got a bad bunch, but when you pay so much, its a real bummer. But I do give credit to the yummy cinnamon flavor, it reminded me of a kids cereal I liked when I was younger, I think those toast crunch cereal brand.

Also purchased the Organic Pumpkin as an added supplement that I now add to his regular daily feedings and he's losing weight each month.  Initially weighed in at a hefty 52 pounds, now weighs 46.5 pounds and he's enjoying far more energy, delicious meals and an improved interest in active (interactive) play times.  With his breed having a 10-12 year life expectancy, it's amazing to see how at eight and a half years of age, he's behaving more like a lively puppy again.

After he potties, whenever he comes in from playing, whenever I come in from outside, pretty much any time the door opens & closes he gets a treat. He loves these (& the blueberry ones as well) and I don't feel bad about giving them to him throughout the day.

When i first opened the bag it smelled like fresh apple cookies so I was impressed. But its not the best training treat.

Now that that's out of the way, these apparently healthy vegan treats are hard (brittle might be a better word), have no enticing aroma, and are not appealing to my 2-year-old toy breed. I stupidly bought a bag of every flavor since the reviews were so positive and since vegan dog treats are relatively hard to find (I'm in Florida). Now I have 4-5 bags of these that I can't use.

Easily one of the best puppy biscuits available.

review/text: unfortunately my dog didn't love it. I was under the impression for some reason that it was a softer treat, which my pug prefers; when it arrived we found it to be a hard, sunflower shaped treat. The ingredient list is definitely a draw and the taste (yes, my sister tried the treat!) was good, just would not recommend for dogs that do not want a really hard biscuit.

review/text: A dear friend sent these to my dogs as a gift.  Both of my dogs (a lab mix and a pug/chihuahua mix) both thoroughly enjoy these Fruitables.  With the lab, all I have to do is pick up the bag.  I don't know how she knows, even before I open the bag, but she knows (even if she's in another room).  She'll wiggle, jump, shiver and shake until she's had her daily Fruitables.  I can hardly wait to try the other flavors.  I really like that this are all natural and healthy for my pets.

review/text: I have two Shih Tzu puppies with very sensitive skin and tummies.  I have to be very careful with everything I feed them.  I opened the bag and the treats smelled wonderful.  The treats are a little larger than the size of a nickel.  They were made with high quality ingredients.  Free from grains, soy, corn and artificial ingredients and certified organic.  My dogs love these treats and only 9 calories per treat so a few each day will not hurt their waistline.  I am impressed with this product line and of course support any company who produces their products in the USA.  I will definitely purchase more products from the Fruitables line.

review/summary: Awesome treats for your dog!
review/text: Before my boyfriend and I went to get our eight month old Boston Terrier two weeks ago, we bought supplies we would need beforehand. We picked up Fruitables Pumpkin and Banana treats because they were cheap and sounded like simple, good treats (I check ingredients). When I opened up the package, I was amazed at how awesome they smelled - they really smell like they could be "human" cookies! My dog LOVES these treats and it makes training fun for us. They also have the benefit of being good for digestion and are low calorie/high fiber.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />For those who have small dogs who can't eat these - I usually run a treat under the sink faucet for a few seconds to make it softer. You can then break off the "petals" of the flower-shaped treats to make smaller treat bits (which are also great to use for training smaller dogs).

And at just under nine calories each (4 cal broken), they are perfect for my Jack Russel who basically gets a treat for every event in his day. After he potties, whenever he comes in from playing, whenever I come in from outside, pretty much any time the door opens & closes he gets a treat. He loves these and I don't feel bad about giving them to him throughout the day.

review/summary: These smell great, and my dog says they taste good.
review/text: I'm always looking for new dog treats to keep my beagle-daschund and black lab spoiled. And although they aren't very picky about taste, I am picky about ingredients.<br /><br />The Fruitables Pumpkin and Apple treats smell great. The ingredients are simple, they're made in the USA, they contain no animal products or by-products (though that's not true for all of the treats from this company), and they don't contain many of the common allergens found in dog treats (wheat, soy, corn).<br /><br />Be aware that these treats are small (a little too small for my 90-lb lab who doesn't even realize he has eaten something when he gets one of these). And they're hard (my beagle-daschund crunches through them with a little work, but a very small dog might not be able to eat these).<br /><br />Overall, a good treat! I think the best dog treat so far, however, is The Lazy Dog Cookie Co Inc Coconut Carob Chip Pup-squeaks, which are unfortunately out-of-stock right now on Amazon. The Fruitable treats are a close second.

I wanted to eat them they smell so delicious - like fresh baked pie or something.  Wonderful ingredients so I probably could have eaten them!  Dog loves them and since he's a puppy, they are a good size treat for him.  NOT a good training treat though...  they are crunchy so they take a bit to chew.  Soft treats are better for training so I intend to try the soft mango treats in this brand.<br /><br />Price is excellent on Amazon - at least 1.50/bag cheaper here than I can get locally.

The pups absolutely love them, and the ingredients are top notch.<br /><br />I ordered these to complement Zuke's Mini Bakes and Mini Naturals as training treats.  I break the little "petals" off, with the occasional "full flower" bonus.<br /><br />My personal opinions regarding the three:<br />Fruitables -> Dogs love 'em and top notch ingredients.  Maybe a bit big for training if you don't break them up.<br />Mini Naturals -> Dogs love 'em and great ingredients.  Perfect size for training, but contain gelatin which I like to limit.  Priced perfectly.<br />Mini Bakes -> Dogs like them.  Good size, great ingredients, but a bit more plain.

review/text: I can't deny that these smell amazing- all the fruitables that I ordered smelled like human-counterpart treats...blueberries, yum.<br /><br />I was excited to give my dog a "real" treat, and I have him one of this and one of another fruitables soft chew. A few hours later, we were shocked at the dog spitting up everything in this stomach- he threw up about 3 times, and then continued to spit up mucous and bile fluid. Gross, and really unfortunate :(<br /><br />I contacted both fruitables and amazon, who both graciously accepted the open bags as returns, and fruitables checked the lot numbers of the bags I had. I guess my dog had a particular sensitivity to something in these, which stinks because I really wanted him to love these nice smelling treats.<br /><br />Hopefully others have better luck with them!

review/summary: Treats break into perfect pieces for my pup
review/text: I bought these treats because they looked liked they could break into suitable pieces for my pup.  And they did.  Just by hand you could break it down to each leaf of the flower that the treat is shaped to be.  A 7oz bag comes with about 90 treats at ~9 calories each.  I usually break each one into 3 pieces (2 leaves each) and it's a good size for my 20lb pup.  After reading the ingredients, I was under the impression that they'd be kinda chewy but they're baked and hard/crunchy.  The pup takes about 8-10 seconds to finish each 2 leaf piece which is sometimes a little long when trying to train commands and etc but I just break the treats down even more if I need her to eat faster.  The flavor I bought, Pumpkin and Apple, smells great and they don't leave crumbles in my pocket when we're on the go.<br />One thing I should add though is that if you break the fruitables treats into pieces, you'll notice that they're pretty fibrous.  On several occasions my pup's had to cough/clear her throat after feeding her one of these.  But it's not a big deal she loves these treats.

review/summary: Yummy snack
review/text: My 8 pound Havanese loves these. I literally just got her yesterday but she eats these happily. I read the reviews about how delicious these smelled, and they do seem tempting. The flavors and ingredients are great. I am doing a mostly grain free diet with her so these are perfect. And the size is great for training. I break one up with no problem.

review/summary: Puppy was pleased with these :)
review/text: I bought these for my dad's new black lab puppy for a 'father's day' gift. He LOVES them and as a puppy, we were worried that his stomach would be fussy when eating something new like this. So far, no problems and my father now is on the hunt to find a place that sells these in his area. They are also small enought to be used as a training treat.

review/text: This is a nice, small snack for my dog.  Especially in the evening, when I get myself a little snack - I can get one of the Fruitables for my dog so he doesn't bother me for my snack!  They are very cute too - shaped like a flower.  Looks like Fruitables will be a staple snack for my dog.

review/summary: My dog loves these!
review/text: First off, my dog has some major stomach issues. It seems like we're always trying to find good treats for him that won't cause him to get loose stools. This is our grand winner! We started with the pumpkin and apple, and then went to the pumpkin and cranberry and, most recently, the pumpkin and blueberry. He loves all three! Major perks? They are made in the USA, they are all natural, and they smell SO GOOD (my husband tried them and says they also taste good, especially the blueberry)!

review/summary: My puppy goes crazy!!!
review/text: I saw these treats online and was going to order them but I went to my local grocery store and they had them there for a 1.00 cheaper. I brought these home and my cocker spaniel puppy has been going crazy for them ever since. He gobbles them up. He even starts to cry and whine when I open the bag because he wants it so bad. I'm glad its a healthy option for him. He loves the pumpkin/banana ones better then the pumpkin/apple. I haven't tried the others because I know that cockers can be sensitive to allergys. I also saw the chewy ones at the store as well so I will try those and update my review.

review/summary: good smelling, but one of my dogs had an allergic reaction
review/text: My family has four dachshunds and they all gobbled up these treats. One of my dachshunds developed an allergy to these treats after I went through 2 bags. He got hives and this throat swelled up. We caught it fast and got him to the vet. He had to take benadryl  for a few days. He's just fine now, but I can't risk feeding my dogs these treats anymore.<br /><br />Before anyone questions, I know they were these treats because he had one small reaction before the big one. The big reaction was right after I fed one of these treats and  he had no other treats as these were the only ones that I had on hand.

review/summary: One of my favorite treats for my dog!
review/text: Not only are these "low" calorie but they smell absolutely great! The aroma of each treat is significant every time you open the bag.<br /><br />These may be too small for big dogs (labs) and too big for small (chihuahuas). These are about the size of a quarter and about 1/3 inch thick. My dog, Max, is a pit/lab mix. He, sometimes, swallows them whole but will chew them when he takes his time.<br /><br />I love that there are no fillers and they are affordable. Plus I know how many calories I'm giving to Max with these treats.<br />I've bought all of the flavors and they are all great! I can honestly say that these are one of my favorite treats!

review/summary: Great treats, but hard to split into smaller pieces
review/text: These treats are great, and my dog really likes them (although he doesn't like them as much as meat-based treats). The only problem I have is that I've been using them for training my small dog, and will be using them to train the puppy we're getting soon, and they're very difficult to break into smaller pieces. They tend to break unevenly and leave a lot of crumbs.

review/summary: Healthy pet treat
review/text: I have two dogs, a Lab and a Chihuahua.  These were a big success with my Chihuahua and he gets super excited any time he hears the bag so much as move and he wolfs them right down.  But he is a food-obsessed dog and I rarely encounter something he'll turn down.  My Lab doesn't care much for them, but she doesn't like crunchy treats much anymore (she's older).  They are made and sourced in the USA and "free of wheat, corn, soy and artificial ingredients, colors or preservatives."  The ingredients are in this order pumpkin, organic oatmeal, pearled barley, potatoes, oat fiber, canola oil, brown sugar, bananas, cinnamon, natural flavor, vanilla, mixed tocopherols.  The package says under 9 calories per treat, about 90 treats per pouch (so they'll last a long time.)

review/summary: We all wish we could eat a Fruitable.
review/text: It's the best treat ever... for appealing to humans.  Everyone where I work says this is the only dog treat they wish they could eat.  It smells, FABULOUS.  I mean, I've smelled a lot of dog treats.  I promise you, upon opening this bag, you'll go, "Wuhhh?" and take a deeper sniff.<br /><br />These are not always such a sure-fire hit with the dogs, however.  Some really go for them.  It's about 60/40, the haters & the lovers.  I honestly wish more dogs liked these, because they make my training pouch smell SO much better than those stinky chicken & cheese nuggets I'm often stuck handing out.  Honesty, however, compels me to admit I am often more in favor of these treats than the dogs.<br /><br />However; I emphasize that *some* dogs did quite like these.  They're a good fit for Kong stuffing and puzzle toys.  They're not a guarantee, but if your pup likes fruit, he will probably enjoy these.

review/summary: I thought they were bland
review/text: Yes, I did try one. They taste very bland, actually, to me they had very little flavor. But my rabbits and the dog love them. Kind of expensive but if you get them at the $1 per bag rates you are getting a big bargain even with the shipping and handling. I actually ordered some treats from a different business that sells bunny treats and found it was this same product repackaged, a smaller amount in the bag and a bigger price. So I checked Amazon and found that the identical items were sold as doggie treats in a bigger bag and less cost. On top of that nice savings (I don't have a car at the moment so I can't drive to the pet store)the animals fight each other to be first in the handout line. I wish I could get the recipe for them. And, I'd like to buy them in a 5lb bag. Does anyone sell them that way? They'd make a nice doggie Christmas present.

As he has kidney disease, it is very important that his treats are low in protein and fat, and these treats follow the specifications of what we should be feeding him perfectly! As other reviewers have mentioned, they smell so good it's hard to believe they're not meant for human consumption... I haven't had the nerve to actually try one... yet. I would highly recommend them!

She won't eat some of the obvious, more common snacks (sweet potato strips for example) and finding Fruitables has been great!!! They actually stimulate my 16 year olds appetite.  And, they are so inexpensive!!! After spending a fortune at the boutique stores, Fruitables are quite a find.
