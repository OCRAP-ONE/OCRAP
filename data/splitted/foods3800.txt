review/summary: Demi-Glace
review/text: Fist let me say that I am not a gourmet cook. I like to cook and wanted to try a new recipe from the Williams-Sonoma catalog. The recipe called for Demi-Glace and since I had no idea what that was, I did a web search and found both a recipe and the ability to purchase. Purchase was definitely the way to go. This configuration, multiple, small containers was certainly preferable to a large jar I might never get the full use of before it spoiled. The 1.5 ounce package held just slightly more than the recipe called for and, since the meal received rave reviews did what it was required to do. Until opened these do not require refrigeration and store easily in the kitchen cabinet till needed again. This added such an excellent flavor to the sauce i'll be tempted to up the ante and use this in basic gravy. Good product that delivered as advertised.

review/summary: Organic but Dry
review/text: The ground coffee comes in a 3 pack and in the first shipment it was leaking from the bags into the shipping box.  It was due to the packaging by the Canano Island manufacturer.  I went online with Amazon and reported my problem and they sent a whole new 3 pack all shrink wrapped to prevent spillage.  Amazon also said that I should keep the first shipment.  The coffee for me is ok but not great.  Its packaging is mostly paper and does tend to leak and I think causes the dryness of the product unlike the organic coffee I previously purchased from Amazon ---- Caf&eacute; Altura Organic Coffee, Biodynamic French Roast, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag.  The Cafe' Altura coffee was fresh with rich oils and was fabulous.  The Camano Island product does not have that kind a fresh and vital look and smell.

review/summary: But is it ROOT Bark??
review/text: This ad indicates root bark, and the item on the invoice as received says root bark.  The invoice item number matches the label, and the company says there is only the one sassafras product.  But since the actual label on the mylar bag says "sassafras bark", what do I have?  Root bark or bark?  I am assuming there's a difference, and we'll find out when I prep my root beer extract.  A needless worry maybe, but since sassafras root is hard to find due to the probably bogus safrole rigamarole, this makes me suspicious.  Hence, for the confusion, three stars only for the prompt delivery and a 800 customer number that answered the phone after 5 pm (even if the agent couldn't answer my question).

review/summary: Easy mango - no peeling
review/text: One of Hubby's favorite recipes is quinoa-mango salad, but I hate peeling fresh mangoes. It took a long time to find the large can after our grocery store dropped them. They are more expensive than fresh mangoes, but since I cook almost everything from scratch they are a great time saver.<br />Mangoes are solid and in good shape. I add the juice to the water in which I cook the quinoa. Covers some of the strong quinoa taste.<br />They are GF, have no MSG or related products or aspartates.<br />Wish they came on the subscription plan. You can get free shipping if you have something elso to order to go over $25.

review/summary: Better tasting than those expensive beans
review/text: I bought these beans at the same time I got a soymilk machine. The machine came with some fancy Laura beans that bragged about being the ultimate soymilk beans. They were okay but I had heard how awesome the taste of fresh homemade soymilk was and those fancy Laura beans just were the same taste as the milk in the packages.  So when I got these much cheaper beans in the mail I was a bit worried about my decision to buy them.  Then I made some soymilk and WOW! I love these beans!  I don't know if they are fresher or if it's the type of bean or even the soil differences but you can really taste a difference. I'm so happy and hope that they will still be available at this price when I am ready to buy more. I refuse to pay a lot for soybeans when they are so cheap on the market. Soybeans are not a crop that should cost much more for the organic version. I'm not buying the hype that I have to pay 3 times more for an organic soybean. I was glad to find these reasonably priced organic soybeans in bulk.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: About twoyears ago, I switched my now seven-year-old Doberman from Nutro Natural Choice Dry Dog Food (I posted a review of that product prior to the FDA recall in April 2009) to this product due to the rash of pet illnesses and deaths in the US and Canada linked to Nutro's canned food. (This made national news. In case you aren't familiar with the story, I'm sure the news reports are archived online.) I didn't feel comfortable taking chances with the most helpless member of my family. Luckily, she switched to Blue Buffalo with minimal fuss. I've purchased the Chicken and Rice as well as the Lamb and Rice versions of the product and she loves both equally. However, she will not eat the versions (canned or dry) that contain a major amount of sweet potato, but she is a rather picky puppy. There is (for her) one small drawback with this food; she tends to eat around the "Lifesource bits" initially. Eventually though, she does come back to them.<br /><br />The most important part for me is that she's as healthy and as happy as she's ever been. Even at seven, she still plays like a puppy. At her last vet check (January 2011), the vet was thrilled at how great her teeth looked, praised the shine and texture of her coat (super shiny and soft as silk) as well as her high energy level. I write these comments because on the rare occasions that I've run out of her food and had to purchase another brand (other high end, vet recommended brands - my dog is very spoiled and always eats well), within two - three days her coat starts to dull and she doesn't seem as playful as is her norm.<br /><br />I'm sorry for the long review on dog food, but my Dobie is as much a part of my family as any of my human family. I'm extremely cautious of the food, treats, and chewy bones that I purchase for her. She has been, and continues to be the best of companions even if she is spoiled. This dog food is a bit more expensive than some others are, but to me it's worth it if it keeps her healthier longer.

review/summary: Switched to Blue Buffalo and haven't looked back
review/text: Our Yorkie/Pekingese became very ill last summer. She was lethargic for weeks before she began vomiting and had blood in her stool. We're careful to never let her into the garbage or anything toxic and we never feed her any human food, so we took her into the vet with the suspicion that maybe she had lodged something in her system from being outside on the lawn.<br /><br />The vet said she checked out fine, so we were clueless. A friend mentioned that his dog had similar symptoms before he changed her food. We thought there was no way a dog's food could cause such dramatic symptoms in a dog, and our dog was far from a picky eater, so we were a bit weary about the advice but we gave it a shot anyway since our dog was miserable. He recommended Blue Buffalo for its more natural ingredients, so that's the route we took.<br /><br />It has been over six months now and we haven't looked back. Phasing the new food in slowly, she stopped vomiting within days, and had considerably perked up within a week. Some days she has so much energy that it even surprises us. The only thing we did was change her food. Our educated guess was that she was having an allergic reaction to one or more of the synthetic ingredients in the Iams that we were feeding her.<br /><br />To us, the extra price paid to get Blue Buffalo is well worth it to feed our dog a more healthy food.

review/summary: Great food, my dogs love it
review/text: I tried Blue Buffalo on the recomendation of an agent when I adopted my rescue. I never thought that a premium food would make such a difference though. The ingredients are pretty straight forward and the more I learned about how dog food is made the more amazed I was a BB for how they make their foods. For one I love the fact that I feed about half of what I would feed my dogs using normal dry foods, which makes the bag last twice as long. Also I can tell the difference in their health, they are more active and having a sheltie with a sensitive stomach I was amazed at how dramatic the decrease in incidents related to his digestive problem we had. As a fact, since I switched we have only had 2 this year (mainly because someone didn't follow the no table scraps rule) where with other regular and even higher end foods we had issues once or twice a week even if he did not get anything outside of his regular kibble.

It's always nearly but not quite $20. I dont think it ever did. This may be false hype. Take your time and investigate what is best for your pet based on activity level, age, ext. More than likely you will already have your dog on another dog food and have plenty of time to decide what's good for transition.

Although the plants came in 4" pots, they are robust, healthy plants and will soon be large enough to be transplanted into larger decorative pots and set out for display and enjoyment. And as they thrive in average household lighting, I will put them throughout our home to brighten each room and help clean the air. I will be ordering from Hirt's again and would recommend this vendor to everyone.

review/summary: Love this - on steaks at least.
review/text: I originally purchased this as a close-out item in my local bbq store.  Took it home and fell in love.  It gives me the flavor on the steaks that I have been searching for a long time.  The garlic and onion are not over-powering and it just makes the meat taste meatier.  We did mix a little into some burgers but didn't care for that as much.  Since my local bbq store isn't carrying this anymore I turn to Amazon for my fix.  Slightly more expensive, but I just can't do without it for steaks anymore.

review/summary: Absolutely Great (Quote me)
review/text: Char-Siu, also known as Chinese barbecue, is really a Cantonese delicacy.  Most non-Cantonese Chinese rarely consume it and certainly do not cook it.  Char-Siu is ever slightly crunchy outside and is moist and tender inside.  The sauce is sweet and tangy with a touch of saltiness to it.  It is different from the American Southern barbecue which is slow smoked for hours, nor it is like the Coastal barbecue which is grilled on direct flames for minutes.  It sits in between.  The cook time is about 1-2 hours.  The cooking temperature also sit in between the Southern and Coastal barbecue.  You can eat it by itself.  You can eat it as part of a meal.  Of course, it is THE essential ingredient of the infamous Char-Siu Bao (Chinese BBQ pork buns).  When you eat a real good Char Siu, you just want to run home and kiss your mom.<br /><br />I am born and raised in Hong Kong.  I have tasted countless authentic Char-Siu for decades.  I know how to make my own Char-Siu sauce from scratch, but it takes time.  I still encourage people to at least make their sauce once, just to appreciate the ingredients.  There is no absolute recipe for Char-Siu sauce, but it must contains sugar, vinegar, honey, salt and soy paste.  Some people make their Char-Siu sauce from Hosin sauce since they share many ingredients.<br /><br />This Lee Kum Kee Char Siu Sauce is authentic -- not because I say so, but because its existence proves its authenticity.  Lee Kum Kee is a very famous Hong Kong brand which dedicates in making sauces.  Its trademark staple product is the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016UX1E">Lee Kum Kee Premium Oyster Sauce, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a>.  Actually, that is an understatement.  Oyster sauce, in fact, is invented by Lee Kam Sheung, who then founded the company: Lee Kum Kee.  (Oyster sauce is another product mostly enjoyed by Cantonese Chinese).  This company made its sauces to satisfy Hong Kong residents who do not have time to make their own sauces.  These Lee Kum Kee sauces would have never survived if they are not authentic and accepted by the Hong Kong residents.<br /><br />I uploaded two pictures of my Char-Siu made with this sauce as customer images.  By no mean, my Char-Siu is perfected.  However, I hope to show that one can achieve good Char-Siu by using this sauce as the main ingredient.<br /><br />I have used this Char-Siu sauce for more than 15 years, and have also tried other brands in between.  I encourage others to try other brands as well.  Lee Kum Kee Char-Siu sauce is not the only good one out there, but it is definitely one of the best.

It was so bad, I kept it to let my friends taste and share my worst drink experience ever. After tasting this, I immediately went online to see all of the hilariously bad reviews. It's labeled a Thirst Quencher. It's more like a gateway drink because it makes you want to immediately drink something else to get the taste out of your mouth. The #1 ingredient should say vomit because that is what you are highly inclined to do. This is worse than cancer.

review/summary: Try a bottle locally first...
review/text: After seeing this lemonade recommended in a health magazine I decided to see if it was as good as they said it was. After reading other's opinion I decided if it was that bad I'd have to try it for myself.<br /><br />I'm a fan of stevia. I drink stevia sweetened beverages all day long so I know what it is supposed to taste like. To me it is almost as good as sugar. The stevia used in this drink seems fine and didn't have an awful bitter taste. You can get various types of stevia and this one seems perfectly sweet.<br /><br />I think the problem with this "lemonade" is that it also has lime juice in it. That is what I'm tasting and it seems a little strong. In fact the aroma of lime seems to be what first hits your nose as you are about to take a drink. That seems to be a little confusing since you think you are drinking lemonade not limeade.<br /><br />The aroma aside, the lemon flavor is actually not bad but is very mild. Think more of a lemon water than a lemonade. If you drink this while holding your nose closed it tastes much better. If I was Honest Ade I'd take out the lime juice. I'd also like to know what "natural flavor" is. Is that a lemon or lime zest flavor? Maybe they could take that out too.<br /><br />A lemonade should taste pure like a summer day. I feel that in making this they are trying too hard to be different. Please Honest Ade - make this just with lemon juice. I make my own lemonade all the time with just straight lemon juice and a packet of stevia and it tastes better than this. I'm giving this a three because it is not as bad as I expected. I just don't like the aroma and the acidic aftertaste.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Plastic bottle flavoring + too much stevia = An honestly awful drink
review/text: This is not a good beverage.  For a diet lemonade, it has a rather extensive list of ingredients that do not produce a flavor you want to remember.  This beverage is sweetened with stevia.  I don't mind stevia but there is such a thing as too much.  This beverage has entirely too much of it.  All I could taste when I drank this was the stevia, lemon, and plastic bottle.  I'm serious about the last one.  On the side of the bottle, the manufacturer boasts that PETE plastic is non-leaching.  This beverage, however, has a distinctly plastic taste.  Again, this is not a case of my needing to get used to the stevia.  Like I said, I don't mind stevia in moderation.  This company needs to go back to the drawing board.  If you are seeking a diet beverage that is not sweetened with aspartame and actually tastes fairly good, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I573FS">Acai Lemonade Sugar Free Drink Sticks 1.7 oz sticks 12 Sticks</a>, which can be purchased at health food stores, iherb.com and Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Purified water, organic lemon juice concentrate, organic lemon extract, organic lime juice concentrate, citric acid, organic stevia extract, organic natural flavor, ascorbic acid, mixed carotene.<br /><br />This product contains 3% juice.<br />This product is gluten-free.

It tastes worse than that Icee I drank in grade school that unbeknownst to me had a cockroach in the bottom of it. The experience was worse than the time when I was a kid and my dad went to the store to go get apple cider, but he was drunk so he accidentally got apple cider vinegar and I took a big swig and threw up.<br /><br />I don't know if its the stevia sweetener, which I had never had before, or they got a terrible batch of lemons, or what the problem might have been, but this is by far the worst bottled "refreshment" that I have ever had.

review/text: OK, here's the thing about this lemonade:  we are so used to consuming overly sweet, high calorie food & beverages that when you take your first sip of this lemonade, you might not like it.  My first reaction, admittedly, was, "Ew!" due to the tart taste and the absence of sweetness.  It was definitely not your Country Time brand.  Then I took another sip, and another, and now I find that I'm hooked on this stuff.  It's very light-tasting, not sweet, and it's a bit tart.  I love it.  To give you another example, it's like being a regular Coke drinker and then drinking Diet Coke for the first time.  At first, the taste seems off.  But after awhile, the regular version seems sickeningly sweet.  If you like regular versions of soda and lemonade, then you might not like Honest Ade at first; but keep in mind why you like the reg. version (overly sweet taste)-you might just want to change your habits.

But the stevia clashes horribly with what little lemon flavor comes through, resulting in a thoroughly unsatisfying beverage.

Oh my gosh...I took a big gulp (expecting something delicious and refreshing) and just about spit it out!  This form of stevia is so bitter :-(  Don't waste your money!

review/text: I wonder how awful the test batch versions of this drink were before they decided to go with this finished product.  Easily the worst drink I have ever purchased.  And I like Honest Tea! I encouraged my gf to buy this, not knowing it would be vomit inducing.  Honest Tea RECALL THIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE YOU LOSE CUSTOMERS! This vile concoction was my first taste of stevia as well - I don't think I will be trying that again either.

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: I just picked up a bottle of this lemonade at my local grocery store. I enjoy other Honest Ade drinks, and hoped that their attempt at a stevia-sweetened beverage would be equally as good. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. It tasted awful, with some kind of plastic or chemical flavor that I can't even begin to describe. My husband just about lost his lunch when he tasted it. We thought maybe it was just a bad bottle, but after reading all of the horrible reviews, I'm thinking they need to hire some new taste testers. If you want a good lemonade that is sweetened with stevia, try the Trop50 line of juices instead.

review/text: I can honestly say this is the worst lemonade I have ever had. The after taste is just as terrible as the taste that first hits your taste buds. I gave this drink a shot and it is a bust! It almost tastes like it was made with bad lemons or something but it may be the Stevia that is used. Regardless, it is God awful.

review/text: This tastes nothing like lemonade.  It is awful.  It is inedible.  It doesn't even deserve one star.  I poured it down the drain.  The reviewers who said we're just not used to it are correct.  I'm not used to drinking sewer sludge, either, but that doesn't mean I need to become accustomed to it.  I drink nothing but diet drinks and I can think of a half dozen, some organic, that taste a million times better than this foul swill.

review/summary: Honest Ade Classic Lemonade
review/text: This was pretty bad.  Not completely terrible, I managed to chug the whole thing down, but still not very good.  I would not get this drink again, although I may try some of the other drinks from the brand since they are supposed to be pretty good.  Maybe something with a stronger taste than light lemon would be better.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this drink would be the taste.  I honestly think it tasted like lemon sawdust.  And I'm not sure why it tasted that way.  I don't think it was the stevia, as I've drank things with stevia in it before without this effect, so I'm not sure what to blame.  It had just a little bit of sweetness to go along with the sawdust but there wasn't a very strong taste of anything.  The lemon taste was very faint, and as said before, it was mostly covered by the sawdust taste.<br /><br />The ingredients in this product are good, which kept it from getting one star.  Most everything is organic, and stevia is the sweetener.  A pretty healthy drink in all.  It also had zero calories and zero fat, so its a good diet drink if it was more palatable.  And at 16.9 fl oz, it lasts for a couple of hours (at least for me anyway) when drinking.  The Honest brand also boasts that its gluten free, no GMO's, is recycled, and they plant a tree, so lots of good things going on with the company in general.<br /><br />Not too great, I don't recommend it to anyone.  Try another of the brand if you want to try any.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: This stuff is terrible.  There must be a huge amount of stevia in it because the drink tastes like stevia and plastic.  It's sickeningly sweet, with a bad aftertaste.  Some reviewers state that people don't like it because it doesn't taste sweet enough, so I can only conclude we have a different reaction to the stevia in this lemonade.  It was bad enough, after just a few sips I came online to leave a review.

review/text: This product is very hit or miss for people. It DOES NOT really taste anything like the heavily sugared "tradtional" lemonades out there, and the stevia can leave a aftertaste for most people that they find unappealing.  That being said I enjoy it myself very much, but i use it primarly to make a half and half lemonade/ice tea with unsweetened ice tea. Makes a very refreshing drink on hot summer days that way with no sugar added.

Their Classic Lemonade has the delicious taste of fresh-squeezed lemons with just the right amount of sweetness--all of that with no calories or sugar! It's the perfect summertime drink.

review/text: This is the 1st time I purchased from this company and I am somewhat disappointed in the size of the ears. About 2/3s the size of ears I had bought elsewhere. The ears were neatly packaged 25 per zipped plastic bag. They were nice clean ears and have caused no problems. We have 2 Giant Schnauzers and their after dinner treat is 1/2 a pig's ear each. Due to the size it is difficult to offer each one a satisfactory 1/2 ear! These ears are good for small to medium size dogs.

review/text: I was sorely disappointed in the cheap quality of this product.  Not only are they very thin, they are small.  The cut out on each ear added to the decrease in size.  I will not reorder this product.  My former supplier provided very large, thick ears that my dogs greatly enjoyed.  I have several rescued dogs of various sizes - these ears were gone in a matter of 3-5 minutes - my previous product from I-pets.com were of excellent quality, very large and of the proper thickness - 15-20 minutes or more before consumed.  I grew up around pigs, this product looks to be what is created when the layers are pealed apart.  NOT worth the money.

review/text: My dogs love these and it takes several minutes for them to be ate.<br /><br />Good training tool for many different situations.<br /><br />One example where I use them for training is to teach dogs not to follow my vehicle. I hand them a pigs ear and then can drive out. After a few times, my dog no longer follows with or with out the pigs ear.<br /><br />I have German Shepherds and they desire to be with me every chance which is a good trait of the German Shepherd, but, that also needs to be guided. The Pigs Ears work great for that.<br /><br />This particular place is the best value I have found. Free shipping and the box of 100 makes a .75 cent nutritional value and training tool<br /><br />The indoor dogs love them as well. We have a small Pekinees that loves them too. Just takes him longer to eat them

review/summary: Good ingredient in our weekly "gravy"
review/text: I have been entrusted to create a "gravy" almost every week for my family (my wife gave me her Italian family's recipe). This is a term designed to identify a tomato sauce, to be served over some appropriate pasta. Ingredients: a basic tomato sauce (such as Ragu), tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, a bit of wine, some herbs--and an additioonal sauce to add some taste. One of my normal additional sauces is Newman's Own Marinara sauce.<br /><br />It adds a nice taste to the basic gravy. Thrown in some pork or some meatballs, and you get a fine topping to whatever pasta you choose. Newman's Own is one of the better marainara sauces that I have purchased at the local grocery store.<br /><br />All in all, then, a tasty product. . . .

review/summary: Great Sauce Exhorbitant Price
review/text: Why is this so expensive?  The regular price at the store is $2.65 a jar and it goes on sale 2 for 1 once a year.  Here it is over $5 a jar.  ??????

review/summary: WOW
review/text: After getting over the initial shock I begin to understand how large this worm was. THEN I looked at the caloric value..... WOWOWOWOWOWOW!!!!! This thing is massive and was a huge hit as a give away prize! But don't eat it all yourself unless you want to go into a sugar coma and die!

review/summary: A dark, bold roast that is a welcome start to the day
review/text: Noted as a "West Coast Favorite" this dark roast conjures up a scent of pine needles for me as it brews, a subliminal association perhaps tied more to the blend's name than the actual aromatics, which are pleasantly thick, sweet and strong enough to lift me from a groggy morning.<br /><br />I am still partial to Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, a recent purchase that knocked my socks off. Still, I would place Lake & Lodge a mere notch (star) beneath the Nantucket Blend. The Green Mountain website offers a fantastic description for Lake & Lodge: "This particular blend is very versatile, yet elegant. It makes a great espresso, partners well with cream, and is delicious iced. The flavors of this rich, darker roast blend reflect hearty West Coast style roasts. Dark roasted Indonesian coffees offer bountiful sweetness and syrupy notes. A touch of East African beans adds an element of berry-hued brightness to the blend's bold flavor foundations."<br /><br />I read that the blend's name has a peculiar history, first called "Tapestry Blend Dark" the blend was originally developed for a New York City shop called "The Coffee Station."<br /><br />Lake & Lodge is a better name, a blend that invokes ski resorts and campsites and sleepy mornings when a dark, bold roast is a welcome start to the day.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here's my other recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C4YIFE">Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>

review/summary: Best I have had
review/text: We picked up a box at their store in Waterbury, VT and it is one of my favorite K cups. The price was right, $16 for a pack of 24. It is great on a cold morning, perfectly balanced, not bitter, light and crisp!

review/summary: Close-dated K-Cups
review/text: I bought 48 Green Mountain Lake and Lodge K-Cups and they arrived on 9/24 with a 'best by" date of 10/7.  Nowhere did Amazon state they were close-dated.  I like coffee but cannot drink 48 cups in 12 days.  I think Amazon should insure the products they sell are fresh or clearly state this is a clearance item.
