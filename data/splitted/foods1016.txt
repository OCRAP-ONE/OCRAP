review/summary: Affordable Organic Dog Treats
review/text: This product is a win/win/win!  A healthy snack for my dog at an affordable price, and the proceeds go to charity.  Outside of the many moral reasons to buy these treats, my dog also loves them.  He rarely likes dry treats, but these are an exception.<br /><br />The treats are heart shaped and about the size of a quarter.  A couple of them are perfect for a small dog and one bag will last for several weeks.  It's really a great value.

review/summary: I liked it better than my picky dogs do
review/text: I believe this to be a perfect dog treat and have great respect for everything that Newman's Own Organics does. Unfortunately, my two dogs (male 9 yrs & female 3 yrs) just are not impressed. I think perhaps if the 'cookies' were a little less dry and / or their excellent quality ingredients were just a little more aromatic that they would be more tempting and desired by my spoiled, but well loved dogs. If I break the cookie in half, it seems to release slightly more tasty aroma and I can almost talk the dogs into them.

My dog has met them w/ mixed reviews, he is not crazy about them but will ultimately eat it. I feel more comfortable that these are made with reasonable ingredients and made in the US

review/summary: Harvey gives 4 Paws Up!
review/text: Harvey's the World's most picky eater, and turns his nose to foods most other dogs would woof down (pun intended).  He loves Newman's Own Organics Dog Treats, which is great.<br /><br />I love them more because of what they don't contain.  No wheat, corn or artificial anything.  Because the ingredients are certified organic I don't have to worry about pesticides and herbicides getting into his system.<br /><br />My husband likes them because they taste good.  Suffice it to say I live in an interesting household.

review/summary: My Yorkie Loves These Treats!
review/text: I purchased these treats because they were on sale, but also because they're made in the US with safe ingredients.  My Yorkie loves duck breast jerky, but those treats are made in China, and I'm not sure I trust products from there 100% after the poisonous ingredients that were found in China-made dog food in the recent past.  Of course, I didn't expect my dog to enjoy these treats as much as the meaty duck, but he reacts the same way to these cheesey treats as the duck breast!  When I have one of these treats ready for him, his responses to commands (sit, lie down, etc.) are instantaneous - he really wants the treat!  I was concered buying 6 packs at once without first testing them, but now I'm glad I have 6 for him.  GREAT PURCHASE, and I'll be buying other Newman dog products in the future

review/summary: perfect food for my old dog :)
review/text: Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets. After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight. Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years. After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat. That may be age related as well. But the stomach upsets have stopped. And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula.

review/text: Newman's Own Organics Premium Dog Treats were thought to be something that my two dogs (minature daschunds) would enjoy, however Heidi, the older of the two dogs will not eat these treats. She is usually eager to get treats but she turns up her nose to these.  Max, the other dog will eat almost anything so he's getting to partake of the entire purchase.  I will not be reordering any more of this treat because I need something that both dogs enjoy.

review/summary: Natural Treats; a product I trust
review/text: It isn't easy to find packaged food for pets that I can trust.  I have been doing a lot of reading lately about what actually goes into most commercial brand pet foods, and I am appalled.  I decided to start cooking for my brood, but the puppy was going bonkers for bicuits, which was kind of freaking me out.  I never thought I'd find something on the store shelves that satisfied us both...and then, in a WalMart in Honesdale PA (where my family owns a vacation home) I saw these.  I trust Newman's Own, so I read the ingredients.  I was happy, and my dog loves them, but I couldn't seem to find them back home in NJ, so I searched Amazon, and here they were.  I am slated to get a case every other month, but I might need to up that to once a month!

Upon researching the product, and finding them to be a good product as well as a good bargain, we purchased 2 cases of them... not for our dog specifically, but to give them to our local Bank so they could give treats to the dogs in cars that came through the drive up window. (Our dog loves to get treats at the bank)... We have gotten great responses from our friends at the bank.<br />We appreciate giving treats that can be dependable and healthy for our pet family.

review/summary: Disappointed, Brownie does not like it at all
review/text: I figured this would be great since Brownie loves Salmon, but he doesn't even want to touch it.  I got him the Salmon and sweet potato one. He'd rather eat regular dog food than this which is quite weird for him.  He eats everything he can get his paws on, including non edible stuff. It might be because the smell is not very strong.  When I put it up close to my nose to smell it, I barely got a light whiff of salmon. Dog treats usually have a stronger smell which makes it more tempting for dogs.

review/summary: Pretty Good Treats
review/text: These are hard treats shaped like hearts that you can break in half if necessary. They have decent ingredients though I try not to give my dogs anything with grain, the oatmeal and barley flour is not too bad. I only give one a day as a late night snack. My Doberman likes them but she is not too picky. My picky Shar-pei will eat them but is not enthusiastic about them (he prefers Merrick sausages). Overall, these are a decent snack for dogs as long as your pet does not have dental issues, these should be okay for them.  I want to make a comment about the packaging. This is one of the few "zip-loc" type resealable bags that actually reseals without having to mess with it a bunch of times. It stays nice and tight and keeps the treats fresh.

review/summary: small - not medium - sized treats
review/text: I'd purchased these dog treats in a local store (Medium sized) and it was a great size for my dog, my dog loved the treats and I thought that the ingredients were okay for my dog.  When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6.  Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats.  Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item.  I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats.  I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium.

review/text: My dog loves these, and I believe (and hope not to be disappointed) that the Newman's Own Organics brand is to be trusted.<br /><br />The treats are small, and no doubt healthy, but I wish they listed the calories on their package. The ingredients are all good, but I'm trying to control my older dog's weight, and if these were very high-calorie, I wouldn't feed them to her. I'd look for something else. (I know, carrots and other veggies, but she won't eat them. She's a 9 year old rescue with terrible teeth, and set in her ways. My past puppies found baby carrots a great treat, but not this girl.)<br /><br />Maybe I'll contact the manufacturer and ask for the calorie count. But I do think it should be on the package.

No big deal as the discoloration seems to wash out just fine.

review/summary: Salmon is 2nd ingredient listed
review/text: I compared Natural Balance, Wellness, and Newman's to make my final decision. Salmon is the 2nd ingredient listed and that was the deciding factor for me. These treats are medium size, so not the small training size that sometimes are convenient when walking the dog. I also like supporting the company cause of profits towards charities.

I was excited to see Newman also offered treats, so I tried the Salmon and sweet potato. Unfortunately, she does not like this product, probably because it is in biscuit form.<br /><br />Now I somehow have to make her eat these over the next several months, even if I have to grind them up and put in her regular food.

My picky eater loves them and eagerly competes with my other dog for her share. Excellent product.

review/summary: Perfect size for a sweet treat every now and then and the jars are very useful.
review/text: I bought a 6 oz jar of this conserve to try and liked it so much I almost ordered the six-pack deal Amazon has, which is very good, but then I saw this 48 - 1 oz pack and I like it a lot more because this way I can just have a serving as a treat every now and then without having an opened large jar taking space and aging away in my fridge.<br /><br />Real fruit taste and no food coloring or preservatives (no syrups, no processed sugar), just red raspberries, pomegranate, concentrated grape juice and fruit pectin.<br /><br />The texture of this delightful conserve is different from jam or marmalade, not as thick, more like between jelly and jam, and the flavor is fruitier. You can definitely taste the raspberries and pomegranate.<br /><br />A very good choice for those with a sweet tooth who don't want or can't eat highly processed sugars.<br /><br />Great product from France.<br /><br />The lil' jars are very useful for storing spices, individual salad dressing for the lunch box, etc., and also for non food things like beads, powders, and many other craft items.<br /><br />TIP: A few of these little jars in a cellophane bag with a nice ribbon make a lovely present.

review/text: St. Dalfour's no-sugar added jams are excellent, and I've never been disappointed in any of the flavors. Rather than adding sugar, these jams are sweetened with fruit juice. St. Dalfour jams can be found in a few stores in my area (northern suburbs of Chicago) but flavor availability varies. I found the Pomegranate and Raspberry at Marshall's several months ago, and it quickly became my favorite. Haven't been able to find any recently, so I was happy to find this on Amazon. The small jars are very handy.

review/text: For some reason known only to Amazon, these bread crumbs pop up third in the list when you search for gluten free bread crumbs. I trusted the search (and all the others it found seem to be gluten free) and didn't read far enough down in the description (so yes, this is completely my fault) and, since this was a subscribe and save deal, ordered these. I just got them today and discovered that I can't use - or return - any of the six containers I ordered because they are not, in fact, gluten free. It would be nice if there were some way that items containing gluten did NOT pop up in a search for items that do not contain it. I'm giving them four stars anyway because I'm sure they probably taste lovely. I will never know.

review/summary: Not Very Sweet. Not Sour Either. Just Quite Tasty.
review/text: Not too long ago I discovered that my nearby Fresh and Easy Grocery Store (an English company that has all kinds of imported English items) stocked a number of concentrate drinks and I've been trying them out. They're quite good and low in calories. My latest is Robinson's Lemon Barley Water Drink. To make a drink you add one part of the Robinson's concentrate and four parts water. Just the pouring together will mix them, or go ahead and stir them if you like. A tall glass drink will contain about 40 calories (my estimate at about two servings). That's quite low. The drink tastes a lot like a real good lemonade. It's not very sweet, nor is it sour. It's just quite tasty, that's what it is. Good drink. Goes well with meals or just for a refreshing break.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I have been using Giovanni Body Wash (White Tea scent) for several years now. I have extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne, rashes and irritations when using most other soaps. I have wasted tons of money trying soap after soap hoping to find something that wouldn't irritate my skin, lathering well, while leaving me feeling clean. This soap has a really nice, soft scent, washes skin clean of dirt and oil and leaves no soap scum after rinsed off. This is the only soap I have found that does not cause break-outs/irritations and lathers well. I truely wish I could find a more econonmcal product that does the same job as this body wash but still haven't found one. So I try to find really good deals when buying this body wash to help off set the cost.<br /><br />Please note: this soap is a little drying.. so if you already have a dry skin conidtion this may not be the soap for you. I lived in a very warm humid climate when I started using this soap and did not notice the drying effect until I moved to a much cooler and dryer area. With that being said Giovanni also sells one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, it's their body butter (comes in the same scents as the body washes). This body butter works fantasticly! I am in the health care field and have to wash my hands many, many times a day. If I put some of the body butter on at night right before I go to sleep, my hands are moisturized all the next day without reapplying! I have tried many moisturizers that seems to work great until you wash your hands, then its like you never had any on in the first place... the body butter is not like this.

review/summary: Where's the moisture?
review/text: Ok, so I absolutely love the packaging and the nifty description on the back of the bottle, but when I'm paying .64/oz, I expect it to moisturize. Giovanni claims that their washes include "essential oil complex to soothe, smooth and regenerate skin's lost moisture" but the ingredients' list contains no such ingredient, unless they are referring to the "Essential Oil Fragrance" in which case they are blatantly lying because essential oils provide scent, not moisture. Even the dollar bottles of cheapo wash at Walmart contain some type of moisturizer, albeit petroleum. Sometimes I use St. Ives Whipped Silk body wash and it's definitely more moisturizing than Giovanni due to the sunflower oil. I've noticed even JASON's washes contain Sodium PCA to moisturize (although their stuff also has harsh sulfates, so I've never tried them). Or maybe Giovanni deliberately left out any moisturizers out so that we buy their lotions/body butters. Ha!<br /><br />While I sound like I hate the product, I really don't; I just wish it provided some moisture. The good: it looks and feels like a spa product, washes well and rinses cleanly, and smells good and not artificial perfumey like Herbal Essences and all that other junk. Also, it actually works well as a shampoo when in a pinch. In fact, I've taken to using it as shampoo as well since Giovanni keeps changing their shampoo formulas (and for the worse, it seems, judging from the new ingredients) and body washes tend to be more gentle than shampoos. I've tried Raspberry Winter, Lavender Vanilla Snow, Cassifluer White Tea, and D:tox (bar soap form) and they all smell awesome. True aromatherapy in a bottle.

review/text: This coffee was a little different than I had expected. I expected it to taste just like the cherry syrup I used to put in my coffee. Of course it didn't. I am trying to cut down on sugar and this coffee had a cherry chocolate taste to it. It was pretty good.

Then we bought 2- 6 packs!!  If I could store a barrel of it I would buy one!!  Too bad it is not shelf price.<br />A bit expensive but if you are frugal it is worth the cost!!

review/summary: Great morning cake!
review/text: We must have made about 20 of these cakes last fall.  They are so good!  Also very easy to make.  This was great with bacon and eggs in the morning.  It was also great for dessert (as I believe it was intended ;).  We didn't put the icing on as suggested as the cake was great without it.  Now that it's getting a little chilly out we're excited to start making our favorite fall cake again.

review/summary: OMG, it's heavenly!
review/text: I bought the Duncan Hines Apple Decadent Caramel cake mix while shopping for snacks for a game night yesterday, and OMG, it is amazing! It was quick and easy to make, and I baked it in a bundt pan. Since it's not a full-sized cake mix, the bundt cake was about the height of a coffee cake. But oh, it is soooo much better! Incredibly moist, nice apple flavor (it has apple bits in it), good caramel taste too. This is great either as a dessert or a breakfast/brunch cake. Decadent is definitely the right word for it!<br /><br />I don't understand why the seller here on Amazon is selling it for such a high price, though! I paid less than $3 for it.

review/summary: Okay but not Cake Mate
review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

review/text: Good quality sprinkles.  Pricing seems pretty decent.  Love the way they make my cupcakes look - takes me back to my elementary school days, long ago!  Only gripes: the "partially-hydrogenated" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.
