review/text: As I step away from conventional carbs due to digestive issues, rice cakes have been a great find, especially the smaller crunchy flavored ones. I lean toward 'savory' rather than sweet, but these chocolate Quakes are delightful, giving you a choco-crunch as you ponder whether Don is actually going to stay married to whats-her-name or reunite with Betty.

I was surprised how affordable it is.  It arrived very promptly. The tea was very fresh and had a very calming aroma.  My doctor said green tea is very high in antioxidents, and drinking it can reduce your risk of getting cancer.  Drink up!  I'll be ordering some more.

review/summary: A wonderful RED wine for American dinner tables
review/text: Rejoice!  Carlo Rossi Sweet Red (Red Mountain) is everything you hoped red wine would taste like.  Fruity, sweet, refreshing but also warmingly seductive.  And of course, it goes well with food...whether it be juicy steak or fresh pasta.<br /><br />Perhaps you've had cravings for a delicous red wine that you could enjoy with nightly meals just like all the images depicted in artwork and movies.  Yet, you've tried red wines and found them to be overpowering...or certainly not refreshing. Maybe you've relegated yourself to the lighter tasting pink wines or have decided wine is not for you.<br /><br />Carlo Rossi has been providing fine table wines for many years.  I remember the timeless jugs at the center of our oak dinner table 30 years ago.<br /><br />I can finally enjoy all of the health benefits of red wine with all of the flavor I imagined it would have.  If you prefer a less sweet wine, try Carlo Rossi Chianti. It is an authentic sangiovese red table wine.

review/summary: Great product, but leaks during shipping
review/text: I love this product, especially the quality of the pumper device.  This is the only pump style salmon oil I've found that doesn't leak fishiness onto my hand and/or fail to reach the bottom third of the oil in the container.  My dogs love the oil itself.  It prevents dandruff on my border collie mix.<br /><br />My complaint is that the product leaked during shipment, causing it and everything else in the box to have a thin but pungent coating of fish oil on it.  The bottle was sealed in a plastic bag within the box, but the oil leached through the plastic.<br /><br />If you can find this product at your local pet shop, I highly recommend buying it there rather than risking leaks during shipment.

review/summary: cats hated it
review/text: I wanted to try this, since my cats had itchy ears and I read that Salmon Oil was good for healthy skin and a shiny coat. Thinking that my cats would love it (since it is fish, obviously) I mixed it in with their food. They would not eat it at all. I tried less than one pump the next time. They still wouldn't eat it. This went on for days of me giving less and less to try and mask the strong smell, but they refused to eat. I had to stop using it and it ended up being a waste of money. If you have finicky eaters, then your cats might be put off by the very strong odor.

review/summary: Fruity goodness
review/text: I'm a fan of fruit snacks and these are very good. When Amazon had these on sale for a really low price I jumped all over it. This will last a while cause you get a total of 72 snack packs with 2 boxes. Each box has 36 packs - 12 mixed berry, 12 cherry, and 12 strawberry. I find them to be sweet but not too sweet. It has a great chewy texture - not too soft and not too hard. The taste is very good. For me one pack lasts about 2-3 servings as I take a small handful for each serving. Stick these in the refrigerator - they're good cold.

I truly wanted to like them...

review/text: These mints are velvety *and* minty: the best of both worlds. I adore strong mints but have always disliked the hard, chalky texture of the leading brands. This candy is like a hard candy and a butter-mint combined. The mint doesn't leave a residue in your mouth as most mints do. These mints melt slowly and can be chewed after they melt in your mouth. There are many mints per package which makes them a good buy for any budget. I can't stop with just one mint, these are just too good.

review/text: Classic French mints made from mineral water of the spa town Vichy.  I think there was a queen of either France or England who once declared these as her favorite sweets.  They come not individually wrapped, but all in one bag.  They are white, chalky and standard size for hard candy.  They are so addicting and so good.  Has a more subtle mint taste.  More sweet like candy than an American mint. More like a dessert than a breath-freshener.  I love them.

review/summary: Great Greenie alternative!
review/text: We have a 3 year old Maltese that we used to shower with Greenies (1-2 a day) even though it says to limit them to one per day.  The last time we took him to the vet, we told her what kind of food he's on and what kind of treats he gets.  She was concerned with the amount of Greenies he gets and told us to limit them to one every other day.  She said that Greenies contain wheat and that could be problematic for dogs later on in life.  So I searched on Amazon for a wheat free dental chew...<br /><br />Our dog has tried three different kinds of dental chews (including this one) and likes them all.  He's tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a>.<br /><br />After reading mixed reviews, I decided to give these a try.  My first impressions were that these were pretty large for a "small" dog.  They are twice the length of a Greenie.  When our little guy got one, he ate half of it, then tried to hide the other half.  He did like it though.  I will say that he usually devours his Greenies but he takes his time on these (he did the same with the Zukes at first).  After a few days, he seems to really like them.<br /><br />If you're doing a side by side comparison between the Get Naked dental chew, Greenies and Zukes,  I think these are better.  They're really low in calories and they're wheat free, corn free, soy free and gluten free.  They're cheaper than Zukes as well.<br /><br />My recommendation is to cut them in half.  That will give you 36 treats for your dog per bag.  Three bags will give you 108 treats vs. Greenies 96 at around the same price.  He likes the Zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get 15 per bag.<br /><br />I suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them.  If they do, then they are a great alternative to Greenies.

review/summary: My picky eater likes these
review/text: I was skeptical that my dog would chew on these treats, but he does seem to like them.  They smell like cinnamon and are very low in calories.  My mini dachshund suffered kidney damage after contracting Leptospirosis.  He is on a special diet of rice and a small amount of protein.  Dogs on these diets often suffer from dental disease. I needed something to clean his teeth, but also not introduce high protein to his diet. These chews are 18% crude protein, much lower than other chews, and contain fiber (chia seeds and flaxseed) and antioxidents like green tea. A win-win situation for my dog's overall health.

review/summary: dogs didn't like it
review/text: I had high hopes for this product, because it is healthy and affordable.  But neither of my 2 Chihuahuas liked it; one just sniffed at it and walked away; the other dog chewed on it for a short while and then walked away from it.  One dog likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KUO2XS">Nylabone Nutri Dent Original Minichews for Mini Dogs, 72-Count Pouch</a>, and the other dog likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B3W4N8">6" BULLY STICKS - Free Range Standard Regular Thick Select 6 inch (10 Pack), by Downtown Pet Supply</a>.  I was looking for some alternatives that were healthy and more affordable.  I guess I'll be sticking with their current treats for now.

They arrived finally, they were fresh, intact, AND the correct quantity was sent, eight boxes of 16 count Pop-Tarts.  I got them on a promotional code deal so it worked out cheaper than the grocery store by far.  One reviewer said they were bland and to go with rice cakes, LOL, WTH???  Uuummm, what was she smoking?  If anything these may be too sweet for some people.  Hahaha, rice cakes, that's funny.

review/text: I use Amazon to send food items to a son to let him know we are thinking about him and to make sure he has food in the house.  He is a little agoraphobic and does not go to the grocery store often.  The general food service delivery is convenient and reliable.  Pop Tart delivery seems to have some difficulty in arriving as anything you would put into a toaster.  They always arrive broken.  It makes me feel like these were salvage items from a train wreck.  For more fragile items I think I will try a local delivery service like Pea Pod.

review/summary: Nice snack for babies
review/text: My son is 11 month and only just now cutting his first tooth. It's hard to find snacks on-the-go for him that don't require teeth. I recently came across the Plum Organics Teensy Fruits and took a chance since they were only $3-ish. The price might be a tad high for what you actually get but the snack is great. The fruit is pretty much the size of a raisin and they are pretty tasty. They're not as thick and chewy as a normal fruit snack which is good since he doesn't have teeth. I'll probably keep them in the house a little longer for a nice alternative to cheerios when we go out, but once he has some teeth we'll move on to something else.

review/summary: Best gummy candy EVER
review/text: This is the most delicious candy ever conceived by man.  I don't know why the Haribo cola gummies are so much more popular when the Trolli brand kicks their ass so hard.  The Trolli ones are soft and full of flavor, while the Haribo gummies are perpetually stale (unless they mean for them to be hard and painful to chew) and barely taste like anything in comparison.<br /><br />The difference between the two is so pronounced that I order this brand from the internet instead of buying the Haribo ones that are available in several of my local grocery stores.  (Which is complete MADNESS, by the way.  Why would they stock the disgusting version when this one exists?)<br /><br />BUY THIS CANDY!  You won't regret it.

The other gummi cola candy from Haribro is much better than the one from Trolli. I just can't taste any cola flavor at all from the trolli gummis, it's way too sweet in my opinion. I do not recommend this product and i will not be buying it again.

review/text: So my roommate wanted me to get sour patch kids as our next order of candy off of amazon. I had tried sour patch kids out for the first time about a week earlier, and thought they were great so I agreed. After receiving them, there was no doubt that we had made a great purchase. Wrong! We were completely wrong. After sucking on them individually for 2 days, I found my mouth hurting. Soon enough, I was spitting out blood from the cuts on the top of my mouth and tongue. My roommate and I both were not able to eat the cafeteria food at times because of the pain in our mouths. Anyways, he finished the 5lb in about a week, while I gave the last pound to my friends. Overall, the candy was great and well worth buying if you enjoy sour patch kids. You could tell that they were brand new and fresh. Good buy overall, just make sure you take your time when eating them. BTW, I personally am never eating sour patch kids again.

The possibilities are endless: I blend it with Fage Total 0% Greek yogurt and pumpkin flax for parfaits, pair it with pancakes, and spread it on top of Biscoff spread on toast. It's sweet enough to be tasty and tart enough to be interesting. Aboslutely love this product -- reminds me of breakfast in an English B&B.

review/summary: spicy and crunchy
review/text: Wow, are these good! They are crispy and crunchy, light and flaky, and still have a bit of texture and depth to them. Sometimes with "healthier" chips I feel like they are almost too light, but these feel like a REAL snack food.<br /><br />Their taste reminds me of SmartFood (which turned out not to be so smart) with a mixture of whole grain chips- there's a nice tang to the crunch. There's just the right amount of spice- it's almost unnoticeable when you first open the bag, but by the time you eat a few chips, it's definitely there.<br /><br />We're big corn chips fans- Fritos, tortilla chips, etc. I also love anything cheddar (Smartfood, Pirate's Booty, Cheez-It) so these were a GREAT find for us.<br /><br />The only downfall is 6 grams of fat per small snack-size bag. But at 140 calories, and the amount of flavor, it's well worth it. My entire family LOVES these chips and they are our new obsession (little ones may not like the spice, though, so try the white cheddar ones...)

review/summary: Tasty Alternative to Popchips
review/text: First off, let me say that I'm a big fan of PopChips (made by a different company, also offered on Amazon).  I've tried almost all their varieties and I've been very happy with most of them.  I saw this come up and it intrigued me, popcorn chips.  PopCorners are in my opinion not quite as good as PopChips, but pretty close.  Right now, PopCorners are a better value per bag too (especially considering that PopCorner single serving bags are bigger).  If you want a change of flavor / texture, I'd recommend giving these a try.  If you like these, and have never tried PopChips, I'd highly recommend trying them too!<br /><br />The Cheesy Jalapeno PopCorners aren't too spicy in my opinion, but have a good cheesy flavor.  If you like popcorn and spicy flavors you gotta try these!  The texture is almost like a rice cake, but they are much thinner.  I've never tried dipping them, but I'm sure they'd work fine for that too.  I really like these as a change of pace from PopChips from time to time.  I'm planning on keeping both PopCorners and PopChips around as both are very good!

review/summary: The Good Stuff!
review/text: I was cruising through my neighborhood Costco when I passed a sample station that featured three flavors of this snack - Kettle, Sea Salt, and White Cheddar.  The Kettle flavor was the best but all were not only tasty, but the texture was interesting and fun!  Costco offered them in a three flavor, variety pack of 24.  Of course I bought it.  The next time I went to Costco, I couldn't find them and none of the local supermarkets carry them.  Amazon to the rescue!<br /><br />Of all the flavors, my least favorite is the butter.  It's a bit too salty for my taste.  The White Cheddar is good, but, to me, the standout flavors are Kettle and Cheesy Jalape&ntilde;o.  They rock!  The 40 pack is great.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Popcorners--Cheesy Jalapeno
review/text: While on a JetBlue flight, we had some PoPCorners as a snack.  I had not had this before but thought it made a great snack.  I ordered directly from Medora an assortment of all their flavors and enjoyed all of them.  I especially liked the Cheesy Jalapeno and ordered a case from Amazon.  Other flavors my wife and I likes were the Butter and especially the Kettle.

review/summary: Really good.
review/text: These are definitely really good although I prefer the white cheddar variety. If your stomach is really sensitive, the jalapeno definitely has a kick to it. I was hoping this would capture the flavor of jalapeno without side effects but so far only a handful of products have been able to deliver that. They still taste really yummy though.

review/text: Popcorners and popchips, my new favorite chips. Just got the cheese jalepeno popcorners. Nice cheese popcorn flavor with a little kick. Starts off mild, after you finish the bag, you feel a little heat. (Not to much, unless you have a big chile intolerance.) Also, I love that corn flavor you get from the popcorners. It's a flavor that you do not get from any other chips. Can't wait to try other flavors.

review/summary: Love em
review/text: Different...light, crispy, salty and spicy.  Like a very very thin crispy ricecake consistency.  130 calories per serving, 5 grams of fat, 5 servings a bag.  Even though they're lower in fat/cals than regular chips, I would urge dieters to use caution. These are not filling in any way shape or form. Like with regular chips, it is very difficult to eat just one ounce. They aren't heavy like Doritos or fatty like chips, so eating them just by themselves aren't going to make you feel satisfied like a less healthy snack chip might after a serving or two.  They are  relatively inexpensive...my grocery store carries them for $1.99 a bag....I see the pricing is similar on Amazon.  Overall, these are really tasty chips, well priced...use them as a healthier alternative to chips, but I really wouldn't recommend them to those trying to trim their waistlines because they are quite addictive!

review/summary: Chessy Jalapeno with perfect heat!!
review/text: Our family is a big fan of "Popped" chips. We loved Chipins Ranch jalapeno, so when I found this brand had the small single portion bags at such a reasonable cost, I knew we needed to try them.  They seem to be the exact same thing, but the flavor is just a little different and we actually prefer this one to the other. Perfect amount of heat and not at all hot like most jalapeno chips out there. The 1.1 ounce single portion bag has 150 calories and 6 grams of fat. The best buy date is January 2013, almost a year from purchase date.

review/text: Don't bother with these "new" and "wholesome" popped corn chips.  They are neither Cheesy nor Jalapeno flavored!  Ok, there is a slightly spicy aftertaste, however, the cheese flavor is missing entirely.  Very disappointed.  Now I am stuck with 39 more bags.  Perhaps I can donate them to a local school or something . . . . .

It worked really well in the protein shake and I was pleased with the flavor. I also tried it in some hot tea, but perhaps I used too much. It worked well, but I got really bad stomach cramps later on... In any case, I've used it in a variety of other recipes that call for sugar and it works well, - with no cramps, lol - just gotta get the measurements worked out a bit.

review/summary: 7 cats are rating 7 paws up
review/text: I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in p�t&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.

review/summary: Lower prices in stores
review/text: I have not bought this online but I know I've seen and bought the 24 packs in stores a lot cheaper and the individual cans a lot cheaper. Here the cans are almost 70 cents per can.  I think at the stores I pay 50 or 55 cents a can.  I think they have the 24 packs cheaper at the dollar store or Freds and I think Walmart but I only go there and in emergencies at night when everything else is closed but they are also about the only place that I've found that sells the tuna and egg flavor that my cat's really love.  I thought Amazon would have a cheaper price then most of the stores but you would probably pay 2 or 3 dollars extra then at the stores and if you couldn't get free shipping I don't know how much extra you would have to pay but all together it would probably be about 5 to 7 dollars extra then just buying it at the store.

review/text: I was told by my doc that my daughter needed to be switched from Similac Advance to Similac for spit up or to Enfamil A.R. I tried both products and I prefer the similac for spit up for one it doesn't mixes with a lot of bubbles when compared to enfamil. Secondly even after vigorous mixing lumps could still be found in the enfamil bottle. Both formulas did bind her though but I just give her an ounce of prune juice and an ounce of water that solved that problem.

I have no idea why they cost so much on Amazon, they are only 8 dollars a case at the local grocery store, so I don't recommend buying them here but check out your local stores maybe you can find La Croix or some similar product.

My wife checked her blood sugar levels (she has gestational diabetes) and found they had skyrocketed.<br /><br />This is not a low-carb product, it is a high-carb product where the carbs have been altered in a way that affects absorption - but not necessarily to truly lower its glycemic impact.<br /><br />If it works for you, great, but it REALLY did not work for us.

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!
