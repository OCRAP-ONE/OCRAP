review/summary: A Delicious and Effective Energy Drink
review/text: Red Bull (as everyone knows) basically started the buzz on energy drinks. It's full of B-vitamins, a bit of sugar (and a nice blast of caffeine just for good measure.) What makes this more popular than every other energy drink? It's CONSISTENTLY effective and NEVER overbearing. Red Bull isn't very sweet, and as such it goes down wonderfully at any time... It's a bit tart (which can take getting used to if you're a soda drinker) but generally has a very pleasing flavor. Plus, you know every time you pop open a can of Red Bull, you will get the desired result. Much like coffee, Red Bull is a tried and true boost that many swear by.<br /><br />My only reservation in recommending this drink is the artificial ingredients, which I feel bring the level of quality down a little bit... In my opinion, a drink that costs this much should use 100% natural ingredients... That being said, at least the original Red Bull uses natural sugar and is free of nasty preservatives.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: My negative review is not at all towards Red Bull, trust me, I've been a Red Bull Junkie for years.  It was the highlight of my life when they finally started making larger cans! But seriously, 45 bucks? Go to any grocery store and you can get a 24 pack for 32.99, and I'm completely aware how sad it is I have that price memorized.

review/summary: Cans leaked before expiration date
review/text: I bought this item several months ago and stored it in a cool, dry place. When I went to get some cans today, 7 of the 12 remaining cans had leaked at least half their contents, leaving behind a moldy mess. I also had to toss several other food items that I had stored next to the red bull because they were also covered in mold. The cans are still more than two months from their expiration date. I'm very disappointed and now I don't feel comfortable drinking the remaining five cans in case there was some kind of defect with the entire batch.

review/summary: Pricey, but good for Caffeine
review/text: I was personally never a big fan of Red Bull until about a month ago.  I preferred drinks such as AMP or Full Throttle because for the same price I could get more liquid volume.  Red Bull tastes amazing though when Very cold.  I am talking borderline frozen.  It goes down like a shot, but not of alcohol, but of caffeine.  Great for a late night of work.  Very Pricey though.

review/summary: Best buy
review/text: Won't go into how great Red Bull is.  What I will mention is the savings by purchasing this 24 pack on Amazon.com.<br /><br />Subscribed at $33.99...comes out to $1.41 per can vs. buying each can at a gas station for $2.39 per can.  Or buy 2 for $4.00 deal at the local gas station.  Great idea buying in bulk if you consume a can per day.  Plus it makes me perform better in bed which is a bonus.  Red Bull gives you boner...I mean wings.

review/summary: Gook kick in the morning
review/text: I have a 7AM class two times a week in my final semester of college. The class is Advanced Accounting.  Need I say more?  Drinking this stuff when I get there, gives me a buzz that lasts the entire 75 minutes and gets rid of my sleepiness...at least until the class ends, then I just want to find a bed and go back to sleep.<br /><br />Taste:  Its a little on the sweet side, but it also has a sour kick to it, it really does the trick when I feel like I need an energy boost.<br /><br />I purchased it with subscribe and save, so it came out to being $32.  Same as the grocery store nearby, but I get this delivered to my doorstep and I don't have to use any gas in my car to get to the store.

review/summary: The Bull Is One Of The Best
review/text: Red Bull essentially revolutionized the energy drink industry and the company does not mess with a good thing; the formula has not changed and it is a solid product. I use Red Bull during the day and have found it as an excellent drink for recovery from my longer swims (I am in the pool three hours for a nonstop freestyle workout). No bull, it is near the top in the field of energy drinks that gets more crowded seemingly each week.

review/summary: Hey, That Really Stiiiiings!
review/text: I'm tired of products that promise more than they can deliver. Advertising should tell me what to expect in the real world, not in some happytime fantasy land where money grows on chia pets and all my pants fit and supermodels frolic on the shores of the lazy Guinness river. I bought this product specifically to test the claims made in their marketing.<br /><br />'Red Bull gives you wiiiiiiings'. All their TV and radio and print ads say so. And not figurative 'wings' or wings like 'earning your wings' or panty liner wings, either. Real, honest-to-Icarus wings. It's in every commercial. But it is really true?<br /><br />To find out, I climbed up on top of my buddy's garage with this 24-pack. To make the experiment scientific, the results had to be reproducible, so I paid my buddy and his two brothers ten bucks each to climb up with me. We drank two cans apiece, waited five minutes, and took a soaring leap off the edge. Like a quartet of Supermen, we prepared to fly.<br /><br />And like a foursome of Incredible Hulks, we plummeted head-first and butt-deep into the snowbank beside the garage. We didn't soar like eagles. We didn't even float like hummingbirds. We sank like frozen turkeys. Frozen upside-down turkeys.<br /><br />So, 'wings'? No. 'Red Bull gives you whiiiiiiiplash', I could maybe believe. Wings, not so much.

review/summary: Smells like Gasoline
review/text: A staple at niteclubs, the secluded bedrooms of 'Warcraft' obsessed Nerds, the cup holder of a caffeine-injected driver and pretty much anywhere else in the world; the mystical potion that has a smell resembling the essence of your local gasoline pump has found its niche in society as a quick fix to drousiness and boredom alike. The blue and silver can contains enough sugar and additional stimulants to create a mediocre Meth-Like buzz and has a caloric content in the triple digits. Although health wise, I'd tell you to pass up on this and opt for a glass of water, I'd actually recommend it for recreational drinking(with or without alcohol), if their is such a thing. Also available as a 12oz. size can and the insane, unnecessary 16 oz. size....Enjoy.

review/summary: Up all Night and Overpriced
review/text: This seems very overpriced for a case of redbull, as it is now a popular mixer for alcoholic beverages, prices have really come down for Redbull and similar drinks and you can get it so much cheaper elsewhere.<br />Its not jst the price I have a problem with, for an energy drink it must contain alot of caffine as I stuggled to sleep and woke up with quite a headache the next day. It's not something I would consider using in the longterm as a way of boosting my energy levels.<br />Fellow amazon users might be keen to try a product called Gene Eden. I take it as a natural way to keep viruses at bay, but it also makes me feel healther and more enegised the longer I have used it.<br />It is also available on Amazon and I have popped the link in if you want to check it out.<br />Gene-Eden: Antiviral Natural Remedy for Latent HPV, EBV, Herpes, Hepatitis, Safe, Effective, Patented Formula

review/summary: For Canned Spaghetti, This Is Really Good.
review/text: Here's a little item I picked up at my nearby Fresh and Easy Store. It's a British company and they have a lot of imported items. I was looking over their imports and found cans of Heinz Spaghetti in Tomato Sauce. Now, why would anyone import  such a mundane item as canned spaghetti all the way from England? Well my only response was that it must be very good. So I tried a can. I'm not used to eating canned spaghetti and I can't recall any since my poverty-stricken graduate school days. In any  case, I was  curious. It was excellent, the best canned spaghetti I can ever recall eating! No wonder they import it. You can't get stuff this good in the American brands, at least not that I'm aware of. Would it displace the regularly prepared spaghetti in my diet? No, but for canned spaghetti, this is really good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Tasty, filling, gr8 mix
review/text: I really like this mix. I expected it to not taste as good as it did due to the seeds and lentils which I found odd to be added to the rice/bean mix. But, they gave a nice texture to my stew. I didn't follow the directions. I boiled the beans for about 3-4 mins then lowered the flame to a simmer. I let them simmer for about 1 hr-1 1/2. Then put them in the fridge in a bowl over night. The following morning I let them simmer for another 2-2 1/2 hours. I like my beans and whole grains to be soft not hard towards the center. No it didn't come out mushy but nice and seasoned. I have nothing bad to say about this mix. The only problem I found was that there really isn't much (brown) rice in this mix. It taste like pure beans/lentils. I had to cook an actual pot of rice to eat with it. Otherwise to that I am very much impressed and will purchase again. I will keep my amazon subscription for the 4 pack as long as they don't raise the price.

I was pleased that it cooked fairly quickly, one hour total, and was perfect and ready to eat. The tomato sauce added good flavor, and I threw in a little browned hamburger as well. There's a good recipe idea on the bag--after it's done cooking, put in one part milk to three parts soup, and warm it up before eating--but don't boil. I'll trying this next time. I would highly recommend this soup mix. Excellent price, all natural, no MSG--and very tasty.

review/text: I make soup all the time from scratch or mixes, and this is one of the best!  Not too many instructions out there...this is how I do it:  Put the contents of the bag in a large pot (the one you intend to cook in).  Add 64 ounces plain water, cover with lid and place in refrigerator 24-72 hours.  It doesn't get soggy, and since these are whole and unmolested seeds (i.e., living) they keep, and may even begin some of the beneficial enzymatic processes of germination.  I put it in the fridge Friday night and make it Monday.<br /><br />Anyhow, after the soak remove from fridge and add 64 ounces chicken broth (I use Swanson, but whatever you feel).  Add four chicken bullion cubes and one-half to one teaspoon each of the following (to taste):  basil, oregano, italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Add one softball-sized onion, chopped, and two carrots, also chopped.  Add two de-boned skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of fat and cubed.  Salt and pepper to taste...  Bring to a boil, hold for about five minutes, lower heat and simmer for about two hours.  Let cool for a time, then serve.<br /><br />I was genuinely surprised how good this came out, considering I really didn't add much to what came in the bag.  Delicious, healthy, and for less than $10 a pot this is a lot of food for the money.  Plus, there's a ton of room for creativity and your own spin on things.  I'm going to try something different with each bag now that I have a baseline.  I think the most important aspects are some degree of presoak, 128 total ounces of liquid and some small source of fat.  The chicken thighs above (post-trim) add just the right amount...if you're going vegetarian or using very lean meat consider adding a touch of olive/sesame/pumpkin seed/sunflower seed oil (any or all!).<br /><br />Best of luck, and have fun!

review/text: I love this soup...it is easy to make and makes a very hearty main course.  You can add whatever seasonings you like and colorful vegies as well.  I think a little carrot or red bell pepper would add to the eye appeal...it is a rather blah "green-gray" without some extra color.  Really great taste!!

review/summary: Thick soup, a bit too thick
review/text: We enjoy thick soups. The Bob's Red Mill Whole Grains and Beans Soup Mix takes thick a bit too far. I followed the instructions carefully, but the end result required diluting. When refrigerated, it congealed completely. I added water and microwaved, and the result was fine. I would prefer not to have to go through that process of continued diluting.

review/summary: My dogs loved this
review/text: One of my dogs tore his ACL and had to have TPLO surgery which has a 12-week recovery period. I knew I needed something to keep him occupied so I ordered a bunch of Made in America treats off of Amazon.  This one is his favorite. He was so excited when I was opening the box.  He spent a hour chewing on it and was a dog again. I was so happy to find something he enjoyed so much since he can't run right now.  He growled at his sister the whole time to make sure she didn't steal his rawhide.  She got her own rawhide and also chewed it for an hour.  It was a nice break for me because I didn't have to watch him so much while he was enjoying his treat.  I'm glad I have 10 of them. We may actually make it through the 12-weeks with these chews!

review/summary: Excellent brewed tea for cooking!
review/text: If you buy this tea to drink, you may or may not like it.  I don't think I would use it for a beverage, but I didn't buy it for that purpose.  I bought it to use for cooking.  I brewed a few cups of this tea and boiled small 3 inch potatoes in it.  It gave the potatoes a lightly smokey scent/flavor.  They were delicious.  I want to use it for a base for potato soup/chowder next.  It has a bit of an overwhelming smoking scent when you are brewing it, but only has a mild scent and flavor when it is used as a food base.<br /><br />If you want to cut out the fat and calories from using smoked meat in your soups or just want to give your food a light smokey flavor/taste.  Try this!  I like to experiment with food and I really think this is a good product for adding flavor.

I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />This is a Chinese black tea, but it's not as full flavored as most others in the same category. I think this is do in part to the fact that it's been SMOKED! This detail wasn't in the product description when I purchased it, but it was immediately noticeable when I opened the bag. It brews quite a bit lighter than most black teas and has a milder flavor, but it definitely tastes and smells smokey.<br /><br />If you're looking for a well priced black tea that's a little different, give this one a shot.

review/text: I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.

review/text: Sugar In The Raw has been around for over twenty years and is still a great product.  Refining sugar has never made sense to me, as food is best when minimally processed.  Unlike brown sugar, which is made of white sugar and molasses recombined, raw sugars are not separated and recombined.  Sugar In The Raw, unlike brown sugar is not sticky and easy to measure.  Less processing of foods preserves more of a foods vitamins and minerals in their original form.  Sugar In The Raw makes fine tapioca and pumpkin pudding and requires no additional time.  tapioca made with raw sugar is slightly darker looking and richer tasting.  Makes good hot chocolate when mixed with powered baker's chocolate and milk.

review/summary: Bad packaging for good product - hardens into bricks
review/text: The sugar itself I love.  I switched to this product when we decided to cut refined sugar out of our diet - and I use it in cooking as well as to sweeten coffee and put on hot cereal in the morning.  I especially like it for cooking - the result is a little less sweet than when using an equal amount of refined sugar, with a very pleasant taste like a faint touch of brown sugar.  It's great for sugar cookies and other baked goods that get rolled in or sprinkled with sugar - makes a nice crunchy topping.<br /><br />However, I had been buying it in plastic-lined envelopes that kept the sugar soft and fresh until I opened the package.  These boxes are horrible.  Every time I open a new one, I get a solid brick of hardened sugar that has to be microwaved and broken up with kitchen utensils, then repackaged in a plastic bag with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H9LPYK">Brown Sugar Teddy Bear Clay Disc Keeps Sugar Soft</a> to keep it soft enough to use.

Calorie count for one serving doesn't seem too bad, though realistically, one box really should give you 3 servings instead of 4. I'm pouring them into small custard cups and if you use 4, it's a pretty skimpy serving. I make it with skim milk and it still tastes good and gives me a bit of sweet when I want one. :) It's yummy just slightly set but still warm!

review/text: This product is different from deserts designed for the western palate, being less sugary sweet than one might be accustomed to. Still, this is very good, the texture is one that I look for from mochi and the filling is quite tasty! I wasn't sure what I would think of red bean but it turned out to be very nice.

review/text: I especially LOVE the Green Tea flavor -- I also like it because it is not as sweet as most Western desserts.<br /><br />I love the almost-rubbery but oh so good texture and flavors that linger -- since it is not something you just chew and swallow like a cookie, the taste and enjoyment last longer.<br /><br />And red bean curd is also healthier than that white icing that you find in between the layers of that little brown cookie sandwich (which I also love, don't get me wrong)

review/summary: Yomogi & Red Bean Mochi Sampler
review/text: The items arrived perfectly on time, however the Yomogi & Red Bean Mochi Sampler product was clearly past expiration date.  The mochi were cracked and dry, they didn't have the correct gummy texture that mochi have and the taste, although not bad, was poor.  The Japanese Green Tea Mochi, however, are perfectly fine, soft and plump.<br /><br />I believe a company that sells out these delicate items should check that they are in perfect conditions before selling the products, also because due to Amazon policy grocery items cannot be returned, even if defective as is apparent in this case.

review/text: these are my favorite snack ever and I was so excited to see them on amazon. I ordered 4 packs and when they arrived I was so disappointed because they were not fresh at all. yes they are dried raspberries but they were almost crumbling and hard to bite into-normally they do have some moistness to them. The light dusting of sugar that these berries normally have were no longer on the berry because they were not fresh. Unfortunately although 3 of the 4 packs I purchased are unopened Amazon does not take returns on these. I wouldn't suggest buying these from Amazon-you won't be happy to have wasted your money on something inedible.

Don't they think, the manufacturers of this otherwise great product, that folks who spend their hard-earned money buying blueberries, are trying to eat a natural health enhacing food?<br /><br />Why contaminate these big, beautiful berries with one of the most horrible sugars ever invented by mankind. Yes, these blueberries are bathed with High Fructuose Corn Syrup. In fact, they have so much of this Genetically Modified sugar that eating a few of them mad me cough uncontrollably! The only way I could eat these blueberries was after washing them for 15 min in running water and this was not enough.<br /><br />Worse. Where foes it say in their advertisment that this supposedly natural product is contaminated with GM HFCS? I think, we consumers, should be able to look at a lable before we spend our cash. Please do not buy this product if you are looking for a natural diet!<br /><br />Why not sweeten this product with the new US approved sweetener Stevia?

I love these beans because they are very plump and stay fresh for a long time. I ordered a different brand before I ordered these and they dried out after two or three months. These vanilla beans stay fresh for a year (I know because I used my last one a year from the first date I purchased them). The taste is wonderful and I use them in everything from buttermilk syrup to rice pudding.
