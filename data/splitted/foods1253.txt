review/summary: Dog loved it...smells like a dead animal
review/text: Yes, my dog loved this thing for the day we let him have it. However, the smell of dead animal that wafted from my dogs breath and the bone was absolutely putrid. He was a wee bit sad when I threw that smelly bone in the garbage. Love most of Merrick's products that I tried so far. Go for the Texas Taffy, and the bones that are hollow.

review/summary: this product contains sweeteners
review/text: This product contains two sweeteners: xylitol and stevia. They are natural but many people, including me,<br />don't react well to sweeteners, artificial or not.<br /><br />The list of contents should be more visible in its label because most people won't even notice the information<br />about sweeteners  as it is in such a minuscule writing. Besides, most sites don't give a complete list of  the contents of<br />Nature's Answer Platinum Green Tea...<br /><br />I used several products from Nature's Answer and I think they are one of the best companies in the market.<br />It was disappointing to find out about the almost hidden  extra contents of this green tea...  Really silly this idea of making<br />everything sweet, especially considering that this is a health product.  I didn't expect this silliness from Nature's Answer.

review/summary: Above & BEEyond
review/text: :) Well my honey recommended this for help in healing a freshly stitched up chainsaw induced wound. Well how sweet it is... it not only accelerated the process but helped take some of the sting out of the experience. I did not apply directly into the wound at first....just around the edges. I did this at night, covering up the sticky stuff with a large bandage tapped securely in place & left it on as i slept. After the wound closed i lightly applied it directly on it about every other day for a week.<br />My recovery was quick....so quick i did not need to use allot. Now i am in the next phase of my recovery, scar reduction & physical therapy & doing great. Proper wound management care is essential from day 1 until fully recovered as the better job you do the better your chances of a quick & complete recovery. So if you have your antennas out looking for something above & beeyond your standard remedy i recommend trying this sweet stuff & sticking to it :)

review/text: Pay no attention to one of the bad reviews above. This person has not clue how to cook buckwheat properly. If they burnt the pot, what does it have to do with the buckwheat? It is not the buckwheat that burnt it, but people that know nothing of cooking it properly. Great buckwheat, cook it (2:1 water/groats) for about 45 mins at the lowest setting of your burner, don't open the lid. Don't let it boil too hard as the water eveporates quickly and it will burn.<br />It should barely simmer.

review/summary: Not edible buckwheat
review/text: I bought this buckwheat months ago. I had bad experience from this one. As a relative to Russian people, this is really not close to being good buckwheat. It burns fast even when you add a lot of water: much more than 2 volume of water to 1 volume of buckwheat. The bottom of the pot burned each time I cooked the buckwheat. The smell is really bad not the typical for buckwheat. We cooked 5 of the 9 bags, hardly could eat them and tossed the rest.

We have a dye free home and finding delicious and affordable dye free snacks can be a challenge. These arrive super fast, within 2-3 days of ordering, packaged 10 roll ups to a box x 7 boxes. Great price of auto delivery makes these comparable to the regular fruit roll ups. I don't mind buying them as an occasional treat since they are relatively healthy and they taste great, I have taste tested several after the kids have gone to bed.

The main ingredients are pear, apple, strawberry, and blackberry juice concentrates and purees.  Less than 2% of the product is made using preservatives or additives.<br /><br />The rolls are sweet but also a bit tangy.  They are a smooth, flexible consistency and aren't sticky to the touch, even when they get hot.<br /><br />The sugar content is a bit high at 10 grams per roll, but they contain only 50 calories each.<br /><br />All in all... a quick, healthy, and tasty snack.

review/text: I saw these when looking at fruit snacks and decided to try them. They are 90% fruit, which is better than not, but when you get down to it, they are a sticky sugary snack that's going to stick to your teeth. Still, I figure that they are better for you than the other ones.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, they are sweet, I had one any thought they were pretty good. My kids love them and think of them as any other fruit snack or candy. I expected the texture to be grainy, and it might be a little, but barely noticable.<br /><br />Also, they don't have any shape cutouts (which are always impossible to remove anyway).

review/text: I love these, strawberry good too. I tried the fruit strips from Target, but they were SOOOPER GOOEY STICKY and it was thick and gelatiny, it just wasn't very good in my opinion. These fruit roll ups are fantastic though, similar to the original fruit roll ups, but a little granier, and tears more easily. The taste is pretty amazing, but beware for those who are allergic to citrus, because it has lemon juice in it despite it being wildberry or strawberry. Overall I recommend it for those who need an easy snack and aren't allergic to citrus or any other ingredients it contains.

review/text: I have dry mouth, and gum chewing really helps.  Sugar-free sweeteners bother my innards, so I've been looking for a gum that doesn't have any sorbitol or xylitol.  Voila!  (Or the Turkish equivalent.)<br /><br />This gum is good quality and lightly flavored.  The individual pieces are a generous size. (What looks like a stick of gum in the picture is actually a pack of 5 pieces.) I understand that this gum has a 25% market share in Turkey.<br /><br />I disagree with a previous reviewer who says that it's like chewing tar.  Some pieces started out kind of chewy, but most didn't, and they all ended up a good consistency in a short time.<br /><br />The shipping bumps up the price considerably when you buy it alone, but the pack I bought will last me for several months and I'm glad it's available.

review/text: This is my favorite brand of the new honey-whiskey craze. It almost has as much alcohol as regular whiskey but the honey takes a lot of the edge off, so you don't taste it as much. I usually have it as a dessert. I like to keep it in freezer to make it nice and thick. It would probably be really good with ice cream.

review/summary: Tasty Lunch Entree
review/text: I bought this selection to take to work for lunch.  I wanted something easy, tasty and warm versus a sandwich everyday.  This selection fits the need.<br /><br />This includes mashed potatoes, gravy and about 8 small pieces of beef. The potatoes are injected into the container...and have a hocky puck like appearance when you open it.  The mashed potatoes are tasty, but could not be confused as "homemade".  They are thick and have a good consistency though.  The beef is good...but I always want more than the 7 or 8 small pieces they give you.  The gravy is plentiful...you will have enough to cover each bite of potato and meat.<br /><br />The meaty flavor is very good.  Health conscious people should know that the calories are low (about 350 calories for this entry) but there is a salty taste to this product...I didn't check the sodium content but I am going to guess it is pretty high.<br /><br />Easy to heat, easy to eat.  I recommend.

review/summary: Tasty, but skimpy amount of meat and barely any mushrooms
review/text: This little bowl is pretty good tasting and has a nice beefy aroma. I just wish there was more meat to it. The amount of beef and mushrooms in here is not even close to what the photo suggests. It's mostly mashed potatoes in here, with what I would call sprinkles of meat. I found maybe 2 specks of mushrooms. They were not whole slices.<br /><br />Like all the other Compleats, the mashed potato is one dense block of material at the bottom of the bowl. There are about 6 or 7 small pieces of beef in here, the biggest being about the size of a thumb. The others were much smaller.<br /><br />Sodium content is modest at 25% of your daily value. Some of the other Compleats trays are as much as 40%. Recommended if you're hungry and in a hurry, but you should disregard the "created for a healthy lifestyle" wording on the packaging. While convenient (only takes 90 seconds to microwave up and does not need refrigeration), eating highly processed high sodium food is not healthy. For under $12, this is a good deal. I got mine at the local drugstore on sale for $2 a bowl.

review/text: It was very nice to find these on Amazon.  I eat them for lunch everyday but can't always find the ones I like each time I shop.  This one is especially good with some mushrooms added to the meat and potatoes.  These lunches are nice in not needing to be refrigerated and only needing 90 seconds to cook, so for eating them at work it's perfect: keep them in a desk drawer and don't create a line waiting for the microwave to finish.

I will no longer buy my dog that canned stuff ever again, now that I know what it tastes like. Thanks, Hormel.

review/summary: Worst. Bread. Ever.
review/text: I purchased 2 packages (6 loaves) of this bread based upon a diabetic nutritionists recommendation. Yes it is expensive, but it is difficult to find locally so I figured I would buy a couple in order to freeze some so I wouldn't have to re-order.<br /> The order arrived on time as promised (I ordered 1 day shipping to ensure freshness)<br />When I opened the box I found that the top loaf had been reduced to a bag of crumbs because apparently there is a shortage of packing material in California.<br /> When I tasted the bread I was very disappointed. I was not expecting a blast of flavor but I did expect, based on previous reviews, at least SOME flavor. Instead what I got was the DRYEST, most bland taste one can imagine. I might as well have been eating the cardboard box it arrived in.<br /> To be fair, it did taste somewhat better toasted with butter on it, but not very much (and that defeats the purpose).<br />Bottom line is that the bread tastes horrible, and that is only if you can find a piece of it that doesn't crumble in your fingers.

For a diabetic it is a must product, it has helped lower my blood sugar 50 points since I stated eating this bread instead of regular bread.  You might say just don't eat bread, that is impossible when you are addicted to bread.  Now if they made pasta with zero net cards my other addiction would be solved.  If they made frozen dough using the same recipe I could have pizza with near zero carbs also.  They need to franchise this product and recipe on the East Coast by this baker.

review/summary: Great product, average cost
review/text: Kool-Aid seems to be the only brand of unsweetened soft drink mix. I prefer this kind of product because I want to choose what sweetener (white/brown sugar, Splenda, honey, etc.) I'd use and the amount of sweetness. Plus, there are some drinks that are too sweet, so I love the option to tone down the sweet, increase the tart.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price ($0.23/packet). Although I've seen a packet up to $0.35 in local stores, during many sales a packet goes for $0.10. Generally, I'd expect when buying in bulk like this, there'd be a better discount.<br /><br />I guess when there's no competition, there's no motivation to offer better discounts. Five stars for the product, 1 star for the price = 3 stars.

We liked the Kool-Aid Twists Ice Blue Raspberry Lemonade much better. Even better than both, the Minute Maid was much better by far.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste. We have changed to using slightly less than 8 cups of water to make the taste richer. We have also increased the Splenda to 12 packets to make it sweeter.<br /><br />Addendum: After many taste tests now, I am increasing the rating to a 4. The problem was that this flavor really needs more sweetener. We increased the Splenda to 1 cup.

review/summary: Crunch.. yum .. crunch..
review/text: My first introduction to Doctor Kracker was through a random review on Amazon about eight years ago, dormant but not forgotten the review resurfaced when I finally saw a box of the flatbreads at my local Zabar's (perk of living in New York). While shopping I spotted them so of course my curiosity escalated and I took a box home, I love pumpkin and cheese, so these were totally up my alley, a few years later and I'm a still huge fan, in fact I'm munching on the now, watching Japanese Iron Chef on TV now, figuring I should review something that I'm so wild for.<br /><br />These offer a major crunch, you almost have to chew these like a Viking with gusto but they are oh so good, the cheddar is quietly baked into to the batter with a few extra sprinkles on top and it provides a lightly salty and crispy background for the nutty pumpkin seeds which are sprinkled throughout each large slab, you can barely taste the cheese, just the salty residue really as these are nice and healthy, each packs 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per 100 calories ( 8 per box). This is a great treat to enjoy with beer if you want to go hang out with friends, or a nice piece under some creamy French Bree or nice slice of cured meat, even turkey and apples can become a lunch time snack with this flatbread under as it's sturdy enough to be a part of a meal. For me these make for a yummy bite, I can never get enough and I finish a box in no time, these are subtle but so refined that they beckon for me to keep coming back, anytime I'm at that store I have to get these because it's impossible to resists what awaits inside. These do not taste like junk food, they are very basic yet complex, at first they hardly taste like anything but the more you eat them the more you want, so keep some on hand once you start them.<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/text: These are excellent crackers for someone on a low carb diet who also wants a tasty satisfying cracker.<br />They are very hard, and are great with peanut butter or even plain. I especially like them with cream cheese.<br />Net carbs for one cracker is about 7 grams depending upon your choice of flavor.  They are also large, about the<br />size of a small postcard, and about 100 calories per cracker.  One cracker is very satisfying due to its<br />taste, size, crunch, texture, and ability to hold whatever  other non carb stuff you choose to pile on it.

review/text: In fact, I want to have your babies.  Why?  These are the best crackers evah!  I've turned to the low carb way of life because of diabetes which means no bread, no crackers, etc.  I have really missed that crunch!  I use to be a popcorn fanatic but had to change all that due to the diabetes.  I just bought the six boxes from Amazon a few days ago based solely on the reviews here.  To my great surprise, I found them in the all natural section of my Publix.  My husband broke open the box for me in the car and handed me a small piece.  WOW!  I was in heaven!!  So crunchy and great tasting.  That night, I had one with a salad.  Put cream cheese on one.  Oh boy!  Then, as a snack, had another one later on with cream cheese again.  Just had one for lunch with tuna on it.  *sigh* I luvs you Doctor Kracker!!  I probably should only eat two a day to watch the carbs but they don't seem to spike my blood sugar at all.  Also, these are not little crackers.  They are about the size of a Poptart!  I can't wait to get my six boxes!

review/summary: If You Want Wholegrain and a Strong Crunch, This is it!
review/text: I like to keep crackers next to my chair and bed to try to help settle my tummy. A restaurant my hubby and I used to go to had this great seeded cracker that they called flatbread, but they don't carry it anymore. I decided to give Seedlander a try and it was very yummy and kept that great crunch, the next logical step was to try 2 things I love together, pumpkin and cheddar. The cheddar is baked onto the cracker along with the pumpkin seeds, which have this wonderful toasted flavor. In fact I like to break some off sometimes to really enjoy the flavor. I have been looking for lots of ways to use this wonderful cracker, as it is really wonderful as a snack but also to replace bread and make a sandwich. One of my favs is to take some albacore tuna, a bit of Smart Balance Omega Mayo and sweet pickle relish to pile onto this cracker. Wow!

It was delivered quickly, just a matter of a couple days, because it is made not 10 miles from our office.  BUT IT TASTED STALE.  That was a real disappointment and I will not order any more.  It's much too expensive to be stale in less than 3 days of my order.  Both my husband and I had it again at Jason's Deli yesterday and it tasted fresh and wonderful.  Our experience was not a happy one.  I tried to find a retailer who sells it in the area, since it is made right here, but could not find one, so I guess we will just have to find something else.

review/summary: Delicious--But Now Pricey
review/text: Good product, peanuts taste fresh, delicious, and natural. But the price has jumped $10 since I ordered them two months ago (its currently listed at $35 from Amazon).<br /><br />I don't know why its getting harder and harder to find dry-roasted, unsalted peanuts. A few months ago I found a great deal on Planters 16 oz. jars from Amazon--then the price skyrocketed. I went with these, and wasn't disappointed, but I'm not sure this is the best price to beat anymore.

review/text: My dogs always look forward to this treat. Most dogs like chicken. You don't have to worry about storage since they are freeze dried. It's cheaper and easier than buying chicken at the store, cooking it and storing it. This is not a food, it's a treat. You can also grind up the smaller pieces and spread it on top of their regular dog food.

The treats were just dry and crumbled but my dogs went crazy. You don't get very much in a bag, and by looking at Amazon's prices, they're a bit expensive. But for a once-in-a-while splurge, this is the way to go!

When I say, "come", they run as fast as they can to me!  It's also nice because you can hide a few pieces of it in their kong toy with food a mealtime.  That keeps them entertained while you eat!

review/text: All I have to do is say "chicken" and my cat rushes to her food bowl.  She loves, loves, loves, these things.  And I like it because it is made in USA, a good protein source for little obligate carnivore, easy to give to her, and there's no messy residue to clean up.  I'd say that most of the bag is large to medium sized chicken chunks, and the rest is "chicken crumbs".  Even "chicken crumbs" are easily mixed with a bit of warm water to make a treat she goes gaga over.  If you are using these as dog training rewards, the crumbs might be a bit a of a waste, but you can always sprinkle it on your dog's food.  I will definitely buy this again from Amazon, as my local pet food store stopped carrying it.

review/summary: FINALLY a good freeze-dried chicken treat that isn't rancid!
review/text: RE: CATS LOVE THIS!!<br /><br />I'm thrilled to have discovered Prime Taste Treats freeze dried dog treats made from 100% chicken breast! AND MADE IN THE USA!!! My cats love this product!!<br /><br />Pet owners should all know by now to check all food to ensure it's not coming from China OR irradiated! (another brand of freeze-dried chicken treats (Beefeaters) is both from China and  irradiated! OMG! (the Beefeater's salmon is USA-made and not irradiated; they are ok and my cats love those...)<br /><br />I spent hundreds of dollars on numerous pouches of the chicken PureBites only to find rancid, slimy pieces in 3 of every 4 pouches I purchased, so much money wasted tossing those pouches out, OR PureBites will refund, using the excuse that "all fat can't be removed from the chicken, so it's normal to find rancid pieces"  but that puts it on the customer to send the bag back to them for a refund. Too much work so I gave up - until I found Prime Taste Treats today!<br /><br />These Prime Taste Treats have a large window on the front so you can see the actual pieces inside; pieces of nice white chicken chunks that easily crumble down to "cat-size" with my fingers without encountering greasy slime like I did far too often with PureBites....This product proves that it IS possible to eliminate all the fat IF one uses a good processing plant!<br /><br />I will continue to feed this to my cats as a daily treat. Cats are obligate carnivores so pure protein is a great treat or supplement for them! (but not to be used to replace a meal because it lacks taurine which is essential for all cat food. This is a "treat", so make sure you are feeding a complete cat food along with these..)

review/summary: Made My Dog Projectile Vomit
review/text: I really wanted to like these treats as all the puppy training manuals say to use freeze dried liver treats when training counts.  I gave my puppy (a 16 week old, 25lb. German Shorthaired Pointer) 3 of these treats, broken into small pieces, during a training session.  He projectile vomited within 5 minutes of receiving these treats.  Another reviewer posted the same issue under a different listing (both his dogs vomited immediately) of this product and the manufacturer replied stating it was lack of water or a beef allergy.  Not the case with my dog, who has access to fresh water all day, and has had plenty of exposure to beef.  He only gets premium, all natural wet and dry food and treats (Nature's Variety Instinct and Nature's Variety Prairie).  All his treats are natural and holistic and are fed in limited quantities as well.  I see nothing on the label stating a puppy should not receive these.  I was going to try to give them to him again in a few days, but the other reviewer with the same issue did that, only to have his 2 dogs vomit again.

review/text: I have a 3 1/2 month old German shepherd/lab and his trainer introduced these treats when training him in chaotic envrionments such as in the store and outside. One whiff under the nose he sits and makes direct eye contact with me. The trainer calls it "puppy crack". He LOVES it! I only use these in certain circumstances, otherwise at home he gets a cheaper treat. You can break up the liver ones into quite a few pieces. My trainer said not to get the chicken ones because they break into powder. Overall,the liver will last much longer (since they are quite pricey) and I highly recommend!

How does one know exactly how much mix is contained in one scoop? My guess is about 1 1/2 tablespoons per scoop based on my taste tests. There isn't as many java chips in this mix as the starbucks drink, but it tastes good especially if you doctor it up. I added about a tablespoon of nutella to my drink and that made it perfect! 5 stars for taste but i am deducting 1 star for the missing scoop.

It's loaded with chocolate chip pieces and the coffee flavor itself is delicious. A definitely recommend to anyone who loves the java chip flavor or blended coffee in general.

review/summary: Carefully enjoy
review/text: These little curled lamb treats can make decent treats for most dogs. They soften up quickly, unlike rawhide, yet can be enjoyed longer than a biscuit because of their consistency. My only caveat would be to watch the aggressive type eaters carefully, (especially large breeds), as they may try to wolf these down whole or barely damp only to end up gagging. Fortunately they usually gag right up. They also lack the corners of hard rawhide strips which saves the esophagus on the way down (and back up), should they try and swallow it whole. I think they are best for small and medium dogs who do not try this but rather attempt to gnaw, dampen and enjoy the treat more normally.<br />Overall, for healthy normal eaters, they are a nice treat and a good change of pace.

The others, once you add shipping to the sale price, seem to me to be over-priced.<br /><br />First there were M&Ms, which are good.  Good enough for Reese's to take the idea and expand on it.  And Reese's Pieces are so good that M&Ms stole the idea back - and doesn't do peanut butter anywhere near as well as Reese's!  Like M&Ms, Reese's Pieces are little dots with a candy-coating; inside is a creamy peanut butter.  They don't compare with M&Ms Plain, but they beat the peanut butter out of M&Ms Peanut Butter!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

I can't imagine using anything else now and will certainly buy again. My only minor complaint is the plastic bottle, but I transferred it to a dark glass bottle upon opening.

review/summary: Flavorful oil, nice bottle!
review/text: I really appreciated the packaging of this oil because the edge of the bottle opening is slightly curved in such a way that there's no drip (for me at least) after pouring oil out of the bottle, which has been a constant problem for me with other brands of olive oil I've bought from the supermarket because I don't transfer the oil to another container (like you see on cooking shows) - I keep things simple and just pour it out of the original container. Now I don't have to worry about oily surfaces and sticky bottle sides. It's just a little thing, but it makes things so much more worth it in considering whether I want to go for this brand or another.<br /><br />Taste was good as any olive oil I've had. Upon opening the bottle, I had a bit by itself and I was extremely happy with the quality. Better than what's in the grocery aisles. It's not that much more expensive than bigger brands, so I'd definitely recommend trying this brand out at least once. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
