review/text: As a previous reviewer said, one box makes a lot of falafel. It tastes great leftover though. Mine kept well in the refrigerator for a week; I sealed it in some run-of-the-mill tupperware. The mix is mildly spiced, but I think it will appeal to most palates.<br /><br />A minor warning: I managed to fill my kitchen with smoke while making a batch using the broiling directions listed on the box. The instructions tell you to brush both sides of a falafel patty with olive oil and then broil them. This is all well and good, except olive oil has a very low smoke point. The falafel baked just fine for me, and it still tasted great. I made the rest of the batch using vegetable oil with no discernible difference in taste or texture. My broiler doesn't have "high" and "low" settings, so perhaps baking at a lower temperature would solve this problem.<br /><br />Really tasty - will definitely make again.

review/summary: Did not hold shape
review/text: I tried to make a big batch of this and it was a complete failure. I've made Casbah brand falafel for years and NEVER had a problem.  I followed the instructions properly, but when the "balls" were put into the hot oil, they completely fell apart.  The "beach sand" comparison made by another reviewer was bang on.  I tried to salvage the mix I had made up by making little patties and frying them in a skillet, but they fared no better.  Made a good faith effort, and got inedible results.  I'd love to know how anyone else followed their instructions and got them to hold together.  I bought a bulk amount and have lost my money.  I'm SO going back to Casbah.

review/text: I love this mix for when you want a quick falafel. It is not better than a homemade one, but when you don't have the time or ingredients around, this is a great substitute!

review/summary: Hit or Miss
review/text: I've had these a number of times and my most recent attempt was an utter and complete failure. The amount of water recommended wasn't enough to hold my falafel balls together and they came out dry. I suspect this is why they fell apart in the oil. Also half an inch of oil in the pan is really insufficient if you want to make normal sized falafel balls. Even at one inch in diameter you would have to flip them over to cook both sides of the ball. This also results in a partially cooked interior.<br /><br />Taste wise these are rather unspectacular. Any half decent restaurant falafel will be better than these. But then again what do you expect for something that comes in a powder form.<br /><br />I say try making your own from scratch. It's not easy to find a perfect mixture that won't disintegrate, but when they are good they are divine.<br /><br />In the meantime I'll continue looking for another prepackaged falafel option.

review/text: I love the combination of the iced tea and lemonade.  Everyone who tried it at my house asked me what exactly this was because they wanted to buy it too. I make it directly over a full glass of ice, using the smallest setting.  The ice will melt a little, and if I have left-over room in the top of the glass after brewing, I top it off with either some more ice or more water.  It has just the right amount of sweetness. It's a little sweet without being overly sweet.  My daughter-in-law drinks it either hot or iced. We were horrified when we tried to buy it at our local kitchen store, when we were informed that it is seasonal, and they no longer have it in stock! So, Amazon to the rescue!

review/text: Wow, I've never not liked one of the coffees or teas that are made for the Keuring...at least until now.<br /><br />Weak and flavorless and is the best I can say about this. You get neither a good tea taste nor a lemonade taste. You do seem to get a bit of a bitter after-taste though. This may be due to how much the ice cubes melt during production. Frankly it is easier and less expensive to have a gallon of a good brand pre-made combination drink on hand.<br /><br />Brewed on 8 ounce setting as per manufacturers recommendation and it still made an extremely weak glass of tea.  Approximately 68 cents a glass.<br /><br />*SAMPLE PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER*

review/summary: Thank you, Riedel!
review/text: I have been enjoying single malt scotch since back in the '70's. For a long time the selection available here in the States was quite limited. My normal choice of glass was a brandy snifter. The recent explosion of available brands of single malt caused me to branch out and try a couple other varities with mixed results. After reading the descriptions of some varities online, I found I just wasn't sensitive enough to discover the aromas and tastes they were experiencing. I was just about to settle back with my old favorite, (Can I name brands here?), Glenfiddich, when I discovered the availability of specialized tasting glasses while searching online.<br /><br />I never thought the shape of a glass could make so much difference! These specialized glasses have opened new doors, or should I say new bottles, to the single malt scotch world for me. Is it the curve of the rim? I don't know. I can't say that I am smelling and tasting all of what the 'experts' claim is there, but they do make a difference. If you have any interest in exploring single malt scotches these specialized glasses are a must have.<br /><br />And I may be bordering on sacrilege, but I've tried a little rum in them and they seem to work for that spirit also.

review/summary: Wonderful glasses
review/text: I bought these as a gift for my a friend of my husband. His favorite drink is single malt scotch (he usually drinks McCallum.) My husband and he often have a glass together at the end of the day and we thought the glasses would be better than the coffee mugs they sometimes use!<br /><br />I wasn't sure why this glass was specific to whiskey or scotch. I did look for information about the Riedel types and shapes. According to the manufacturer, the company did research with the help of master distillers in Scotland. This resulted the design of a glass that is an elongated thistle shape on a truncated stem.  The design incorporates a small, slightly out-turned lip which directs the spirit onto the tip of the tongue, where sweetness is perceived, and serves to emphasize the elegant creaminess of top quality single malt whiskey.<br /><br />There are two lines of this glass, the Sommelier and the Vinum. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DZDTZ">Riedel Sommeliers Series Single Malt Whiskey Glass</a> is also available here at Amazon. The Sommelier items are more expensive as the upper part is blown into a mold and the the stem and base are hand-crafted.<br /><br />The Vinum is machine made and more reasonably priced. The Vinum looks very lovely and is very nice and thin, there are no seams on the bowl, stem or base. (The Reidel name is etched on the bottom of the base.) It is made of over 24% lead crystal. The glass is 4 1/2 inches tall. There are 2 glasses per box, they are hand wash only. The box is sturdy and was in perfect condition when they arrived (I worried about this a little bit with such thin glasses.)<br /><br />My husband feels the glasses indeed improve the taste of the scotch, but he isn't sure why. He also said it also makes you appreciate the whiskey more and pay attention to it when you are drinking with the special glasses. They made a beautiful gift with a bottle of his favorite drink. You won't be disappointed in these.

review/summary: OK, but not as good as Glencarin Whisky Glasses
review/text: These are extremely well made but whisky seems to taste much better in the Glencarin glasses. I have 8 of the Riedel Vinum Single Malt Glasses and about 30 of the Glencarin whisky glasses.  I have used these at about 10 different tastings and with the except of one person (and then only with one bourbon) every preferred the Glencarin glasses.<br /><br />As an experiment, I had people put the same whisky from the same bottle in a Riedel Vinum Single Malt Glass and a Glencarin whisky glass.  The difference was amazing:  The Glencarin whisky glass seemed to make the whisky smoother and more flavorful.<br /><br />At my tastings I will put both glasses out for people to use and they will wash and reuse their Glencarin whisky glasses before they will pick up a clean Riedel Vinum Single Malt Glasses.  That speaks to the effect.<br /><br />Just to be clear these are very well made and do improve the tastes of the whisky put in them, but the Glencarin whisky glasses do a much better job AND they are cheaper!<br /><br />I still have 6 unopened Riedel Vinum Single Malt Glasses....not sure what I will do with them.<br /><br />My recommendation, use these:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EXF3BS">Glencarin Crystal Whiskey Glass, Set of 4</a>

review/summary: Wonderful Enhancement
review/text: On a recent stay at the Westin Kierland Resort in Scottsdale, I took part in a single malt scotch tasting sponsored by their Food and Beverage Department.  The beverage director used glasses of this shape and size, and talked about how the shape of the glass can enhance the single malt experience.  I was initially skeptical, but as soon as the tasting began I was convinced, and started looking to purchase a few for myself as soon as I returned home.  I only rarely drink single malt scotch (too expensive) but I've found my enjoyment of those rare moments increased by 100% as a result of these glasses.  They are pricey, but a wonderful way to help you enjoy your favorite single malt scotch, and I recommend them highly. Plus Amazon's prices were the best I could find when I purchased them.

review/summary: From a skeptic - the glass really matters
review/text: After attending a wine tasting where different Riedel glasses were demonstrated, I had some friends do a head to head comparison using these glasses versus the typical barware you might have for Scotch.<br /><br />Each was able to recognize a distinct difference and improvement to the experience using these glasses.<br /><br />From what I can infer, the out-turned rim causes the spirits to mostly pass over the edges of the tongue, instead of on the center, making the alcohol burn more mellow, so you can detect more of the flavors in the Scotch or other liquor.  These taste buds are not as susceptible to the burn which the middle tongue taste buds accentuate.  The bowl height and shape also allows the scents to concentrate for you to appreciate, if you like.<br /><br />I find many strong liquors taste much better in this glass, and don't need to be watered down to fully appreciate their complexity. Old fashioneds, shot glasses, etc. concentrate the drink right where you get the biggest reaction to the burn, so you miss out on the subtlety.<br /><br />So if you get the glasses, please do a head-to-head comparison, and prove it to yourself.  Pour some of you favorite liquor into this glass and have a taste, then pour it from this glass to one of the glasses you've always used. Taste again, then pour it back into this glass and try it again.  Prepare to be amazed by the result...

Obviously, these are for drinking neat rather than on the rocks. (I tend to add a half of a small ice cube - chills it a wee bit - allows that extra bit of aroma to mingle with the liquid - works for me.)<br /><br />Do they enhance the flavor of scotch over other shapes of glasses? I have no idea. It's probably more marketing than anything else.  I still dig 'em anyway.<br /><br />Just a small note: I bought these to replace a few of mine that had been broken over time. These are slightly larger than those I bought the first time around. Not by much, but noticeable. Base is slightly differently shaped. No biggie, really. Just sos you knows.

review/summary: Nicely made but not terribly effective
review/text: One of the more enjoyable (and important) aspects of the single malt experience is the nose. Whereas with wine, the nose can be complimentary or conflicting to its taste, scotch whisky tends to be mainly complimentary. Further, as a distilled spirit often of considerable ABV, the myriad components making up a fine whisky's nose can be identified and analyzed with great depth and accuracy provided it is presented in a suitable glass.<br /><br />In my opinion, sloping sides to concentrate aromas from the whisky is essential and for some reason, Riedel saw fit to omit this critical feature from this glass. From the looks of it, it hasn't gone unnoticed and they've received quite a bit of flak over it. Even they admitted that they had made a mistake. One feature that is not a mistake, however, is the curved rim. This serves to deliver the spirit to the middle of the tongue rather than the tip and will let you appreciate a wider array of flavors from your whisky but the taste is only half of the story.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of the traditional Glencairn glass and taste my whisky (and many other spirits) from it. They have the sloping sides but no curved rim, which isn't a deal-breaker since you can just pour the whisky deeper into your mouth. Some stemmed copitas have it but they're also much more delicate. One glass that has a lot going for it is the Ravenscroft single malt tumbler. It has a Glencairn-type shape AND the curved rim and features no stem of any kind. Perhaps the only thing that could be perceived as a downside is its 12 oz. capacity to the Glencairn's 6 oz. I find the Glencairn to be the perfect size for a dram.<br /><br />If you have the extra clams, you could certainly add these to your glassware collection as an experiment but if you're looking to have the best and most durable, spend your hard-earned quid on some Glencairns.

review/summary: elegant whiskey glasses
review/text: These glasses definitely bring out the best in a whiskey.  I was surprised how the flared lip seemed to make a good whiskey even smoother.  If you like Bourbon get these glasses.  Others have commented that they think the Glencairn glass is better.  I would qualify that with maybe.  The Glencairn does focus the nose a bit better than the Reidel however the Reidel's shape allows you to put your nose deeper into the glass while sipping and gives a smoother sip.  If you are trying to extract the last nuance of a whiskey, the Glencairn is the glass.  For overall sipping experience, the Reidel.  These glasses are beautifly made and have a very graceful shape.

review/summary: Superb quality and does make a difference
review/text: I purchased these with skepticism. Obviously being Riedel the quality is there and it shows. But, I was unsure if the drinking experience using this glass would be any different than say a double old fashioned. The answer is, it is. I hardly use my Waterford double old fashioned glasses anyone because the bourbon/whiskey I drink is so much more enjoyable out of these glasses. I purchased two sets of 2 and they are worth every bit of what I paid for them. Highly recommended for the person who loves a neat bourbon/whiskey.

review/summary: Habitant Pea Soup is Superb!
review/text: I grew up in Manchester, NH. My grandmother was from Quebec, and my mother and father were both of French Canadian descent.  As a result, we were all raised on Habitant Pea Soup.  It wasn't until I was an adult did I discover that pea soup was any OTHER color than yellow! We used to eat it with a little salt in the soup, and slices of white bread (unbuttered). Just as an aside, Habitant used to have a factory in Manchester right on the shores of the Amoskeag River down in the millyards where this soup was made at least as recently as the early 70s. I know, because I had a job in a nearby textile mill, and you could smell the soup cooking constantly. What a fantastic fragrance. Why they closed it, I don't know. I wish I could purchase it here in Pennsylvania!

review/text: I have loved this soup for over 60 years, and the can I bought yesterday was terrific the same as always.  I have to admit that I did recently get one can that was very thin with not much evidence of peas.  However the flavor was the same.  I have found this type of situation to be true with many packaged products.  I suspect that even though production is automated there is still the chance for an occasional anomaly.

A former boss, from Whitehall, New York, was raised with this soup and was so attached to it that I could always get on his good side by bringing some back with me for him. Thick, tasty, and satisfying, it is the perfect thing to chase away the winter doldrums. It is yellow, unlike the normal green split pea, but don't let the color put you off. Your taste buds will thank you. If you like split pea soup, this is not to be missed.

review/summary: More like pee than pea
review/text: I have loved Habitant Pea soup my whole life. When I moved to Philadelphia from Michigan in May I couldn't find it anywhere in the city--thereby increasing my desire for my "former" favorite.  Was delighted to find a way to order it through Amazon.When the box arrived I was struck by how light it was.  When I opened the first can I realized that there were no longer peas in this soup.  It used to be at least half liquid and half the most delectable peas.  You'll laugh at this, but I really feel betrayed.  Surely peas can't be that expensive that you have to eliminate them from your formerly fabulous product.  I would have given this a zero star rating, but I thought you'd think I might have forgotten to rate.Feel a little guilty donating this to the food drive at church.<br />Sincerely,<br />Pat Daniels

review/text: I've started buying Go Raw products. I'm not vegan or vegetarian but I don't eat most commercially processed foods because they're no longer natural. However Go Raw produces what I consider properly processed foods and for that I'm very grateful. I'm not fond of the two types of chips I've bought but I love, and will continue buying, their seeds. I use the Go Raw seeds for traveling, hiking, and work since I won't eat in restaurants or eat what most grocery stores carry. I follow a Weston A. Price (WAPF) diet and it's great to find properly soaked and sprouted seeds (to combat the enzyme inhibitors and make the nutrients available) that have been dehydrated at a low temperature -- the enzymes are still viable and yet the seeds are crispy and lightly salted with sea salt. I've offered them to co-workers who aren't picky about commercially produced foods like I am and they, too, find them more delicious than the seeds they can get at a regular supermarket.

review/summary: My search for perfect sunflower seeds is over ....
review/text: ... and this is it! I like sunflower seeds and have tried more than a dozen of combination of roasted vs raw and salted vs unsalted on different brands in the commercial market. These are by far my favorite.<br /><br />What's good about them? They are sprouted and then dried under 105 degrees Farenheit. (Go Raw = not roasted.) Therefore, not a trace of stale oil smell as you open the package. They are lightly salted using Celtic sea salt and the taste is really great. Also, this company (Go Raw) seems to have very good quality control. I have tried 9(!) packages in the past months and have been consistently impressed.<br /><br />Furthermore, they are certified USDA organic, so presumably better for the environment and better for you and your family. It is also reported that sprouted and raw seeds are "far more nutritious" than the oil-roasted seeds. So there is really nothing not to like.<br /><br />These sunflower seeds are good for salad toppings, which I use most of the time, but they can serve as snacks as well.<br /><br />Note however that they do taste different from the usual roasted sunflower seeds. So if roasted seeds are your thing, you might want to try the smaller packages from your local markets or Go Raw Organic Cltc Sea Salt Sunflower Seeds (2x16 OZ) before getting this pack of 3 x 1-pound bag.<br /><br />Allergy information: These are certified wheat, gluten, nut free and are vegan.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes sunflower seeds, but especially for the salad eaters.

I wonder why they add salt to it. Most organic nuts and seeds I had before are without added salt. Is it because this is sprouted? I will need to check to see if other sprouted products also have salt added.<br /><br />I don't mind a dash of salt. But again it is too much to my taste.

review/text: First, I love the fact that Go Raw processes their products in nut free/gluten free facilities and says so prominently right on the bag. That makes a big difference and was THE reason I chose this product. Thanks Go Raw and Amazon!<br /><br />The sunflower seeds are delicious right out of the bag. They taste fresh and not overprocessed. They are kind of salty and they are very high in fat naturally. The taste is pretty addictive, so I avoid snacking on them right out of the bag.<br /><br />I use them for baking in recipes that call for nuts. I soak them in a bowl with warm water for a few minutes, rinse twice, and I have a great unpredictable but yummy alternative that really tastes great in everything from blueberry muffins to whole wheat bread.<br /><br />If you're cooking for someone who has nut allergies or for a school event where nuts are generally prohibited, these fresh tasty sunflower seeds provide extra flavor and crunch in favorite recipes. (Just be sure to rinse first!)

review/text: I first discovered this tea at Panera. When I couldn't find it in my usual haunts I resorted to Amazon which, of course, had a source. It doesn't get bitter as many green teas can and has just a nuance of a smooth honey flavor.  Everyone I've treated to this tea loves it as well.

review/text: I know, candied cherries, aren't they all the same?! NO WAY!<br /><br />Our family has a LONG standing tradition, we make a fruit cake for Christmas!<br /><br />NO! It is not that nasty type of fruit cake you get in the tins or even in the package in the stores. This is a moist and delicious 5 pound fruit and nut cake that we fight over and BARELY share with our most loved friends!<br /><br />Being a military spouse, we are limited to where and what we can shop while living overseas. Trust me, the local merchants LOVE their candied fruit MORE than we love our cake! Let me tell you about that some time! $20 for 6 ounces, and I needed 2 pounds of fruit, can you say, AMAZON?! And here I am, telling you about the BEST candied cherries I have EVER had!<br /><br />The shop that these were ordered from is my favorite feature about this purchase! Feels like hometown America, when you are far from home, its nice to know you can find and order something from home! I have to say, my cake was the best we have ever had.... maybe it had something to do with the deployment we were gearing up for, but I say, its the cherries and the hometown of America they came from that made them SO good and took my cake over the top!<br /><br />THANKS! We have been back to order and will keep coming back, even when we have a choice of places to shop! Won't that be nice!

review/text: Roland Kosher anchovies in olive oil from Spain are a great buy of a really high quality fish product. The reviewer who said they are high in Sodium apparently hasn't used processed anchovies before- these are no more saltier then other canned anchovies in oil and much less then anchovies packed in salt. I highly recommend this product to anyone using anchovies for cooling, in salads, making dressings, etc. If you are concerned about sodium to the point where you cannot use a product naturally high inn sodium and additionally processed with salt, learn about that product before making comments that are derogatory and untrue in nature.

review/summary: Add some tropical fire to your next curry or even a burger
review/text: I often  make different curry dishes for my family, from lamb Vindaloo to chicken Korma, they are always favorites around my house.  The only problem is that some like it really hot and spicy while others prefer it medium or mild.  It's hard to please everyone and just adding hot sauce at the end isn't the same since the peppers and spices don't get a chance to become a part of dish as it does when it simmers for a long while.  With Rasta Fire and a little extra work everyone gets what they want.<br /><br />I often separate my curry dishes before I add the meat (for my son the vegetarian), now I just separate some more for those that like it hot.  I love hot sauce and have a dozen bottles open in the fridge at any one time.  I gave this sauce a chance several years ago based on the ingredient list.  The tropical fruits such as orange, pineapple and papaya and the spices that includes curry, tumeric, cumin allspice and annato really appealed to me.  I would rate the heat as 6 or 7 out of 10, just hot enough to hold it's own in a stew but not so hot that the flavor is over-powered by the heat.  The combination of heat, tropical spices and fruit make for a sweet and savory sauce.  Here are a few things that I've used it in (or on):<br /><br />*  Indian Dishes<br />*  Thai Dishes<br />*  Bar-b-Qued Ribs<br />*  Deviled Eggs<br />*  Chicken Wings<br />*  Burgers<br />*  As a topping for cream cheese or goat cheese appetizers<br />*  As a marinade (with orange or pineapple juice)<br /><br />I really like this sauce and always have a bottle on hand.  If you think that all Habanero sauces are so hot that they hurt, you might want to give this a try. It's really surprising how complex the taste is.

review/text: I am sorry, but this is not authentic Dutch licorice. The original Dutch Licorice, known in Holland as 'Drop', is made with Arabic Gum. However, Gustaf's is made with Wheat Starch instead, probably because it is much cheaper. That does affect the taste, as Wheat starch has a more sticky pasty texture, where Arabic Gum has a firmer and  smoother texture.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is by far the best 'Drop' I have found so far that is readily available in the USA for a decent price. Importing the real stuff can get quite expensive. So, I will be buying this again.

review/summary: For people that loves White Asparagus!
review/text: Guilty as charged. I do and have loved white asparagus since babyhood. Instead of white milk on occasions I was fed blended soft white asparagus at room temperature. By my own decree (I was very assertive back then) and later I learned the many gourmet possibilities that exist with this much understated edible. Most people being familiar with the green variety, which is not bad for I do love all things asparagus, that offers different ways of consuming. From raw to steamed to sauces to grill, the possibilities are not limited to either or.<br />Back in the old world the chinese population had a gift for chinese foods. A lot different than the ones here in US, somewhat a cultural blending with south american cuisine influence, they had the famous and much loved chicken rolled in asparagus. Really a highlight every time of the dinner.<br />This one gets a 4 and that is good enough for now for even though it is much appreciated it is not eaten with a lot of frequency or the bathrooms wouldn't be able to take for they do reveal themselves in that most basic of human function, the famous #1. Kind of a strong reminder of what one had for dinner.<br />Enough said and 4 well deserved stars for Roland White Asparagus peeled Spears, 27.8-Ounce Can (Pack of 3).

review/summary: Acquired taste
review/text: When I lived on the border of England and Wales, I had a roommate from Copenhagen Denmark, and he got some of this in his Christmas goodie basket from his Mom. At first it is a shock to the system, and I was the only American in the house that didn't spit it out. Soon I was bugging him to get his Mom to send more. It is a testament to the impression that it made that 25 years later I checked Amazon to see if I could get it here.<br /><br />Before I got home my wife and kids had gotten into the box and tried it. They didn't try a second piece. I however after the initial shock of the first piece, remembered why I liked it. And although this case will probably last me a long time, I do rather enjoy the flavor. But be warned the flavor is HEAVY on the salt and very light on the sweet. But it is a treat that you can enjoy without emptying the whole container in a sitting and wonder where it went. So... if you are adventurous, or if you remember the taste from your European adventures, try this exotic treat.

review/summary: Genuine Article
review/text: I love licorice and thought I would try this stuff out. I wondered how a double-salt licorice could have 0 mg of sodium. Well, the answer is, the saltiness is the ammonium chloride. There is no sodium chloride (table salt) in this licorice. I'm not sure that ammonium chloride is any better for you than plain old salt, but since it is 'sodium free' it appears on the surface to be a healthy choice. Bottom line: This stuff is salty. A very close friend of mine is Dutch. He's not the typical, "I'm Dutch because my grandparents came from Holland." He is the real deal. He is not even remotely interested in visits to Amsterdam, like most people are. I told him I had some Dubbel Zout (Dutch for double-salt) and he was over to see me instantly. He loved it. Where most people immediately spat it out or nearly choked on it, he was crazy about it. I think that says a lot about its authenticity. Now, as to the saltiness, if that's not your thing, I suggest not buying six tubs at first (though the price is great), but rather pick up a single tub from an import market. If you have tried the double-salt and think that all of the dutch licorice is like that, then you need to try Gustaf's Licorice Coins (which my friend refers to as single-salt). They are outstanding as well. Both the double-salt and single-salt are interesting and authentic Dutch confections and I highly recommend them both.

review/summary: Extra Salty
review/text: Its sad that most of the bad reviews are from people who don't realize what they are purchasing.  This is Double Salt Licorice, and its a very salty tasting candy (if you can call it candy).  Since its salted with salmiak, it has no sodium (but ammonium chloride).<br /><br />Anyways, when I was a kid I used to love to get rock salt and let it dissolve on my tongue and thought it was way better than regular candy, so as an adult, I have finally found what I consider to be the perfect treat, highly recommended to those people who love salt.  This stuff is pretty much perfect, I've tried many different types of Salt Licorice and along with the amazing Tyrkisk Peber, this stuff is the best (note: I prefer the harder candies not the chewy ones).  If you're expecting traditional US licorice (which mostly I don't like) then don't waste your time or money.

review/summary: A disappointment - too flat
review/text: First of all, I'm a licorice fiend - and not the so-called licorice typically sold in the US.  I grew up in Sweden with the real deal - I even bought ultra-bitter licorice sticks from the pharmacy, back when they sold that.<br /><br />My favorites range from Malaco to Fazer - with ammonium chloride filled licorice candy like Turkish Pepper at the top.<br /><br />Bassett's is the substitute of choice in the US - not much available here.<br /><br />With that said, here's what I thought about Gustaf's - and I bought a whole case.  It's too flat, it hits a very narrow band of licorice flavor - something missing to make it bloom.<br /><br />Great chewability, lots of licorice flavor, but no depth - if that makes sense to you.  Most other licorice versions that I like hit a much broader range.<br /><br />It's worth a try, but I suggest that you make this a small portion of a mixed plate of various licorice types.

review/text: These DZ licorice buttons are what are known in Northern Europe as Salmiak pastilles. Salmiak, or sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride salt) used to be prescribed as a expectorant for head colds. Sal ammoniac is also used as soldering flux to clean metal. The sugar was used to cover the very strong, corrosive taste. Those who've acquired a taste for them crave them.  All others spit them out within ten seconds. I use them as a diet aid, as two or three will put you off food for hours. Keep them in their resealable tubs as they attract water from the air.

review/summary: Love it or hate it, these are unique
review/text: If you've never tasted salty licorice, don't buy this bulk pack. It's not the same as sweet black licorice at all, and I don't blame the folks giving it one star. You absolutely need to find a $.50 roll of salmaki first, or you might wind up throwing the whole shipment out, because these are a very acquired taste. But I love them, a few at a time, and they were just what I'd been looking for ever since a friend introduced me. Best of all, they're vegan-friendly, with no glycerin at all.<br /><br />The first taste that hits your tongue feels like a salt lick; once you've melted off the outer layer the taste and texture mellows out quite a bit. They're hard but not especially gummy; they dissolve easily in the mouth. After a couple you get quite used to the taste and it's no longer a shock, more of a savory that gets you to munch some more, but it does leave the palate quite cleansed for a while. I haven't yet found a red wine or liquor these don't clash violently with, but a very acidic white works pretty well.<br /><br />The only trouble is that there are so many; I've had the 6-pack for a month and I'm not even half way through the first tin! I can't in good conscience palm them off on friends and family!

review/summary: The genuine article
review/text: This is the real deal. It's what you get when you buy it in the stores in the Netherlands. It's just the perfect double salted taste I craved for. It is excellent!<br /><br />As so many have said, this is acquired taste. I grew up with salty licorice, and this is just short of giving me the burn I so want. If you haven't tried it, be prepared to throw is all away, or give it as gifts to people you don't like. But if you have an ounce of adventure in you, try this! It will burn and sting (in my opinion, not enough). Once you get over that, it has a sweetness to it. After a while the burn will become pleasant, as will the taste. And it is sweet!<br /><br />The recommended serving size seems high to me, though (5 servings per tub). Once I've eaten myself sick, I guess a tub can last a few weeks.

review/summary: It is what it is...
review/text: If you're looking for something sweet, keep looking.  This item bills itself as "double-salt" and it definitely lives up to its self-description.  Go to your refrigerator and take a spoon full of baking soda, now let it melt in your mouth while sniffing a box of Good and Plenty.  You've now experienced the essence of the flavor provided by these double-salt licorice pieces without spending the $15.  If this is what you're looking for, I highly recommend this product.  I gave it 4 stars, because it is what is says it is.  It's just not what I was looking for.

review/summary: Very salty.
review/text: When they say salty, they are not kidding.  Ok, so its not overpoweringly salty and there is the faintest amount of sugar in it, but I wouldn't consider this to be candy and you have to search for the sugar and if you don't focus on it you will lose it.  I wish I hadn't gotten a whole order of this, and that there was a way to get a sample first.  I ordered it because its so hard to find Tyrkisk Peber.  If you want a licorice to the extreme but still be reminiscent of candy, I recommend checking that out instead.

review/summary: Too Salty for Non-Dutch
review/text: Don't buy this if you're American and you think you like salty things.<br /><br />Don't buy this if you love licorice, but have never tried Dutch double salt licorice.<br /><br />Buy this if you want the saltiness of the Dead Sea packed into a tiny drop of something vaguely resembling licorice.

review/summary: Candy and a show
review/text: I acquired the taste of this licorice the first time I tried it. I say acquired because at first I didn't like it, but a chunk of it got jammed in a molar and was for a while irretrievable. By the end of that struggle, I actually liked it. I liked it enough to buy this pack of six tubs.<br /><br />It's an awful lot. So I offered to share it with a few friends, hoping they would like it but warning them they might not. I told them I liked it, and I proved it by popping one into my mouth.<br /><br />My friends hated it. But as a joke, they pretended to like it whenever I offered it to someone else. We would all have a good laugh as the curiosity on their faces fade into confusion, then disgust. Most people spat it out and asked me, "And you actually like that stuff?"<br /><br />The people who refused to play along with the joke made it even funnier. I always warned people that the taste was very different and they might not like it. When else someone chimed in and said they didn't like it, that just intrigued people more.<br /><br />So to sum up my experience, given the amount of licorice, this item is fairly priced. Given to friends, the reactions are priceless.

review/summary: Wicked Salty
review/text: OK, here is the truth.  I rated 5 stars because it is EXACTLY what it says it is.  However, I will not buy these again due to how strong the salt flavor is.<br /><br />A little background....I was raised in a low sodium family.  I do not put salt on anything, including eggs.  So, if you like black licorice....and you put so much salt on your food it would look like a Twilight vampire if you placed it under a light due to the light hitting the salt crystals, you will probably like these.<br /><br />The best analogy I can come up with is if you put a spoonful of salt in your mouth, and a small black jelly bean, you would have the salt to licorice ratio.<br /><br />What I like:<br />The salty aftertaste lasts a long time.  It reminds me of a long drive home from the beach where you taste the ocean in your mouth.<br />The saltiness keeps me from gobbling down the entire tub....which I would do if it were regular licorice<br /><br />What I dislike:<br />The saltiness is a little bit more than my tongue is accustomed to.<br />I still have 5 more tubs to open and finish :/<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The product is exactly what it claims to be.  If you grew up with a lot of salt, these will provide you with your salt fix.  (Even though there is 0 sodium)  If you grew up with minimal salt, you may want to try the regular salted kind instead of the double salt.
