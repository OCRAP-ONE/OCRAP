review/summary: Good product, price not so hot
review/text: If you cannot find this on the grocery shelf, this is a good source.  At $1.38 per ounce, it's actually pricier than buying a box of 8 packets at my grocery store, where the price is $1.28 per ounce.  Weird.

review/summary: Excellent product; price hike sice last order
review/text: I have placed several orders for Nestles Fat Free  Cocoa & have really enjoyed the product. I was amazed, however, at the extreme price hike since my last order. All previous orders were about $25-26 for 4 canisters. This one was $44 for the identical order. I may find another outlet because of price. Thank you. Glenda Long

review/summary: Tastes great, low calorie
review/text: It's only 20 calories a serving and it tastes great. I am quite sensitive to the taste of artificial sweetners but I don't pick any of that taste up in this product. They stopped selling it at my local supermarket (Wegmans) so I order it on line now. I drink it almost every night to satisfy my chocolate craving!

review/summary: Good hot cocoa mix, but....
review/text: I usually buy Nestle's Hot Cocoa Mix in the Milk Chocolate flavor.<br />This time, I decided to try the Dark Chocolate flavor which we've<br />never had before.  My husband loves dark chocolate in all its forms,<br />but I never really cared for it.  Well, I still don't.  This is a<br />flavorful hot cocoa, but I think it's much sweeter than the Milk<br />Chocolate flavor yet not as chocolate-y; not as creamy.  This flavor<br />is OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'll<br />go back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.<br />By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix and<br />Nestle's wins, there's no contest.  After all, as they say,<br />"Nestle's makes the very best - chocolate".

review/text: There is no flavor or sweetness lost in this fat-free hot cocoa mix. There are ONLY 20 calories contained in each packet. The cocoa doesn't have a fake taste or lackluster aftertaste. It's honestly one of the best low-calorie hot cocoa drinks  I've ever had. I have yet to find a hot beverage that tastes this good and is only 20 calories...

review/text: I do not like this for its intended purpose as a hot chocolate drink. To my taste buds, this does not taste rich and chocolate-y despite its name of "Double Chocolate Meltdown".<br /><br />But - I add it every day to my morning coffee and for that purpose, it is the best hot chocolate powder around. I've tried many different brands and chocolate flavors but nothing comes close to putting this one in my coffee. It creates the perfect balance between hot chocolate and coffee, and I even make sure to take it with me when going on vacation. Love it for that!

I have shared this information with my Weight Watchers Group and everyone is elated to find a treat such as this. MANY, MANY THANKS TO NESTLE!!!!!!<br />If you want to risk a few more calories, use 1/2 water and 1/2 skim milK.  DELICIOUS!!

review/text: I start each day with a cup of hot chocolate.  I worried that this product was discontinued because I couldn't find it for some time.  But happily it became available again and I ordered enough to last a while.  I like the way it tastes and love the fact that it is like 30 calories per serving.  The low calorie count gives me more reasons to keep using it.

Amazon no longer carries it directly and the reseller is charging $44 for the same package plus shipping(down this week from $49 last week).  The cocoa is not twice as good at these prices and I wish Amazon would find a reseller whose price is somewhat closer to the old amazon price. This is a very disappointing message from Amazon to its loyal customers.  W. Grace

review/text: great purchase.  I live alone, and am the only one drinking this... wish that i could have bought it in a small size package.  Hopefully I will go through it all before the expiration date.  It is wonderful to know that you can have a "zero" point weight watchers snack in the evening.... It felt like having dessert without the guilt.  It mixes well, and was creamy and chocolately.  I would recommend to all!!

review/text: I also LOVE this stuff!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I believe Nestle's has stopped making it.<br /><br />I actually wrote them TWO letters.  They replied that the sales numbers weren't strong enough to warrant the continued production of it.<br /><br />I just can't believe this.  I think they simply tried to re-tool their formulas for some unknown reason.<br /><br />In my opinion, they should have stuck to the old adage:  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Because they did, and none of their new products compare to this flavor--I have tried several of the competitors also--still searching!

review/summary: A delicious cocoa mix
review/text: We made batches of hot chocolate for the people walking down our street looking at the neighborhood Christmas lights. Everyone loved it. The chocolate flavor doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. The best part is that hot water is all that's needed. One note of caution: The person making the hot chocolate must adjust the amount of mix to get good results. She didn't follow the directions on the can, but did a taste test for each batch.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown.  This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad.  However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed.  This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet.  It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors.

review/summary: Simply the best chocolate
review/text: I don't like truffle-style chocolates - I like high quality chocolate with satisfying centers.  See's chocolate has always been my favorite and it was easy to obtain when I lived in California.  However, you can't get them in the Boston area unless you want to go to Lord and Taylor's and pay ten dollars more than the price on Amazon.<br /><br />You can order from See's direct as well, but it's easier to order through Amazon and pay the exact same price and shipping.  Amazon has a great selection of the milk and dark chocolates and different assortments.  The only thing you might want to get that you can't on Amazon is a custom assortment, where you go through and make a piece by piece selection.  But of course, you need to already know which you love before doing that.<br /><br />This nuts and chews milk chocolate box comes with almonds, walnuts, etc drenched in silky milk chocolate and some with caramel.  You get the rum chews and others.  These are so satisfying because they are so substantial and delicious.  I bring See's wherever I visit and the reception from friends and relatives in Europe is amazing ("these are the best chocolates I've ever tried!").<br /><br />Send this as a gift...you can't go wrong.

review/summary: Red Barn Chew-A-Bulls
review/text: I purchased these at a big-box petstore locally and I was rather miffed to discover that these are not what they appear. I expected bull pizzles, but it seems all of the "Red Barn" brand Chew-A-Bulls are reconstituted and not real pizzles. They have gone to great lengths to make the product look like a real bull pizzle, but they are not the real thing and do not last like the real thing. I knew something was wrong when my dog had devoured it within minutes. Close inspection revealed flashing from the mold used to form them and the ends were smooth and uniform, unlike a real pizzle.<br />Bull pizzles aren't particularly cheap, and neither are the cheap imitations like these.<br />I truly felt like I had been deliberately deceived, enough so to warn others.

review/summary: Love Black Silk - Hate this price!
review/text: Product:<br />I've become addicted to Folger's Black Silk coffee.  It is strong without being sharp, deep without being bitter, and extremely smooth.  I brew mine very strong, occasionally adding a measure of chocolate truffle flavored ground coffee (light roast) with the usual amount of Black Silk.  This is a special treat I save for rewarding myself or serving to people who come to visit.<br /><br />Price:<br />On the matter of this price - wow.  Just - wow.  I get one 27.8 ounce container of this exact brand/flavor at an extremely expensive (not open-box) store in my neighborhood for $6.99 per container, which is under $14 for two.  The product here on Amazon is priced at $29.20 for a two-pack as I type this.  You can do much better than $15.00 per container, at least as of Nov. 10, 2010.  I just checked my local grocer, who offers online shopping and home delivery, and it's still $6.99 there.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br />Shop at your local grocery store and find this coffee.  Even $9 per 27.8 oz. container is worth it, but I'm sure you can do better than that in your usual stores.  I'm uncertain why Folgers would jack the price up so much here, but aside from this sales tactic - the coffee itself is magnificent, rich, and very smooth.

review/summary: Very Good.....But Not As Strong As Expected
review/text: I recently picked up a can of this coffee at the local Walmart.  As a self confessed coffee fiend, I am always on the look out for something new and promising to try out my taste buds on.  Admitting that, who could resist something with a name like Black Silk.  No doubt about it, this dark blend is very rich tasting and smooth as many other reviewers have mentioned.  But unfortunately strong is not an attribute that I can attach to it.  Actually for something as dark and an finely ground as it is, it's my opinion that it quite surprisingly lacks a real wallop. Don't get me wrong, it brews a nice rich dark cup of coffee that is very smooth and almost devoid of any real bitterness.  But if you are expecting something as strong as the dark roast it is implies, I suggest you may want to look elsewhere.  It really is aptly named at Black Silk, for it is indeed wonderful smooth, but not at all that strong compared to other dark roasts I have tried.  Folgers Gourmet Blend as well as Melitta's dark roast are much stronger than this.  In conclusion, I recommend this for the discerning coffee drinker that prefers a smooth dark cup of coffee with a rich taste, but not too much belt in it to really pop you out of any bed in the morning...

review/summary: Smooth as Silk; a tad too Fine
review/text: Folgers Black Silk is a good addition to their line of average consumer coffees.  I enjoy a good cup of coffee about 12 times a day and usually buy Folgers or another brand.  When buying Folgers I split my purchases between Black Silk and Gourmet Supreme.  The Black Silk has a good taste and is easy to drink a dozen cups a day; however, my only complaint about the coffee itself is that I do not believe this type was designed to be used in a drip coffee maker.  The grind is so fine that it has a propensity to clog the filter to the point of almost overflowing.  It's a small thing but if I were to put a full complement of grounds in the filter it would run over and that would be a mess.  The Gourmet Supreme is not like that.  Regardless, Black Silk meets my simple demands and is a handy, easy to consume coffee.<br /><br />One pet peeve comment if I may.  Too many merchandisers are changing their container sizes too often.  Coffee is just one example.  The standard was one pound and three pounds.  Today, the measurements are all over the place.  Yesterday, you could buy 5 pound or 10 pound sugar.  Not so much today.  Prices increase at the same time the size shrinks.  I just do not like it.

If you like like Youban, Colombian, or any tye of dark roast I would highly recomend this. Even if you enjoy your coffee on the mellow side I would still recomend this but sugest "watering" it down to tast. Any way you look at this is a wonderful dark rost flavor.

review/summary: Good product, but I don't really like the bitter flavor
review/text: To be honest, I didn't know what to expect when I bought this.  I was looking for high-quality, and from the reviews this looked good.  There is a lot of tea in this box.  Unless you have bought this before, it is difficult to explain how much tea 160 bags is.  This is good.  The bags are not individually packaged either, but ready to drop in water right out of the box.  This is also good.  Each bag has a lot of tea particles in it.  This is also good and makes for an intense flavor, more intense than any other tea I have tasted.<br /><br />I have been used to more sweet teas though, so the bitter flavor of this one caught me off guard, and it has not grown on me yet.  Let me be clear: the product is very good, but it is a consumable, so I must also rate the flavor, and I don't like it much.  I am experimenting with sugar and milk to try find a better combination than with straight water, but the bitter aftertaste is difficult to hide.  Perhaps I just need to get used to it.

review/summary: Take it with you when you go out
review/text: I join others in saying that no other tea stands up to this one.  I'm such a fanatic user that I carry it with me in my purse at all times, so that I can have it anyplace, at any time, simply by ordering hot water. Does it bother anyone else when you go to a gourmet restaurant that they offer you run-of-the-mill tea, and then look at you as though you're crazy when you complain?  Unfortunately the portable teabag idea doesn't work at "gourmet" places where they make hot water by running it through a coffee maker, so that the tea comes out tasting like mutant coffee.  But I digress.  This tea is the best, and I've tried them all.  Don't use boiling water - let it cool down a bit - brew it no more than 3 minutes.  You should have the perfect cup that will sustain you for many hours.  Also makes excellent iced tea, but then brew it a little stronger.

For a very inexpensive simulation of this tea, try the Tetley British Blend, which is available in many US grocery stores.

review/summary: The Best Tea I've Ever Had
review/text: To be fair, I need to explain that I'm not a Brit brought up on tea, but rather a Yank who drank coffee his entire life. Due to the recent economic turmoil, the local stores decreased their SKU count and one of the victims of this cost cutting was the brand of coffee I preferred. After thinking about things for a while, I decided rather than switch coffee, I'd try tea and see. To my surprise, I enjoy tea much more than coffee. I even enjoy the preparation method either using loose tea in a dramatically over priced stainless 'ball' I bought in a moment of madness or in tea bags.<br /><br />My bias is toward a full bodied tea. Prior to trying this tea, my favorite was Twining's Irish Breakfast tea but I thought to give this a try solely on having stumbled across it and it's rave ratings while (or should I say 'whilst') browsing Amazon.<br /><br />I'm very glad I did. This tea has the body of Irish Breakfast but has some delicate flavor overtones that that offering lacks. It's a minor difference but noticeable too. The flavor overlay is slightly flowery in a good sense. It is much less dramatic than the 'hit your nose with a hammer' some Earl Grey teas sport. While one may say this aspect of it is similar to a jasmine tea, this product is much more full bodied than any jasmine I've tried.<br /><br />In addition, it never seems to have a bitter or acidic aftertaste some teas have. BTW, if you are, like I was, and used to wring the tea bag out over the cup, try doing without that step as that doesn't do anything except to increase the tea's bite or bitterness.<br /><br />My only minor issue is that this tea bag comes without strings. I don't understand how the Brits leave such a thing out. It's trivial because there is always one corner of the bag sticking up so I can grab that corner easily and get the bag out after brewing is done, but I don't get why this is missing. Well, no biggie, I suppose.<br /><br />If you like a nice hearty, but well flavored tea, try this. I'm glad I did.

review/summary: I love Yorkshire Gold BUT not the one I got from Amazon
review/text: My friend bought me a box of this Yorkshire Gold in England and I got hooked since. I drink this everyday now and it's the best tea I ever had.  It smells so good that just the smell soothes me without drinking them.  I found them in TJ Maxx, then the international section from Stop and Shop and was paying 6.99 for a box of 40.  Not cheap, really.<br /><br />I was really excited when I saw them in Amazon with such good price but the batch I got was pretty much tasteless.  With the other ones I got, I can smell the beautiful smell from the tea as soon as I pour hot water in the mug and I can smell it a few feet away.  Each bag, I pour at least 10 oz of water in my mug, yet you can re-use the bag for another 1/2 cup with same strength. Unfortunately, the batch I got from Amazon, I smell nothing even when I hold the mug to my nose.  I even thought perhaps I got used to the smell and taste, but no, as soon as I use the old ones I had, I can smell them just as the 1st time I had them.  I missed the smell and taste so much, so I started to purchase these from where else even though it costs more, it's well worth it.<br /><br />I wanted to give this a second try but have a feeling I'll get disappointed again and stuck with another 160 bags.

review/summary: A taste of UK
review/text: We first tasted Yorkshire Gold Tea when visiting family in UK a couple of years ago.  It is a nice full-flavored tea, and we decided to buy some when we got home.  It is not so easy to find stateside, but we were pleased to find it on Amazon.  I only order when I have enough other items to qualify for free shipping, otherwise it is more than I care to spend.  For me, it is one of the best black teas I have tried.  PG Tips compares, but perhaps not quite as good...and not as many memories attached, which is the clincher.

review/text: After all the positive reviews about this tea, I felt like I had to try it, and with Amazon's 20% Off deal for March, it was the perfect time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea is really, really, really bland. Not bitter or disgusting, just...blah.<br /><br />After the other British-style blends that I've tried and loved in the past (PG Tips, Typhoo, Tetley), this tea just doesn't compare.<br /><br />The box says it's a blend of Assam and another tea, but I wouldn't have guessed Assam...there's none of the malty sweetness, or the strength of the tea that I've come to expect. (Maybe a Ceylon? A really old Ceylon? Note: not a toaster.)<br /><br />Steeped for 4 minutes (boiling water), then added milk and sugar.

But now that I've tried it, I have to ask: Are we drinking the same tea?

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I thoroughly enjoy Betty's and Taylor's of Harrogate.  I had high expecations for this tea but it is quite mediocre.  Yes, it's far better than PG Tips, but frankly, I think I prefer Tetley's.  Even Lipton comes close to this Yorkshire Gold.  There's just nothing exceptional about it.  I expected to to be more like the better whole leaf teas that I enjoy.  It's just another bag of dust and fannings.  For an everyday tea, it's barely drinkable.<br /><br />Everyone has their preferences.  Some like Darjeeling, Ceylon, Yunan, or traditional blends like English Breakfast.  Some like bergamot (Earl Grey) or the smokey flavour of Lapsang Souchong or a Scotish Breakfast.  Personally, I favour a pure Assam.  It's hard to tell exactly what Yorkshire Gold is.  They say it's a blend from twenty tea gardens.  I suppose that actually means it's a collection of nearly everyone's refuse.<br /><br />Taylor's does sell better quality loose leaf teas and although I haven't tried enough of them, I'm sure they're quite good.<br /><br />Update:  I have found that this makes the most outstanding iced tea.  I highly recommend it for that.  For a cheap bagged tea, I stand by Tetley's.  But yeah, I do prefer a whole-leaf Assam, and I've got nothing against Taylor's.

review/summary: THE Best English Tea!!!
review/text: I'm not English but my mother was so I grew up a confirmed tea drinker. The British often complain that they can't get a decent cuppa in this country. Sadly true!<br /><br />I spent most of my adult life looking for a tea company that would make the strong steaming cuppa that makes everything better. If you like a good black tea, THIS is the one. I tried Yorkshire Tea for a few years and then discovered Yorkshire Gold and there was no turning back! Even my staunchly American husband wants this tea each day. This is a tea that has substance and an excellent taste. I bought the 160-ct tea bags because I don't want to risk running out, especially now that my husband is demanding a cup of this excellent tea daily. Somtimes he wants it at bedtime to soothe his soul as he does his paperwork after I've gone to bed.<br /><br />I tried PG Tips, Red Rose, and other prominent English brands but although they were a distinct improvement over Tetley and Lipton teas (gag!), they are no match for Yorkshire Gold. I have found MY tea. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Come to think of it, I believe it's time for a steaming cuppa on this rainy day! Cheers!

review/text: I chanced across this stuff at a store that carries odd lots and overstocks, and now am trying to find out where I can keep a steady supply going.<br />I prefer loose tea, but even in a teabag this Yorkshire Tea blew away anything I had tried before, and sadly to say, my entire stock of other tea will be very hard to use up, because it doesn't even taste like tea by comparison. Even other brands of English tea taste like hot dishwater in a side-by-side comparison.<br /><br />Interestingly, this tea is strong without being bitter, and whereas it is made to stand up to milk, it is quite good without as well. I will be showing a local merchant the barcode and asking if they can locate the loose-leaf variety, and if all else fails, ordering it online.

Because it is the best tea for milk tea people does not mean it is the best tea for all tea people everywhere, tea has many different faces.  Mr. Assam Tea made some unfair, and I would say untrue criticisms of this tea.  I'm sure he was disappointed, but I suspect his disappointment was not a question of quality but rather of having selected the wrong product - wishing for apples and accidentally purchasing oranges.

review/summary: Top-notch British Tea
review/text: Experienced drinkers of black tea usually discover those from the British Isles. After tasting them, American brand teas seem second rate. There is a similarity in taste and aroma of British teas, yet there are subtle differences, much like red wine.<br /><br />I've made it a point to try as many British tea brands as are available in specialty shops or on line. In my opinion, Taylor's of Harrogate Yorkshire Gold is a cut above the rest. Yorkshire has a red label as well that is more common and less expensive, much like PG Tips. Yorkshire Gold, however, brews a consistently fine cup of tea, cup after cup, exciting the taste buds with its masterful blend. A splash of milk is advised to make the tea more mellow. Just the thought of it makes my mouth water.<br /><br />How about you?

review/summary: Price is meaningless; quality is everything
review/text: Over the weekend I had hot tea at two restaurants, the one a restaurant in a 5-diamond hotel, the other a national chain that features large portions and small prices.  In each case, the tea bag had to be dipped, squeezed and cajoled into yielding a single cup of decent (i.e. not very dark) tea.  Yorkshire Gold is not all that expensive, but each tea bag yields spectacular flavor and great quantities of rich, dark tea.  You only need one bag for a pot.  I usually drink it by the mug and a single bag yields at least six large mugs of tea.  So forget price.  The cheap tea yields tepid yellow water; Yorkshire Gold (and the standard Yorkshire tea as well) yields strong, dark perfection.<br /><br />Other reviewers point to the fact that Yorkshire Gold is particularly good with sugar and milk.  It does not become bitter with the addition of sugar as some tea does.  I'll take their word for that.  I drink it with milk and Splenda and each cup is consistently delicious.  They also describe it as 'malty'.  Fine.  I can only say that it tastes perfect.  Not too much of this or too much of that.  Quintessential tea.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for carrying it.

I've had a standing order with Amazon for years for PG Tips which I also love.  Recently, I visited my mum in the UK with my American wife.  She commented on a cup of tea she had at one of my mum's bingo nights(!)  It happened to be Typhoo.  So when we got back I bought some Typhoo and, on a whim, some Yorkshire tea (both from Amazon).  My wife prefers the Typhoo over the PG and, I have to say, I prefer the Yorkshire over the PG.  I'm quite amazed.  I love this stuff.  Very robust but not stringent.  My cups of tea have that orangy colour that I like.  As the name implies, Yorkshire tea is sturdy and uncomplaining.  I live on a rural area with water drawn from a well.  The quality varies and my PG cuppas sometimes suffer but the Yorkshire always tastes right.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still a big fan of PG as well.  But Yorkshire may have knocked it off its pedestal.<br /><br />Hmmm!

review/text: We love this tea.  You can brew it strong and it is never bitter.  Let steep with a hat on the cup (after warming up the cup of course!), ideally letting it steep (with hat) while the cup stands in a pot of not-quite-boiling water - I suggest at least 5-minutes!  Then adding a few slightly rounded teaspoons of sugar and an ounce of whole milk.  Summer or Winter - just the best tasting tea I've come across and I've tried *many* over the years.  The only thing which would rival is a loose tea - Orange Pekoe we found in Maryland.<br /><br />But ordering over the Internet - keeping a good supply has been one of the wondrous advantages of a connected world.
