review/summary: Worst Green Tea Ever
review/text: This is the worst green tea I have ever had. Don't be fooled by the pristine picture on the packaging. This tea is made in China--I doubt where this tea is grown looks anything like the picture. I try not to buy food products from China considering how polluted it is. This may be "organic" but the water and air in China is toxic so it doesnt really matter. The taste is all off and it leaves a sour/bitter taste in your mouth. The tea bags are made of a cheap brown material. Overall this product is bad.

review/summary: Terrific tea, but you may want to try a different seller than ARRAM
review/text: This is delicious tea.  I have purchased it in the past for myself and as a gift for someone who says it is her favorite tea.<br /><br />That said the seller I tried to purchase from, ARRAM Traders, is a bit strange.  I placed an order, but the order remained listed as "shipping soon" with a wide range on the estimated arrival date. Since my purchase included a gift, I wasn't sure if shipment would arrive in time so I emailed ARRAM Traders and said I wanted to cancel and told them why. (I thought I would go online and try to track down another source.)<br /><br />Shipper contacted me saying they had already shipped. I replied that I had only cancelled<br />because shipping was vague, and so was happy that it might arrive soon afterall. Asked, if they had any estimate of arrival time. Afterall, UK delivers to US all the time and they should have some I idea based on previous deliveries to the States.<br /><br />ARRAM Traders said they couldn't tell me anything about a delivery estimate and chose to cancel the order.  Very strange.  I suspect that they were out of stock, had not actually shipped the tea at all and were not sure when they would ship, if ever.  Otherwise, they should have been able to tell me when they shipped and, based on other shipments made to US, estimate delivery (a week, two weeks....whatever).<br /><br />So if you like a brightly flavored tea and can find it, I recommend this one highly.  It really tastes like pineapple and grapefruit and is delicious hot or cold.<br /><br />And, please, if you find another source, please let me know.<br /><br />FOUND A NEW SOURCE: BritishMart and look forward to receiving this tea.

The green tea has a hint of pineapple flavor and finishes on a lovely grapefruit note. The flavors are not overpowering, but definitely discernable. It is refreshing and leaves me looking forward to my next glass.

review/summary: Sticky situation.
review/text: Don't get me wrong, when it comes to taste these are by far the best me and anyone that has tried them has had, but it was waaay to sticky. I don't know if it was from shipping or from the factory, but when we opened the package to split it into smaller bags to freeze, it came out in one solid wormy blob. Then when we laid it down on the paper towels, to try and separate the blob, it stuck to it and was very had hard to get off so we could eat 'em. I would be hesitant about ordering another batch if they end up being this sticky again. 5 stars on taste, look, and size: 2 stars for stickiness and hard to separate. :)

review/summary: Easy to prepare; good lemongrass flavor
review/text: As prepared, this instant noodle soup is more noodle than soup.  The three components (noodles, flavor powder, flavor oil) are packaged separately so you can adjust them to your taste.  Hot water, a couple of minutes in the microwave, and it's ready.  The lemongrass flavor is pronounced but not overpowering, the chili flavor is more muted.  Heat lovers will want to have some Sriracha, Mongolian fire oil or another Asian hot sauce handy.  The overall impression was rich and satisfying for a quick lunch or snack.  It would also serve as a good base to build on if you happen to have add-ins, such as fresh cilantro, sliced chilis or scallions, some sauteed cabbage or a leaf of Thai basil, to put it over the top.  You could also make it with beef or chicken broth.

review/text: Let me start by saying that I can't stand hot chocolate mixes that you add water to .. for me, it must be made with fresh milk!  I recently read some online reviews on hot chocolate and this brand received rave reviews.  I've tried both the organic and the old world and both are fabulous.  The organic is a powder mix and the old world is chocolate shavings. I guess I'd say the old world is more intense and rich, but you can control the strength by how much you add to your hot milk. Both are definately worth the extra money and makes a nice holiday gift (with a couple festive mugs).  You can also find this brand at Whole Foods Market.

review/text: I like hot chocolate and I drink a lot of it.  Naturally, I have experimented with many different hot chocolate mixes, including the big national brands.  Lake Champlain hot chocolate is my favorite. The Organic and the Old World are very good, but Traditional is my absolute favorite and I used to make special trips to out of the way stores just to get it. The Aztec is an interesting spicy change of pace. Sometimes when supplies run out I have had to make do with other brands and you can just tell the difference if like a really chocolaty taste. I am glad that Amazon is finally stocking it.  Try it and compare.  Try it for baking your favorite chocolate desserts.  Their chocolate bars are very good as well.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SNYFAM">Lake Champlain Hot Chocolate Mixes</a>

review/summary: Cocoa Mojo : )
review/text: I was very lucky to receive a gift package of Lake Champlain hot cocoa mixes. Very lucky. The three varieties included were: Traditional, Mocha, and Aztec. Three wonderfully chunky one pound cans of hot cocoa mix. Oh, boy! This is an all-natural product without additives or preservatives. The Lake Champlain company has been reverentially producing chocolate goodness from its factory in Vermont for over 25 years. They offer a variety of chocolate indulgences, including gift baskets and gift samplers. In addition to the addictive hot cocoas, they also tempt you with truffles, caramels, chocolate bars and other items of divine decadence. The hot cocoa mixes are rich and satisfying, made with milk and soothing to the soul and the senses. The flavors of the mixes are so full-bodied that I even added spoonfuls of the hot cocoa mix into the batter for brownies, cookies, cakes and etc. I also made my own gourmet mocha madness mixes by combining the hot cocoa dry mix with instant coffee granules and powdered creamer. I had my own private stash at work, and the scent of my cocoa-powered coffee creations had others asking what I was drinking. I was benevolent and shared some of the mix. I think I started something ; )

review/summary: Coffe shop quality capuccino at home
review/text: I love coffee. Usually I would not recommend Maxwell House as I consider it a "supermarket brand". I was very surprised with the quality of this cappuccino. My wife loves it too!<br /><br />Contrary to instructions, we brew milk first then the espresso, this makes it look very nice, especially on a transparent cup. The taste is smooth and velvety, with low acidity and aftertaste. You can buy extra espresso T-Discs separately and brew an extra shot if you really like your coffee bold (like I do).<br /><br />In about a minute, you have a cappuccino that is as good as that of many coffee shops. Yes, it is not nearly close to making my personal list of best coffees I have tested, but you can't beat the convenience and cost. We also use it a lot to entertain guests at our house. Works great with any dessert.<br /><br />Instead of buying them one box for 6 coffees at a time, this 5-pack from Amazon really saves us money. Each set comes with 16 T-Discs: 8 espresso and 8 milk. So this 5-pack will be good for 40 cappuccinos.

review/text: This cappuccino is very good and tastes almost as good as Starbucks Latte Primo, T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers, 8 Count Packages (Pack of 2). The cream foams up well in the Tassimo machine. The only difference in taste between this Cappuccino drink and the Starbucks Latte Primo is that the coffee flavor is slightly stronger in the Starbucks product. Also, with the Cappuccino you brew the coffee first and then use the milk disc. With the Starbucks Latte Primo you brew the milk first then the coffee.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a bargain buy. As long as you are not looking for a slightly stronger coffee flavor, I'd suggest purchasing this instead of the Starbucks brand as both products use expresso coffee and milk discs.

review/summary: Bland and uninteresting pasta sauce
review/text: Classico pasta sauces are my favorite at the supermarket, but this particular variety is a miss. I like my sauces to be chunky and full of flavor. This one is neither. I can't taste the "fire roasted" flavor in the tomatoes or the garlic. It's pretty bland as far as pasta sauce goes, tasting barely better than tomato puree out of a can. There isn't much flavor to this sauce at all, except the tanginess of the tomatoes. I had to add some red pepper flakes and black pepper to try to perk up my rigatoni.<br /><br />On the plus side this sauce, like all of Classico's, is all-natural and free of artificial additives. It is low in calories: 50 calories per 1/2 cup serving (10 from fat) and 400mg of sodium (17% recommended daily intake). It comes in a nice and thick glass jar that I re-use for storing spices and other food.<br /><br />I won't be buying this flavor again. I recommend Classico Traditional Favorites - Pasta Sauce Italian Sausage with Peppers & Onion- 24 oz instead.

review/summary: Very spicy, a little too sticky and moist
review/text: I received a very well packaged (and promptly shipped even) package of the Habanero Jerky from Mahogany Smoked Meats.<br /><br /> The jerky itself it obviously made from good meat (vs some of the garbage you'd get from Oberto or whomever). The initial smell is excellent. An aroma of pepper and brown sugar.<br /><br /> However, the Jerky itself is somewhat sticky. The pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together, so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore. After you're done, your hands are all sticky. My guess is if they manufacturer spent a little longer in a dessicator, we'd have a drier product that tasted just as well.<br /><br /> As for how spicy. Well, my lips are burning. I like that. I really love Habanero (and in fact grow several varieties at home). This isn't some &quot;slightly spicy&quot; product with the name Habanero in it to make it seem macho. It will scorch your mouth. In my opinion, scorch in a good way.<br /><br /> The price is great. You'd spend that much at any store, buying a far lower quality of jerky, and just try finding habanero ANYTHING at Safeway.<br /><br /> Kudos to Amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list. Additional kudos to Mahogany Smoked Meats for having such a wonderful product.<br /><br /> I've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky (I guess it's the sugar?), and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves.<br /><br /> Definitely recommended.

review/summary: Get some of this right now!
review/text: I happened to run across this sauce in a local grocery store and picked it up on a whim. Used it on some chicken thighs on the smoker (though I didn't cook 'em slow--just under an hour at 375F). This sauce must have opium in it, it's so good. The honey caramelizes up quite nicely, and wonder of wonders: it's not overly salty! I actually added a smidgeon of salt after the first time I cooked with it! Now what I do is let my chicken pieces sit in it for 1-3 hours, having added just a touch of my favorite carne asada seasoning ('cuz it's REAL salty), then baste it at 20 minutes, and again at 40 minutes. Comes out quite sweet, and the garlic is not at all overstated. Do yourself a favor & give this a try; I don't think you'll be disappointed. Also nice is the soft-pack style container, which allows you to squeeze out any air when you're putting the unused portion into the refrigerator (I typically use about half a pouch for seven to eight large chicken thighs, but this could probably be stretched just a bit) Good Stuff, Maynard!

They wanted me to avoid ever purchasing this item again for anyone else. I was shocked and surprised because you received so little product for the price and then it is stale on top of it. Will never purchase anything from Broadway Basketeers again!!!

review/summary: My daughter really liked this!
review/text: I bought this as a study gift for my daughter and she really liked it!  She is away at college and she really enjoyed the nuts and fruit.  It was a nice change from other snack gifts that load up with sugar and other not so healthy things.  This snack box allowed her to have something to snack on while providing some level of nutrition and she really enjoyed the quality of the items included!

I've done several taste-tests and it apparently tastes the same as Equal, but the listing on Amazon should have said that it isn't Equal.  That's why I didn't give it five stars.

review/summary: Sweet-mate was a sweet deal
review/text: Not sure if I'm lucky or it was just a fluke with everyone else. But I've bought this brand for a dollar at my local dollar store and it tastes almost identical to equal. No it wasn't equal but if you look the same ingredients in this is the same as in equal. This price comes to a penny a pack. Which is amazing considering I was paying 1 dollar for fifty. As for as the product in the box. Not a one was out of place or damaged. Took the whole box of packets out and dumped them on the kitchen table to make sure. And not one small grain of the Sweetner was present. Packages was all sealed and put neatly in the box. I  however do suggest that you save a smaller box or bowl to place maybe fifty in bc this box is fairly large to be sitting on the counter or table.  Just keep in a dry place and it should last you a good long while. This product was made for my Lipton sweet tea. Thanks a million seller. Don't be affraid to order this product. You will not be disappointed. I'm ready to order another box and haven't even used one packet out of the box I just received. Hope this helps anyone. Oh one more thing. If your really really really picky don't bother with off brands such as this. You will never be happy. Even though to the less picky it tastes just like equal. Please know one take offense to that. You know your tastes . I sure don't. Some are easy to please . Others are hard. Either way it's surely your choice.  Again don't hesitate to give it a try. If you just try it at your local dollar store. Then if you like it come here to buy from this seller. Oh one more thing you may wonder. No I don't own a business to use this it. It will be totally used in my kitchen for sweet tea and doing a little of sugar free baking considering I'm a diabetic. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps everyone.

review/summary: Bad Idea Package Leaking Badly
review/text: I purchased this item hoping to buy a large amount of artificial sweetner. The box arrived in a larger box of other item. When I opened the large box I found the powdered sweetner all over the other items. When I opened the smaller box of sweetner I found hundreds of packets of the sweetner with several of the little paper containers leaking. The paper packets were not broken, they just were not glued shut. At the bottom of the box there is a two or three inch thick pile of the stuff-just sitting in the box. This of course, is spreading all over the floor, my carpet, and the other sweetner packs.<br /><br />I also noticed the box is labeled, "NOT FOR RETAIL SALE". This purchase was a big mistake. The Christmas presents packed in the same box were covered with the sweetner and there was a pile of the stuff that leaked on to my carpet.

review/summary: Misleading title and photograph
review/text: Nothing has changed since the past purchasers posted their reviews. Instead of the blue Equal packets shown in the picture, we received Sweetmate. Apparently it is the same as Equal, and if it was for my own use, I wouldn't be too upset. However, I purchased this for an office, and it's caused a bit of an uproar, as everyone thinks we have switched to an inferior sweetener - it's tough to convince the angry coffee drinkers otherwise! I realize now that the title says Sweetmate. But as it also says Equal, and shows pictures of Equal packets, I don't think it's unreasonable to be surprised when a different product arrives.

review/summary: BEWARE  NOT EQUAL ---NOT EQUAL
review/text: First let me say that I did purchased this from the Amazon option, the pictured product, EQUALis not what you will receive, you will get a sweetener called "Sweet Mate" which sells at the 99 cent stores. This is a cheaper product made with different quemicals and ingredients than Equal. I informed Amazon and I still can't believe they haven't removed or change this product. Another reviewer says that the product is made by EQUAL, not true,it is just distributed by a vendor that also distribute Equal. This do not taste like EQUAL at all.  Amazon wanted me to reorder it to see if I got a different one again, even after telling them that all feedbacks said they received a different product than the one listed. Doesn't make sense at all, how many people ned to receive the wrong product for them to do something about it? I love Amazon but this is a big disappointment.

review/text: I completely agree - I have used many Equal-substitutes in the past, but this stuff is nasty.  We used it on cereal and in tea, and it leaves a rusty after-taste in both applications.  Want to ruin some nice oatmeal?<br />Also be advised that Amazon considers this a "Grocery" item, and as such it is NOT returnable (which I found out too late).  No reason to even try this stuff, IMO.

review/text: the freshness date on my box of 2000 sweet mate packets was october 2014. right away i noticed that it comes out of the packet so much easier than most i have tried so far. i feel some granularity to it in the packet.  it is not a fine powder. it tastes pretty good. i use it a lot in iced tea and to sweeten up some other things. it says the ingredients are dextrose with maltodextrin aspartame. the net weight of each packet is 1 gram or 0.035 oz. each packet it says has the sweetness of two teaspoons of sugar and also that it is suitable for those with diabetes. it is distributed by the Merisant Company. it is hard to read those tiny letters on that packet. i am happy with this product so far. the price is pretty good too.

It has the same ingredients as Equal but half the price.<br />I have a packet from my previous purchase of Sweet Mate. It says in ingredients: Dextrose with maldextrin, aspartame (aspartame is the main sweetener ingredient). That is the same ingredients as Equal.<br /><br />It is half the price that I pay for Nutrasweet in store, and a whole lot less than Equal.

review/text: I simply could not beat the price on this product. It came out to a little over $1 per 100 packets, which I normally buy 100 packs for $1.50 in the grocery store, plus 8.25% sales tax. In this economy, its all about the numbers. The product tastes just like Equal to me and flavors wonderfully. The first box I received had some defective packaging resulting in the product pouring out of the packets and into the bottom of the box. Amazon quickly replaced the box of sweetener with another, which had no defective packets. Excellent service from Amazon. This is why I keep coming back....

SINCE I FOUND THE FANCY FEAST CLASSIC VARIETY BOX THEY SEEM QUITE SATISFIED AND THERE IS USUALLY NONE LEFT AFTER JUST A FEW MINUTES.  THEY ARE HEALTHY AND MOSTLY HAPPY AND I THINK THAT IS IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE CLASSIC VARIET PACK.  I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT WHILE SOME CAT FOOD GIVES OFF A SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANT ODOR, THE CLASSIC FANCY FEAST DOES NOT.  I DO ALSO LIKE THAT THE CLASSIC FANCY FEAST COMES IN A SMALL CAN WHICH THEY SHARE.  THIS ENCOURAGES THEY TO EAT DRY FOOD WHICH KEEPS THEIR TEETH SHINY AND SHARP. I ALSO LIKE THE VARIET PACK, AS THEY ARE MORE MEATEATERS THAN FISH EATERS.  AND THIS VARIETY PACK GIVES THEM A NICE CHANGE FROM EVERY DAY EATING THE SAME FLAVOR.<br /><br />I ALSO LIKE THE FACT THAT I CAN ORDER THE VARIETY PACK, AND CATNIP OR THE OCCASIONAL TOY.  IT CERTAINLY MAKES THINGS EASIER AND LESS EXPENSIVE.

review/summary: TUNA PAR EXCELLENCE
review/text: Ventresca Tuna is a very special experience. Hand cut filets from the belly of Mediteranean tuna, packed in olive oil, with a lovely texture, this tuna stands on its own - without mayonnaise. It makes a delicious Salade Nicoise or a lunch with crusty bread to sop up the olive oil and sliced tomato. Resist mayonnaise in favor of a few drops of lemon juice.

review/text: Delicious, tender tuna. Perfect size for 1 or 2. This is not for tuna salad sandwiches. Perfect for Salad Nicoise or just on a light cracker or toast point. No over-processed canned tuna type flavor. Well worth the price.

review/summary: Not the best
review/text: This is good tuna. Much better than your local grocery's Starkist or Bumblebee. However, I was hoping for more. My typical experience with Ventresca Tuna has been with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OHGOY6">Ortiz Ventresca White Tuna Belly in Oil, 112-Grams</a>. In a money saving effort, I decided to try the Zoe Brand. It simply isn't as good. After doing a side by side taste test, the Ortiz is more buttery and velvety. The Zoe tastes dry in comparison. I think the difference is that Zoe uses Yellowfin Tuna while Ortiz uses Albacore (Bonito del Norte).<br /><br />At the time of this review the Zoe Brand is $11 per tin while Ortiz Brand is $14. For me, the Ortiz is well worth the extra three bucks. You're already paying a ridiculous amount for a can of tuna, you might as well spend the extra money and really treat yourself.

review/summary: Red Vines Rock!
review/text: Red Vines are so good. I grew up in the West eating them at the movies. Since moving out East, they are very hard to find and I have found that the majority of people have no idea what they are. I ordered a tub and they were sooooo soft and fresh! I brought the tub in to share with my East coast friends and they hated them...said Twizzlers were much better. Of course that is total garbage. Eating Twizzlers is like eating a candle; they are SO waxy. Anyway, back on the subject, the Red Vines were shipped quickly, and were totally soft and fresh! You must get some!

review/summary: Enjoyed by co-workers and kids, at the office and on Halloween
review/text: We purchased this in addition to the Red Vines Black Licorice Twists.<br /><br />Red Vines provide excellent value; you will not find four pounds of candy at this price that is so popular with kids and adults. Red Vines are Star-K kosher-certified with no fat and only 140 calories per serving (five pieces/vines).<br /><br />The licorice is also versatile for many occasions. I use Red Vines licorice for Halloween, birthday parties and I keep a tub at the office to fend off co-workers who roam around in the afternoon, looking for a snack.<br /><br />Licorice requires tender, loving care. Unlike hard candy, which can (and often does) sit for months in the bottom of your grandmother's purse, licorice tastes best soft and fresh. Storage should be airtight and at room temperature. Lucky for us, this order arrives in a plastic tub with a nine-month shelf life.<br /><br />According to the Red Vines web site, "many fans heat Red Vines candy in their microwaves for 5-7 seconds or until the candy reaches the desired softness." I tried this trick and it works great, softening the licorice into a delectable treat.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/text: Made by the American Licorice Company, this is quite simply the best licorice there is. Red Vines have a very distinctive taste and the texture is soft and chewy. This 4-pound tub is very economical and helps keep the licorice fresh, too. My kids and I absolutely LOVE this licorice! Red Vines rule!!

review/summary: Red Vines: What the Hell Can't They Do?
review/text: Anybody else give Redvines a try after watching A Very Potter Sequel???  Well I did, and I honestly think that Redvines are kind of an acquired taste.  I really didn't like them at all when my friend first introduced me to them last November at the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows premiere.  But I've found that they really aren't that bad and my tastebuds can now tolerate them and they are even kind of tasty.  Never have been a fan of twizzlers, so I thought it was a nice change of pace from the norm.

review/text: I like Twizzlers as much as the next fruit-flavored-rope-like-candy lover, but nothing beats a Red Vine.<br /><br />Well, nothing, except a big VAT of Red Vines.<br /><br />Red Vines have superior taste, texture, and straw-ability -- bite off the ends and use a vine to sip your soda (or, if you're over 21, your champagne). Tasty, silly fun.<br /><br />The jar helped keep the vines fresh as long as the vines lasted, which, frankly, wasn't very long -- I opened them up for a game night, and everyone scarfed them down.

review/summary: Ex-Twizzlers Fan Loves Red Vines!
review/text: I was "raised" on Switzer's licorice bars (I miss those!) and cherry Twizzlers. It wasn't until I moved to the midwest and tried a bag of Red Vines that I truly fell in love with this delicious licorice candy treat. Some complain of the "playdough" odor? For me, that's a wonderful part of the experience! I love the smell of fresh Red Vines and their chewy texture!<br /><br />When I saw the 64oz tubs of Red Vines on sale for $6.85 (and with free 2 day shipping courtesy of Amazon Prime), I couldn't resist! Also ordered a tub of the black Red Vines as well!

review/text: the word "yummy" is about the best word I can come up with for Red Vines.<br /><br />The product arrived fresh, and the container, surprisingly, kept the vines in great condition for a couple of weeks (can you believe it lasted THAT long ?)<br /><br />There should be bi-weekly home delivery for this (yes, I know it's possible)...but like 40 years ago) when the milk was delivered.  HA HA<br /><br />I suppose you could use the container for other things...maybe a cookie jar to take to work? or to keep bird feed in your garage (keep the mice out).<br /><br />But truly, the freshness and over all taste of Red Vines was excellent.  Red Vines do not have the same shiney waxiness that Twizzlers has.  And, Red Vines seems to have more Flavour, too.

review/text: I prefer the Red Vines over Twizzler because the taste and texture of the twists.  These are more "tough" and that makes it a plessure to chew.  They're also fun because you can bite off a tip from the top and bottom and use it as a straw!  Some may like the texture of the Twizzler, which I like as well, but I prefer the Red Vines.  These will turn hard if left open to the air so make sure you keep them closed up but the quality is just as good as the Twizzler brand.  Give them a try and form your own opinion.

review/summary: Red Vines Love em or hate em?
review/text: I just ordered a tub of black red vines and a tub of red red vines. I was curous to see what the reviews were for my favorite candy. It seems if you like twizzlers which I despise then you won't like red vines. Taste is a hard thing to quantify. I can't imagine anyone liking twizzlers at all but apparently a lot of people do like them. In the east about all you can buy are Twizzlers. For awhile Wal Mart was carrying Red Vines both black and red but they've stopped carrying them. I am grateful to Amazon so I don't have to go through Red Vines withdrawal! In conclusion I would have to advise anyone who thinks Twizzlers taste good to not order Red Vines. I would equate Red Vines to a fine wine and Twizzlers to Sterno strained through a sock!

review/text: I've a friend who would absolutely walk across burning coals barefoot for some Red Vines. So i purchase them in quantity for his benefit. He's a regular movie viewing buddy. He and I enjoy viewing movies on my 73" DLP TV purchased from Amazon ;-)<br />Amazon has also been a source for my expansive DVD collection! This review is supposed to focus on Red Vines. So back to the topic at hand. Personally I've tried Red Vines but I prefer Twizlers. They're what I grew up snacking on at the drive in. Everyone has their own taste preference. He raves about Red Vines and as long as I've them on hand I can enjoy a film uninterrupted. It's a small price to pay for a weeks worth of confab in the coffee room at work. I don't mind having a stash on hand just in case someone might wanna partake of something other than popcorn during a film. I tend to guard my Twizlers closely but guests are welcome to Red Vines ad lib.

review/text: I have my daughter to thank for the insight that Redvines are NOT the same as Twizzlers. These are her favorite. I can see why because every time I open the tub I get that fragrant sweet licorice scent and the candy has stayed soft and fresh for months at a time.<br /><br />Even though I'm not a licorice fan myself, this tub has been great "packing material" to send along to her at college. There's always a bit of room left in a Priority Mail package when I'm sending her a little love and so I grab a few handfuls, put in a ziplock baggie and pack the extra space with these licorice twists.<br /><br />Very pleased with this purchase and recommended.

Ordered it on early Saturday (5th November) afternoon, and it arrived as expected on Monday (7th November) with Amazon Prime shipping. My friend was ecstatic and she commented it was the biggest tub of Red Vines she'd ever seen. My only complaint was that I specified the item was a gift and included a note, which wasn't printed on the label of the item. However, that is minor because she was pleased to have one of her favourite candies. Very pleased by the cost, it's nice to be able to treat a friend without breaking the bank. Would order again.
