review/summary: Fruit for School
review/text: My 2.5 yo wouldn't always eat her fresh fruit or fruit cups. This solved the problem. I pack it in every lunch. They could be bigger, like at least 4oz or even 6oz would be better. When she eats them at home, she'll have 2.

review/summary: really good
review/text: Bought these for my son's lunches at school. Last year he lost about 20 of my little containers and countless spoons!! He can open them by himself (he's 5) and they taste really good. Says on the box they can be frozen to make a kind of slushy. So that's double duty as it will keep his lunchbox cool as well.

review/summary: Easy and the Kids LOVE it
review/text: I give this to both my 1 and my 2 year old as an easy snack or a side to a lunch.  They both LOVE it.  I like that it is organic, and that there isn't a lot of extra stuff.  It's just mashed up fruits in a really handy container.  Great for keeping in your purse for when you are on the go.<br /><br />This same company makes a fruit and veggie mash-up too.  It is a genius way to sneak some vegetables into a picky 2-year-old's diet.<br /><br />For the fruit-only variety, this one (tropical) is the favorite of both my little ones. Although I should note that they have liked every single flavor.  This is just the flavor they reach for most often.<br /><br />These are expensive, that is the downside.  But I've looked high and low and haven't found a better price than this  (online OR in my local stores).

review/text: My 10 month old son has 2 busy older sisters. We often have to dash off to some activity during his mealtime and finding healthy foods that are easy to feed him on the go has been a chalenge. These are perfect. He absolutly loves them ( his older sisters do too ) and they are super easy to feed anywhere with zero mess. I have even feed him in church and no one noticed. I wish they had more flavors.

They are 60 calories and nutrition facts are as follows: Vitamin C 5%. Potassium 3%. Fiber 1 gram. That is about it! You'd think something that is tropical would have 100% Vit C at least. Disappointed.

This on a grilled cheese sandwich is pure heaven. I like both tomato jam products for different reasons but the flavor of this one is amazing. I would buy this in bulk and give it to friends as gifts. That is how good it is. It is made for cheese, for sandwiches, it is a perfect brunch item. I love Barry Farm products and will order in the future.

review/text: I was just deceived... I'm pregnant and have a craving for caviar, but can't eat any raw fish products. So the only option for me is pasteurized caviar. The description of the product here states that this romanoff caviar is pasteurized, but when I got it I didn't find any mention about pasteurization on the jar or packing! So, I can't eat it. It's not cheap, but I don't want spent more money on return shipment, so don't know what to do with it...<br />Shame on you, seller, for deceiving your customers!

I even use them when we go out to eat to keep him happy until our food comes.  I just wish a store near me sold them so I could buy them in lesser quantities if I wanted to.  The canisters take up a lot of room in my cabinet and we don't have a lot of cabinet space.

I tasted them and they weren't terrible to me- a mixture of bitter and bland with no cheesy flavor that I could detect.

review/summary: One of the best puffs to start with - even with strong gagging reflex
review/text: My daughter started finger foods pretty late, she has a very strong gagging reflex and once she starts gagging she'd vomit everything she ate before. I finally was able to start her with these puffs by cutting them in 3 and then 2 pieces and giving her the whole one. She eats everything now but these puffs really helped at the beginning. She learned to pick them up, put them in her mouth and dissolve them. The great thing about them is that they dissolve much much faster than cheerios or any other puffs I tried before.

This conditioner is smooth and goes on easily and best of all, you don't have use a whole handful It smells great and even after blow drying left my hair soft and silky, but not greasy.  I did use it with the Clear shampoo, so I think that using both products together also helped and would recommend that you get the shampoo as well!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.

In all fairness, this might be a great product for dry and damaged hair that is frizzy or heavy but that isn't my issue.

review/summary: Nice conditioning
review/text: This has been used by my daughter for the last week. She has dry, curly hair, very thick, medium coarse and past shoulder length. She's been using it with the matching shampoo.<br /><br />I expected with it's description that it would be really moisturizing for her hair type. It's been conditioning it, but not quite as well as expected. Her hair does look good, and it's been easy to comb through. It's still prone to some frizzing even after a week of using it following the instructions every day. It doesn't seem to be causing a build up on her hair and I do like that.<br /><br />She loves it, she likes the scent, the shape of the bottle, and how shiny her hair looks. So figure 4.5 stars, splitting the difference between my expectations on the frizzy, and her joy in the shine.

review/summary: Not for every follicle...
review/text: I did not find Ultra Shea conditioner to be any better than my regular regimen.  If anything it may have been more drying.<br /><br />I tried the product as directed with very poor results.  Immediately after drying my hair, it felt even drier than before I shampooed and conditioned. Within two days I had to wash my hair again, as it was bone dry.<br /><br />I decided to give the conditioner another try, this time as a deep conditioner along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a>.  There was some improvement in the overall moisture levels of my hair, but not enough to warrant changing from my routine of cholesterol and coconut oil conditioners.  Within days my hair was dry and brittle.  (Other than the hair dryer, I do not use any heated appliances on my hair.)<br /><br />I tried the conditioner once more as directed with the same results as before.<br /><br />Because of the increased need to shampoo, condition, and dry my hair, I feel like I experienced more breakage than I normally would have under my normal routine.

review/summary: Pass on this
review/text: After the disappointment of the shampoo, I had somewhat high hopes still for the conditioner, especially if I could use this for cowashing. When I bagan to pour out the conditioner, I instantly noticed how watery it was. As I applied it to my hair, it was just like putting water on it, it was runny and gave no slip as I tried to detangle my hair. Honestly, this is a cheap ineffective conditioner. There are more synthetics inside of this product than shea butter which is far down on the list of ingredients. You would do much better buying some V05 conditioner for $1. If you're looking for a hydrating conditioner that gives good slip for natural hair, try Herbal Essences Hello Hydration. It has silicones just like this one but provides much better results. After using both the shampoo and conditioner, I was left with lifeless, dull hair with a waxy film over it.

review/text: I gave this product three tries; with a good hair product I think you should be able to tell its worth by then. I have long, very thick hair, and cheap conditioners tend to cause a lot of quick buildup; this was no exception. I could still feel the waxiness by the next time I washed my hair. Give this one a pass - use a real shea butter product instead, and it should absorb into the hair and scalp better.

review/summary: Not Best Choice for Sensitive Skin
review/text: Attractive bottle, smells nice, thick enough (like thick lotion, I can stick my finger in the bottle, get a big glop on my finger and it stays there when I hold it upside down, so I did not experience it being runny at all.<br /><br />My main issue is a concern over the high alcohol content (Cetearyl Alcohol being #2 after water on ingredient list). Alcohol is too drying for my thin and super curly hair. I tried it out, anyway and found that is seemed to strip out some possible oil buildup I had from using natural products (including real shea butter).<br /><br />Update:<br />Had to downgrade my reviews for this line when the skin on my arms and neck started breaking out after accumulated exposure-washing my daughter's hair in the sink in addition to using other products from same line on myself that day. Not the best choice for sensitive skin.<br /><br />*Found a "silver lining:"<br /><br />When scalp became extremely dry as a result, with dandruff "raining down" to the touch, I did an internet search. I found that VINEGAR is an excellent conditioner. I used 1/2 vinegar/water-amazing results! My scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered-now soft to the touch instead of brittle.

review/summary: Pleasantly scented and effective hair conditioner
review/text: I wash my hair every day and color it every two weeks. The bottle is an odd shape and the moisturizer is dispensed from the bottom. While it took a moment for me to grasp where to open the bottle, it does make sense because one can get to use every last drop in the container. I would have given it five stars but the claim that it nourishes the hair and scalp disturbed me a bit because we all know that hair really cannot be nourished (this is factual). It did a fine job of conditioning my hair and I rubbed it into my scalp before rinsing it off. I would buy it!

review/summary: Soft, Smooth, Silky NOT as Shiny
review/text: Having shoulder length hair that is wavy, curly or frizzy according to weather conditions, I'm continually looking for product lines that moisturize and hydrate my hair. The Texas heat has arrived 2 months early making this selection worth a try so I can avoid 5 months of frizzies. I'm no stranger to using conditioners containing almond and coconut oils, shea butter etc. with positive results. I expected this product to perform well and it exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Clear Scalp and Hair eradicated scalp itching such that I could even skip a day between shampoos without "cooties". This is not the case with some other product lines. This conditioner DOES coat the hair and I needed to figure out how much rinsing I needed to get my hair to feel "squeaky clean". More than usual, so I'm still experimenting. The product made my hair soft, smooth, and silky just not as shiny. A shine serum was necessary.<br /><br />I vary the amount of product and rinsing BOTH for the "squeaky clean" feel and diluting the lingering "tropical" fragrance. Right now I use from dime size to quarter size dollops based on the condition of my hair when shampooing daily or every other day, or having wash-n-wear hair styles vs using hot-tooled styles.<br /><br />Overall, I do like the product and even purchased the accompanying oil and balm to incorporate into my hair care routine for the summer AND winter when dry hair and breakage is even more an issue due to dry-heated air.<br /><br />I really would like to have further directions from Unilever IF this same conditioner can be used as:<br /> o a deep conditioner, by leaving it in for X minutes before rinsing.<br /> o a curl reviving mist, by diluting it with x parts water.<br /><br />This is Step2: Smooth ...in the Ultra Shea line

review/summary: Like Lotion for the Follicles
review/text: NOTE: This review is based several uses. I don't use hair conditioner very often because it weighs down my hair, but I thought I would be fair and give this product a try.<br /><br />At first, the smell of the product coming through the bottle was strong and overly sweet. What surprised me was that it actually has a pleasant, not overpowering smell once you squeeze it out of the bottle.<br /><br />As for the cons, the texture is thick and feels like heavy lotion. This worried me, because as I mentioned before, certain conditioners weigh my hair down. I used a dime sized amount and coated the top and bottom parts of my hair with the product, then rinsed thoroughly. However, when I tried to dry my hair, I realized it still felt heavy with conditioner. I had to rinse for a few more minutes before I could try to dry and style again. A week later, I tried again, unfortunately to the same results.<br /><br />I can see how this can benefit other users. This conditioner, however, is definitely not for me.

review/summary: Great results!
review/text: However, the bottle was designed to stand on its cap. Not a great idea, IMHO, for a container that contains a liquid. It was also shipped to me in a padded envelope, instead of a box that should have said "This End up" -- it leaked into the envelope -- luckily the bottle was wrapped in a plastic bag, so damage and loss were minimal.<br /><br />And the fragrance, IMHO, is a bit over-powering -- use less in the formula and I think that will help a great deal. Early morning is not the greatest time to assail my olfactory senses.<br /><br />The product itself, containing "a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm", is certainly impressive, and those oils are an incredible arsenal for moisturizing and conditioning -- and "CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner" does condition very well. My hair is soft, shiny and feels like silk. Since I also use "CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo". I think the two products work together very synergystically.<br /><br />So yes I like "CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner" and would recommend it to others- but tweaking the design of the bottle and using a bit less of the fragrance would make this product much more enjoyable to use.

review/summary: Real or Fake?
review/text: I wanted to title my review "happy hair" because my 9-year-old loves this conditioner.  My medium-thick long hair could take it or leave it, but counter to my expectations, her baby-fine hair became extra gleamy and managable.  She says it gives her "happy hair."<br /><br />The problem, once I started looking at the ingredients, is that it's chock full of synthetics and silicones, which, oddly enough, can be skin irritants and possibly cause dermatitis in some people.  I'm not so sure that this is what you call "nourishing the scalp"; it's more of a situation in which you apply silicone to the hair shaft to make it shiny.  So, I'm referring to the cyclopentasiloxane, stearamdo propyl dimethylamine, dimethiconol, etc.  It's a long way down the list before you get to the nourishing shea butter and coconut oil.<br /><br />I guess if I want to nourish my scalp, I could always use pure coconut oil, then shampoo it out.  For what it's worth, I try to keep ingredients natural with my kids.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: I have tried a few different Clear shampoos and conditioners and so far, I have not liked any of them particularly well. This one is no different.<br /><br />While the scent is nice - it smells like shea butter of course - it just doesn't perform well for me. I need to use a whole lot of it to get any kind of good detangling and softening/conditioning. After I shampoo, I add conditioner, comb it through with a wide tooth comb and then put my hair up in a clip with the conditioner still in my hair, while I wash my body. So, conditioner always sits in my hair for a good 5 minutes or so. With this conditioner, I felt like I had to use so many heaping piles of it to get just a tad bit of detangling action. Once I rinse it out, it almost feels like I never even used conditioner. Most of the time I use my other conditioner (Infusium23 or Redken Extreme) after rinsing this Clear one out. If not, I use a leave in because my hair just doesn't feel moisturized or soft enough after using the Clear. My hair is not particularly rough or damaged, so I shouldn't really need to use so much. I definitely don't need to use as much when using my regular brands.<br /><br />It does smell good and rinse well, but there are no benefits to using it. It also does not seem to coat or weigh my hair down, but again no other benefits. I need a conditioner to help me detangle and soften my hair - things a conditioner typically does - this one just doesn't do any of that for me.

review/summary: in 4 weeks my stylist noticed the difference in health
review/text: I am 50 year old and still have the same thick curly hair I did when I was 13.  I have been looking for the right mix of care products. Just last month I switched to three products:<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner,<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil,<br /><br />My hair is dryer now that I am older and the shampoo really does the trick of cleaning without destroying my hair, it cleanses completely to remove product build-up. The conditioner allows me to much more easily run a brush through my hair. Without flattening my hair it reduces the dryness that flat ironing can do and reduces breakage.  It really does lock in moisture and provide long lasting nourishment.  The Therapy works best on wet hair, it gives deep, non-greasy nourishment to my hair and lends a healthy looking shine.  I can wash, condition and therapy my hair Monday. Tuesday I can wet my hair put the therapy in and it looks brand new.<br /><br />The real test was going to my salon and my stylist of 8 years noticed the difference in softness. I love the blend of shea, vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm. It really works for me. I did find the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair.<br /><br />KEEPER!

review/summary: Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner
review/text: This conditioner is working great for my hair in the hot, hazy, humid days of summer.  I use it in conjunction with the Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, and it leaves my hair feeling balanced.  The conditioner has a slippery texture that helps keep my hair from tangling, and although it rinses out easily, some days, I comb the conditioner through my hair after shampooing, and then just wrap a towel around my head to get the worst of the water out, and then wind it into a bun with this conditioner still in it.  It's really helped my hair feel smooth and healthy instead of dry on the days I do actually rinse the conditioner out and do something with my hair besides a bun.  The scent, although difficult to place exactly what it is, is a clean, pleasant smell.  So far, I'm really happy with how this conditioner and its companion shampoo are working with my hair!

review/summary: Average Conditioner--Perfectly Serviceable
review/text: I got to admit, after liking the Ultra Shea Shampoo, I hoped to like the conditioner as well.  The packaging is nice--especially with the reversed spout to keep from confusing the shampoo and conditioner in the shower.  The product itself?  Not bad.  It's certainly not as gloppy or watery as some of the really cheap conditioners I've used.<br /><br />Let's be honest I'm a practical mommy that yanks her hair back in a pony tail and doesn't really have money to splurge on high end stuff.  For the price and the results, this is certainly well within range for a decent conditioner.  It won't hold a candle to anything really high end, granted, but at that price point, comparable high quality would be unreasonable to expect.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have with this product is one that plagues me with most conditioners.  I have a lot of hair.  In order to use enough conditioner, I have to use twice as much of it as I do the shampoo--which means it won't last nearly as long. Still, it's a useful conditioner and I like the look, feel and scent of it and would be likely to buy a bottle now and then.<br /><br />^_^ Shanshad

review/summary: nice scent, conditions well, not sure if it does anything for scalp
review/text: I was very much looking forward to the Clear Scalp & Hair product line, because using dandruff shampoo for dry scalp, as I have been doing for years, really dries out my hair.  I got both this conditioner and a shampoo, and was mostly pleased with the results.  The scent was nice, and the conditioner strong enough you didn't have to use very much of it.  The conditioner rarely gets on my scalp, though; it's mostly on my ends.  Because of this, I'm not sure it helped with my scalp at all. When the shampoo didn't control the itching as well as I would like (see separate review), I went back to dandruff shampoo brand dry scalp treatment, but this conditioner helped keep it from being so rough on my hair.  All in all, I would definitely use this conditioner again.

review/summary: Waxy and Weighs Hair Down...
review/text: After only a few uses, "Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner" left my hair feeling waxy and weighed down.  That was disappointing because while my hair was wet, it was slick and smooth.  Further, while blow-drying and using a round brush, I found the brush moved easily, without tangling or catching, through my wet hair.<br /><br /> "Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner" did not prevent my hair from "frizzing" as humidity increased.  Instead of the sleek look I usually achieve with my regular conditioner, I ended up with a great number off fly-away hairs.  Frizz is not a look I am trying to achieve.<br /><br />"Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner" is packaged in a uniquely shaped container.  It fits nicely in one's hand; is easy to hold, even with wet hands; and is easy to control with respect to dispensing the shampoo.  I plan on saving the container and refilling when the "Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner" is gone.<br /><br />A word of warning:  "Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner" left the tile shower floor extremely slick and slippery.  If you use this product, please be careful that you do not fall because your shower floor is slippery.<br /><br />"Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner" is similar to many commercially available conditioners.  It does the job, but leaves one's hair weighed down after several uses; conditioners that rinse out cleanly and completely are preferable.  I am rating "Clear Scalp Hair & Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner" as a 3-star product.

review/summary: Thick and Rich and No Dye
review/text: Thick and rich, I like this conditioner. My very long hair was easier to comb out while it was wet, and gets less tangled when it's dry. I haven't noticed that it's any softer, but, then again, I've only used it once. One big pro is that there is no dye in this conditioner. And I love the flip cap! Press to open. Press to close. So easy!<br /><br />I always put conditioner only on the bottom 2/3 of my hair because I've been told that conditioner will weigh down the hair if it's put on the scalp. Since Unilever is saying that these Clear conditioners nourish the scalp, I've been massaging conditioner (all of the different kinds that I use) into my scalp. Not only does it not weigh my hair down, but I find that the hair near my scalp looks so much nicer, and stays cleaner longer. Just that alone is worth having tried the Clear line of products.<br /><br />Amazon has addressed the problem of leakage during shipping by putting a piece of clear tape over the lid. It worked, and the tape came off with no sticky residue left behind. Thanks, Amazon!

I get deep condition and It was light and I could tell my hair was easy to manage afterwards. I'm really glad I bought it, and I look forward to using it again and reordering once I'm out. My favorite Shampoo and conditioner so far.

review/summary: Great for natural hair
review/text: This conditioner really softened my hair. I left it on for more than the recommended 30 minutes though. I left it on for over 4 hours, but it really did soften and silken my hair and I love the way it smells. It works great in conjunction with the Clear Shampoo, but overall, I would use the conditioner and leave it on for a long time. It would probably be even better if I had a heated cap, but it still works great.

I've used top quality salon product for years and wouldn't consider buying anything else, that is till I tried this.  You get quality for much less cost than so many of the top brands. I will buy this product again.

review/text: Like the shampoo, this conditioner has a slightly sweet scent. It is creamy and leaves my hair soft and silky. The combination of the shampoo and conditioner left a build-up on my hair after a few weeks of use. I recommend using a clarifying shampoo about once a week to remove the build-up.<br /><br />By the way, I am the wife of your Vine participant.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: Not bad for conditioner, although please note this review is only after one use. I need not love the smell at first as it spilled in the plastic it was wrapped in, but I liked it better after smelling on my hair. I have thick semi-long hair, and I felt it did as good a job at conditioning it as any other comparable condition for this price range ( like Pantene). I did not think it was the best conditioner I have ever used, and the smell was not pleasant enough I would go searching this out on my own. Not bad, though I would balk at paying almost five dollars for this in the store or on Amazon.

review/summary: Overpowering fragrance...
review/text: I like the companion shampoo to this product. It does the job with a minimal fragrance that doesn't linger. I expected the same of this product. Boy, was I surprised! This has a VERY strong, perfume-y smell that I just can't get past...COMPLETELY different than the shampoo. As with the shampoo, it does it's job just fine: detangling and conditioning, and my hair does feel quite silky (as much a very short bob can) after it's dry. That part I like. It rinses well, so hair doesn't feel gummy or sticky. The product appears to have a silicone derrivative in in, so if you're trying to avoid that (ie: fine hair or volume style, this product may not be for you. If you are fragrance sensitive or just don't like to be your olfactory nerve to be overpowered, stay away!

The Ultra Shea has a nuttier aroma and the Daily conditioning is a light and fragrant.<br /><br />I use them both as pre-poos. I have 4a/b hair and I used the Ultra Shea as a leave in as well.

review/text: I've tried other conditioners in the Clear line and for some reason this one was a little lackluster. I figured with the addition of Shea butter, this conditioner would have even more moisturizing power, but it was just average. My hair was soft, but it didn't feel completely moisturized. I had to use a leave-in to achieve the desired results. I was also a little disappointed in the scent. It didn't have the wow factor of the other conditioners and seemed bland. Overall, this was product was average.

review/text: Pantene is the brand I have always used and been most satisfied with but I was really happy with this new Clear Scalp Conditioner (the shampoo is great too).  The smell alone makes you want to try it.  It reminds me of the old "Salon Selectives" brand.  Anyway, my hair does seem smother and less frizzy.  It is shiny and I got a compliment on it the other day which I hadn't received in a while so it must be working.  It is comparable in price to Pantene as well.

review/text: I live in a dry climate with hard water and I have processed hair - that means that good conditioner is essential. I used this along with Clear Scalp and Hair shampoo for color treated hair and I have to say that this product is great. It doesn't weigh my hair down and it doesn't make my scalp oily. I don't use conditioner anywhere above my ears, so I can't say how it helped my scalp, but when used with Clear Scalp and Hair shampoo, my scalp is in great condition. It gives my hair that healthy shine and movement that I look for in a conditioner and it smells great. Healthy scalp and healthy hair - what more could you ask for?

review/summary: New favorite, great conditioner.
review/text: About my hair:  Long (middle of back), naturally straight, it has never been colored or treated in any way.<br /><br />I have awesome hair.  It bleaches itself to a nice dark golden light brown during the summer with great highlights.  I'm lucky and get complimented often on it.  That being said, the most I ever do to it is add in layers or have it trimmed.  I rarely blow dry it.  I shampoo/condition it almost daily (gasp!).<br /><br />My favorite shampoo/conditioner combo used to be Infusium 23, but a couple years ago they changed the scent/formula and it hasn't been great since.<br /><br />Enter Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo & Conditioner.<br /><br />Like the shampoo, the conditioner smells amazing.  My first thought was "warm summer beach day".  Light vanilla mingling with coconut and perhaps a bit floral.  Its intoxicating and I absolutely love it.<br /><br />A little bit goes a long way and it honestly feels like it gets absorbed into your hair.  Having long hair like mine, this is important.<br /><br />My hair is left feeling soft, looks shiny, and combs easily.<br /><br />I use it with the shampoo and I could not be happier.  Definitely will be my new go-to shampoo and conditioner combo.

review/summary: Love, Love it!
review/text: For years, I have been battling with my hair. Too dry. Flakes that I could never get to go away. I have tried so many different products trying to get these issues under control. For the most part, other products seemed to help for a few days, a week or two if I was lucky. Then, sadly, my issues would pop up again.<br /><br />When I first saw the commerical for Clean, I knew that it may be different than all the other products I have tried before. Claiming to work at the scalp then down the hair instead of the other way around. Upon first use, I noticed how light the product was. It didn't feel heavy or feel like it was still in my hair after rinsing. Clean promises to change your hair after 7 days. Mine took two. The first day, I noticed how much softer my hair was. By the second, my flakes were all but gone. I use this product every day and I am still amazed with the results. Something that I have been battling for so long to be gone like that. Clean is a product that I have been recommending to all my friends and family. And I could not be happier with it.

review/text: Before I get into the merits of this product, Amazon needs to ship it more carefully in the future. The bottle opens from the bottom, and my bottle spilled into the packaging. I'm all for easy-to-open products, but in this case it would be wise to use a small strip of tape to seal the container.<br /><br />Despite this concern, I found the conditioner to be very good. It made my hair easier to comb through when it was wet. It also has a nice scent, and my hair, when dry, looked healthy and shiny.<br /><br />I'm still a fan of Pantene, but this is not a bad conditioner.

review/summary: Not bad. Hair was soft.
review/text: I use only conditioner on my hair and avoid styling at least 2 days a week. I'm trying to strengthen my damaged hair. The CLEAR Ultra Shea conditioner appealed to me because of the use of natural oils like coconut and almond, so I wanted to try it.<br /><br />First of all, the conditioner leaked in shipping. The bottle was inside a bubble mailer, wrapped in a bag, so that the mess was contained, but this pointed out a design flaw. The bottle is cool-looking in shape and color, but the dispenser is on the bottom. Many conditioners are designed like this (with a flip lid cap), but CLEAR has a push-type opener. Obviously, shipping this product is cause for disaster. A flip lid would take some effort to open, but the push lid...well, a bump or two in transit will result in conditioner all over the packaging - and you're also out a good amount of product!<br /><br />So, this product may not be conducive to mail-order, unless Amazon packages in a more secure matter.<br /><br />As for the conditioner itself: Whew! I smelled it right away, since it had leaked! And it smelled a bit overpowering at first. I don't like strong-smelling styling products, so I was nervous when I went to use it the first time. However, the smell is actually quite soft and pleasant. Not overly flowery or fruity, just clean and nice.<br /><br />I was surprised that CLEAR's Ultra Shea conditioner was not as greasy as many conditioners that I have used in the past. It easily coated my hair from root to tip, but was just as easy to rinse out. I felt no residue or heaviness on my hair afterwards. My hair felt soft.<br /><br />As for the claims of all the wonderful oils in the product: well, yes, they're there. But beware - the conditioner is not quite a 'natural' as the description makes it sound. Lots of chemical ingredients are listed before the good stuff. I've been making the transition to more natural products in our food, but haven't quite changed in my beauty products, yet. So this doesn't bother me too much, except for CLEAR making it sound more natural than it really is.

review/summary: Better than Any Professional Product I've Tried
review/text: I did start by using the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Shampoo, so this review is based on using both products together.<br /><br />I have relatively long, very thick, and very wavy hair. Frizzing is a major problem, especially in humidity, which Vermont often experiences during the rainy spring weather. I also color my hair, so it can dry out. My hair stylist swears by the Redken line for dry hair, but I've tried it and have never been impressed. I'm sick of paying $15 to $30 for shampoo and conditioners that do not work.<br /><br />Clear's Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish impressed me. I started with the shampoo and then moved on to the conditioner. Applied it to all the hair, making sure the ends got extra attention, waited two minutes, and then rinsed. I moved on to blow drying it partially and was amazed with the results. My hair came out shiny, feeling like silk, and best of all, even on a very rainy day, there was no frizz.<br /><br />It smells a little like a Pina Colada, but stronger on the coconut side. I love that smell, my husband and daughter hate it. Given that, it wasn't so strong that they couldn't tolerate being near me. If you dislike the smell of coconut, you may not enjoy this line as much as I do.<br /><br />Based on my use of this new shampoo and conditioner line, however, I've found a new favorite shampoo and conditioner line. With Sunday papers offering up lots of $2 off coupons on this new line, I'm going to be stocking up.

I have been using salon shampoos and conditioners on my hair for ages now, and been really displeased with how my hair has been looking. It's grey, very thick and wiry, and was dry and brittle to the touch, and had totally lost its sheen. One wash with Clear Ultra Shea has changed all that. My hair hasn't felt this soft in years, and it's actually shining!<br /><br />Clear Ultra Shea smooth and Nourish Conditioner has a lovely feel to it. The aroma is very subtle and quite pleasant, and I like the packaging a lot. The cylinders are sturdy, with tops that press open easily, and the shampoo stands on its feet, and conditioner on its head, so there is no confusion as to what bottle you're reaching for, half blind with no glasses on and water running down your face. I'm going to keep using Clear Ultra Shea, and those salon products will have to go bye bye.

This conditioner is the only one I've seen that has a good amount of moisture but not too much for hair that is oily and also is good for scalp problems.  By the way, it covers the stinky shampoo's smells, too!

review/text: Used in conjunction with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>, I think this conditioner does a good job. I have thick, sometimes frizzy hair when it gets hot and humid, and this stuff makes my hair smoother and a little less full-looking, which is what I want. It contains a great shea butter smell that makes me feel like I'm vacationing somewhere exotic.<br /><br />My wife, on the other hand, isn't as keen on this conditioner as me. She feels it leaves a residue that feels heavy and is hard to get out of your hair. To me, the sign of good conditioner is the kind that is hard to get out of your hair with water, but she doesn't like that. Her rating for this product was three stars.<br /><br />The bottle is long and slender and has a convenient pop-up cap that's easy to open and close. I like how the cap end of the bottle is the flat portion that you place down; all the shampoo in the bottle builds toward that end, so you'll never have to hit the back of the bottle to squeeze shampoo out.

My scalp had been feeling dry and itchy, and true to its promise, this conditioner offered relief on that count. So far, so good. My hair, however, looked a bit duller and not as soft as expected, which was a disappointment. My advice is to be sparing with this conditioner when you apply and wash it out very well.

This is a fairly thick conditioner, but it didn't weigh down my hair (which is shoulder-length and color-treated).  In all, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between this conditioner and others that I've tried.  Considering that Clear is an inexpensive line, this one will do just as well for me.  I don't really like that it opens on the bottom though.

review/summary: NOT GOOD AT ALL
review/text: So I bought this product to test it out because I read up on it and it sounded like a good new shampoo and conditioner and thinking the Clear Ultra Shea Shampoo and Conditioner would nourish my scalp, lock moisture in my hair, smooth, and seal as it says on the container it would do, turns out it does the complete opposite the shampoo stripped my hair. After shampooing my hair was hard, tangled, and dry feelong. Then I thought maybe the conditioner will help my hair so I put the conditioner in and it did NOTHING, my hair was so tangled, no kind of moisture what so ever to it, my hair was extremely dry and tangled and was very hard to detangle even after applying the conditioner. So I ended up rewashing my hair that same day with Garnier Triple Nutrition which I LOVE LOVE LOVE and would recommend to anyone! I will never ever ever buy this Clear Ultra Shea or recommend to anybody you would be better off buying some Suave shampoo and conditioner than this mess. I am very upset that I have two almost full bottles of this shampoo and conditioner that's going in the trash unless I find somebody that likes it that I know.

I wouldn't say I have dandruff every day, but I *can* have some if I end up itchy right before I wash my hair.<br /><br />I really did itch less with this conditioner. In fact, I've been trying all sorts of conditioners since I ran out of this, and I also went back to my old conditioner, but nothing has worked to both moisturize my hair and calm that "need to wash my hair" scalp itch. I thought it would end up drying my hair out further, but I used it about a month, and that didn't happen. So, I'm sold on it, and if you have some scalp itch, I think it's worth trying out.

review/summary: Good, But Not For Everyday Use
review/text: This Clear Ultra Shea Conditioner does a good job at moisturizing hair and has a very pleasant scent, but using it more than two or three times a week leaves my daughter's hair feeling unpleasantly "coated".<br /><br />This was used in conjunction with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>, which does work well.<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Liked the Shampoo, Not much of a fan of the conditioner
review/text: I actually liked the companion shampoo but didn't get the same benefit from the conditioner and would be unlikely to purchase in the future. The companion shampoo left my hair feeling light with body. The conditioner didn't. My waist length hair felt heavy, limp and difficult to style/manage after using. All in all, a bit on the heavy side.

review/summary: Good solid shampoo. Bit drying.
review/text: I've been using this shampoo for a few weeks now, to give my hair a chance to get used it it, and see how it works. My hair and head feel utterly clean after using it. I work in a restaurant, and some days come home sweating and gross, so I need something that'll be like an industrial cleaner on my head. This stuff does that well. My hair always feels squeaky clean. However, I find that if I don't follow up immediately with a deep conditioner, my hair tends to feel rather light and dry. That's great if you have fine hair that needs that lift. When you have thick hair, it turns into a giant 'fro, and is not cute. The smell is nice, and not too strong. The lather is rich and plentiful.

review/summary: Shea, Shea, Shea, what you want.....
review/text: This review is for Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ">Shampoo</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9E2">Conditioner</a>.<br /><br />This is the third of the clear scalp and hair beauty products that I've used, and I'm starting to wonder if there's any difference between them. I didn't wash my hair and suddenly think "Wow! This product brings out all of the potential my hair has ever had!" but it wasn't bad. My biggest complaint about this particular product is the scent. I'm not sure how to explain it, but the scent seems a little chemical to me. It reminds me of a very faint version of the way your hair smells after a perm.<br /><br />This product isn't so bad that I won't eventually finish the bottle, but it's not something I plan on purchasing in the future.

review/summary: Excellent For the Right Hair Type
review/text: I have baby fine hair that doesn't take well to conditioner, so I saved this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9E2">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> for my teenage granddaughter to test drive during her August vacation with Grandma.  Her hair is much coarser than mine, naturally curly, straightened, blow dried, often frizzy and a different color just about every week.  Straight off the plane her hair looked about like so much straw on her head, badly in need of some intensive repair.<br /><br />The difference in her hair was striking, right from the very first use - soft, smooth, no frizz.  Even her drastically split ends were nowhere near as apparent.  Needless to say, she raved about this conditioner - so much so that I'm going to have to order a year's supply to drag across the pond to the UK when I go to visit this fall.<br /><br />Give this a try for your problem hair.

review/summary: not my favorite
review/text: I've tried a few of the "Clear" brand conditioners. Like the other ones I've tried, this one is lightly scented and the scent is not too bad, but I prefer the scents of the non-shea conditoners they have.  The consistency of the conditioner is okay but I prefer thicker conditioners. It rinses out well enough and leaves my hair soft.<br />I like that the spout is on the bottom because this helps the conditioner settle and makes it easier to get the last bit of conditioner out of the bottle.

review/summary: A Basic Conditioner
review/text: I wish I had a bit more to say about this product.  I used both this and the shampoo of the same line.  As a result, and with apology, my reviews for these products will be very similar.<br /><br />The scent of the conditioner is fine (it smells like the shampoo).  It's neither particularly outstanding nor is it bad.  The scent, such as it is, is not very long lasting.  I did find that the conditioner wasn't quite as "weightless" as I expected.  It seemed to take a bit longer than normal to get all the conditioner out of my hair.<br /><br />After using it, I didn't notice any particular change in my hair.  It didn't seem stronger or shinier.  It's possible that I could see improvements with repeated use.<br /><br />It simply seems to be a fine, basic conditioner and seems mild enough for everyday use.

review/summary: It makes my hair soft but I don't like the scent at all
review/text: I have tried a variety of Clear Scalp & Hair products with good results but this is the first in their product line that I don't really care for. It does a good job of moisturizing my hair without leaving a oily or waxy feeling. So it is a good conditioner but I have one problem with it. It has a very different smell to it that I don't care for. It smells like clay or play-doh to me and I just don't like it.

review/summary: No Tangles . . . .
review/text: I wash my long hair every night, and have to use a conditioner, without fail!  I got this Clear Scalp with the matching shampoo, and am quite happy with it.  My hair ends up totally soft and totally tangle free.  That's all I ask from a conditioner.  Oh, it also can't have a heavy perfume smell, because that gives me headaches.  This one has a slight perfume scent, and it doesn't linger, so that works.

review/summary: A Perfect Conditioner!
review/text: I got ULTRA SHEA SMOOTH & NOURISH CONDITIONER mainly for my roommate, who complained to me recently that he has tried many, many conditioners and found that they either dry out his hair or dry out his scalp, or both.  He also mentioned that many products he'd tried did not result in the manageability he had purchased the product for in the first place.  So, when Amazon offered this product, I decided to try it for our bathroom.<br /><br />Fortunately for me, I do not have the type of hair that really needs a conditioner.  My hair is normally soft and manageable, no matter what the weather or how often I wash it, which is usually daily.  Still, I do like to use a conditioner every ten days or so, just to keep my hair feeling the way I like it.<br /><br />Well, ULTRA SHEA SMOOTH & NOURISH CONDITIONER more than met both of our expectations.  My roommate is a professional actor, who needs to have a consistent appearance and wants to make sure he looks exactly the same day after day, especially when making a film or doing a long stretch in a theatre piece.  I asked him what he thought about this conditioner, and he said that it was probably the best he'd ever tried.  Especially important was the fact that it did not dry out his hair or scalp, but he mentioned that he also liked the way it made his hair feel, even when using it on a daily basis.  As for me, I have no complaint at all; the odor is agreeable and it leaves my hair feeling even more silky than usual.  As far as I'm concerned, it's a perfect conditioner, and we will continue to use it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Smells so good!
review/text: I need to wash my hair daily because it tends to get oily, and when I used it daily it worked great.  I decided to give it a day in between washes to see how this product would hold up, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't need it daily after all!  My hair was still nice and fresh on that in between day.  I think I will continue using this conditioner on a regular basis now.<br /><br />I love the smell, too!  It smells so good.  Not overpoweringly so, either.  The container is essentially upside down, with the lid on the bottom.  I really liked this because I feel I'm getting every last drop out of it.<br /><br />It moisturizes well and my usually hard to comb wet hair combed nice and smoothly.  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great product at a decent price.

review/summary: Better than expected
review/text: I had already tried two Clear Scalp & Hair products and was less than impressed with the results.  In fact, I noticed a difference after just one use-and not in a good way.<br /><br />This product however was much better.  The conditioner helped restore the moisture that the Clear Scalp & Hair Moisture shampoo had striped away.  I also used the Clear Scalp & Hair Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil which added a lot of shine.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone with long hair (long hair is old hair-the closer to the scalp the younger the hair), curly hair or thick & coarse hair because the shea butter adds the moisture that your hair needs but it doesn't make your hair greasy or weighed down.  If you have thin or fine hair I would try a volumizing formula instead.

review/summary: I Was Surprised At How Well This Worked
review/text: We have four types of hair in our home- baby fine and wavy, medium fine and straight, coarse oily and wavy, and dry brittle and wavy with color treatment.<br /><br />When trying the Clear Scalp Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, I expected greasy useless performance, but in once case I was wrong!<br /><br />Although the first three types of hair did not fare too well with the conditioner (too heavy and weighed down), the dry brittle wavy color treated hair does beautifully with this conditioner.  When using various shampoo with it, this conditioner left the hair beautifully shiny, soft, and very curly and wavy.  The color was enhanced nicely too.<br /><br />So, despite having a not to impressed outlook, this conditioner turned out to be a fantastic find and I know at least one person in our household will be using it until it is gone and most likely repurchasing too!<br /><br />We also like the way the container is made.  It stands up straight, does not leak, and dispenses the conditioner just right.  The scent is fresh and fruity/herbal very reminiscent of a high end brand which works well too.

review/summary: Moisturizes well and smells divine!
review/text: I have used this conditioner for two weeks now. I am very picky about conditioner. I have very long and fine hair that tends to be dry and flyaway at times. This conditioner moisturizes well and also leaves a wonderful smell to your hair. I have noticed it is east to comb my hair when I get out of the shower.<br /><br />The best thing is the summer has been very hot and humid and most conditioners leave my hair flyaway. The moisture this provides leaves my hair soft and not flyaway. At night it smells good still and so soft to the touch!<br /><br />I have been using it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>. The shampoo does not clean my hair well but the conditioner does wonders. I might try another shampoo to go with the conditioner since it works so well.

review/summary: Inexpensive, but leaves my hair soft and feeling healthier.
review/text: This is the 3rd conditioner from CLEAR SCALP & HAIR that I have tried recently.  The first one didn't do anything for my hair, the second was an improvement and I continue to use it and this one is even better than that.<br /><br />With this conditioner I have been using it every other day for close to two weeks.  If I use it daily it makes my hair to oily, but on the other schedule it leaves it soft and feeling moisturized.  It rinses well and also doesn't weigh my hair down, which is good for my naturally curly hair.  Additionally I have had less problem with frizziness which is great here in the Northwest. One last note is I do like the smell of it; although because it rinses well it doesn't linger as much on my hair as I would like.<br /><br />Overall for the price I am happy with this conditioner and will continue to use it in a rotation with other conditioners that work well for my hair.

review/text: I've used a similar type of conditioner and it seems that they all have a coconut scent I don't like.  I have to use a tiny bit of product, wash it out fully with water, more than i would normally use, yet the scent of the tropics still remains.  It does work, the scent just lingers for days.

review/summary: Shea Butter and Coconut make a nice pair
review/text: This conditioner is pleasant, in fact it is what I think clean should be.  I used this conditioner with its "partner" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>  and had wonderful results.  The conditioner, as the shampoo, has a cordial blend of ingredients such as shea butter, sunflower, coconut and almond, to list a few.  These ingredients promote a great clean feeling and a nice refreshing smell once the product is washed out of one's hair.  The fragrances of coconut and shea butter seem to stand out the most, but in a good way.  Overall, this is a wonderful product that left my hair (and my bathroom) feeling refreshed and clean.  I strongly recommend this product.

review/summary: Leaves my hair nice and smells great
review/text: The Clear Scalp Ultra Shea conditioner leaves my hair soft without feeling oily. My hair is pretty thin and I normally shave my head, but for the last few weeks, I had been letting it grow. In combination with the shampoo, this is a great product. It washes out well (better than the shampoo) and leaves my hair smelling nice (my wife loves it). I don't need to use a lot, so I think this will last me quite a while, even with my wife using it. My wife also loves it, and she has very long hair, while not as thin as mine, it is by no means thick. This is good enough to recommend.

review/summary: **GREAT PRODUCT, AMAZING VALUE****
review/text: I decided to get this product for my daughter who struggles with dandruff, since we had such success using the men's version of this same product for my son.  Smell was great, which was a plus; but since this is a shampoo geared towards a "clear" scalp, I didn't have high expectations with regard to the aesthetics of her hair after blow drying.  BOY was I wrong.  Her hair was soft, shiny, looked beautiful.  This is an added advantage to the obvious...which is resolving the dandruff problem, as the product appears to have also done.  I'll be sticking with this shampoo line for quite some time.<br /><br />-DYB

review/summary: Left my hair lifeless
review/text: I'm not sure if maybe this conditioner was not right for my type of hair (curly), but it was too heavy and my hair was just lifeless. The product itself its a thick pearly liquid, which smells wonderfully nutty. When I washed my hair it felt like it was extremely soft and I though that the end result would be great. I have curly hair which needs hydration so I thought this would work, but it made my curls just drag. I used the shampoo of the same kind with it for a month, then gave up, going back to my regular shampoo.
