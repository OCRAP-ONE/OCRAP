review/summary: And old favorite with a new taste
review/text: I have been a fan of Cheez-it crackers since my teen days when I enjoyed the cheddar cheese Cheez-its.  We used to sit in front of the TV with a bowl of Raspberry Apple Sauce and a box of Cheez-its.  Today I just received a new box, this one is Mozzarella Cheez-its, wow these are really a treat.  The flavor is much the same with a little subtle flavor of Mozzarella.<br /><br />Cheez-its, are made with 100% real cheese and you can taste it, the flavor is very fresh and creamy.<br />I do not detect any MSG, although it is in there, and I find that the sour taste that was noted is not (to me) sour but a bit tangy, it gives it the zip you would expect in a nice cheesy snack cracker.  We all have different tastes and I find this one is a winner for mine.<br /><br />I love them.<br /><br />For the health conscious here are the nutritional facts:<br /><br />Serving size: 25 crackers<br />Servings per box: 13<br />Total fat 7g  with no trans fats<br />Poly. Fats 3.5g<br />Monio. Fats. 1.5<br />Cholesterol: 0<br />Sodium 180<br />Total Carbs. 19g<br />Sugars 0<br />Protein 3g<br /><br />All in all I think this is a very nice baked flavorful crispy snack cracker.<br />I am enjoying them very much, and I think you will also.<br />My only problem now is to stop shoveling them into my mouth.<br />Enjoy

review/summary: Fun flavor, but my wife says she can taste the MSG
review/text: Up till now we've only had regular Cheez-It crackers in our home, so we thought the new Mozzarella-flavored crackers would be fun to try. In short: they're a hit. The kids really like them, and I guess that's what matters, as I don't get cheese-flavored crackers for me. The crackers do have a fun, mozzarella-like flavor. Nutritionally they have less Sodium and fat than regular Cheez-It crackers--a nice plus.<br /><br />I'm taking off one star for MSG. It's really down on the ingredients list, but my wife ate some crackers and--without having seen the ingredients list first--said they tasted like they were made with MSG (The regular crackers apparently do not contain MSG). If you're sensitive to the taste of MSG, it may be a bother to you too.

review/summary: Pretty good, not quite as good as the cheddar
review/text: These are pretty similar to regular Cheez-Its, with the exception that they are a white/pale yellow color and they have a slight powdery seasoning sprinkled on them that is supposed to taste like mozzarella.  It actually tastes a little more like the flavoring they put on sour cream potato chips than mozzarella to me, but it's still good.  I do slightly prefer regular Cheez-Its or the white cheddar flavor to this mozzarella flavor, as does my daughter (9 years old).  My wife says she actually likes the mozzarella flavor much more than regular Cheez-Its, so clearly it's a matter of personal preference.

review/summary: Sunshine's Mozzarella Cheez-It tastes great but there is no way this should be priced over $5 per box
review/text: In our household, we often purchase Cheez-It baked snack crackers and we often like to purchase various cheese flavors.<br /><br />My son absolutely loves Cheez-It's and often, we purchase the White Cheddar or original versions, but we noticed there was a new Mozzarella "Creamy & Mild" version that is available and is made with 100% real cheese.<br /><br />And for anyone who loves Mozzarella, the taste of these crackers are flavorful and as our 9-year-old would say "very yummy"!<br /><br />For those who are wondering about the nutrition facts, for 25 crackers, it's about 150 calories, cholesterol is 0mg and 0% and total fat is 11% with saturated fat at 8%.  Ingredients contains wheat, milk and soy.<br /><br />Now, purchasing Cheez-It are typically affordable but surprisingly a four-pack of a 13.7 ounce goes for nearly $30 and for a single box, they cost nearly $12.  For me, that is just insane...unless it's specially imported from Italy or if it was some huge family-sized package as big as family-sized cereal box, I can easily see how $12 is justified but for this small 13.7 ounce version to cost around $12 and a 4-pack for $30 just doesn't make sense (I am assuming that these third party sellers are factoring in huge shipping costs).<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Sunshine's Cheez-It's are delicious and like other various flavors, next to our favorite of White Cheddar, Mozzarrella "Creamy & Mild" is going to be the version we will most likely purchase... but as long as you can purchase Cheez-It's for under $5, it's hard to justify these being sold for $12 or $30 for four 13.7 oz. boxes, these are costing more than Crunchmasters and other crackers that are sold at Trader Joes and even speciality crackers that I have purchased in Tokyo.<br /><br />Overall, Sunshine's Mozzarella Cheez-It's are wonderful!  Too bad I can't say so much about the price!

review/text: opened the shipping box right away. Noticed it was slightly crushed on the top. No packing to protect the box of crackers. About 1/3 were crushed. Sad about that.<br /><br />Love the flavor though. They taste a little different than the white cheddar which I also love. Great mild and creamy taste. I noticed one of the other reviewers suggested to put them in salads and soups. Will save the broken ones for that. Nice idea.<br /><br />Thanks for another great product. Will buy them and also try some of the other new flavors.

review/summary: sour flavor
review/text: I didn't think these would have such a sour flavor. The first bite of one was fine, but after eating three or four, I couldn't handle how sour they are. My kids (5 and 2) really seem to enjoy them though. They're both asking for more. I also had a little bit of a strange feel in my mouth after eating them and a strong after taste. I guess they're not bad for a quick snack for the boys, but I won't be eating any more.

review/text: I had my doubts about a single serving cake bowl but this is the most ingenious dessert idea for people on the go. It is awsome because it is so easy to make. You just need a microwave. I bring them to work for a quick and hot sweet treat. But the greatest thing is that you don't have to worry about finishing off an entire pan of brownies. Just one satisfies my sweet tooth and I don't have all of the guilt from overeating. Unless of course you keep a cabinet full of these bowls...

review/summary: Good for an individual hot serving
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect from this product.  It has a lot of packaging and I suspect one could do this basic thing at home with a box of cake mix and a jar of ice cream topping; but still, this is rather cool.<br /><br />All you do is open the package, put the powder in the bowl, add 1/4 cup water and mix it, and squeeze the sauce packet on top.  Put in microwave for 1 minute and 15 seconds.  That's it.  I have been adding nuts to mine before cooking and that works great.  What results is basic chocolate cake with a mild caramel sauce squiggled on it.  The warmth factor is what makes this so appealing; it really seems to add a nice and satisfying quality to it.  Also, while it's definitely sweet, it isn't as sweet as I was worried it would be.  You could choose to use less of the caramel sauce if you wanted, of course, or add other ingredients like I do; I'm going to try coconut and berries, but just a few nuts is really great.<br /><br />I don't think I would buy this again simply because I feel like the packaging is overkill and I do want to try replicating this process with a plain box of cake mix.  But it does taste good, and it works effectively and quickly.

My husband was watching Ace of Cakes one night and then wanted cake, so I made one of these and in about a minute we were sharing the cake...no waste! I pick them up on sale and keep a couple in the pantry. The lemon cake is excellent too.

review/text: I have tried microwave cakes in the past and was always disappointed at the texture and consistancy of the end result, but not this time. The cake is almost as good as if you baked it in the oven only much quicker and easier. All you have to do is add water to the mix, stir together, squeeze the carmel from the packet onto the cake and put it in the microwave for approx. 1 min. and 15 seconds and you have a decent cake without the trouble, time and mess of making a full size cake mix.<br /><br />Try it, you'll be glad you did.

review/text: The Pelindaba organic lavender Rooibos tea is a delicious caffein free tea. It is a natural source of health promoting minerals,  has a high level of antioxidants AND it is low in tannins. If you have not tried Rooibos (South African "red bush") I suggest you try this tea. The hint of lavender infusion is delightful. You can also make a wash of the tea for acne problems.

review/summary: High Quality Cat Food- can't beat $26+Free Shipping!
review/text: PROS:- High Quality Nutritious Cat food, Easily Digestable= less litterbox waste  Helps with Urinary & Constipation/Bowel/Allergy Related Issues, Human Grade Ingredients, Non Allergenic, No Fillers, Good Flavors- even for finicky cats. So even though it's a bit more to pay up front, it actually saves $$ in the long run in the form of healthier cats (most important), less food eaten & less litter used.<br /><br />CONS: Definitely a bit expensive but I bought it for $25.97 w/ Free Shipping through Petco on Amazon.com so I felt that was a very good value!! I will stock up when it is at that price for sure!<br /><br />TIP:- I actually WET THIS FOOD DOWN quite a bit, to a thick spaghetti sauce consistency. It's actually better for the cats b/c it increases their water intake which they desperately need since their thirst drive is so low. That helps prevent & control Urinary Issues such as: crystals, etc. ALL of my cats actually PREFER it this wetter way & it makes the can go a longer ways too, so more value!<br /><br /> I do cat rescue/fostering on occasion & this food has helped me nurse sick cats & kittens to health. The food is highly nutritious & easily digestable, therefore helping stomach & bowel ailments improve. I  also have a cat w/ chronic acid reflux disease & one prone to urinary crystals & this helps keep those conditions under control. Also my sister's cat who was always snorty & snotty w/ allergies got completely better after being on this food, I believe due to no grain being used in this product.<br /> A good way to see how digestable a wet food is  to wet it down w/ water, it should easily dissolve in. A bad food will be chunky & hard to dissolve in water. Just think how it will act on a cat's stomach! A lot of low quality cheap foods will just sit in the cat's stomach, not absorbing any nutrients into the body & then it just comes out as smelly poop!  Also, because they are getting less nutrients, the cats will EAT MORE therefore costing more $ in food, more litterbox waste cuz it goes right through them. I actually have less litterbox waste when I use Wellness & the cats eat less cuz they are more full.<br /><br /> After the pet food contamination scare in 2007, I really educated my self on what actually is in pet food & boy was I freaked out. I used to buy Science Diet thinking it was good for my pets but the ingredients are not species appropriate or high quality AT ALL. Veterinarians are generally extremely undereducated in animal nutrition, and they generally tout the food from the company that sponsors their schooling or otherwise they have a vested financial interest in. After having my cats be on medicines & "special vet diets" that did little to help, I switched to high quality cat foods, Wellness being one of them and my cats are thriving and some of them have gone off their meds completely. I HIGHLY recommended the Wellness brand, I have seen a HUGE difference in my own cats as well as the cats I rescue. PLEASE, PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELF ON WHAT IS REALLY IN MOST PET FOOD AND YOU WILL SEE WHY WELLNESS IS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Excellent nutrition, well liked cat food.
review/text: I switched to this cat food after our eldest cat was diagnosed with diabetes and required a change in diet to maintain his health. We got a serious crash course in cat nutrition and realized that cats should be fed this stuff all the time, not just when they're sick.<br /><br />This product is very low carbohydrate and high animal protein; perfect for a cat's required nutrient needs. I enjoy buying the Wellness brand as they hold high standards for what they put in their products and I feel comfortable supporting their company with my purchase.<br /><br />This can will last three days in a house with three cats. We feed this as a snack, more than a meal, but everyone seems satisfied with their share. All the cats are also fed dry food during the day, so if you only feed wet food this will not last you as long.

review/summary: Seemed like a good food but caused urinary crystals twice
review/text: I fed this flavor to my cat for over two and a half years (as a kitten he ate grain-free Innova), almost exclusively wet food. If he got hungry later I'd give him a tiny sprinkle of Wellness dry (salmon), but twice a day he got this food. He developed urinary crystals TWICE even though the food says it's designed to prevent this problem.<br /><br />I was a big believer in healthy, grain-free, wet food, "natural" cat food diets. Even when I was unemployed for a year, my cat continued to eat Wellness while I ate instant noodles. It was fine, I thought I was feeding him the best and pre-emptively striking against any preventable health problems. Well, he got urinary crystals on one occasion; I brought him to the vet, $1,000 later and he seemed fine. The vet cautioned me against returning to the same diet but I somehow thought it would be okay and that the diet wasn't to blame. Well, it was. A few months later he got the same problem. Another $1,000 later and boarding for four days, my vet (whom I've trusted with all my pets, dearly, for many years) told me that (1) the "natural pet food craze" was overblown and ridiculous, that he's fed a leading brand of standard grocery store cat food and has had cats live beyond 19 years; (2) the diet was the cause of my cat's troubles, and I had to change it.<br /><br />Well, now he's on prescription food that's even more expensive than the fancy stuff but with seemingly far less high-quality ingredients. But he hasn't had the problem come back, and from what I can tell, he's got the same energy levels and healthy coat as before, just minus the urinary troubles. The stray cats my family and I feed (six others) all get the junky grocery stuff like Friskies, Fancy Feast, and Purina, and they have never needed to go to the hospital. I know diet isn't the only factor but it is certainly the major one. I would rather have my cat eating food that doesn't send him to the hospital with a life-threatening condition, than one that makes me feel good about its "naturalness." Mind you, urinary crystals are severely painful and will kill your cat if not treated within hours. This food might work for many owners but I'm not taking the risk again.

review/summary: Wellness is the best I've found
review/text: First, let me say that I watched my previous two cats die early on a diet of dry cat food - one from diabetes, one from kidney failure. I decided to do a lot of research I came to the conclusion that dry cat food keeps a cat in a constant state of dehydration. I own a pet sitting business and have displeased many cat owners with this information - feed only dry food and you can't get them enough water to prevent UTI, kidney/liver damage, diabetes and pre-mature death.<br /><br />I have raised my next cats on a diet of Wellness grain-free canned and the results have been amazing in all areas - their coat, their weight, their energy and their overall health. There is one caveat:  A diet of the best wet cat food doesn't do much to keep their teeth clean. I recommend a tablespoon of a dry dental food each day to combat tartar.

Busy chews last about five to ten minutes of total enjoyment!  Only wish I could get the bigger 9 oz boxes and find them at grocery store.  There are about 15 chews in each of this size box.

review/summary: Flavorless
review/text: Prior purchases were darker and had a lot more flavor.  My two Shih Tzu's just chewed on them for hours.  This purchase was bland and had no flavor.  Appears manufacturer was saving money by providing less color and flavor.  The final test was when the dogs looked, smelled and walked away.  Opened several more but the test was the same.

review/summary: Keeps her attention!
review/text: We have tried several different "chewables" for our dog, and we have found that she either eats them too quickly, or loses interest (as another reviewer mentioned). We tried her ont he Purina Chewnola, but she just started chewing off the granola layer and then hiding the rawhide part under furniture!<br /><br />With the heartyhides, she has YET to not finish one in a sitting, and will happily trot off with one in her mouth to work on for 10 minutes or so. Such a great treat to keep her busy, and it's basted in chicken flavor so that tail keeps wagging!<br /><br />Definitely recommended!

With regular Dingo mini bones he leaves half of the bone and they take a day or two and sometimes cause his mouth to bleed.  Max does not beg for them.  We used to buy these at Walmart but they no longer carry them and we could not find them locally so Amazon is the way to go for these.

review/summary: I think it's Great!!
review/text: The school where I work has a "popcorn day" one Friday per month.  The popcorn is popped in a theater-type popper.  They use the Act II Buttery flavored oil and the Act II butter flavored salt.  I don't know how others who gave such poor reviews are popping their corn, but our popcorn is fabulous!  It is a huge hit at school, both with the kids and the adult staff.  We have families who buy enough for every member of the family for a movie and popcorn night.  Maybe others are not measuring it correctly, or are not using the right popper.  I don't know.  All I can say is I love this stuff!!  I smell it being popped all day and can't wait to eat it!!  It takes all my willpower to keep from eating a bag of it for lunch!<br /><br />If you use the Act II salt with the oil, be careful not to use too much of the salt.  It seems to be concentrated.  It doesn't take as much as you might think.<br /><br />If I could have these people send me their supply that they obviously don't know how to use, I'd be in heaven!<br /><br />I'm buying myself a theater-style popper for Christmas, just so I can have this popcorn more often than once a month!

review/summary: Spicy and Calming......
review/text: I am not a tea connoisseur. I just started drinking herbal<br /><br />teas about a month ago. However, since then I have tried many and this is one of my favorite. At first I did not like the medicinal smell. But, the tea taste great. It is a spicy cinnamon licorice flavor, more than sarsaparilla. If you don't like anise(black licorice)taste, do not buy this tea. Instead try the Yogi tea Cocoa Spice. It is sweet and delicious. It's my favorite. The reason I drink Detox is because it does seem to have some detoxing benefits. Also, I feel extremely relaxed after drinking this tea. It really calms me, without making me tired. I am not sure what herb is doing this...but it is almost as good as a glass of wine! So far, I like Yogi tea better than any I have tried. It is worth the extra cost for a great tea.

review/text: The taste of this tea will take some getting used to - it's a bit peppery and warm, and you can taste a tiny bit of licorice in it. Sounds disgusting, I know, but it isn't bad - just...odd. I've heard that it helps with recovery from colds and mild illnesses, though I haven't tried it for that purpose myself. As for the "detox" effects, they're extremely mild and you likely won't notice any physical difference (except for increased energy, perhaps).

review/text: I love the 34 degree cracked peppercorn, wheat, and other varieties so I thought I would try the caramel, cinnamon, and graham as an alternative to cookies or regular graham crackers. True - you can have a lot of these crackers for little calories/carbs, but the flavor is bland. In terms of satisfaction, they don't quite cut it for me as a snack unless I put peanut butter or something on them. They would probably be good as part of a fruit and cheese dessert platter, along with some peanut butter, fruit spread, honey, or cream cheese.

review/text: The crackers were VERY DELICIOUS.  I have tried all of the savory 34 degrees cracker flavors and Rosemary is the best--hands down.  This caramel flavor is tasty.  I don't know how they do it--it is thin and flaky in texture like a thin rice cracker, but it tastes like creamy caramel.  The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was how it arrived--most of the cookies in the box were crumbled, which would probably make a good ice cream topping.  Still, I would have preferred if they arrived intact.

It has pretty much what it says in the title - there is no 'hidden' beef in every can, unless it says so on the front (we don't feed beef, only seafood or poultry, which are more natural to animals this size, and in protest to the treatment of cows). There is also a full list of vitamins and minerals (meets the AAFCO requirements). Overall, THIS IS IT! :)

review/text: I have 3 indoor cats and 2 of them liked it, the other one wouldn't even taste it. The 2 outdoor cats eat anything I feed them. Of course it's mostly sardine but you can see the crab meat and bits of shrimp. This flavor does have a strong scent, likely the reason the one cat wouldn't try it. Still you are getting a lot of meat as the filler is only a small amount of a gelatin substance to hold it all together. All of my cats like the other flavors of this brand so I may stick w/ the flavors that do not contain sardines. I still think this brand is a great value compared w/ the ingredients in other canned cat food.

review/text: In principle I like lard.  It's rich in mono-unsaturated fat, and the dangers of saturated fat have been greatly overstated and over-hyped -- it may not in fact be harmful at all.  This comes in a neat, tidy package and doesn't need refrigeration, but the problem is that it's been hydrogenated in order to have a nice, firm, even consistency, and hydrogenation can't help but add some trans-fats -- something nobody should be eating at all (barring a few found naturally in fat from ruminant animals, which are very different in structure from those found in hydrogenated fats, and seem to be beneficial to eat).<br /><br />I suspect that the levels of trans-fats here aren't way high -- the hydrogenation is probably just enough to make a firm, consistent product -- but I'd rather avoid them entirely.

review/text: If you can get $49 worth of products and free shipping from Vitacost, this costs you about $1.53 per lb, which is a terrific deal. Be aware that Vitacost won't let you know if the item is back ordered; you'll have to call and ask if your order arrives short. This can go in your freezer for several months so buy in bulk when you can!<br /><br />It's a great product for GF baking (try Elizabeth Barbone's baking book for easy and tasty recipes) and less costly to use than a GF mix. It's a bit grainy, which is actually a plus in some cookies. I made Ginger Snaps from the above book with it and they were great. Any cookie leftovers (yeah, right!) can be used to make crusts for cream pies and cheesecakes.<br />I haven't noticed any grainy texture in finished baked items like muffins. The graininess actually makes it a favorite in my homemade GF breading mix, adding a nice dimension to fried and baked breaded chicken, cube steaks, etc. Add a little grated strong cheese to your rice flour breading for a flavor boost.

This canned coffee drink is strong, black, but too sweet for me. I liked that it was more like coffee rather than a cream drink with some coffee mixed in, but the sweetness of it killed it for me. It wasn't terrible to the point of "I can't drink this" but it also wasn't so good that I would go out and buy it. I do love iced coffee though and I would consider buying an unsweetened version. I never let the coffee shop put the sweetener in my coffee, I want to do it myself to my taste and feel the same with a bottled or canned coffee such as this. I could tell there was a good expresso coffee flavor to this drink and would definitely like to try a plain version I could make to my own taste.

review/summary: Very nice iced coffee
review/text: This is a great pre-made and sweetened iced coffee.  Not bitter, no metallic aftertaste from the can, and not too sweet, though it is very strong as an espresso based drink should be.<br /><br />My wife poured her share into a glass and added a splash of creamer and that was also very good.<br /><br />Summary: Recommended as a quality iced coffee perfect for those hot summer days.

review/summary: I thought it was perfect - a little sweet without being too sweet
review/text: I drank this cold and could not be more pleased. The coffee was high quality arabica - I always notice when coffee is arabica or robusta. It was sweet without being too sweet - how'd they do that? I mean, you can't compare this to the major bottled coffee brand for that reason alone. You can keep this in the fridge at work and offer it to people without looking like you're pushing calories along with caffeine.<br /><br />For a long time, I'd stock highly sweetened coffee beverages in the fridge at work.  Then I noticed that people stopped consuming them, and it happened around the same time that I lost interest in that level of sweetness.  I recommend this drink for those that prefer a lower level of sugar and for old school arabica coffee types.

review/summary: Woah - now this is coffee drink tastes like coffee
review/text: And if that's what you're looking for then this should be your cup of... coffee. Seriously, this can only contains four ingredients: coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate. I don't know what those last two are, but I can tell you that there's plenty of coffee in here and only a dash of sugar. Unlike other iced coffee drinks in a can that I've had this one is hardly sweetened and definitely doesn't have any cream in it. The label describes it as an "espresso style coffee drink" and they're not messing around. I had trouble getting this down because I like a lot of cream and sugar in my coffee, but if you like your coffee black this is the can you've been looking for.

review/summary: illy issimo - Caffe In A Can!
review/text: I have tried different illy brand products and have always enjoyed their products. The new illy brand "issimo" line which translates loosely to "extremely" or "remarkably" pretty much lives up to it's moniker. At 6.8 oz. and only 45 calories, it is a nice pick me up in the AM. I only enjoy cold coffee products in the summertime when it's hot so I wouldn't be a year round drinker of issimo but I liked the flavor and especially the sweetness of the product. It isn't at all sweet, thick and doesn't have an overly "canned" quality to it which I found nice. I still preferred the cann cappucinno over the caffe, however.  Issimo is a light product that doesn't leave you feeling bloated or heavy. At just under $2.00 a can, it's not the cheapest coffee beverage out there but it's certainly more cost effective than your local, upscale coffee shop.

review/summary: Yummy and  Convenient
review/text: I love my coffee--in any way shape or form. I especially love to add espresso shots to a regular cup of coffee. But one thing I've never done is have espresso over ice.<br /><br />This product had sugar added (beet sugar) so it is NOT made for purists and a web search did not give me the info I wanted as to how much caffeine this product has.<br /><br />What it does have is an excellent flavor that was unexpected from a canned product and a convenience that I find gratifying.<br /><br />Take the warning on the back of the can seriously--do NOT shake this product before using, it actually isn't necessary (I shook it a little to see why there was a warning and it frothed all over the place when I opened it).<br />- if you don't have issues other than not wanting milk in your iced espresso have no fear, if there was milk in it I couldn't tell.<br /><br />Delicious, flavorful, not overly bitter -just enough to give a kick, convenient.<br /><br />I will definitely buy more of this product! At a 1.92 per nearly a 7oz can - and with a 20% off coupon when you buy from Amazon, this is a pretty good deal for the convenience of it all!

review/text: Not the greatest canned coffee ever made...it had a very bitter taste to it to me.  I wasnt' thrilled at the amount of "in your face" flavor it had, even for an espresso style drink.  I guess I would rather have had that hot vs. cold.  At only 50 calories a can, it can be used as a pick me up on a hot day and you'll be going until nightime ;)<br />Much preferred the "flavored" variety, but if you like Italian blend, espresso style coffee, it's worth trying.

review/summary: It Certainly Tastes Like Coffee!
review/text: Obvious yes, given that this is an 'Italian Espresso'style coffee drink.<br /><br />"It isn't too bad!"  VERY high praise from my husband, seeing as he doesn't even like coffee.<br /><br />But I do, and while this had a richer flavor than I was expecting, I am not a huge fan of the aftertaste.<br /><br />I am no espresso connoisseur, in fact that only espresso I have ever had is Starbucks, so I don't have a whole lot to compare it to, but I do like strong coffee.  A slightly bitter taste is actually something I enjoy, as opposed to overly sweetened coffee that seem to be the rage.  This little can (6.8 FL OZ) certainly has that.  It has a surprisingly bitter taste with just the right amount of sweetness.  At 50 calories a can, it's relatively diet friendly too.<br /><br />But there, at least for me, was something of a strange film in my mouth.  Not a big deal, but at almost $2 per can ($22.93 for 12) I expect to like it much more than I did.  If I was running errands and really wanted some iced coffee, I might consider this, but at home I will stick with my own brew.

review/summary: Surprised to find good coffee in a can!!
review/text: As a devout drinker of good, fresh roasted/ground/drip brewed, strong coffee, I approached this can of ILLYissimo espresso with much skepticism and profoundly low expectations. The experience of drinking it caught me by complete surprise as it is entirely acceptable as a cold/cool glass of coffee on the run!<br /><br />Described by another reviewer as "muddy water in a can", I can only infer that strong coffee is not to that person's liking. This IS a strong formulation and does not suffer from the burnt taste or bitter aftertaste that many other canned coffee beverages have. It is sweetened, but mildly so and used beet sugar to do this.  Too many other canned coffee beverages are overly sweetened thereby destroying any vestige of honest coffee flavor.<br /><br />Made in Denmark and distributed by Coca-Cola, it is a pleasure to find an alternative to either sickeningly sweet or simply bad coffee in cans or bottles.<br /><br />Rich, satisfying and easily portable, I plan to have a pack of these in my desk drawer (or in the refrigerator) at work for those days when brewing hot coffee isn't right - but a smooth and satisfying 6.8 ounces of the 'real thing' chilled would really hit the spot.

review/text: It's not bad.  I had this on my way into work.  Great way to get some caffiene in ya before work!  It only has 4 ingredients: Coffee, sugar, and the other two I assume are preservatives or something.  It tasted almost creamy, although there is no cream in it!  It was sweeter - more sweet than anything else.  The coffee flavor is on the watery side.  It tasted like one of those cold Starbucks drinks you can buy, only not as creamy.  I thought it was good enough - but I'd never buy them.  My preference for a cold coffee-style drink is those excellent Starbucks bottle things!!!

It left me more thirsty than when I finished it.<br /><br />Overall not very good.

review/summary: Not overly bitter like most espresso, but...
review/text: Let's face it, espresso is not for the casual coffee drinker.  It's highly concentrated, and generally tastes terribly bitter.  But I thought I'd give this illy drink a whirl anyway. It does seem a bit tame for espresso -- which is a good thing if you're not an aficionado; but for those who love espresso, this will likely be too dilute. I think illy's canned cappuccino drink tastes much better.  But I guess if you're a serious coffee drinker, having an espresso on the go like this would be a good thing.  I think the price is relatively fair considering the cost of packaging, manufacturing, distribution, et al, but at the end of the day, I still think it's far too steep a price for canned coffee.  Overall, it's just ok.

review/summary: Surprising
review/text: What can you expect from coffee in a can? I certainly did not have very high expectations. However, when I first tasted this illy coffee, I was surprised by its strong coffee flavor. I do like my coffee strong. Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find the taste bitter. Generally, I do not put sugar in my coffee, or anything else for that matter. So I did notice the sugary taste.<br /><br />After trying the illy at room temperature, I decided that it would be fair to compare it with my usual hot coffee, so I poured the remaining liquid into a coffee cup and plopped it into the microwave. When heated, it was better than at room temperature. Good coffee taste, but still too sweet.<br /><br />This coffee drink has 10 grams of sugar per can. That is almost as much sugar as there is in a tablespoon of granulated sugar, which comes in at 13 grams. I would never put that much sugar in a single cup of coffee. Some people may like it though.

review/text: I got one can of Illy issimo coffee drink free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review about it.<br /><br />I like strong, dark coffee, but avoid most canned coffee beverages because of the sugar and carbs. We drink French roast coffee at home, brewed very strong, so most coffees at restaurants and in cans taste weak to me.<br /><br />This little can of espresso was a pleasant surprise - it only contains 50 calories and 12 carbs. It had a strong coffee flavor but I didn't detect any bitterness or aftertaste like some reviewers reported. It also had a nice little caffeine kick, probably because the coffee is strong.<br /><br />Of all the canned coffee beverages I've tried, this one is my favorite.

review/summary: Not-bad coffee taste
review/text: For a wanna-be Italian coffee produced in Denmark and distributed by Coca-Cola, this is much better than expected.  It really does have a smooth, rich espresso flavor.<br /><br />It is sweetened, but fortunately real sugar is used, so there is no strange aftertaste, and there is not enough sugar to mask the delicious coffee flavor.  Of course, refined sugar is never healthy, and there are 10 grams of sugar per can, but this would still make a nice occasional treat on a long road trip, and I could foresee myself having one again.<br /><br />Now, make no mistake, you will never get the best coffee flavor from a can, but this still beats most of the fresh-brewed coffee served in most convenience stores or offices, and you have the convenience of popping one in your cooler or handbag to enjoy at your convenience.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's not the best, but for what it is, I'm impressed.

review/summary: Kind of shocked to like this!
review/text: Not exactly the highest possible praise, but as something of a coffee snob, I was surprised to find this so palatable.  And really, if you need a caffeine hit, isn't it better to down something that didn't have to be formulated inside of a lab?  Five Hour Energy Drinks, I'm talking to *you*.<br /><br />What's in the can?  Coffee, beet sugar, potassium carbonate and potassium citrate.  Those last two you can buy in the vitamin/supplement aisle of your drugstore, and they do have natural antacid properties - I don't think they are used here as preservatives, but rather to tone down coffee's natural acidity.  I get good balance in the flavor of the coffee, so it's easy to enjoy without the addition of milk - great for me as a lactose-intolerant coffee drinker.  If you happen to already cold-brew in the fridge at home for lower acid, you'll appreciate the difference.  On the other hand, if you're a huge fan of bright, acid-y Central American coffees as opposed to the deeper Sumatrans and Suwalesis, then for you this might be a deficit.<br /><br />I'd keep this around in warm weather to offer iced to guests.  It's true that you can probably brew a better cup, if you start with good beans, but I think the convenience here is worth the price, particularly if you don't normally brew much coffee. Roasted beans kept in storage go stale - FAST.<br /><br />For decades, Illy has enjoyed a reputation for reliable, if not exceptional quality, and I'd sooner have one of these than a Starbucks canned or a McCafe any day. (Even if they did partner with Coca Cola for this latest Issimo line, says the coffee snob.)

The can is small, the calorie count is 50, the taste really standard. Anyone with some instant coffee, sugar, and ice could make this easily. I don't even see it as being a matter of giving up taste for convenience, as it's not a "fancy" drink.

review/text: There are times when making iced coffee or even getting premium iced coffee from a coffee shop is not a possibility, and for those times, having some cans of illy issimo caffe would be great.  The caffeine--plus a little sugar--really hit the spot.  It isn't a big serving, but the benefit of that is that it's only 50 Kcal a can!<br />The downside?  $2. for 6.8 oz. is a lot.  So while I will buy this drink from time to time when I stop into a deli for something to allay my thirst and caffeine deprivation, I don't think I'd stock up for home use, because making iced coffee by the quart, and keeping it in the fridge, isn't that onerous.

Some people may not like the taste of it, since most of are used to having either black coffee or black coffee with cream and sugar, but black coffee with sugar - hmm.<br /><br />Overall, I did like the taste of it.  If you are planning to buy this, I would suggest trying a single can before doing a bulk order

review/summary: Good expresso
review/text: I usually have four or more cups of strong black coffee every day, and I like to pick up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CDP2XA">Starbucks DoubleShot Espresso Drink 12 ct</a> if I am starting my day away from my coffee pot, so I have tried this kind of drink before. If you don't like the "burnt coffeepot" taste of espresso, then don't get this product. I put this on par with Starbuck's product of the same type. Would I go out of my way to get this product instead of Starbucks? No, I would not. In my area, this product is significantly more expensive than Starbuck's. So, I would get this product if it is available for less $$, which at retail, usually isn't less $$.

review/summary: Sweet Coffee
review/text: This drink is really good. It contains no cream. Just coffee and a touch of sugar. It isn't overly sweetened at all. It is perfect. The coffee flavor is bold with a slight acidity. At only 50 calories, this coffee drink could easily be a daily habit.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it seemed weird to me drinking coffee from a can. I'm not so much a can person. And these cans are pretty small.

review/summary: A bit strong but nice
review/text: As I sit here and taste this for the first time I wonder what it is that I like so much and what it is that makes me not like it.  The coffee flavor is really there, so it can hold up to the ice you will no doubt use to make this truly iced coffee.<br />It is a bit bitter, it needs to be smoothed with some milk or non dairy milk product to give it the nice smooth flavor of iced coffee.  The sugar content is fairly low for this kind of product so is the calorie count, 50 cals. per 6.8 fluid ounces. The only thing "for me" is the caffeine is a little high, and is openly stated on the back label, to be: 155 mg/per 6.8 fl. oz.<br />I do like this product as long as I can add some "milk" to smooth it out a little.<br />As far as I can see, this is a pure product and is made well.<br />I would drink this again.

review/summary: Has a good taste but maybe too much added sugar
review/text: I enjoy my coffee but I normally add only a touch of sugar, if any at all to my coffee. When I do add sugar, I would put no more than a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar in my cup of coffee. I also will generally choose a dark roast coffee, like French Roast or Sumatra.<br /><br />This illy Caffe coffee drink is an Italian Roast coffee. It has a decent taste in my opinion. I was expecting some sort of "canned" taste but didn't sense that at all while I was drinking it. But I did experience an aftertaste that I can only describe as somewhat metallic.<br /><br />I usually drink the dark roast coffees but was surprised to find that this had a really  nicely balanced coffee taste without the pronounced bitterness usually associated with the bigger, bolder dark roasts to which I'm accustomed.<br /><br />It was the added sugar that I don't really care for. The serving size is 6.8 fluid ounces and that contains 10g of sugar. A teaspoon of sugar is approximately 4 g which means this 6.8 oz can of coffee has the equivalent of 2.5 teaspoons of sugar. Even if I did put sugar in a cup of coffee, I'd only put in a single teaspoon. So for me it was way too sweet. Knowing that many people do sweeten their coffee, I'd say that many people would not find this as overly sweet as I did. You'd probably like it if you sweeten your coffee.<br /><br />I find it convenient to be able to have with you on trips or travels, a good quality cup of coffee. This tastes much better to me than your typical gas station swill that is passed on as coffee. So for trips or commutes it would be a great choice. Just be careful if you are diabetic or have sugar restrictions because there is quite a bit of sugar in a serving. Other than that it tastes pretty good to me.

And, as a plus, I didn't have to brew a pot of coffee to get my coffee kick. The low calorie count didn't make a dent in my calories for the day so I celebrated with some chocolate sorbet!

review/text: In a nutshell this is a 6.8oz Italian Espresso style drink, made in Denmark, by the Coco-Cola company, sweetened with 10g of sugar, comes in a small can and has 50 calories.<br /><br />I don't usually drink coffee from a can so this was an interesting trial. I tried this two ways, first as a straight espresso. But since I don't drink my coffee room temperature, I heated it up in a microwave. Straight up, I'd say this was a little weak, and the 10g of sugar doesn't do anything for it. If I drink it black, 10g of sugar takes a little of the bite away; if I drink it sweetened, it's not sweet enough. It's a like a matter of trying to please everyone but not making anyone happy.<br /><br />Next, I tried it as a latte and added some milk and heated it up. I usually drink my latte without sugar but since this already had a little and not enough at that, I sweetened it a little more. As a latte it was actually not bad.<br /><br />The taste is a little bland (not talking about strength but flavor) but I'm accustomed to making my own coffee from different beans so I wouldn't mark it down that much. It says it's 100% Arabica but that doesn't really tell you much since the most common bean grown is C. arabica. Is it the dregs swept from around the world or is it the finest hand picked? Coffee taste itself is very subjective so all I'm saying here is that the taste is not very specific to a region that I can tell. I really have to give kudos for Coca-Cola for trying to make a canned presentation out of a product whose taste is so personal and difficult to please.<br /><br />It doesn't have any caffeine information on the can but I wonder if they juiced it up because it gave me a buzz that I only usually get when I drink extra concentrated coffee.<br /><br />I would think that cans like this are meant to be drunk cold from the fridge or from a cooler and unfortunately I didn't think to save some of it to drink with ice or cold. But overall I think it's an OK substitute for someone who needs his coffee fix when there is absolutely no cafe around and it's not too bad for a situation like that.

review/summary: This Illi Issimo Drink Packs A Strange Combination Of Sweet And Bitter
review/text: Through the years, I've tried just about every pre-made coffee beverage imaginable. I am a coffee lover and enthusiast, so I'm married to the idea of buying a can or bottle of a delicious coffee based product that I'll live happily ever after with. My experiences, however, have yet to yield bliss. Some are just fine, but nothing has ever made me say "Wow! I'd like to drink this all the time!" I had heard some positive things about the illy issimo brand, so given the opportunity--I sampled both their Caffe and their Cappuccino.<br /><br />Caffe (2 1/2 stars) is, in their own words, an Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink. At first, I thought this drink had a strong and pronounced coffee flavor. But something is slightly off. The more I drank, it seemed too sweet and too bitter at once, which is a strange and not altogether pleasant combination. As it is essentially comparable to drinking an iced espresso, it may not be as palatable as some of their other creations. But, it's not really something that I would sample again. And at an approximate cost of $2.00 per can (only 6.8 ounce), this serves more as a caffeine boost than a refreshing beverage. Made with real Arabica coffee, I was also intrigued by the "Do Not Shake" warning which left me with the unappetizing visual of the particulate matter that must still be in the liquid drink (fine for Turkish coffee, not so appealing for something in a can).<br /><br />Cappucino (3 1/2 stars) is, in their own words, an Espresso Style Coffee Drink with Lowfat Milk and Cocoa. So, at 8.45 ounces this is a slightly bigger drink. As some of the harshness is buffered by the milk and cocoa combination, this one easily had a more pleasant taste. Still, a bit sweet for my liking but better overall. I'm still not blown away and I won't be a regular purchaser of this, or any illi issimo brand drinks, but I didn't dislike this one. Nice enough once in a while, but not inspiring enough to purchase a case. I guess I'll remain a fresh made kind of coffee drinker! KGHarris, 6/12.

review/summary: for a canned coffee, it's okay
review/text: My first choice for a coffee is never a can. I much prefer perked, homemade, hot coffee. Being of English/German background, Espresso was never a standard drink in our home. All that being said, this coffee was okay for a canned drink. There is no cream in it, so the color is dark. It is much less sweet than the Cappuccino version put out by illy, as so I liked it better than the Cappuccino.<br /><br />I did not taste the metal aftertaste in the Caffe/Espresso drink that I detected in the Cappuccino version, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />After drinking 1/2 a can straight to get the full flavor, I added a hint of half and half cream (I know, not traditional, but I'm not Italian) and I liked it better than without. This is a quick fix for a caffeine boost if you are in a hurry.<br /><br />The can is smaller than the Cappuccino, having 6.8 oz, 50 calories and 100% Natural Arabica.  One can would be more than enough for me in one day. Don't shake the can before serving.

review/summary: Why is it sugared?
review/text: I really wish I knew what was up with this country and sweeteners.  These days you can barely get a cup of coffee somewhere without someone dumping sugar into it without asking.  So along comes Illy's ready-to-drink "espresso-style" coffee and I imagine I should have guessed that it would be sweetened.  I didn't.  It was an unpleasant shock,not only because I hate sugar in my coffee, but because you have to check the ingredient list to find the sugar. Okay, fair enough, you should look at the ingredient list on everything you put in your mouth, but it should also say "pre-sweetened" on the front of the can. I'm just sayin'.<br /><br />All that aside, and making an honest attempt to evaluate the stuff in spite of the sugar, I'd have to say that it's a good, smooth, tasty brew.  I've always liked Illy coffee and this brewed stuff isn't half bad for something that comes out of a can.  I think I'd prefer it from a glass bottle, but what are the odds of that happening? As it is, the flavor of the can isn't a huge problem, but it sure doesn't add anything to the experience.<br /><br />Tiny can doesn't go very far either.  Presumably the reason why Illy has produced a ready-to-drink brew is for people who want to grab a can out of the fridge and swig it down.  If they're going to heat it... well no, I don't even want to think about that.  Ugh. So it's meant to be drunk cold.  Twelve ounces would have made more sense in that case.  This isn't a tiny cup of hot espresso we're talking about, it's a cold beverage. If Illy is going to bow down to the Sugar Gods of America, they can darn well do a bit of homage to the Gods of Conspicuous Consumption, too.  But $2 for less than 7 ounces of coffee?  Thanks but no thanks as Sarah Palin famously remarked.  @2 for a 12 oz can is still a bit high, but more acceptable overall.<br /><br />So kudos to Illy for using sugar instead of HFCS, but points off for using any sweetener at all.  Good flavor and body, but cans just don't lend themselves to a good coffee-drinking experience.  Cans are too small and the price is too high.  Buy a tin of Illy and brew your own.  It'll taste better and you'll save money.

review/summary: ok
review/text: This is a strong iced coffee drink in a small can.  The coffee is light to moderate in acidity, clean tasting,with a medium level of bitterness, quite strong and quite rich.  There is no milk or cream in it.  There is a little sugar which gives the drink a moderate level of sweetness that is good and appropriate.  Drinking it straight, the taste is a little too lean and austere.  I prefer iced coffee to have a little dairy for roundness and body.  Coffee of this strength alone leaves too dry a taste and lacking in richness.  That aside, I added a small scoop of vanilla ice cream to this drink and it tasted very nice.  It has all the missing parts filled in as far as I am concerned.  Most bottled ice coffee drinks with cream are too sweet.  This one isn't.  It just needs a bit of roundness from the ice cream (half-and-half will do similarly).  Overall, it is an ok drink.  From a can though, if you have no access to milk or cream, this drink may be a bit too strong and too dry to have broad appeal.

review/summary: Not too sweet -- Good taste, even right from the can
review/text: The first thing I did was Shake The Can. Then I saw the "Do Not Shake" warning but I opened the can anyway and nothing happened. I suspect the DNS is in reference to the Potassium Bicarbonate (fizz-producer?) that lurks within the ingredients. There WAS a nice little "kick" to this -- perhaps from the Potassium Bicarbonate.<br /><br />The initial taste produced an "aaah!" reaction. This is a nice full-bodied coffee, straight from the can, or iced (if consumed shortly after being iced). As a coffee purist who grew up with my Italian Nonna and her old-fashioned espresso pots, it would have been anathema for me to put this in a cup and Nuke it. But I suspect the flavor would not be diminished by doing so.<br /><br />Is this a real Espresso experience? The name says it all - "Italian espresso STYLE Coffee drink". Although it stands out over and above your regular strong coffee, I would say it is a mild but memorable brew, compared to the espresso that your local Barista brews for you -- and compared to mild-mannered Nonna Lucia's "stand-your-hair-on-end" potent brew.<br /><br />The sweetness factor is not cloying. The coffee (made with the better Arabica Beans)is too rich to be chugged. It IS meant to be savored.<br /><br />I'm happy with Illy issimos' Caffe -- take it with you to work - on a car ride -- it would also be a nice addition to any backpack or travel-case, as the can is a nice compact size.  Add it to your favorite cofee liquer-based drink(s), or even smoothies.  Price is a consideration -- my budget will not allow this on a regular basis, but as a treat, as I do consider it a quality product.<br /><br />Bravo Illy -- Viva Italia.

review/summary: Stirred, not shaken
review/text: Seriously, there's a 'do not shake' warning on the can and it's there for good reason - the contents are under pressure so... you shake it at your own risk.<br /><br />As a coffee drinker, I can't say that I'm impressed by this canned Espresso to the point that I'd stop making my own but I suppose that's not the point of the 'illy'. No canned coffee can challenge the flavor and aroma of a freshly brewed cup but when that is not possible, here comes the 'illy' and... it's passable.<br /><br />If comparing canned coffees to canned coffees, the 'illy' espresso is okay as in 'decent' and probably preferable to most other canned brands but to call it 'espresso' is a bit of a stretch. It's got 'sugar' for starters, 50 calories worth of it and I don't know too many espresso drinkers that would tolerate sugar in their espresso drink. And it's not espresso-strong. It's a little stronger than the normally bland canned coffee but maybe only half-way between regular coffee and espresso. As for the taste, this is supposed to be made of 'Arabica' and maybe it is but it tastes more like instant coffee to me. Maybe Arabica-based, cold instant coffee.<br /><br />So... if stranded on an island or anywhere a decent cup of real coffee is not an option or you aren't in the mood or don't have the time to make your own, the 'illy espresso' is an option and at least as good, possibly better than alternative canned or bottled coffees. In other words, "It's Okay" (3 stars) if used as directed and your expectations are reasonably low.<br /><br />________________________________<br /><br />Note: Should this be chilled before use? Ice espresso is an abomination but, again, just because it says 'espresso' on the can it doesn't necessarily make it so.

Also there is 50 calories in the can, not 45 (small difference), but fot many that count calories might matter.<br /><br />Anyway I wouldn't recommend Issimo espresso, unless you love very very bitter coffee.

review/text: Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel. It's not as good as freshly made espresso but it's not bad at all. I do prefer the illy issimo cappucino as a treat.
