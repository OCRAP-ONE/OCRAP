review/summary: The Best
review/text: We like this cereal so much that we have subscribed.  Now we not only enjoy this cereal but we save money.  By subscribing to a monthly delivery (I sound like a commercial, don't I) we save 70 cents a box from what it cost at our local grocer and then that's only when we can find it on his shelf which isn't often enough.  So it comes to our door for less.  It tastes so good and is truly healthful.

review/summary: Better than Kellogg's Bran Buds
review/text: This bran cereal is very similar to Kellogg's Bran Buds in texture, but it tastes a little better.  Also on the plus side the Nature's Path variety does not use high fructose corn syrup (unlike Kellogg's).  This makes the Nature's Path slightly more expensive, but it is worth it.  There does not seem to be much quantity in each individual box, but it is very filling so one does not feel like eating as much as other sugary cereals.

review/summary: Smart Bran Cereal
review/text: This cereal is a healthy source of fiber.  I have it for breakfast most days and use it as a base cereal, adding extra oat bran (for cholesterol control), fruit and milk or soy milk for a complete breakfast.  I highly recommend it and the price on Amazon is significantly less than the price on the store shelves -- in the stores that carry this cereal.

review/summary: An easy way to get more fiber!
review/text: I bought this cereal after it was mentioned in a Men's Health article and I am so glad I did!<br />The taste is surprisingly good. It's kinda like Cheerios, but a little bit more grainy. It has a subtle sweetness to it as well. The cereal itself is basically tiny pellets. I jokingly call it hamster food hehe. I usually mix a serving in with my yogurt or mix it with another cereal for that fiber boost. All in all though I am very satisfied with this product and I'm basically going through a box every week!

review/summary: Doesn't taste very good
review/text: This cereal is very healthy (lots of fiber) but it sure doesn't taste very good! I don't understand the people who rave about the taste, maybe they've never tried a great tasting cereal before? Pretty much any cereal out there tastes better. Don't get me wrong, this is probably one of the healthiest cereal out there and one of the few that has Psyllium in it, but it sure doesn't taste very good. The cereal is all uniform "pellets", not crunchy at all.<br /><br />If you want to try good tasting cereal then give Bob's Red Mill's Honey Oatmeal cereal a try. That tastes 10 times better and is probably as healty as this one.<br /><br />If you're trying to solve digestive problems (that's probably why you consider a cereal with Psyllium in the first place), then try some "Organic Smooth Move" tea with Senna leafs. That helps with constipation issues.<br /><br />Bottom line, this cereal gets 10/10 for health, but 3/10 for taste. Before you buy the 6-pack based on all the raving reviews, make sure you buy one package first, to see if you like the taste. I pretty much wasted $24. I will go back to Bob's Red Mill's cereal for sure.

review/summary: Crunchy surprise
review/text: I am not a big fan of bran cereals. Most of them are heavy and get soggy fast in milk. Smart Bran was a pleasant surprise. I love the light texture that is in between bran buds and rice crispies. They are impervious to milk and remain appealing to eat to the last spoonful. The taste is also amazing. There isn't that gritty feeling that most bran cereals leave behind.<br /><br />One criticism is that the sweetness, while good, is a bit much for such a light cereal but they taste wonderful anyway. Those of us changing our diets become less interested in sugary foods. Nature's Path could do us a favor and cut down on the sweet. People can always add a spoonful if that is their taste. There is no way to take it out.<br /><br />On the "sticks with you until the next meal" topic, this cereal ROCKS in that department. You easily get 4 hours of full off of a serving with milk. The calorie count is within my goal of 400 calories a meal or less.<br /><br />I will be interested in trying the other versions of Nature's Path cereals if I ever get tired of Smart Bran.

review/summary: exactly what I was hoping it would be at a great price
review/text: I had been eating Kelloggs Bran Buds which were fine except they contained a few unfavorable ingredients (HFCS being one of them!).  I went looking for the organic approach in a similar product and found Smart Bran by Nature's Path.  I enjoy it equally well and feel that I am getting a superior product because of the organic and wholesome ingredients.  I am grateful it is being offered undert the S&S program so it is at a very favorable price compared to the per box price in a grocery store (plus it's difficult to even FIND this product at a lot of stores!).  This cereal fills me ups and seems to keep my digestion process funtioning well.  I like it with greek yogurt and fresh fruit.  The serving size is really more than adequate (don't fill up your cereal bowl!).  A good choice if you are looking for a bran cereal.

review/text: A lot of fiber, pretty tasteless, so I add a lot of fruit to it...and often mix in another cereal.  I like to look forward to my breakfast, and with this I don't unless I do the above.  But, I bought it for the fiber, and for the lack of HFCS, which is what I got.  The pack of six will last a long time, and doubt that I will re-order now that the health food store is starting to carry it, and I can get it one box at a time when I need it.

review/summary: Great product, but quite expensive
review/text: Those of us looking for the best dietary fiber supply and all the health benefits that flow from it will inevitably come across this great cereal. I wish the oat and psyllium were in higher proportions to the wheat, but I know of no other cereals that do any better in this respect. I am grateful to Nature's Path for improving their packaging, which makes breakfast less frustrating than it used to be. The taste is fine, but blueberries make a great complement in summer and bananas are around all year to improve the taste. I eat this cereal regularly, and I hope that it stays in production a long time. My only real reluctance to giving five stars is that this cereal costs over $8 a pound (before shipping!), and there's a lot of other good food around for $8+ a pound.

review/summary: Good alternative to Fiber One
review/text: I recently have eliminated Splenda from my diet because I am concerned about its effects.  Fiber One is sweetened with Splenda, unfortunately, as are so many other products these days.  But I was concerned about how to replace its high fiber content, which really is important to me.  So I decided to try this product.  It is terrific!  A lighter texture than Fiber One, almost identical fiber content.  It has 30 calories more per serving, but you get a bigger serving (2/3 cup versus 1/2 cup) and I will take the extra calories for a natural sweetness rather than the Splenda.  Also, this is a great product to get on Subscribe & Save!

Not too sweet, but just sweet enough with that light touch of saltiness that makes this snack really stand out as something different.  There is something about the flavor of Bugles corn chips that really stands out as a superior snacking chip.  Just a few chips leaves you feeling satisfied, although I will admit to scarfing down a bag of these all by myself while watching a movie.  Because these are more than likely a test item by the makers of Bugles, I would not wait around to buy a case and stock up for winter.  If you like these, you definitely will want to try their Chocolate & Peanut Butter Bugles!  Just thinking about them is enough to make me take a ten minute break from the computer... starting right now!

review/text: Bugles are a great snack that have been around a long time. I can remember eating them as a kid as far back as the 1970s, and I still occasionally eat them today. They have a distinctive corny taste which, as far as I know, is unlike anything else currently on the market. On the basis of taste alone, this product would rate 5 stars, however, I am only giving 4 stars out of 5 because of the high staurated fat content, something that is easily evident from a glance at the nutrition label. Bugles have much higher saturated fat content than many other snacks - a result, I suppose, of coconut oil (rather than vegetable or corn oil) being a main ingredient. I wonder, why can't they make Bugles lower in saturated fat and overall fat content, and would it really taste any different?

review/summary: taste like a reg bagel
review/text: This bagel is great, taste like a regular bagel and has the same consistency has a reg bagel, i couldn't believe it. i was so used to the nasty after taste like bagels with that wacky texture, but not these bagels. i live in NYC and so bagels are very important but for those of us living low carb/sugar, these are a great susbstitute, and they have lot's of fiber to boot.

review/summary: Great low-carb bagels
review/text: I've tried several other brands of low-carb breads and they were flavorless with an odd texture.  Carb Krunchers breads  are great - they freeze well and hold up well in the freezer (don't become soggy when they thaw).  They toast very well.  You could serve these to unsuspecting people and they wouldn't know the difference.  Not the BEST bagel I've ever had, but a really GOOD low-carb bagel.

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: This is the first low carb bagel that I have tried.  It was quite good toasted.  The texture was slightly different from regular bagels, but not in a bad way.  It seemed a little spongier than a normal bagel, and might not be as good if not toasted.  I recommend these bagels.  The price seems high, unless you consider how much you would pay for one bagel in a bagel shop - and then it's not that much more.  Shipping is the big problem.  You should order more than one package or order other items so that the cost per item is less.  I ordered mine from Linda's Diet Delites.

Get the cheap red hot dogs for the best results. And make sure you have plenty of mustard.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: We've been drinking this coffee for several months and love the flavor and the fact that it's organic. Buying 3 bags at a time is no problem as we throw the extras in the freezer till it's time to open a fresh bag. We purchased some other whole bean organic coffees elsewhere on the Internet at much higher prices and the shipping was quite expensive. Amazon sells this at a great price and it qualifies for free shipping making it cheaper than buying the typical run of the mill coffee from the grocery store. Try it and see for yourself.

review/summary: Doesn't work well with my Capresso
review/text: I wasn't sure how to rate this product, because the taste of the coffee was very good, but.....I have a Capresso coffee maker which I love and it has problems with the beans.  The beans are too oily for my machine and it has trouble grinding them.  I have used this machine for several years, and this is the only coffee that it had a problem with and I have used it with other flavored coffees.  Again, I probably would have given it a higher rating if not for this factor which is highly personal to my situation.

review/text: I suggest ordering the pack with the small glass teapot with one each of 9 different flowering teas first.  Two disk and two balls are packed in each small box.  The ball ones open up in a cuter way.  They should steep longer to get the best flavor out of them but by that time, the tea will have cooled  considerably.  Of the four types, I only liked the taste of the ball with the red blossom.  None of them bloomed as prettily as other brands I have tried.

review/text: Who knew that my 1 year old would love broccoli this much???<br />I'm thrilled that he likes this puree of broccoli, zucchini, peas, and couscous. It's a chunkier style than many other purees, so it's definitely something to try once your baby does well with the stage 2 foods. It doesn't have the big chunks like the chicken & stars meal or the carrot & corn one, but it's got a "bumpy" texture because of the broccoli and the couscous, so your baby needs to be OK with that thicker texture.<br />This particular blend is difficult to find, so we buy in bulk whenever it's available.

review/text: My son is unique in that he has an allergy to carrots.  It is extremely difficult to find dinner blends that don't contain them!  I looked over the Earth's Best website to find ingredients and picked this product because carrots were lower down on the list of ingredients.  (Some blended in is okay.)  This still had small carrot chunks throughout!  Pulling them out makes this product much less than 6 oz.  My son still likes this product, even if it doesn't agree with him, and I stand by the quality of Earth's Best.  But is it too much to ask for a product without carrots????

review/text: My baby girl choked on this!!  She had been eating food for sometime and even had food "from the table".  I packed this because we were going to a local festival and was worried there wouldn't be much there she would be able to eat.  She appeared to be chewing the spaghetti and seemed just fine.  All of a sudden she began choking and I had to clear her throat.  The spaghetti had "gummed up" and formed a ball in the back of her throat.  The experience was absolutely horrible.  Please keep a close eye on your little one if you choose to feed this and be sure to feed extra slow!

My son is not specifically allergic but I don't like to give it to him as he spits up more. So, I'll likely not be getting it again. Also, it's extremely bland and not as good as the fresh stuff I make. But in a bind, it's a good meal I guess.

It's a nice way to help get them more fiber and because the product is organic, I know there are no chemicals inside.  It's good for their diet and they love it as treat and it's healthy for them.  Way better than the processed treats you can by at the store.

I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: Tastes ok, good for ya!
review/text: This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.

review/summary: Great Tea @ Reasonable Price
review/text: I have a hard time finding nettle leaf tea at regular grocery stores, so I purchased mine from Amazon.  I generally enjoy English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Japanese green, and Oolong teas; this is a great addition to my current mix.  The tea bags make it easy to enjoy at work.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/text: i really have to say I love this chamomile tea. Especially when I have a cough and/or cold I brew some and pour it in a bowl to inhale the chamomile vapors. It works just great. Of course I also love to drink it when I'm sick. I like the chamomile taste and that there are not other ingredients in it but the chamomile.

review/text: I ordered this for my boyfriend because he has trouble sleeping sometimes. He loves it! It makes him a little bit loopy before he goes to sleep but he likes the feeling. The only thing I don't like is that on the shelf it smells like vomit. It grosses me out. It doesn't smell like that when it's brewed.

review/text: I know nettle tea has a pretty distinct taste, but this particular brand was just unbearable. The smell reminded me of fish food pellets, and it had a fishy taste, too. I bought a pound of loose nettles from somewhere else for a lot cheaper, and the taste is so much better.

review/text: I bought this to help me fall asleep and it works although it tastes and smell really bad. Make sure to put this in some sort of a glass jar to prevent your kitchen from stinking. I found that if i added cream to this tea it would help the taste but its still pretty bad.

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

review/text: This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried. The bags have no string and tag. The bags are the limpest and often fall apart while squeezing. The only brand of tea I have ever had do this. I drink 4 to six cups of tea a day of various types and this is a very lame tea.

review/text: This tea has a strong pungent smell that my husband hates (he says stinky socks) but call me weird I really like it.  I like parmasean cheese too though and that stinks.  Anyhow, I find both the aroma very relaxing and find that after a cup I am tired and ready to go to bed.  I am not even sure if it is the aroma or the actual tea that is knocking me out but for some reason it is so right for this body.

review/text: Thought this tea would have been more bitter, but it is surprisingly pleasant to drink without sweeteners!  Less bitter than a black or earl grey tea.  The pack of 3 is a wonderful deal as well.  Had to get creative with storing so much tea in my cupboard, but for the amount you get, the price cannot be beat. Highly recomended!
