review/text: Having a good friend with Celiac Disease, I like to like to find recipes and mixes that are gluten free. This mix makes a very good bread, so good you would never know that it's gluten free! It works well in my bread machine, and it tastes great. I highly recommend it!<br /><br />(Review of The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix)

review/summary: Best Mix I ever tried (and I tried my share)
review/text: Wow, who would have thought that a gluten free dough could actually rise and spill over the bread-machine baking pan?  Had a little mess to clean up but did not mind at all.  I am so use to having to add stuff to the mix to make it more pleasing that I guess I got a little carried away on the extras.  I don't know what the secret is but this bread not only tastes great but it will rise resulting in a large moist and delish slice.  I did not detect the tell tale beany aftertaste that accompanies so many of the others and was delighted with the texture and flavor.  Now keep in mind that even this great mix will not result in a French Twist, however, for those of us that that have experimented, eaten bricks, made more bread crumbs than we can ever consume due to mishaps - this is the mix to go with!  A bargain considering the results!  I like the brand that has a "Bob" and "wonderful" in the title as well and will most likely switch things up to keep it interesting; this mix however has a greater potential for versatility. I am going to try to turn it into a sweet loaf next time...maybe add a couple of raisins and nuts?<br />Great product - do enjoy!

review/summary: This is THE BEST GF bread!
review/text: We make this bread in our bread machine on the GF setting and it is DELICIOUS!  The whole loaf is gone within a day or two.  Last weekend I made it for my kids who both have celiac disease, but the gluten eaters we invited over for breakfast ate the entire loaf!  That's saying a lot since most GF bread is terrible.  This is so easy and delicious that I won't be wasting any more time or money trying to make GF bread from scratch anymore.  Yay to PB&J sandwiches again!

review/summary: I can't believe it's Gluten Free!!!
review/text: We recently have gone gluten free to try and manage my lymphedema.  One of the major problems was everything, especially bread was disgusting.  Most products taste like a mix of wood glue and wood shavings, with some dirt thrown in.  One of our major desires is bread that is soft, tastes good, and is not as heavy as an anchor....not brittle & dry & disgusting.<br /><br />THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!  It is easy to make, tastes amazingly good, is light & has a wonderful consistency and is soft.  You can spread tuna fish salad on this bread without the bread crumbling into sawdust.  It's good for peanut butter as well.<br /><br />Following the instructions on the box you get an awesome product.I have tweaked the directions a bit to suit our tastes more.<br /><br />I add an extra package of yeast, extra 1 TBSP sugar, use 1 whole egg & 2 egg-whites, and use whole milk.

I prefer the sandwich mix to to the french bread mix. This is an indulgence for those of us who must live with out gluten in our diet...but I wouldn't pay this price for it.

review/summary: Very good bread
review/text: Making this bread in a conventional oven is very easy in a 9 by 12 non stick pan.  I just followed the directions.  I used milk in my bread for the liquid.  I put it in the microwave for about 2.5 minutes to make it a little more than lukewarm so that when I melted butter into the milk it was the right temp.  You will need a heavy stand mixer, like a Kitchen Aid.  Don't try mixing it with hand beaters.  The dough is thick and sticky, and it held its shape somewhat, so I am going to use a spatula greased with oil to shape the loaf a bit.  The texture of the bread was a bit like pound cake, but it was delicious.  I stored mine in the fridge, tightly wrapped with two layers of saran wrap.  It kept just fine, but it was gone in three days.  I am the one that needed it to be gluten free.  It was nice to finally have a sandwich.  My eight year old son loved it as well.  He requested several slices of buttered bread.  At the end of the week when it got dry, it crumbled nicely into a meatloaf.  My oven made the crust dark, so watch it if you put it in the oven.  Next time I will put foil on it.

review/text: This is the best mix I have ever tried.  The bread is far better than store bought.  And there is nothing like warm butter bread.  Find a good used bread maker, clean it up really good and you can easily make your own gluten free bread.  You don't need one of those expensive specialty ones.  Just use white bread with medium crust setting for gluten free bread.

review/text: I really love this bread. It makes it so easy to make homemade bread with this mix in my breadmaker. I almost always add raisons or other chopped dried fruit or chopped vegetables to this when I make it. I love it. It tastes great and has always come out great. I continue to orer this from time to time. I really appreciate that I am able to order these mixes from Amazon. My local grocery store has some of these gluten free products, but individually and the selection varies. It is very convenient to be able to get a box of these from Amazon. One time I ordered this bread mix, and received the gluten-free brownie mix instead. I contacted Amazon and they sent out the bread mix right away and told me to keep the brownie mix. I've never been a big brownie person, but decided to try them one day. They are really easy to make and taste really good. I glad there was a mix-up that time, because I never would have tried the brownies otherwise!

review/text: This matcha is pretty close to capturing the flavour of mangos accurately.  Red Leaf as always has produced a quality product at a reasonable price.  In the mango matcha there is the deliciousness of juicy ripe mangos with the balance of mangos that are just about ripe.  I particularly like this matcha in my morning smoothie!

review/summary: A Good Fruity Matcha
review/text: I love mangoes and I love matcha, so this is the perfect combo for me! However, this isn't your plain old mango tea taste. The mango aspect is quite interesting--it's not juicy mango flesh, but more like... you know, when you're cutting a mango and there's some flesh left after you peel it so you scrape your teeth on the rind to get it all? You get mango flesh, but also some rind-y goodness as well that adds a woodsy, almost tangy taste. Well, that's what the mango is like here! Rind-y. It's kind of nice, quite different from other mango teas I've tried.<br /><br />There's also a hint of citrus, a lemon-y quality. It goes well with the matcha, whose grassiness really adds to the mango/lemon tastes. Refreshing, great iced!

review/summary: Great for anyone who loves matcha and fresh mangoes!
review/text: The smell of this tea is wonderful. It smells like fresh mango juice. I would describe it as a very clean and refreshing smell, which is how I feel about most matchas. I will also say that I had no issues with clumps. I have been very careful to check the temperature of my water before adding it to the tea, and so far have not had any bitter disasters. The mango matcha has a grassy sweetness that definitely keeps the mango taste. The actual flavour isn't as strong as the smell, but I think that it would be overpowering if it was. I love this both hot and iced, which a slight edge going to the iced version. I haven't tried it yet in a smoothie, but I am thinking it would be fantastic. I did try adding a bit to some yogurt, and it was almost perfect - this was the only time I had clumps, but I also wasn't very patient trying to mix it all together. I would definitely purchase this again, and can't wait to try more from Red Leaf Teas.

review/summary: Leggo my Mango!
review/text: After seeing some of the glowing reviews for this matcha, I had to try it. Trying Mango Diablo from DavidsTea recently has brought back to mind my love of mangos and real mango flavor. I had forgotten it in the face of so much fake-tasting mango flavored tea and candy out there. But I used to beg my mom to let me buy a mango. There are few things better than slicing into a perfectly ripe mango. Makes a royal mess to eat it (at least, the way I did it), but it was so, so worth it. Still, I hate messy food, so if I can find that mango flavor without the mess, I am all for it! It was a bit worried about this tea after the strange bitterness of the Peach and Lemon flavors, but what's life without a few risks? Mango makes me think of summer and tropical smoothies and everything delicious in life.<br /><br />So when I opened it, it had that same smell the Peach and Lemon flavors had, a faint hint of bitterness, and I got worried. Still, never let it be said that I'm afraid to try new things. I made a cup of this to take to work with me, and thank goodness I did, it was a hellish day and I desperately needed the energy from it. But...it wasn't that great. It tasted like decent mango flavor with a back hint of chemicals. I don't know what it is, but I think I just need to stay away from the citrus group of flavored matchas. The Peach redeemed itself when iced, so maybe the mango will do the same. I'm hoping it does. My feelings may also be skewed a bit, I've been spoiled by the delicious goodness of the Mango Diablo from Davids, so my opinions on the mango flavor might have been different if I hadn't been drinking tons of the Mango Diablo lately. That's my new standard for mango flavor and this just doesn't match up to it.<br /><br />Still, it will be no great hardship to finish this off, especially in smoothies over the coming summer months. It's not horrible, it's just not for me. But maybe a lower temperature will help or finding another way to drink it. Or maybe one of my friends will try it and like it and then it will have a good home!

review/summary: Basmati rice is best
review/text: We love basmati rice, and prefer it to regular long grain rice because of its texture and delicious aroma. We used to purchase it at Indian grocery stores, but once we moved outside of the immediate Atlanta area, it was hard to find it at a price we could accept.<br /><br />I did my research, and located it (this time) on Amazon at $1.79 a pound, including shipping. This was the best price, so I took it. A 25 lb bag will last my family about a year.<br /><br />I search all over the net whenever it's time to purchase basmati rice, looking for the best total price per pound, including shipping. Sometimes it's Amazon, sometimes it's eBay, sometimes it's another source. But the rice itself is always fantastic, regardless of the source.<br /><br />The nice burlap bags are great too -- I use them to carry in corn from the garden, and cats love to play in them! Some people even use them to make purses. A 25 lb bag is about the size of one of those reusable bags you can get at Wal-Mart, and it has a zipper at the top. For ease of handling, we repackage into gallon size ZipLoc bags.

review/summary: These Ginger Chews Are Delicious!
review/text: A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market imports a lot of European-style candies and one of them is Chimes (the original) Ginger Chews. If you enjoy the taste of ginger, you'll probably love these. Trust me. They're a chewy piece of candy that is strongly ginger flavored and not particularly sweet, at least not overly sweet. Each piece comes in it's own individual wrap. It says to store them in a cool dry place, and that would be a good suggestion because they can melt and stick to the wrappers. I just bought a single 1.5-ounce pack, but I'll certainly be back for more. These things are delicious!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Consumers called it RC Cola for so long the company finally made it official. "ME and MY RC to taste mighty good to me" was a popular commerical in the 1970's. It is not available everywhere, so some people are lucky to find it this way on Amazon. A very popular cola in the south, I have heard southerners swear by drinking a glass with a few shelled peanuts in the soda, say it tastes great that way. I have also heard that the combination of a Moon-Pie and RC was big in the 1950's but sounds like too much suga for me. Either way the 1950's was their heyday and they spent tons on advertising especially with celebrity sponsors like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.<br /><br />Packaging: It is sold in plastic, glass and cans and like many sodas the glass bottle tastes better but good luck finding it. SMOOTHNESS: It is more smooth than Coca-Cola, but more uppity than Pepsi. CARBONATION: RC has average carbonation, the big two colas are a bit more fizzy. SWEETNESS: It is a little lighter in sweetness than the 2 big colas. COLA Flavor: You can taste the cola pretty well.<br /><br />In 1954, it was the first brand to be sold in an all aluminum can, the first to offer a low calorie diet cola, and a caffeine free soda. Four years later, they introduced the first 16-ounce bottle.<br />Dr. Pepper/7Up company owns this now, and they in turn were bought by Cadbury Schweppes a British company in 2000, who seems to be buying up all the soda companies in the country with the exception for the big 2. Check out their web site.<br />Update: As of June 2, 2007, Cadbury Scweppes is selling off their soda division. Let's hope someone keeps the regional sodas alive.

review/summary: No Finer Beverage!
review/text: Of all cola beverages, RC Cola is tops in taste.  Sadly, the Dr Pepper company, of which RC is a part, fails to recognize it's high qualities, and promotion of the product is not allowed (as it is with most DP company products, except DP.....when was the last time you saw a 7-UP ad?).  Nonetheless, RC is outstanding, far superior to Coke and Pepsi, and is deserving of your purchase.

review/summary: Cool Fun Salty
review/text: Product arrived as promised. Prompt professinal shipping.  Extra business cards and ads for the company in the box; nicely done and not too much.  The blocks are heavy.  Heavy. I cooked scallops on them. Made the mistake of adding salt to the marinade though (out of habit I guess)...do NOT add salt to anything you want to cook on the block.  The scallops were actually very good and cooked perfectly, but about 1/3 too salty.  Still very edible, but you needed a sip of a beverage afterward.<br />The salt blocks heat up slowly, but retain very even heat for a long time. I did notice they take a lot of heat to get them hot enough to sear something...our gas range on high did the trick.  Didn't try cooking on them in the oven.  I thinkmy next recipe will be thinly sliced ribeye.<br />Also, keep in m,ind that when you cook on the blocks, you end up "seasoning" the block a little.  Keep that in mind if you want to cook seafood, but also think you might like to try veggis or fruit...fishy apples are not good.

review/summary: Salt blocks are attractive and fun
review/text: Salt blocks were given as housewarming gifts and very appreciated; both recipients display them in their respective kitchens and they look great.  Other friends have been anxious to try them out.  We have cooked on them and found it to be fun experience and we are looking forward to trying them on the grill this summer.  Nice conversation piece and fun dinner party addition.<br /><br />Of the set of two salt blocks one arrived cracked.  Manufacturer quickly replaced product without any fuss.<br /><br />Would recommend both product and manufacturer esp. for "gourmet kitchen" gifts.

review/summary: Perfect for grilling, baking and freezing . . .
review/text: I first became familiar with Himalayan salt while traveling in the Frontier Province in Pakistan.  Widely used for centuries in some of the finest cooking in the world, it adds an incredible flavor to your grilling.<br /><br />It's hands down my favorite way of grilling fish.  I season liberally with lemon juice and add fresh herbs.  No salt is needed!  Place the block on the grill to heat, then add fish.  Careful removing the block from the grill as it holds the heat AND cold VERY well.<br /><br />It's also very useful to use in the oven to bake hearth bread on.<br /><br />One of my favorite uses, however, is to freeze it for a couple of hours in the freezer . . .then place custard on the block and lift with a spatula as it's cooling, for a sweet/salty dessert guests won't soon forget.

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: This was the first All-Juice kit that I purchased from this company.  The packaged arrived quickly, although the lid for the primary bucket had a lot of dirt on it, The instructions were quite clear and the Customer service line actually worked.  From start to bottling this kit took 7 weeks.  It is a 6 gallon kit with having to add water after the 3rd stage of adding the finning and stabalizing agents.  I personally elected to not add any water and go with 5 gallons instead for a fuller quality.  Had I had a filtration system of some sort, I might have been able to get an additional 1/2 gallon with little or no sediment.  At bottling, the product smelled like apples, with a little smokey smell to it.  I added enough sugar to bring it to a semi dry taste and it is now aging in bottles.  I was able to get 21 750ml bottles and 1 375ml bottle and one full glass at bottling.  So far I am very impressed.  This should keep for about two years since I added a pinch of Metabisulphite powder to the mix at the end.  I will add another review around 6 months to check its progress.  I would recommend this product to anyone.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I've been using this paste for a couple of years now for my homemade thai food. For some reason they stopped selling it in all the grocery stores and i couldn't find it anywhere except for this seller. My family loves it! Its got just the right amount of spicy - my husband lives on hot spicy sauces and he absolutely loves this. It comes in a convenient container and all you need is a couple of table spoons for a meal that will feed 4+ people. It last forever and is absolutely delicious. The only draw back was shipping too forever and it is kinda expensive. But since I am rating the item and not the seller I recommend it everyone who likes to cook and spicy Thai food!

review/text: The flavor of this tea is vanilla, fruit and citrus.  The effect is "enlightening."  If you like your tea with a subtle taste, and if you like lemon too, this is a tea for you.  The quality is tops.  Harney & Sons are very picky about their tea leaves, which come from the most exceptional gardens across Asia and India.  This tea works with one teaspoon per cup.  Steep for 5 minutes.  The tin recommends pouring over the leaves and straining the tea.  It also tastes great to use a filter basket.  Rating of the tea is low briskness, low-medium body, and high aroma.

I shared them with my senior citizen friends. As we ate these strange looking candy bars we laughed until we had tears rolling down our cheeks. In spite of having been melted and reshaped, they were still very good and not one was wasted. I definitely want to recommend these candy bars to others. Not only were they very good, but also a real conversation piece and a provider of much mirth. So if you are looking for a really good candy bar as well as a conversation piece, by all means order Peanut Butter Mountain Bars in the summer months. Happy candy bar eating to one and all.

Regarding the prior review "difficult to swallow"? You probably should have mixed it with liquid. I'm also very sceptical whenever I see the EXACT same review for all three flavors. Really? You bought all three flavors at the same time without first trying one of them? I highly doubt it. Anyway, to those interested in trying this product, I've had all three flavors and the Apple-Cinnamon Oatmeal is outstanding.

Well, this is good stuff.  When this is gone I will purchase more of this same brand.  One hint, I live in a very humid area, Brazil.  I have thrown out more spices than most folks buy in a lifetime.  I now put all of my spices in 1/2 pint Ball or Kerr caning jars and vacuum pack them with a Food Saver.  Saffron normally becomes very soft here quickly but the Food Saver keeps it and all of my spices fresh.

review/summary: Perfect Blend of Sweet and Sour
review/text: These Gummi Fruits are delicious and addictive. The sweet/sour is in balance and the candy is not rubbery like some gummi candy is. The texture is softer then the Haribo Gummi Bears and easier to chew without being soft. Perfect for a light little candy break, but hard to stop once the snacking starts. I bought the pack of 12 thinking they would last me quite a while, but I have decided to put packages in all the kids and grandkids Christmas stockings, or I will end up eating them all myself in very short order. (My will-power is quite lacking.) The flavors are quite distinct even after being packaged together in the same package, even though I think the passion fruit flavor tastes more like mango than passion fruit, and the lime tastes more like apple than lime. But, that being said, they are delicious and I can't stay out of them.

review/summary: Decent Candies
review/text: Combination of their rubbery and less rubbery gummies.  Each one is coated by sugar shaped granules but is not as sweet and not as messy that it scatters everywhere.  A single piece is a good bite size; certainly much bigger than their gummy bears.<br /><br />Nice combination of flavors.  I don't think they taste quite extraordinary; but nevertheless decent candies coming from the world's leading maker of gummi bears.

These differ from any other fruit splices by not only having a flavored coating, but the inside gelly is also flavored. I always thought that this should be a rule for candy makers. This stuff is awesome and I eat about a bag of this a day :)

review/summary: Not really gummy or fruity
review/text: These are coated in sugar which make them less gummy and kind of dry. They are very firm and chewy more than gummy. They have a lot of citric acid which makes them tart but there is no discernible fruit flavor in any of them. If you ate each kind with your eyes closed, you would not be able to tell one "fruit" from the other. Very very disappointed. Will be giving 11 bags away and not ordering any Haribo again.

review/summary: VERY high quality - The best dabba I've seen to date
review/text: For anyone looking for a Masala Dabba to hold their spices, look no further than this Ajika spice box. Although many designs exist for these products, this is the ideal design to properly store your spices. The metal is of a thick gauge, and it has an excellent polish to it. The dual-lid system helps to keep spices fresh for longer, and yet is very easy to remove without any hassle. The included spice spoon fits in the space between the lid and the cover when not in use, so you will never have to worry about losing it.<br /><br />Even the red velvet bag the dabba came in was of impressive quality; my wife loved it enough to keep for storage of other items in the kitchen. This product sits on our counter within easy reach at all times. Apart from the usefulness of having it around, it is also a great conversation starter; almost every guest who sees it is fascinated and ends up ordering one for themselves.<br /><br />If you are reading this review, you probably already know what a spice dabba is, and are just wondering if the Ajika product is worth buying. This gets an easy five stars from me, and I intend to purchase more as gifts in the future. It may cost more than some competing products from other brands, but it is money well spent, as I have no doubt that this item will be around long enough to pass off to my children some day.

Crazy, but I would NOT buy any food item made in China to eat myself, so I guess it's not all that crazy.<br /><br />Still, these were one of his VERY favorites (must be the liver), so I got him some DINGO peanut butter wrapped rawhide (more expensive, coated only on one side - but his absolute favorite flavor of all time), and he is satisfied.  Dingo's are made in US, so I'm happier too.<br /><br />Wish these were made stateside - he loved them.

review/text: The product in and of itself is great.  The chicken bouillon has great flavor and works well in recipes.  But, I called the manufacturer of this product today (Nestle USA) and they told me that they do not have halal certification for this product here in the United States.  Therefore, it is not halal.  The man told me that they do sell a milk product called Milo, which can be found here in the US as halal.  But, this product is not halal.  I just wanted to write this review because the message behind it is so important for my Muslim brothers and sisters out there.

review/summary: Love this coffee, and ordering it on Amazon is a blast!
review/text: I originally left this review on the 3-pack of the larger tubs, but I didn't order since it was so pricey here on Amazon. Well, I did a price comparison with this pack, and this turned out to be a much better deal per ounce, so I went ahead and ordered it. I love having it delivered straight to the house!<br /><br />I have to say, Folgers Simply Smooth has been the ideal coffee for me. For starters, it does seem to be far easier on my stomach; many other coffees leave my stomach growling/turning, and other undesireable effects. For many, its not the caffeine that causes upset stomachs, but rather just many of the other irritants associated with coffee. For those that don't have those issues, kudos, you can probably buy similar coffee a lot cheaper.<br /><br />As for the taste, I personally think its great. Its not "bold", but just right. It doesn't have high hints of bitterness, which I personally associate with bad coffee, others may think is good. I'd say if you're looking for a taste comparison, its close to McDonalds. Then again, I prefer my coffee on the sweet side, and this I don't have to drown out with creamer, but its also not as watery tasting as many of the "mild" brands. Again, just right for my tastes. I personally recommend combining it with International Delight's Carmel Macchiato, it really tastes like a coffee house drink, with a fraction of the calories and cost.<br /><br />Now the one downside is the cost/availability. Often, this is double the cost of the regular brew. They also tend to only stock the smaller bins in many retail stores. So, its up to you if its worth the cost. Here on Amazon I think the six pack is a pretty good deal at the moment, better than what I would pay in stores.<br /><br />So, if you're like me, and have any sort of stomach issues associated with coffee, but love coffee, this is probably the product for you. If you're merely looking for a mild coffee, this one has a great taste, better than most mild blends, but the cost probably isn't justified. Keep in mind, this is not decaffinated, they sell a version of simply smooth that is, but I personally like the caffeine to get me going, which is not what upsets my stomach.

review/summary: Best coffee for sensitive stomachs
review/text: I have a very sensitive stomach and I'm not sure why. Coffee can sometimes cause great discomfort. When I saw this coffee, I was so excited to try it but skeptical of the claims that it wouldn't irritate my stomach. I have used this coffee a countless number of times over the past 6 or 7 years with no problems whatsoever. Obviously, you can adjust the strength of the flavor by adding more or less depending on your preference. I highly recommend this coffee to anyone, even if you don't have stomach issues. It has such a smooth taste and is a great way to get your coffee quota.

Mind you, that this review is from experiences when this product first hit the shelves, so it's been a few years, but there werent many reviews here, so I thought I'd toss my hat into the ring.<br /><br />I'm very experienced with coffee, I worked my way through high school & part of University in a small coffee house as a barista- back before we called ourselves baristas and before THAT Coffee Co. ("in my opinion"- so I dont get sued like others that have said this) had started tainting the world with burnt coffee so they could sell expensive coffee milkshakes.  Sure we sold tons of espresso & cappucino, but we also sold tons of fresh roasted, ground, and brews o' the day from all around the world- black or with a dollopofmil. It was awesome, I was like a kid in a cand- no, like a kid in a coffee store- which I was! So the moral is that I've got extensive coffee house experience, and my job was producing this Nectar of the Gods in whatever form someone wanted it.<br />  But... I'm also not such a coffee snob to ignore both history, blind taste tests, and the average consumer. I've seen multiple taste tests that puts those massive tin containers of grocery store ground coffee up against coffeehouse/boutique coffee- and seen the grocery store stuff take the prize.  One of my employers is an 85yr old New York Jew that (in what would make the coffee-elitists have a conniption fit) makes an incredible cup o' joe with a an old percolator (against all of the laws of coffee physics) he inherited from a small NY diner... I'm also an accomplished scientist, with one of my specialties being h2o chemistry, which gives me insight into the various methods of brewing, etc.<br /><br />Lets call all the verbose drivel above my Coffee CV. It's meant to show that although I've got a good deal of experience with what one would consider "fine coffee" from the coffee house, I also have a tremendous amount of appreciation for ALL of the wide world of coffee- From an awesome bright estate grown Costa Rican brewed in a quality drip, to a syrupy Yirgacheffe in a press-pot, to Yub@n in a percolator, or M@xwell House 4-cup filter pack in made in the complementary 4-cup coffeemaker in a cheap motels "dressing area"- I can find something in almost all of them that I like, and enjoy them all.<br /><br />Not so with this Simply Smooth product. It was bitter, remarkably bitter. I probably could have cut it with copious amnts of cream(er) & sugar, but I unless I'm drinking a cappucino, I only like a touch ofcream, sometimes a packet of sugar- as an accent to the coffee, not to drown out the bitter notes.  I brewed a few batches, cleaned the coffee maker, tried a french press. Nothing worked.  Just couldnt find anything I liked here.<br /><br />Very disappointing, I had been anxiously awaiting the product, and got stuck with a BIG tub that I hate to see going to waste.  and I'll admit this experience has kept me from experimenting with any of the other (and newer) Low Acid coffee's.<br /><br />I have, however, found myself enjoying homebrew coldbew on occasion- which reads 60-80% lower in acid (pH wise, not flavor profile).<br />I imagine combining some of the low-acid coffees with the coldbrew method might yield some even more desirable product- or it might just yield a very flat uninteresting coffee.<br /><br />Again- maybe I got a "bad" can.  It was during the first week that the product was on the shelf, and I live in a popular test market city, so my tub may have been one of the first off the factory floor, and could have been defective.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.
