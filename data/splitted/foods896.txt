review/summary: Candy that tastes great-and made with Splenda
review/text: I've tried all the other sugar free candies sold at the local stores.  All of those other brands made with sorbitol or maltitol will rip apart your insides.  Then I found Go Lightly.  I immediately hit up Amazon and here they are-shipped right to my house.  What can be better than that.<br /><br />Go Lightly candies use Splenda and this makes all the difference in the world.  I can eat a handful of caramels with no upset.  I am so glad I found this brand.<br /><br />Taste:  they taste just great.  I gave some to friends who do not eat sugar free candy and they like them.  I can't even tell the difference, I think they taste great.

review/summary: One of the Best Sugar Free Hard Candies
review/text: Since I cut back on sugar, I stopped buying sugar-filled hard candies. Brach's Butterscotch was one of my favorites. To me, Brach's is one of the best brands of hard candy and candy corn out there that I use its products as a yard stick. None of the local stores carry the sugar free Brach's Butterscotch. So I took a risk in ordering a box of 12 because I couldn't find any online store that sold it in individual packs without ridiculous shipping fees. \<br /><br />The first time I had one of these, I wasn't sure I liked them. I figured my tastebuds remembered the originals and needed a little time to adjust. Over time, I grew to love these and don't miss the originals.<br /><br />A word of warning: These have sugar alcohol in them, so they can irritate the stomach or cause gas pains. If Brach's tries to make them a different way without the sugar alcohol, it probably won't taste as good. The advantage of this, however, is that it helps you from eating too many knowing this could happen. I never eat more than four pieces a day (three pieces makes a serving for 35 calories!).<br /><br />Each candy is the same size as the originals -- about the size of a quarter on the outside and a thickness of about a stack of 5 quarters. They taste like a mix of buttery salty flavors.

review/text: You can eat it but I wouldn't call it cheddar explosion. Far from it, more like a fizzle. Bigger shapes? Yeah right, if this was bigger I'd hate to see the original versions. Yeah you can use more milk and less butter but it still tastes like buttery slightly cheesy slippery cardboard. If you need something in your stomach and don't really care about taste, quality, actual cheesie-ness and care more about cost, convienance and packaging this is for you. The box says it feeds mulitple people (don't remember how many servings total) but when I made it it barely came out more than 2 rather scrawny looking bits. If you plan on having three sides with your entree then have fun. Our family was not impressed. Plus the original chessiest tastes better than this crap. Will not be buying again and the food pantry will get the rest.

review/text: I was initially excited to see this product in my local grocery store. I love the original Macaroni and Cheese recipe.<br /><br />But after inspecting what this product is made of, I realized that also buying a 'store brand' and just adding more milk to that product is what produces the same increased cheese taste. And I can save money in today's ever-tight economy. This is very important when every penny counts.<br /><br />Given a choice, I'd rather save money for a product itself. I don't want to pay money for the packaging.

review/text: I bought the vanilla, orange, mango, lemon and peach flavors of these.  They are OKAY in hot foods - I used them in herbal teas and to punch up my orange chicken.  However, these were only good in hot foods and in very small quantities.  They were extremely bitter and were completely useless in cold foods because even a couple drops made the item so bitter the food was inedible.  Even in hot foods the bitterness came out after a couple drops.  Save your money and use a better brand like truvia and just flavor your food with pure extracts from the baking aisle.  No bitterness and you get to control the level of flavor.

review/text: I absolutely love these, healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. I love fruit snacks, but am kind of particular about them. These ones are great! One of the best I have had. This particular flavor, the berries and cherries, is delicious! My boyfriend, who usually dislikes all fruit snacks, enjoyed these as well! We are both partial to the dark cherry flavor. Texture is also really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. You don't have to sit there chewing forever, but if you want u can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect! The only fruit snack that I have had that is in my opinion slightly better than these, is Annie's brand. However, Annie's is at least double (closer to triple) the price of these. I definitely recommend this product =)

Ok, maybe a little onion & ginger fried in ghee - but that's all.  Perfect balance of flavor and heat, the chewy seeds bring a bright spark and the rest of the blend is harmonious and perfect for dressing up the dull taste of pulses.  Another note about those mixes out there - check and see how much salt is crammed into those other blends. Salt - the cheapest thing out there, diluting your value.  Ajika Lentil Curry Blend has NO salt at all - you are paying for 100% spice.  Rock on.

review/summary: Promising, but flawed
review/text: In principle, this is a great product:  It's actual fruit, with nothing added, dried to a crisp and put in a packet that only has 85 calories.  If you're looking for light, healthy-ish snack foods that are still tasty, this is a great choice.<br /><br />But there are a couple of problems:<br /><br />1.  The packets are very narrow and long, which makes it virtually impossible to reach into them to get the fruit out, once you're past the top third or so.<br /><br />2.  There's a decent amount of fruit dust inside -- which, as these are berries and cherries, is red, and just waiting for a bit of added water to  stain up any fabric it lands on.<br /><br />Either of these in isolation is no problem, but put them together, and you've got a product that you MUST pour out, and yet a product that you CAN'T pour out.  I guess maybe if you had a bowl or something, it wouldn't be a big deal, but that sort of takes away the portable-snack nature of it, no?  As much as I liked the fruit, the inconvenience of the packaging is going to keep me from buying more.<br /><br />Oh, and one more caveat:  Despite the "Cherry Berry" name, this is at least 50% apple.  I suspect that apples are to dried fruit mixes what peanuts are to mixed nuts, the inexpensive and unobjectionable filler.  The apple tastes fine and all, but I wouldn't mind more cherries and berries, and fewer apples.

I paid $1.79 for one packet at a major chain!!  That's insanity.

review/summary: Sensible Snacking
review/text: The Sensible Foods Cherry Berry snacks are great.  I keep them at my desk and anytime I need a little something they are perfect.  No drips or dribbles on the keyboard.  I have ordered some other selections of the dried fruit, but be mindful that there are more apple pieces than berries.  The pouches average about 2 blueberries, 6 strawberry slices and 2 cherries.

review/summary: One of my favorite snacks
review/text: When it comes to snacking, the crunch dried snacks are the best. Each fruit has a distinctive texture and flavor. The individual pieces are flavorful so you can nibble one tiny piece of banana and actually taste banana. There is no fat so you don't have greasy fingers.  You can take the packages anywhere.  Dried blueberries taste like blueberries.  Dried cherries taste like cherries. In some of the dried fruit mixes, the general taste is "blend." With Sensible Foods crunch dried snacks, you can savor the morsels slowly, one individual flavor and one individual texture at a time or eat them fast, mingling textures and tastes depending.<br /><br />I keep packages on hand to satisfy midnight snack urges,  to crunch instead of chips when I eat a sandwich, to snack while I watch the tube or to grab and go.  Cherry Berry is frankly delicious.  I buy regularly to always have some on hand.  It is much tastier, more interesting to the palate, and cleaner eating than nibbling on rice cakes, popcorn or chips. The product satisfies hunger, too, which makes it a close to perfect food in my world.  The ONLY reason I did not give it a 5 is because I've gotten packages that were light on the cherries and I really like the cherries a lot.

review/text: These fruit snacks are the best low calorie, extremely flavorful snacks in the world.  I eat the Orchard and Cherry Berry for breakfast at my desk every day.  The fruit is dried to a crunch not a gummy chew and the flavor has no aftertaste or funky smell.<br /><br />Overall, I love these snacks more than any other pre-packaged food.  I carry them with me on trips and eat them at my desk or in my comfy chair at home.  Try them!

review/summary: Sweet and crunchy!
review/text: The Cherry Berry snacks from Sensible Foods are my new favorite food on the go.  I've taken them on road trips, shared them at the office, and even gave them as stocking-stuffers this year.  I find them delightfully sweet and crunchy, which is perfect for my typical snack craving.  The powder at the bottom of the bag doesn't bother me, but I can understand the frustration some folks have voiced; if you get it on your hands with any moisture at all, it can stick.  I always have little hand wipes in the car or in my purse, so it hasn't caused me any trouble.  I highly recommend this product as a healthy alternative to candy, and I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.

review/text: This is the best dried fruit I've had.  There are some big whole berries in there and it's great tasting.  Contains only fruit and nothing else. No fat or extra sugar.  And it's crunchy instead of chewy like most dried fruit.  If I had one complaint it would be once I added up the cost (no shipping cost for Prime) it comes out to $1.11 per bag.  Still, good for you snacks never come cheap.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the simple goodness of these snacks. They remind me more of fruit that has been "freeze-dried" (like the ice cream at the Air and Space Museum in DC, if you are familiar) than of conventional dried fruit. They are light and flavorful with "nothing else" added to the fruit (as the ingredients state). They might take some getting used to if you are familiar with sugary (or high fructose corn syrupy) dried fruit, though. They are a great addition to organic cereal and low-fat ice cream, too. Yum!

review/summary: Nice flavor, but...
review/text: I tried 3 flavors (Cherry Berry, Orchard Blend and Tropical Blend) and found the following to be true of all of them.<br /><br />1) Packaging is impressive with long, narrow, foil lined one-serving sized bags. However, the size of the bag is deceiving for the amount of product inside. Although they are easy to open by simply tearing off the top inch, they are not resealable - not that you would want to because the servings are so 'small'. The bag design also makes it near to impossible to reach in by hand for snacks. Even a child's hand is too large, resulting in having to eat this snack by pouring into hand or bowl.<br /><br />2) At the bottom of each bag is a layer of fine 'powder' residue from the dried fruits. It gets on everything and stains: esp. when wet from fingers, etc. It also makes it difficult to get the last of the snacks from the bag to your mouth, esp. if eating directly from the package,  because the powder from the bottom of the bag puffs out, up your nose and all over your mouth. Makes a mess.<br /><br />3) All 3 flavors that I tried had the same issue as someone mentioned in their comments before me: each flavor seems to have an over-abundance of one particular fruit. In the Cherry Berry, it is apples. In the tropical, I found it to be mangoes, and in the orchard, it was bananas, lots and lots of bananas.<br /><br />4) I also found some of the snack to be 'crunchy' while other pieces of fruit were sticky/mushy once in my mouth. Ex. banana slices. The combo of moosh and crunch (very little crunch) was disappointing when this is suppose to be a 'crunchy snack'. I found myself using it up in yogurt and oatmeal rather than as a snack.<br /><br />This is a natural snack so the first time around I didn't mind the expense. However, now that I know what to expect, I will not purchase again unless the packaging and fruit 'dust' issues could be addressed. Then it might be worth the money. Until then, I'll buy my own fresh bananas, mangoes and apples.<br /><br />I will admit, however, a few of these put together in a gift basket would make a nice presentation for someone who has never tried this product.

review/text: This is a good tasting snack, but I should have read the reviews more carefully.  It's called "Cherry Berry" but it should be called "Apple Cherry Berry with more Apples and some Apples on top".  The apples are fine, but I expected more berries.<br /><br />Also, I don't know if this is an effect of shipping or what, but there's a lot of "fruit dust" in the bottom. Be careful if you tip the package up over your mouth (which you will do since your hand doesn't fit in the narrow package) because it's easy to inhale it.

review/text: Great stuff even though the pouches are small, I'm quite satisfied with one and the quality seems to be very consistent.  Not the typical dried fruit they call it "crunch dried", more akin to freeze dried, seems to agree better with me then the typical dried bulk fruit and being portion controlled you can count calories with ease.  Something people forget when they eat bulk packed dried fruit, they tend to eat too much of it.  Also works well on cereal or oatmeal.<br /><br />It's also nice that Amazon offers it by the box, it's more economical then buying it piece price locally.

review/summary: Definately a good between meal snack or add to cereal
review/text: Its tough finding 100% real fruit snacks that low in calories, and these are pretty good. These work well on there own as a snack, good with cold cereal, or even tossed into oatmeal.<br /><br />At a bit over $1 USD per bag, I think they are priced accordingly, but wish they were about $.80 USD per bag generally.<br /><br />There is sometimes alot of fruit 'dust' at the bottom of the bag that obviously weight (sack is .75 OZ), where you wish there were larger pieces.  Also, the pieces range from easy to pick up indivually, to small pieces (like blueberries or 'dust') that can't easily.<br /><br />The bag does not have a re-seal, but they are really built to be a single snack.

review/summary: Very interesting
review/text: First of all, I was worried about the pulp that is present in this product.  But it's not like orange juice pulp.  The little bits of aloe are actually quite juicy.  As someone who does NOT like to have floaties in anything I drink, this pulp was quite tolerable.<br /><br />The flavor was very interesting.  It wasn't very sweet, and the reason for that is obvious.  There is no added sugar.  The only sugar present is the stuff that naturally occurs in the mango, mangosteen, coconut, and aloe.  The result was actually quite refreshing.  But I will warn that it was very coconutty.  I could barely taste the mangosteen and mango.  It was almost like a pi&ntilde;a colada.  Coconut is a flavor I absolutely love, so I had no problem with this at all.<br /><br />The one warning I have is what aloe can do to a person's digestive system if that person is not used to aloe.  I highly recommend starting off with about a quarter of a bottle a day and work your way up.  I drink this before I spend any time where I need to keep hydrated because the high potassium content helps the body retain water.  But overdoing it can lead to diarrhea, and that would conter-act the hydrating qualities.<br /><br />I'm editing after drinking a few bottles to give an updated impression.<br /><br />First of all, I've started having to strain the pulp out of the juice.  This isn'ta big deal, but after a couple of glasses, I started to develop a gag reflex due to the pulp.  It's not specific to this drink.  I do the same when I drink pulpy orange juice.  I do, however, have to drop one star because of this.  If it was pulp free, it would get the full five stars.<br /><br />Another thing I've noticed is that this tastes almost identical to all of the other Coco drinks made my Alo, so which one I buy in the future will be determined mostly by which one is the cheapest.<br /><br />And of course, the final thing I'd like to point out is that this stuff has some pretty amazing hydration qualities.  If I drink a half a bottle before excercising, the water I drink while excercising goes a lot further towards quenching my thirst.  The reason, of course, is because it contains such a large amount of potassium.  Potassium is an electrolyte, and electrolytes are needed in order for the body to absorb water that is ingested.  I used to get full on water while spending four hours in the 100 degree heat on the golf course, but a quick potassium pick-me-up before the round helps me to regulate the amount of water I need to drink while outside in that heat.  For that reason alone, the fact that it is a great natural alternative to Gatorade, I will be continuing to buy this product.

review/summary: Very good. Tastes like a graham cracker with figs.
review/text: These taste like a combination of graham cracker, with a little cinnamon, and with fig mixed in. They are sweet, but not overly so. I put them in a ziplock bag after opening and they stayed crisp for over a week. So the fig is not so overwhelming as to make the cracker "soggy".  They are about 3 inches diameter, and are round. The nutrition information says they are about 100 calories, with about 2 gm of fat in a two cookie serving. These are a good snack for those moments when I have a sweet tooth and do satisfy.

review/summary: Tasty but Not as Good as Original Newtons
review/text: For a `healthy' snack they are quite good.  They have a very sweet taste and bits of fruit that will remind you of the original fig newtons.  I liked the crunchy texture of the cookies which reminded me of Honey Graham crackers.<br /><br />Each serving of 3 has about 140 calories and contains about 2 g of fiber and 5 g of fat.  To get the fiber in there the cookies are a little dry and I had a glass of milk when eating them.  They are quite good dunked.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed them and will probably buy them again.  One note I seem to have eaten them all myself as none of my children cared for them.  I suppose it is more of an adult taste.

review/summary: Da Better Flavor, but still I've eaten better
review/text: This was the flavor most people preferred when I shared these Fruit Thins in the Office and the response was 45% YUCK, 40% GOOD, and 15% Neutral.  The Yuck group complained that the cracker was too dry, fruit tasted like cough syrup, texture was too chewy.  The Good group like that this was at least nutrious compared to similar crackers and tasted like newtons.  I fell into the neutral group and my main opinion is that it is okay, this type of cracker has been done before, some have had baked better versions and the price is quite expensive for a bag of crackers.  One of the more colorful comments is that NEWTON'S are always characterized by a soft fruit filled cake and this product just does not come close to that description hence the comfort food factor which might have made this more acceptable is lost.  Good effort, bad execution.

review/summary: Tasty but pretty chewy
review/text: It's a small thing, but the figs in these cookies will really stick in your teeth and I would not recommend these if you are currently wearing braces.  I really like the shortbread texture and the fact that three of them only total 140 calories, making them a great snack insert for my perpetual diet.  There is a distinctively figgy taste, which is somewhat overdone in my opinion, but the pieces of fruit themselves just get so imbedded to the point that I feel the need to brush my teeth immediately after eating.  Otherwise, of the ingredients that I can pronounce, they are made with unbleached enriched wheat flour, sugar (no wonder they taste good), whole grain wheat flour, soybean and/or palm oil, rolled oats, dried figs, raisins, honey, salt, baking soda, rice flour, and natural favor (contains cinnamon).

review/text: These little cookies are delicious! And not altogether horrible for you. They are crispy with a little bit of stickiness (in a good way) from the figs. They remind me somewhat of teddy grahams in their flavor: strong but not too artificial. I brought them to work and they were gone within the hour! Great snack for any age.<br />Downside: They package isn't that protective, and they got a little crumbly in the mail. I saw them at Albertson's for something like 4 dollars a package? There are also other flavors, but I think the fig is probably best.<br />Filling without being heavy or unhealthy, and healthy without being bland! What more could you ask for?

review/summary: Tasty Light Crispy Cookie
review/text: First, a couple of minor negatives with these cookies.<br /><br />First is the name. For years Nabisco advertised, "A cookie is just a cookie, but Newtons are fruit and cake." Why the Nabisco marketing gurus would think that it was a good idea to associate the "Newtons" name with these thin, crisp cookies is beyond me.<br /><br />Next is the packaging. The trend today is toward recycled-content paperboard packaging, such as the one Nabisco used for their new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LA1LKI">Ritz Crackerful Multigrain Crackers</a>. These cookies come in a foil-lined bag with a plastic liner, neither of which can be recycled.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are quite good. They have a light texture similar to that of a shortbread or butter cookie. There is a nice light sweet flavor that is not overpowering. As is often the case when you use dried fruit in a cookie, the fig bits are a tad hard and chewy. I thought these go best with a beverage. Tea, coffee, soft drink, and even (according to Mrs. Boilermate), wine. We both agreed these are "adult" cookies.<br /><br />While we prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEJ968">Cranberry Citrus Oat</a> flavor by a slight margin, we will buy these, too.

review/text: My kids don't like them and I don't care for them, however I'm not really much of a cookie eater. I think these cookies are more designed for adults because they are not very sweet and are hard and brittle. If you like a hard dry cookie like the Canadian Biscuits you'll probably like Newton's Fruit Thins. They may be good for dipping in milk, tea or coffee.

review/summary: C is for cookie -- that's good enough for me.
review/text: In the great word-association game that is cookie-eating, "Newton" conjures up immediately the image of those pillowy fruit-filled cookies, the kind that some people carefully pull in half to get to the fruit first and others just gulp down whole. Well, forget about them, because the Newton folks have something new here.<br /><br />These cookies, as the name implies, are flat -- really flat and think, like the chocolate wafers you use for baking or a ginger snap. Thinner than most crackers, certainly thinner than your standard cookie. So they have a crunch and a snap to them that's unusual for an cookie. It's a satisfying crunch; these are thin, but eating one feels like a real cookie. (Not to say that the thinness won't lead to eating vast quantities -- ask my wife; she demolished most of the box, even after I told her I need to eat more of them -- purely in the interests of science, of course! -- for review here.)<br /><br />The fruity taste comes as something of a surprise -- it's throughout the cookie, as well as baked into tiny little nubbins of fruity something-or-other. (I'm not an industrial chemist, so I'm flailing around for the right terminology.) These cookies obviously don't have the fruity softness of the pillowy Newtons, but they're fruity enough for a good taste.<br /><br />Actually, let's be honest here: these are *cookies.* They're sweet and crunchy and my family demolished a whole box of them in less than a weekend. There may be bad cookies out there, but these are not among them -- if you've read this far, you obviously want to know "Are these cookies good to eat?" and the answer is most definitely Yes.

review/summary: Surprise!  Husband Likes a HEALTHY Cookie
review/text: These cookies make a perfect accompaniment to a cup of green tea.<br /><br />Not too sweet, with an interesting infusion of flavor from the fig and raisin bits.  They're nicely crisp, with a barely perceptible oat flavor that adds an extra dimension to the taste. And despite having added fruit, the cookies manage to stay crisp and maintain their texture, even after opening the package.<br /><br />I like the fact that they're made with some multigrain flour and I find that 3 cookies makes a satisfying snack.<br /><br />I was shocked to find that not only would my husband eat these (he's a notoriously picky eater) but would actually say he LIKED them.  Awesome feat, Nabisco!<br /><br />These are unlike any cookie I've tasted before (and nothing at all like a fig newton, in my opinion).  Give them a try; you might be surprised to find a new cookie favorite!

review/summary: Thin, crispy cookies with a bit of fruit
review/text: I am a big fan of all types of cookies, including all varieties of Fig Newtons. These Fruit Thins are not exactly a thin Fig Newton, they are a thin, circular cookie with bits of fig and a honey flavor. The taste is reminiscent of the original Fig Newtons, but there is no soft, paste filling.<br /><br />The cookies are perfect for a light treat with a cup of tea, and the thinner size keeps them from being too sweet or filling.  I think you could compare them somewhat to a sweet biscuit instead of a full size Fig Newton. Light and crisp, my husband and I both enjoyed these cookies, and have already bought another bag.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when I tried these cookies. From the packaging and description, I expected a stronger fig taste. However, after my first bite, I thought, "Wow, these taste like fancy graham crackers." Aside from the typical graham cracker taste, these also had a hint of cinnamon, which went well with the overall taste. My only criticism is that, after I was done chewing the cookies, I would have small bits of fig in my mouth, as the pieces are kind of hard.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try, though, especially if you like graham crackers!

They are a perfect compliment to coffee, and possibly hot tea.  They do not work well with iced tea for some reason. The specific taste is hard to place...somewhere between a butter cookie, fig, and raisin.  These thins are at their best when nibbled slowly with a late morning cup of coffee - oral confection heaven.

review/summary: Very different than Fig Newtons, but a terrific snacking biscuit in its own related right.
review/text: 'Newtons Fruit Thins', as the name of the product, evokes a pretty specific response in my head.  Fig Newtons maintained a better-than-irregular presence in our pantry when I was growing up, and that dense cake(y) exterior of the Newton wrapped around the dark and rich fig filling was (and is) a pretty distinct taste and experience amongst mass-produced cookies.  It's always interesting, I think, when an (at least somewhat) iconic brand rolls out a new derivation of its core product -- or at least that's what I imagined 'Newtons Fruit Thins' was going to be.  I was wrong, but I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Unlike the soft richness of the original Fig Newtons, these snap a bit like crackers.  They are crumbly, not flaky or otherwise too dense or tough to be difficult to bite into, but they are wholly a different textural experience than the original Newtons.  Toned down is the sweetness, although the rich and chewy (sometimes a little tough/dense against the relatively softer biscuit) bits of fig still elevate the overall flavor are still reminiscent of the original cookie.  These are, perhaps, a more mature and refined thin biscuit when compared to the classic Newton; they're light, tasty, and satisfying, while still managing to be relatively healthy when compared to similar snacks (and that's what I think this is, a snack item rather than a dessert).  Three biscuits represents 140 calories, 5g total fat (1g sat fat), 95mg of sodium, 60mg potassium, 21 total carb, 2g fiber, 7g sugar, and 2g protein.<br /><br />A bag of the fig and honey has impressed us enough that we've added two of the other three currently available flavor combinations to our list; the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEP5VQ">Newtons Fruit Thins Raspberry Chocolate, 10.5-Ounce (Pack of4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEN3GA">Newtons Fruit Thins Blueberry Brown Sugar, 10.5-Ounce (Pack of4)</a>.  Good stuff, looking forward to trying the others, and that's the bottom line when and as it comes to this review.

review/summary: Really wanted to like 'em
review/text: I've been a Fig Newton fan for over 30 years, and was delighted to try the new Newton Thins.  What a disappointment.  Original Newtons live in a chewy-fruity world of texture-taste sensation.  The Newton Thins are supposed to be crisp, but are more crisp-ish, while the fig is negligible and tasteless.<br /><br />The concept is a good one.  If this cookie had been done with cranberry or something punchier than fig in small doses it probably would have fared better.  Likewise doing a fig cookie more like the danish cookies would also have been a good concept transference.  Instead, the Newton Thin tries to be a cookie AND a Newton and it can't be both; which I guess is why the old tagline was, "it's not a cookie... it's a Newton".

review/summary: light and healthy, with only a single flaw
review/text: I like Fig Newtons, and Newtons in general. I also like honey. So it goes without saying that I wanted to try these. Newtons are always a healthy alternative to other types of cookies and snacks, so I was hopeful these would be the same.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />These cookies are very crisp, they are flaky but not soft. They hold their shape very well, and surprisingly, even after shipping, only a few were broken in the package. There are about 30 cookies in s single 10.5 ounce package.<br /><br />In terms of consistency, I'm very pleased. They remind me of shortbread. Each cookie is about 2.5 inches in diameter, so they are a decent size.<br /><br />There are three cookies in a serving, and the serving totals 140 calories. Personally, three is a bit much, so I keep it to two. However, in a regular serving, there is 5g of fat, 2g of fiber, and only 7g of sugar. The sugar content is really low, making for a good healthy alternative.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the figs are a bit chewy and hard in the cookie. This may immediately turn you off from having more, since it takes a little more effort to chew than a Newton. It could also be the honey combined with the fig pieces that makes them a little tough. Also, I've come across one fig pit piece in a cookie...so you need to watch your teeth. In other words, you just need to be mindful of this while eating the cookies (and the same holds true for Newtons, too).<br /><br />I like these enough to buy them again in the future. They are delicious, hearty, and healthy. Other than watching for a rare pit, I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Reasonable Cookie - Palm Oil is a Concern
review/text: The cookies themselves are reasonably good.  They are thin, but that was the idea, wasn't it? The cookies have a nice texture.  You can taste the honey and figs.  They do go well with tea. The calorie count, 140 for three cookies, is about the same as the granola bars that I sometimes snack on.  Just don't eat the whole box at once.<br /><br />The ingredients are also reasonable with the exception of the use of palm oil.  As palm oil use has increased dramatically over the past ten years, commercial growers have been clearing rain forests in Indonesia and Malaysia to create palm oil plantations.  The palm oil is used in food production, as in these cookies, and in the manufacture of bio-fuels.  The result is a loss of endangered species and ironically increased carbon emission. There has been some movement to either reduce palm oil use or use only palm oil from sustainable sources.  There have even been stories of girl scouts agitating to sell only palm-oil-free cookies.<br /><br />Kraft is aware of the palm oil situation.  It is not clear that they are doing anything about it. This is from a July 15, 2009 Wall Street Journal article:  "Kraft spokesman Richard D. Buino said that while the company supports the RSPO's [Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil] efforts, "it is clear more work is needed to consolidate standards, enforce principles, verify traceability along the supply chain and ensure competitive pricing to bring certified palm oil to market. We're monitoring the RSPO process and actively engaging our suppliers to monitor their certification efforts to find viable options for sourcing sustainable palm oil." Neither Nestl&eacute; nor Kraft directly addressed purchases of Malaysia's certified palm oil."<br /><br />The cookies go from four to three stars from me as a consequence of the palm oil.

review/summary: Fine, but not special.
review/text: The cookie is pretty tasty, presumably because of the honey.  The fruit is a bit hard and bland, and definitely disappointing.  Overall, I could see that some people would really enjoy the cookies, but I did not.  Don't get me wrong: they were fine.  I would eat them if they were offered to me, without complaint.  But I don't think I will be buying these any more.  It was surprising because I definitely enjoy Fig Newtons.

review/summary: A Cookie for Grown-Ups
review/text: I am one of those people who has a disgustingly ravenous sweet tooth. Almost any sweet treat will do but of late I have been making an effort to go for fruit over cookies. But come on, everyone deserves a real sugary snack now and again. Candy bars and pints of ice cream have been my vices in the past but the humble cookie is the one I go for when I want to feel like I'm eating a lot when I'm not really. When I saw these cookies offered on Amazon's Vine I skipped them in favor of books and went out and bought a box (to conduct my very own taste test review) because they sounded good. I'm glad I did because I love these!<br /><br />Newtons Fruit Thins are hardly Double Stuf Oreos as far as sweetness goes but if you enjoy the classic Fig Newton this one is like a crunchy cousin. A little bit cinnamony with a graham-crackery note of honey and little nibs of fig sprinkled through-out. If you like graham-crackers or crispy oatmeal cookies these will probably be a delight. Certainly they're not for everyone and it's a matter of personal likes but these are hardly the tasteless bits of cardboard others have suggested they are. I believe it is fair to compare them to tea biscuits, these the aren't sugar-coma inducing cookies your 8-year-old is going to demand. These are more of a grown-up cookie--as my grandma likes to say "I'm not old, I'm mature"--but I've been debating sharing one with my toddler to see what she thinks.<br /><br />Overall I think these are lovely, just the right amount of sweet, crunchy goodie for a post-lunch treat. I'm looking forward to trying one of the other varieties soon!

review/summary: Crunchy fig newtons
review/text: The taste really reminded me of the original fig newtons.<br />Instead of a soft pastry with lots of fruit filling, these cookies are crunchy with bits and pieces of fruit.<br /><br />It's the same taste that makes fig newtons delicious, but now they in crunchy cookie form.

review/summary: A pleasant surprise!
review/text: When first opening this bag of cookies, I got a burst of spicy, slightly sweet scent that was quite pleasant without being overpowering.  The cookies (more like biscuits, really) were only slightly sweet - then one of the little fig bits exploded with sweetness in my mouth!<br /><br />These more wholesome, lower sugar cookies would be ideal for long summer car rides with kids; as they are less messy than most cookies, and won't get the kids as wired.<br /><br />Very nice, slightly more sophisticated take on the usual cookie.

review/summary: Not very Fig-y
review/text: For a product that calls itself "Fruit Thins," my first question after trying one has to be "where's the fruit?"  There is a decidable lack of fig and/or fig-taste in these cookies.  The fig that is in there consists of dry and tasteless little chopped bits that are often so hard that sometimes you think you might have bitten a stray piece of shell.  These hard bits have a tendency to get stuck in your teeth where they soften to the point of sticky.  Yuck.<br /><br />As for the cookie part, that's a different story.  The cookie itself is thin, light, and crisp, and has a nice honey flavor.  However, if you're a Fig Newton lover thinking to give these a try as an alternative to the original, then my advice would be to stick with the old "fruit and cake" and give these a miss.

review/summary: Delicious and reasonably healthy
review/text: I confess, I only got to try one cookie in this pack.  My husband and daughter devoured them almost upon arrival.  On Saturday morning, I slept late, and my daughter had them for breakfast saying, "Well, you said they were healthy."<br /><br />Happily, I can pronounce every ingredient in these cookies, and I know what all of the ingredients are. Here's the list:  Unbleached Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate {Vitamin B1}, Riboflavin {Vitamin B2}, Folic Acid), Sugar, Whole Grain Wheat Flour, Soybean And/Or Palm Oil, Rolled Oats, Dried Figs, Raisins, Honey, Salt, Baking Soda, Rice Flour, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavor (Contains Cinnamon). Contains: Wheat, Soy.<br /><br />They have only 7 grams of sugar per serving (compare that to Nilla Wafers at 11 grams, and only 1 gram protien) Additionally, the cookies have a smattering of iron, protein, and a healthy dose of potassium.<br /><br />The taste is very much like a standard shortbread cookie--lightly sweet and crispy.  There are tiny bits of fig mixed in that are chewy and sweet (though truthfully, the cookie doesn't taste figgy).  They are the perfect cookie for a milk and cookies snack.

review/summary: Mostly Harmless
review/text: After several samplings of these cookies and sharing them with both friends and strangers, the general concensus is that most everyone is pretty ambivalent.  They're not great, they're not terrible, they just...are.  The taste and texture is like a cross between a graham cracker and a windmill cookie, with little chewy fruit bits that get stuck in your teeth (some individual cookies have more or less fruit bits).  If you bite into one expecting any resemblance to a fig Newton, you'll be disappointed, but otherwise they're OK.  I probably wouldn't bother trying this flavor again, though I might try one of the others just to compare.

review/summary: Like a graham cracker with fruit
review/text: I'm a fan of Fig Newtons. It's one of those treats that I associate with my grandparents and every time I have them, it takes me back to their cookie jar in the pantry. Since Nabisco is using the "Newtons" brand on this product, I felt that I would be a good judge of the new product.<br /><br />These are called fruit thins for a reason, as they are quite thin! I would say that they are equivalent to the thickness of a graham cracker, and about the same softness. The comparison to a graham cracker is apt because that's what I'm reminded of most when eating them. The honey flavor and the texture make them more like round graham crackers with fruit embedded in them than any kind of cookie that I've ever had.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is good, if a little sweet for my preference. I shared them with a 10-year-old and a 6-year-old to get the child's perspective and they really liked them.<br /><br />The serving size is three crackers, clocking in at 140 calories (45 from fat). The list of ingredients doesn't contain anything too scary or artificial, which is a good thing. The absence of high fructose corn syrup is welcome. The package I received was marked as having been made in Canada.<br /><br />Would I buy them again? Maybe, but probably not. They certainly aren't a replacement for the tried and true Fig Newtons in my book.
