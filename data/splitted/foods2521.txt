review/summary: Don't Listen to the negative reviews
review/text: So before I ordered this I was reading the reviews worrying about how some people said that when they got the coffee it was already or close to expiring.<br />Not true. I got mine today (june 16th) and mine are going to expire March 28th 2013.<br /><br />And also people said that the coffee packets came in all messed up and it looked like they just threw it in the box.<br />Not true. Mine came in a amazon box and inside is another box and the receipt. Inside the smaller box is the VIA container that is just like the picture. All little packets were still inside the starbucks packet.<br /><br />I would def ignore all those negative comments because this is a pretty good product to order! =)

review/summary: Best instant coffee EVER
review/text: I purchased this for work because I work at night, and can't drink an entire pot of coffee on my own, (don't like to waste). I hadn't tried instant coffee in ages because I'd never had a positive experience with any brand, until now. Starbucks Italian Roast instant has a strong robust flavor, and will perk you up before you've finished the first cup. I'll definitely be keeping this on hand!

review/text: The caramel flavor I bought at a Starbucks store led me to try more. This one however was much weaker and only one in a cup was too weak. So I used two packets for one cup, and when you figure the unit cost, that's about $1.25/cup for instant. Also, when you open the package, the coffee really doesn't seem to flow smoothly and often I would get some on the counter.<br /><br />Not planning to purchase again.

review/text: I bought the Columbian and the Espresso 3-packs locally for travel because motel/hotel coffees are so bad as are fast-food chain coffees, but both versions of the Starbucks VIA instant coffees are absolutely disgusting. I am not a soda drinker, but when I travel I prefer a Coca Cola or Pepsi to this foul "coffee". It reminds me of the old Sanka instant coffee, but is much stronger and much more bitter. Totally disgusting! The only people who could drink this crap are those who use flavored creamers and/or loads of sugar so they don't taste any of this foul coffee.

review/text: In my search for instant java fix, I have sampled French, German, Italian, US, Israeli, Turkish produced instant coffees and this is, by far, the best instant coffee I have tasted.  The reason? It does not taste "instant". Rather, it tastes like a freshly brewed, dark, strong, rich cup of real coffee. For a less "potent" taste, packets should be used in venti-sized cups or rationed for more than one regular cup. This is an excellent product.

review/summary: Still A Fan!
review/text: Strangely enough but this Starbucks' instant coffee tastes better than the instant coffee I purchase in the Starbucks coffee shops. I often worry that the coffee may be old and have a wierd taste -- which has occurred twice. So, of course I was nervous about ordering this large amount online but said what the heck. It was a good choice. I do wish they would instant package the Breakfast Blend. That is my very favorite. Pike's Place is my next fav -- but not to be had in the instant variety either. This Columbian, medium roast, is quite tasty though. I'm having a cup right now and really enjoying it. Oh by the way, for the person who said the coffee is too strong and uses only half the package and the remainder of the coffee turns to goo. Tip: Do not pour the coffee into a cup of hot water. The steam from the water instantly makes the coffee hard to pour from the package and indeed starts to dissolve the coffee. Pour the coffee into the empty cup and then seal the package. A small paper clip works well.

review/summary: I'm impressed. Tastes like real coffee. Still not better than brewed, but hey.
review/text: I have two positive reviews for this product -- me as a coffee drinker, and after polling a number of training participants at my work after switching 100% to via products.<br /><br />I drink very dark french press coffee at home, and often espresso. I am very picky about my coffee. So, for me to find this instant coffee very drinkable is quite impressive. I like the italian roast, and can't really drink the medium roast. I drink this at work when I have trainings, and think it's pretty close to the real thing, but still not the same as getting a fresh brewed cup. However, in a pinch, it's a great substitute. My husband likes the Via so that he doesn't have to make noise making coffee in the morning at home -- we have a 3 month old son -- and grinding and boiling water can get loud.<br /><br />I work in a business where we previously had a caterer bringing us coffee (very subpar) and it was costing us $20-50 per class. Now people are impressed that the Starbucks Via is out. They seem to like the coffee (all flavors) and say it's an improvement over the catering coffee. And, we are saving SO much money because people only consume what they need, rather than paying per person with a caterer. A win-win! Thanks for making it taste good, Starbucks!

At the time of this writing 66 cents for one packet! A little bit more than a k-cup (.43) but i dont have to carry around a machine in my purse to enjoy it.<br /><br />2. They are super convenient for camping / backpacking.<br /><br />3. I throw some in the car - so if I am traveling, I can stop at a gas station with hot water, instead of plunking down $4 on crap coffee.<br /><br />4. They do NOT taste like instant coffee. They taste delicious! And strong!<br /><br />5. Easy to open.<br /><br />6. Throw them in your purse when you need a coffee fix and your clients, friends, family dont like strong or good coffee.<br /><br />7. You don't have to clean a coffeepot or throw away a more bulky kcup.

I completely avoided instant coffee until I tried Starbucks Via. I was amazed! In the time it takes to boil water, I can have a full-flavored, aromatic cup of coffee. My office has a Bunn hot-water dispenser which cuts the time to seconds! Now I take the VIA packs camping, boating and always have a few in my brief case when traveling on business. They are pricey when bought at the local supermarket, but the Amazon price on the 50-pack brings the cost down to .65 per cup.

review/summary: Great for that extra cup of coffee !
review/text: I love this stuff!  Although we brew a big pot of coffee in the AM, shut the machine off, and use the microwave to heat cups later in the day, there are those days when we run out of coffee early, want another cup or two, and don't want to brew another whole pot.  These give us the additional cups of really good coffee we want - hate the usual instant stuff - and it's so quick and easy to make another cup this way.<br /><br />Great for camping too - and for making a cup of strong coffee when a recipe I'm using calls for one as an ingredient.  (I cook gluten-free - and can't make "rye" bread without a good strong cup of joe.)<br /><br />So glad I found it on Amazon.  They've gotten really expensive in the nearest Starbucks, and I'm already running out of the pack Santa put in my Christmas stocking.  Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Great value for awesome instant coffee
review/text: I love having Starbucks VIA around to supplement my brewed coffee.  Personally, I start out with a pot of fresh ground extra bold coffee in the morning.  It usually lasts me until around 3 in the afternoon, at which point I switch to using my VIAs.  They taste the most like fresh brewed coffee from any instant I've ever tried.  I also use the VIAs when I'm working late at night, heading out early for a meeting, or for Church on Sundays so I can avoid the "burner coffee".  ;)<br /><br />Being able to by them in bulk at $0.70 per packet makes this habit much more economical!  A big thanks to Starbucks for offering them through Amazon as well as their own store.  Finally, I received my pack of 50 on May 2nd, and it has an expiration date of October, if that helps any of you who are concerned about the expiration date problems described by others.  Perhaps it was just a backlog of product as people were discovering VIA available on Amazon?

review/summary: Heaven for decaf drinkers!
review/text: If you already know about VIA, let me just say that this is the decaf version, and it's fabulous -- 'nuff said!  :)<br /><br />If you don't know about VIA, boy, are you in for a treat.  VIA is Starbucks' trademark name for their new version of instant coffee.  Before you give up in disgust, stop and think:  would they really blow their name by bringing out something undrinkable like ordinary instant?  No, they're not that stupid, right?  So... there must be something unlike ordinary instant going on here.  Bingo!  Here's how I discovered it:<br /><br />My coffee maker (a Cuisinart GRIND-n-BREW, less than 2 weeks beyond the warranty period, naturally) gave up the ghost just before a big dinner party, and my husband and I aren't eager to make big purchases these days, to put it mildly.  At Sam's Club I ran across a large-sized pack of single-serving little tubes of Columbian VIA and thought, hey, why not -- gives us some more time to decide on our new coffeemaker.  Sam's doesn't sell any decaf VIA, so I had to admit to being out of decaf at the dinner (most of our guests gave up at that point, not wanting to caffeinate themselves so late in the evening), but the few who still wanted coffee were served VIA without knowing it.  All 3 praised our coffee, and I personally thought it was terrific!!  I 'fessed up to everyone's surprise and gave them each a single-serving packet to take home.<br /><br />Since then, I've had nothing but VIA.  Not only do I enjoy it as much as brewed fresh-ground Starbucks coffee, but I absolutely love the convenience of "brewing" a single serving whenever I want it, instead of waiting for a whole pot, throwing some of it out after it lingered for an hour or two, and then waiting for a whole new pot later if I want more.  Needless to say, we haven't replaced the Cuisinart, and that was months ago.  (Note:  a single serving is 8 oz., and our porcelain coffee mugs hold 10 oz., so it works beautifully for us, whether a single cup or a dozen:  just put a tube's worth into each mug and add steaming hot water to what you've predetermined is the 8 oz. point).  I also love not having to wonder whether my big bag of whole beans is still fresh or whether to throw out the rest and plunk down serious cash on the next one:  the VIA is fresh each time, so I'm actually spending less per cup than I had been before.  Not to mention the serious pain previously of cleaning the grinding mechanism on the GRIND-n-BREW for every new pot... :(<br /><br />The only problem I originally had was no decaf, so I was giving up drinking any coffee at all after 3 or 4 in the afternoon.  Then, naturally, I found the decaf on Amazon -- HOORAY!!!  I'm about to order my sixth case of this wonderful decaf, which tastes as good as any decaf I've ever had.  The only other place I've ever found the decaf is on Starbucks' own website, and it's cheaper from Amazon, especially if you're a Prime member.  Amazon scores again, and then some.<br /><br />The best part?  How portable it is!!  If you end up agreeing with me that it's as good as "brewed", then just imagine being able to take one of these little tubes with you anywhere you go, just add it to 8 oz. of steaming hot water, and then end up with a fresh cup of fabulous-tasting coffee?  Ymmmm...  (Especially nice to have some in my bag for "emergencies", such as when a restaurant tells us at the end of a nice dinner out that they don't have any more decaf...)<br /><br />Try both the caffeinated and the decaf -- I'll bet you end up being incredibly glad you did, and I'll bet the two combined save you a lot of time, money and inconvenience.  Go for it!  :)

Since its a new product, Starbucks take notice: the 50pc half-filled non-descript recycled box packaging it comes in is really lame; It came crushed in the order. Moreover, the packets do not tear fully at the perforated line.<br /><br />Instead, try the VIA Colombia and VIA Mocha flavors. The packaging is the same but the flavor is rich and smooth and tastes brewed.

review/summary: I also received nearly-expired product
review/text: I should start by saying I love the Starbux Via coffees - they really are good "emergency" coffee.  I normally brew my own espresso every day, but I use the Via packs when I don't have time for that and need to hit the road with my caffeine fix.  I rated this product 1 star because like other reviewers, I too received a 50-ct box of nearly expired product.  When you buy this stuff in the store it has roughly a one year shelf life.  The box I was sent expires in two months.  A box of 50 is like a one year supply for me.  If I had known they are selling these boxes at such a good price because they are about to expire, I would have passed on this "bargain".  But if you plan to drink them all in a month or two, it is a good buy.

review/summary: Expiration dates - sometimes chewing gum stick consistency
review/text: I have some experience with expired Via coffee.  Occasionally (not often) coffee inside turns into a solid but bendable flat stick inside the package so I would not say the date doesn't matter!  In one case, because it was expired, Starbucks wouldn't replace it and said they'd seen it before.  I love the coffee but beware that sometimes this does happen.  Not sure why, possibly pinhole in packaging?<br /><br />update 10/16/2-12  video showing another "chewing gum stick consistency" Via found in not yet expired date.  I'd open it to show but then I couldn't return.

If you are a fast and furious VIA drinker this would not be a problem, but I only drink them at work, etc etc. I actually find a whole packet to be too strong; I prefer to use half a packet per cup, which is cheaper of course, and allows you to justify the occasional splurge on the "real thing".

review/summary: Terrible customer service
review/text: I purchased this through Amazon and it was shipped from Starbucks.com.<br />I received the order promptly, however when I opened the shipping box, I found the product box with a round blue sticker over the broken seal that keep the product box sealed. Inside, there was coffee grounds all over the box and stuck to all the packets was this gritty stuff. There were 2 sleeves of VIA that were obviously opened and causing the mess in the box. Each of these packets also had a blue sticker! So it was pretty obvious that I was shipped a known defective product. When I called Starbucks, at first they wouldn't help me and treated me like they didn't ship this item (because I ordered thru Amazon) and would not replace this product. They said I would have to pay to ship it back to them and they would send a refund. I didn't want a refund, I just wanted the product replaced. They said that after I returned it, I would have to completely reorder and pay for the product. I called the customer service again and got the run-around. There customer service is awful. I guess they figure they can afford to lose a customer if they behave this way. That is why I am posting this review....<br />I would not recommend buying from Starbucks.

I suppose I would buy this again, but not before shopping around and trying a different decaf.

review/summary: As good as instant coffee gets!
review/text: I've always been disappointed by instant coffee. But things have changed with VIA. I picked up a 3 pack from the grocery store to test it out, cost me like $3 which is insane for instant coffee. $1 per serving compared to 10 cents with other brands. But, when i tried the Starbucks Via Columbia I had no regrets. Far superior then any instant. I'm not big on Starbucks, i have never ordered coffee from Starbucks. In fact, i'm shocked they got this far with the prices and silly names for sizes, etc. The entire experience going into a Starbucks makes me roll my eyes and leave everytime. But anyway, this instant coffee has great roasted taste and aroma. I'll def buy this in bulk from amazon. The 50 count for $29 breaks down to about 60 cents per cup, which the best way to go. You'd have to grind and brew at home to get this quality/price.

Maybe it has more a french press taste and experience than other instants that draws me to them, I don't know.  I do know that I will take these quick and easy to use instant packs over the cafeteria coffee any day.  Before folks get all on me about my contradictions, it's a personal taste thing.  I love apples, too, and eat tons of them, but hate applesauce.  The same goes with these things...I hate liking them, but I do.

I tried the Taster's Choice and regretted it. The Taster's Choice is half the price but you need at least 3 TC's packs to equal 1 VIA and it's still not that good. Spend the extra couple of dollars on Starbucks. You know it's worth it.

So, when I took that first delicious sip of Starbucks Instant Italian Roast Coffee...it hit the Starbucks-craving spot. The flavor is so much better than any other instant coffee I've ever tasted. Here's the thing--it's still instant coffee. But, it actually tastes almost exactly like regular brewed coffee. It's an expensive cup of heaven...I'll be saving mine for special occasions. Because, in West Africa, you have to savor the luxurious moments in-between mosquito attacks and power cuts.

I have used it on cruise ships when the coffee is terrible or at conferences for the same reason.  They usually have hot water for tea, so I just use one of these.<br /><br />One note of caution though, it is smooth but don't drink it too fast or else you will be seeing through walls.  Then again, sometimes seeing through walls could be kind of fun.  What I mean is that to me, it has more of a kick to it than regular coffee.

review/summary: SHAME ON AMAZON
review/text: Shame on Amazon for enhancing their financial facts (list price $50) on this product. First, Starbucks list this item for $35.95 so there is no $21.05 savings. Next, add in the shipping cost and your saving is further erroded. The bottomline is that Amazon is not rewarding you with a 42% saving....With that said, I love brewed coffee and drink my coffee black. For an instant coffee VIA brand is probably one of the best on the market. The Italian Roast is labeled "extra bold" by Starbucks and indeed it is. This is not a very smooth coffee and has a robust taste. If you like a medium taste (ex. Colombia) you might want to give thought before buying the Italian Roast. Even though the Columbian is medium this coffee still has a rich flavor. An if you prefer a strong coffee (as I do) this is not the one. Last thing for those who drink brewed coffee (and especially black coffee) every morning. The VIA is NOT a substitute brand for your every morning coffee. This is fine as an emergency when freshly brewed coffee is not possible. Oh yes, I have purchased the VIA direct from Starbucks and the grocery store, the "use by" stamp on the coffee has been from four to eight months (grocery store). So, the shelf life the buyer sees depends on how long its been on the shelf of the seller and when you make the purchase. Would I purchase this product? Yes, but I would compare prices (at the grocery store-no shipping cost, Starbucks, etc.) before I purchase from Amazon.

review/summary: Made a believer of me
review/text: I'm coffee picky.  ok, snobby if you must know.<br />I wandered into a Starbucks one day and they were testing fresh brewed against their Via coffee.  I guessed wrong.  Which shocked me and converted me.<br />I know that it is not freeze dried coffee.  It is (in part) ground particles of the coffee bean.  It makes it taste absolutely fresh brewed.  I love the convenient little packages.  They make coffee on the run easier than you'd believe.<br />I order every month for my husband and me and have not bought whole coffee beans in over a year.

The shipping is resonibly fast and when it gets here I will have plenty of coffee to last me a while. Personally I drink 3-5 cups a day and this price is a great deal rather than Walmart 8 packets for 7 dollars or 50 packets for 28 dollars. Personally I think this price is a great deal. The seller has shipped my item about 30 min after I ordered it. It will be here very soon on free standard shipping.

review/summary: Via Colombia is fabulous coffee!
review/text: I used to be a fan of original brewed Starbucks, then got used to Pikes.  I developed a preference for Casi Cielo / French Pressed at home.  When Via came on the market, I was excited because I love Starbucks, but it's such a hassle to fit in the time to find an outlet/get there/ stand in line, etc when traveling.<br />And then came Via Columbia.  I have been transported to a heavenly world of flavor, instant availability even when traveling and a reasonable price besides!  Thank you, Starbucks, for this amazing and delightful coffee....far and away the most incredibly delicious thing I put in my mouth each day!

review/summary: Favorite Afternoon Instant Coffee
review/text: I have ordered Starbucks VIA Decaf several times and am always pleased.  Being a chocoholic, I combine it with a "low"-calorie instant cocoa to make myself a mocha.  (So I order decaf to "offset" the extra caffeine from the cocoa &lt;grin>.)<br /><br />While the product on the first shipment had an early (as in about 4-5 months) expiration date, that has not since been the case.  (The early expiration date didn't matter at the time since I went through the product within a couple of months.)  In fact, I have 8-9 months before the expiration date on the latest shipment, which is good because I stocked up on the caffeinated version when it went on "sale" at Costco before the holidays.<br /><br />An unexpected bonus in this latest shipment was a sample of Blonde Veranda Blend.  Cool!  (I don't have an automatic drip coffee maker so I need to dig out my Keurig filter basket to try the coffee.  But I'm looking forward to it.)

review/summary: This coffee has saved me more than once
review/text: Recently at work, we've been looking to cut costs and save money, and so the first thing to go was decent coffee.  The swill that they're serving now is an abomination to coffee, so I finally went out and bought a pack of these 50 Starbucks Via Italian Roast instant coffee.  Starbucks Via is pretty good, I mean, it's really good for instant coffee.  I am fortunate at work we have a hot-water maker thing that works well and gives you piping hot water, which dissolves this coffee dust in a matter of seconds... barely requiring a stir.<br /><br />THe coffee is strong and tastes similar to the Starbucks Italian Roast you might get from the store;  not the same, not as robust, not as "burnt" (something that I personally prefer), but still pretty damn good for instant coffee.<br /><br />Having irregular sleep patterns, this coffee has spared me the embarrassment of falling asleep in countless meetings.  It works, it tastes good, it holds cream well.  Only drawback is it leaves this muddy residue on the bottom of your cup.  But, that ain't all that bad.  It's not Sanka.

review/text: The Starbucks Via coffees are excellent, for any coffee, let alone instant.  Just great when you only want one cup, and a generous sized cup at that.  I've used a half-packet for a small cup. It's very rich and flavorful, there is not another instant like this.  My husband drinks strictly decaf, and it's usually a Starbucks Via Italian Roast.  During our recent relocation, living in a furnished apartment with an inferior coffee maker, we both used VIA for the duration.  The Amazon price is lowest I've found, but I'd pay full-price if necessary, it's worth it.

review/summary: Great Buy!
review/text: I was worried after reading some of the reviews saying the exp. date on this coffee was bad, but I ordered anyway because it's such a fantastic deal. When I got mine it says it doesn't expire for another year! I mean make sure when you order it's from Starbucks and I'd say your good. It's such a great buy and comes in a very nice pop open box thing that makes it simple to grab a ready brew in the mornings and pop it open and pour it into my hot water. I own a Keurig so I just make it brew hot water and then I use these, it's so much cheaper than k-cups and the taste is the same great Starbucks taste I get at their stores! The colombia blend is my favorite blend at Starbucks, it offers a nice bold flavor but it's not too strong and the finish is just fantastic, I recommend Baileys Caramel Creamer to add to your cup of coffee of Colombia, you will have to buy the creamer at your local grocery store though since it needs to be refrigerated. I can't say enough about how great of a buy this is, the only thing I would change is making it a Amazon Prime item, I am a Prime member and love the free 2 day shipping, but had to pay shipping on this since it wasn't prime, other than that, this is my new favorite must have here on Amazon!

review/summary: Refreshing alternative to Red Bull and Rockstar
review/text: I'm not a soda or coffee consumer, nor am I a fan of Red Bull or Rockstar, so I'm always on the lookout for viable sources of caffeine. At just 8 ounces per can, the new V8 Fusion Energy Drink might be my new go-to drink. With a mere 50 calories and 80mg of jitter-free caffeine, V8 Fusion is a convenient, low(er) calorie option to get you through the afternoon slump (or get you going in the morning). Here's a quick breakdown of the nutrient profile:<br /><br />Calories: 50<br />Total Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0g<br />Sodium: 50mg (2%)<br />Potassium: 170mg (5%)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 13g (4%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 0g<br />Sugars: 10g<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Water, Reconstructed Vegetable Juice Blend (Water and Juices of Sweet Potatoes, Yellow Tomatoes, Carrots, Yellow Carrots), Reconstituted Fruit Juices (Water and Concentrated Juices of Apples, Oranges, Peaches), Contains Less Than 2% of: Mango Puree, Natural Flavoring, Green Tea Extract (With Natural Caffeine from Green Tea), Citric Acid, Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Sucralose, Vitamin E, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B1 and Vitamin B12.<br /><br />As you can see, neither the Peach or Mango play a prominent role in the flavoring, which is quite evident upon the first sip. The predominant flavor I could taste was that of tomato and carrot, but the fruit blend was certainly present and added a refreshing sweetness to the beverage. I enjoyed the flavor combination, but I could see how some might find it less-than-pleasant, especially if expecting a strong Peach Mango flavor.<br /><br />The caffeine, not too high or low at 80mg, kicked in fairly quickly and sustained me throughout the afternoon, and I experienced no subsequent crash. Just a pleasant boost in alertness and focus, which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Overall, V8 Fusion Energy is a great alternative to soda, coffee, Red Bull and the plethora of high-octane energy drinks, offering convenience in a small 8oz can. The price might be a little bit too high to make it more economical than coffee or soda, but for the occasional energy boost, you can't miss with this drink!

review/summary: Neither too sweet nor fizzy
review/text: V8 V-Fusion may appear to be the typical energy drink that is available today, but the difference between V8 and drinks such as Red Bull, this drink contains vegetable and fruit and 50 calories.  This may be a nice alternative to carbonated sodas or sugary fruit juices because it contains nutritional ingredients that may provide a bit of energy for the day.  The drink contains fruity peach mango flavor, green tea, and vitamin B, but also a concentration of potatoes, yellow tomatoes, and carrots.<br /><br />With the natural energy that V8 V-Fusion provides, one may want to switch from the regular cup of coffee or fizzy pop that usually contains the energy for the day.  The taste is satisfying, not too sweet, fruity, acidic, or watery.  And after trying the 8 fl. Oz. Can, one may not be enough, however, the contents warn that it may not be recommended for children, women nursing or pregnant, or individuals watching their caffeine in take.  But one recommendation, chill the drink before serving.

review/summary: Great alternative to sodas and energy drinks
review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker, but am used to having a caffeine fix in the morning. Until recently I was used to having a Diet Coke each morning, but wasn't really thrilled about the chemicals that diet soda packs. I was already a fan of the V8 Fusion drinks, so when I found out about V-8's Fusion + Energy drinks, I was thrilled to have a better option available.<br /><br />Unlike the 100% juice V8 Fusion drinks, the V8 Fusion + Energy drinks combine the fruit and vegetable juices with green tea, so you get a hefty dose of caffeine in addition to a full serving of fruits and veggies (and the vitamins that come with it) in one 50-calorie serving. The green tea does alter the taste quite a lot from the non-caffeinated V8 Fusion drinks, but it's still pretty tasty, especially the Peach Mango flavor.<br /><br />One thing that's worth pointing out is that this little can has quite a bit more caffeine than a can of diet soda, so you may need to modify the amount of caffeine you take in later in the day. Most of the time, one can has all the caffeine I need for the day.<br /><br />These V8 Fusion + Energy drinks are a great tasting, and mostly healthy, alternative to diet sodas as well as the crazy chemical/stimulant concoctions like Red Bull and Monster. If you've got to have that caffeine fix, you might as well get some vitamins with it!

review/summary: Tastes like juice, works like soda
review/text: I've tried a few different energy drinks in the last couple of years, largely as part of the Amazon Vine program, and this is my new favorite.  Most energy drinks do a good job hitting my body with some caffeine and waking me up, but they generally have an unpleasant bitter chemical taste.  This drink does have a little of that bitterness if you're looking for it, but mostly it tastes like peach and mango, like it promises on the can.  I drank my free sample just before I left for work, after a rough night with very little sleep, and I was impressed that it tasted so much like regular fruit juice (if it helps, I left the can in the fridge overnight, so I don't know if the taste is as good at room temperature).  By about fifteen minutes into my hour-long commute, I felt fresh and energetic - not manic or jittery, just really awake.  I never had any kind of an energy crash, and I was able to keep up all day at work.<br /><br />The next time I buy an energy drink, it will be this brand.

The caffeine in this product is from Green Tea and is not too strong (less than a cup of coffee) which is nice.  Because of this product I stopped drinking coffee in the morning... I have two of these instead.  I get fruits, veggies, and caffeine, as well as the added B vitamins all in one shot. You can't beat it.  I have all of my friends hooked on this drink too!  If you drink Red Bull or other drinks for an energy boost, this is a healthy alternative.  I highly recommend this product. A+ :)

review/text: This is basically undrinkable. I like the other V8 Fusion canned flavors such as Strawberry Banana, Pomegranate Blueberry, and Concord Grape Raspberry very much, and drink them consistently, but this is just abysmal. It's hard to describe the taste though, it's sweet, yet it still makes me want to gag. You can taste the peach mango too. I think that the taste factor might have more to do with the fact that this is 50% juice and 50 calories, while the other flavors are 100% juice and about 120 calories. This diet/energy version is like a watered down nasty version of the original.

review/summary: Best Spaghetti EVER
review/text: My mom made this when I was a kid and I love it!!!  I won't eat spaghetti unless it's this exact kind.  When I make it, I use 2 boxes... Brown 1lb ground sirloin, add dehydrated onions to taste while meat is cooking, (remove any fat from beef)then add two cans of tomato sauce (and 1/2 can of water) and the seasoning mix from the boxes...the secret to the sauce is adding 1-2 tablespoons of butter and cooking it for 15-20 minutes on a low simmer...YUM!!!  EASY and a delicious dinner!

review/summary: The best packaged dinner.
review/text: This is my favorite packaged dinner. It is the most flavorful. Most packaged dinners or sides are bland or just salty. Tangy is in the name and describes the taste.

review/summary: Best spaghetti every made!
review/text: I have been eating this spaghetti for the past 30+ years. It is the best spaghetti I've ever had. My husband and kids are even hooked on it! It's been very difficult to find in stores recently so I called the Kraft company. They told me it was being discontinued due to low sales. So, everyone, please write to Kraft and ask them to keep it as an active product in their product line. Maybe, somehow, we can get them to change their minds.

review/text: This assisted "home made" sauce is much fresher and more tasty than premade sauces.  It has some "Zip" to it!

review/summary: Great spaghetti
review/text: This makes a spicy sauce without being hot.  Every other 'spicy' sauce I've tried has just been hot spicy.  I use one can of tomato sauce, one can of water, 1 lb of ground beef and let it simmer for 30 min to an hour.  I've not found any other sauce like it.  The grocery stores in some areas of the country don't carry the product which is why I have to order it online now.

review/summary: this is what i remember
review/text: i have had this memory of the smell and taste of the spaghetti i had as a kid. I made this added extra black pepper and WOW! it was the lost memory i had struggled to remember.  My husband and I have decided that a case or two is needed for our food storage since I think its better that a jar.

review/summary: My Childhood Favorite......
review/text: I also had this when I was a kid.  My mom made this and when I was about 11 I started making it for myself.  I have always like this spaghetti dinner.  My late husband was Italian and at first was skeptical of my spaghetti dinner, however he liked it after he tried it.  I am sure he probably liked his mom's homemade sauce the best but he always commented how great my spaghetti dinner was.  He never knew it was from a box dinner.<br /><br />I did mine a little different that the box directions being we had a family of six to feed.  I bought Kraft Spaghetti dinner for the sauce packet.  I would cook a pound of angel hair spaghetti and then brown hamburger, beef stirfry strips or stew meat that I added chopped onions and half of the seasoning packet.  Once it was cooked completely I would drain if needed and then added 3 small cans of tomato sauce (Hunt's) and one large can of diced tomatoes (drained) and the remainder of the seasoning packet.  I would also add about a half of cup of parmesan cheese (Kraft's) while sauce was heating.  Adding the tomatoes to the sauce made it a little thicker and chunkier and made the flavor packet not so strong.  Anyone that tried my spaghetti like this had no idea that it was a boxed spaghetti dinner.<br /><br />I have not made this in a very long time and this is making me miss it even more.  I think there are people who do not like this sauce because alot of Italian sauces have sugar in them which make them a little sweeter than this Kraft Spaghetti sauce.  However by adding the beef strips with onions and tomatoes it does tame the strong spices of using it alone in just tomato sauce.  I also just use about a half a packet when I am using only tomato sauce.  Of course however we make it we always sprinkle Kraft parmesan cheese on our dinner and have garlic bread.  This is my kid's favorite dinner I have ever made for them.<br /><br />I hope my kids can make it for their kids and so on one day.  I am glad to find that I can buy it at Amazon.com.  I will relay that on to my daughter that is in college.  Although, she will probably want me to buy it and supply her with her weekly supply.  Oh well, good memories are wonderful.<br /><br />Enjoy......I hope you try the Kraft Spaghetti dinner my way mentioned above and like it.  It gives a variety of ways to make this childhood favorite.

review/summary: Favorite Spaghetti
review/text: Have eaten this spaghetti since I was 10 years old (just about 50 years ago now).  Really, really hard to find. I even e-mailed 'Kraft' which I never received a response.  Friend told me to try 'Amazon'.  I got so excited that I could get it through them.  I just ordered a case of it and the Chicken Noodle which I have not seen in years either.<br />My Mom used to make this spaghetti soupy using tomato sauce instead of the paste along with some water.  I still make it the same way.  I don't add the butter since it is on the soupy side - but the tangy ingridients make the spaghetti and I will even add some hot sauce.  Sometimes I add hambuger.  My favorite is just soupy type spaghetti.  My brother does not like Italian food - but he will eat this. Thank you for carrying it Amazon!

review/summary: Meh
review/text: Don't get me wrong, it's good, I just prefer my homemade spaghetti. It's messy as all get out to make, but, totally worth it. Any homemade is, really...I just love homemade spaghetti, sue me.<br /><br />But I realize, not everyone knows how to cook, or has the time, or just doesn't feel like it (& doesn't have an Italian mama around ;). In those cases, you should totally buy this. It's definitely good for those spaghetti-craving nights I seem to have far too frequently.
