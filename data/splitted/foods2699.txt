review/summary: OK
review/text: I bought this mostly for use in breakfast smoothies.  The first time using it, I added 3 tablespoons to a mixed berry smoothie (smoothie recipe on the bag calls for 3 TBS), and it was awful.  It left a terrible after-taste that lingered for hours.  Maybe it's better with bananas and apples, as in the recipe on the bag, than berries.  Next time, I added only 1 TBS and it tasted fine and then increased to 2 TBS, which works too.  It's a good additive to homemade breads. I've put the remaining 3 bags of the 4-pack in the freezer because it'll take a while to use it all.  I like that it's free of artificial additives that so many protein powders have.  Acceptable product, good price.

review/summary: Bob's Soy Protein Powder
review/text: I count on this to get enough protein, since I'm a vegan.  For protein, I eat nuts, beans, nutritional yeast, but I get about 50 grams of protein from the soy powder.  I mix it with soymilk for morning cereal, and with berries for dessert...tastes lovely and creamy, but mix well to avoid powder lumps!  Being fond of sweet tastes, I add Stevia, which is an acquired taste.  Since soy is all protein, and Stevia sweeter than sugar, it helps keep calories down.

review/summary: Smooth, Dissovles with a spoon
review/text: Purchased directly from Amazon. I'm glad I tried the Bob's Red Mill Isolated Soy Protein Powder. Unlike some other reviewers, I had no trouble mixing the powder into an 8oz glass of lactose-free milk. I've used both a spoon and a little battery-powered mini-mixer. The mini-mixer does seem to get it completely smooth faster (spoon is 15 seconds, mixer 5 seconds). I bought one for under ten bucks here on Amazon.<br /><br />When mixed with milk or water it tastes just like fresh, unsweetened soymilk. Neat. But for my tastes, I prefer adding a tablespoon of honey or molasses.<br /><br />Since I'm lactose-intolerant, I can't handle the Whey protein powders. I like that this soy protein powder is nice and simple: pure Isolated soy protein. 20 calories per Tablespoon. No chemical additives.<br /><br />Overall, the texture is pretty smooth. Some have said it's gritty, but I disagree. If you've had Odwalla protein shakes or Jamba Juice smoothies with a protein boost, it's exactly like that as far as texture goes.<br /><br />I know some people who can't eat/drink soy because it causes a bunch of gas, etc, but if you've been able to drink soymilk or eat tofu, you'll probably be okay with this product. Hope that helps!

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: I'm no meat-head but I enjoy a good protein shake after I workout.  I usually jump from ON or whatever Costco has to save on costs but I've decided this is in the best interest of my health and spare no costs.  I have high cholesterol (genetics) and so wanted something that was low on cholesterol and natural.  I found this doing a quick search and I'm in love with the product.  However, there is a caveat.  You can not manually mix this!!  Unless you have a whisk or something, but physically impossible.  Those of you who enjoy using those shaker things, forget it about it.  You need a blender or a magic bullet (my preference) to mix this stuff.  I love the way it tastes since I love soy flavor.  Don't need to add any additives for me.  Just mix it with low fat milk or water and I have a good healthy protein shake.  One last thing I like about this is because it actually fills me up.  Other protein shakes feel like water but this is a hearty meal for me.  I can miss about two meals with light snacks with this shake, but I don't do that since I enjoying eating.  My GF really likes Genisoy products but I'm sold on this and will buy the bigger bag next time.

review/summary: it meets their claims, good value
review/text: The package suggests apple and banana together. I think the idea is that the pulp from the apple will get your mind off of the typical protein powder texture, but I found I like double the banana and no apple instead.<br /><br />Some have complained about clumping. That's to be expected for protein powder; especially if they don't add things you don't want in your food. We have a Hamilton Beach hand blender that does a great job mixing it so there are no clumps.  It's great for making smoothies, etc.  The stem detaches for easy cleaning.  A great gadget that will really help here.<br /><br />It's a good value and they don't add things you don't want in your food.

I have been following a low-carb diet for several years and added some new recipes recently asking for Soy Protein which is very difficult to find and when I did, was paying a lot for a small packet.  This was a wonderful find for me.  The packaging is convenient and the product is excellent.  Great value for money and I know it's good, cos it's under the Bob's Red Mill label.

It has a wonderful flavor, not vanilla, just plain, but it still makes things taste great, and has alot of nututional value. This pack of 4 will last us 3 months or more. Compared to spending at least $10, to $15, at the health food store, for a container, it is much more cost effective to purchase Red Mill. Love this company!!!!

review/summary: Chalky if you use too much
review/text: It does what you expect.  If you add it to something, you will increase the protein content.  It has a flavor, like chalk.  And the powder is sticky in things like smoothies, so you have to use the correct ratio of powder to liquid or you will feel like you are drinking liquified classroom chalk.  I bet it will go great in a homemade cake or bread.  You could easily add 3 or 4 grams of protein per serving without changing the flavor much.

review/text: I am a runner and mix this with orange juice after a run.  It mixes in easily and the taste is very similar to an expensive soy protein mixture that I used previously.  Before using soy protein, I mixed whey powder into my orange juice, but switched to soy protein because it has a much higher percentage of arginine.  The soy protein actually stirs in more easily than does whey powder.  The taste and texture is very different than whey powder, but I like both.

review/summary: Great for athletes
review/text: Great product.  Helps tremendously in athletics.  I notice I have more energy and can play harder for longer durations when eating hemp seeds regularly.  They also fill me up so that I don't need to eat a big meal for lunch if I've had them for breakfast.  I typically cut up half a banana, take 2 Tbsp of raw, unpasteurized yogurt and 3 - 4 Tbsp of hemp seed and mix together.  Homemade banana yogurt with hemp seeds....great breakfast.

review/summary: I must have received a bad batch
review/text: I have purchased hemp seeds many times, and count them as a large part of my diet. I typically purchase the Manitoba Harvest brand, but the price on the 5 pound bag with Subscribe & Save was unbeatable. The hemp seeds I received looked and smelled normal, but sent my GI tract into a nightmare. I thought it was a fluke, and had nothing to do with the hemp seeds, so I ate them again a few days later, when I was feeling better. Within 30 minutes of eating, I was vomiting profusely, with terrible stomach pain. I wonder perhaps if there was some ecoli (or similar) bacteria on the seeds. I tossed the rest of the $50 bag. I won't buy Nutiva brand again.

review/summary: Great Expectations not Realized
review/text: I had great expectations when I purchased these hemp hearts as someone at our local health food store was very enthusiastic about its ability to cut appetite and thus worked for weight loss and control  I found it pleasent to eat, tastes fine and texture is appealing although the seeds get caught in my teeth and under my gums so I need to brush, rinse and floss quickly after eating it.  I was surprise to read the fat content at 45 percent so I am only eating it with breakfast.  I don't think this is any miracle food supplement and probably will not buy again unless something changes with my experience.  I've used it for a month now with no noteable impact.

review/summary: Good Milk Subsitiute
review/text: Plenty of time to use before exp. date.(close to a year give or take) The flavor is very mild and won't throw off the taste of your recipe's.<br /><br /> I usually keep it in the freezer to keep it fresh. Follow storage insturctions on package. It will start to get an strong flavor as it starts to go bad. (just like flax or any other perishable food) I noticed that once when leaving some in the frige too long. (a couple of months)<br /><br />Mostly I use it for a subsitiute for milk. Just add water and/or other ingredients and blend. Great for drinking, cooking, and making "milk shakes". Or you could just use it as a sprinkle on your salads.

review/text: Hello,  I started to eat a little healthier, so I have to buy hemp seeds.  I am a Nutiva's consumer for 2 years now (coconut oil), so I know their product quality, and I wouldn't buy any other brand than Nutiva. I used few times a day: in my morning protein shake, with plain yogurt and in my strawberry smoothie. I need to loose weight, but I am not in a diet yet, but I lost 7LBS in 2.5 weeks. Like I said, I am not in a diet. I am not exercising, so I believe is the hemp seeds.<br /><br />For those of you who are trying to loose weight, I highly recommend you to buy the Hood� Calorie Countdown Fat Free Dairy Beverage. It only has 35 calories x serving, and  it has all vitamins and everything else than milk.  Google it.

This food is so delicious that you could use it by itself and be happy with your choice. I recommend for people who do not know this food to give it a try.

review/summary: Bad taste and burn
review/text: I've had hemp seeds before, purchased at my local natural foods market (navitas brand, I believe) and enjoyed it very much.  In contrast, Nutiva in the 5 lb bag, was disappointing to say the least.  Poor taste, plus a horrible burn all the way down my throat.  I'm not allergic to hemp, in fact consume hemp milk every day, so this was quite a surprise.  Unfortunately I did not keep the packaging, since I had immediately transferred the seeds to glass containers to prepare for freezing.  These seeds are going in the compost bin (hope it doesn't burn the worms!)

review/text: I have enjoyed Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed for three years.  But I just received a three pound bag that was puffed up with air.  When I opened it up, it still smelled like hemp seed so I took a bite and swallowed it.  Not only did it taste bitter, but it burned my throat!  Amazon is refunding my money and I am going to try a different brand of hemp seed.  I suspect improper packaging or storage which is a shame because Nutiva's product is really good when it is fresh.

review/text: I ordered this product based on good reviews like 2 months ago and i really loved it and I ordered another 3 pound bag a month later, the second bag was just not right, I thought i must be a bad batch or something because it had more green shells in it and the seeds looked more brownish, it had this bitter burning taste. I called amazon and they said they would send me another ( i really did not wanna give up on it so i wanted to try another), same thing. I called again and they said they would send me another just to make sure that it was not a fluke. I got the bag 2 days ago and the same thing :(  finally i gave up on it. I will look in to another brand. I am really curious if other people are having the same issue..

review/summary: Maybe not for everyone
review/text: I put a heaping teaspoon of this product on my usual cereal (Nature's Path Heritage) and skim milk -- got really bad diarrhea for the next two days.<br /><br />I also tried the Nutiva's chocolate HempShake and I loved the taste of that -- I added about 8 oz of skim milk.  Seemed agreeable for two days, then on the third day the combination gave me several hours of rotten-egg flatulence like I have never experienced in my life.  Again, I had skim milk and hemp together in combination.<br /><br />Too early to say it's the hemp, might be the combination -- maybe hemp creates a digestive environment where the milk is indigestible. Usually I can eat just about anything so I was very surprised.  I'll give it another try someday...<br /><br />If anyone has any insight, please feel free to comment.

review/text: This product sounded so great. I started taking about two to four tbls. a day. After a week my lips started swelling, then the inside of my mouth started feeling strange and my tongue was very sensitive, then I started having what I thought was heartburn (which i never get) I would feel pressure in my thoart all the way down to my Solar plexis, By the end of the second week it became so intense I knew something was wrong with me, I just didn't know what. I thought "I"m having an allergic reaction"(I'm not allergic to anything) so it took me awhile to catch on, the only new thing I added to my diet was the hemp hearts. I quite taking them, in one day  I started feeling better, by two days, started feeling normal again.<br />So just be careful, people can have an allergic reaction to this.

review/summary: Wound up at the ER
review/text: I won't go all the way to 1-star since this is probably more about me and not the foodstuff but, despite the claim that hemp seeds are not known to contain allergens, I did experience *some kind* of reaction to 4 tbsp of this stuff this past Monday, about 4 hours after ingesting it. I passed out, was shaking uncontrollably when I came to, felt tingling followed by a loss of sensation, nausea, pain, and shortness of breath. I realize correlation does not prove causation, but the health professionals whom I've consulted so far (which includes my primary) agree that there's a strong possibility that the episode was caused by something in the hemp seed, especially since I do not have a history of these kinds of incidents. I'm going for tests anyhow, and if it turns out that the hemp seed was not implicated, I'll update my review.<br /><br />Still, the moral of the story is, try just a little bit of this and any novel food or remedy before you take a full serving of it, lest you wind up at the ER like I did.

Just a question that should be raised since companies are in the habit of caring about their bottom lines over our bodies.

review/text: I really enjoy the hemp hearts. I have come to crave them. I am always looking for a good deal and this is indeed a great price for the qty. These come to abt 3 to 5 dollars less per lb. than what I can get locally. If I use auto ship it is 5 to 7 dollars less. My only complaint is the hulls of the 3 brands I have tried this has by far the most hulls and the only one with intact seeds. I doesn't take much to de-hull them but, it is time consuming. I realize "hulls are a good source of fiber" but, my teeth do not agree. I am tempted to pay a little more for less. If this is something that doesn't bother you I urge you to get it.

review/text: Sometimes health discoveries, (wonders), are simply amazing.  Hemp seeds are helping me turn my health around because I'm nurturing my cells.  How I know is because I don't crave or binge on junk food and sugars like before, as well as "diet" products, and I no longer feel like I'm starving. This became forefront to looking for real food, other nutrition<br />"secrets" and, basically, gave me motivation to come out of a slump I was<br />in while not looking after my health like I should have been.  A good friend threw me this life-line which I gladly pass on.  Amazon.com had the best price with the free shipping so I'm sticking with good people, and powerful nutrition.  My overall health is only getting better day by day, and a good outlook itself becomes good medicine.  Do the research, you'll be amazed.  Lucky you for discovering hemp seeds.  A. prouty

review/summary: Essential!
review/text: We have been eating hempseeds for sometime - they are an essential part of our diet.  I genuinely notice a difference physically when I eat them along.  This is a good price and we have gotten good quality from Amazon.  PLEASE SHARE SOME WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!<br /><br />We must work together to make this available to the USA INCLUDING the farmers.  We live under an oppressive, authoritarian regime which, only a few years ago, would have attacked you for eating what is literally "birdseed".  Wild!<br /><br />2nd Review w/Suspcription Purchase Method<br />We have been delighted to have hemp seed finally taken off Schedule 1 Controlled Substance (along with heroin, etc.).  I know that is insane to even write this but that is the nature of the degenerate and immoral drug policy barons from the DEA and ONDCP - to twist reality and prohibit what are supposed to be free American citizens from obtaining some of the best food known to mankind beause their pseudo fear of people smoking flowers(and then engaging in violence against these same peaceful, free human beings).  NUTS indeed!!<br /><br />In any event, we have started using the suscription method.  This is a great price compared to anywhere else that I have found.  It actually takes 4 mos for us to go through 5 lbs.  Therefore, I signed up for 2 mos and simply skip one.  I will give very great KUDOS to Amazon for how they have set this up - at least for this product, both the product and the system work great!<br /><br />Greg Logan

review/summary: Inconsistent at best - too many hulls
review/text: I enjoy hempseed, primarily I sprinkle it over my salads to add a nutty and nutritious component.<br />I like buying this in bulk because it saves money over the expensive 1 pound or half-pound  bags I can get at the store.<br />My complaint about this product is that you never know what you'll get. Sometimes it's fairly free of hulls (seed coats) and sometime it's just full of them<br />And they're hard to deal with - very hard pieces of shells that interfere with the enjoyment of whatever you are eating.<br />I guess you could spend time separating the pieces out, but that is a labor-intensive process and at that point it becomes more economical (time is money) to buy the 1 pound or half-pound bag at the store from a company that pays more attention to what they are packaging.<br />I kust got a new shipment and it is absolutely full of seed coat fragments.<br />Grrrrr....

review/summary: Tasty and healthy
review/text: This is a great product, very tasty and at the same time having all kinds of good natural nutrients. I buy it on "Subscribe and Save" program, getting 5 lb. every six months and enjoying sizeable discounts. It makes up a part of my regular lunch consisting of an apple, a banana, and a mixture of sunflower, pumpkin, and hemp seeds (1/4 of cup each). The apple a day definitely keeps a doctor away (to my delight), and the seeds provide a close to perfect combination of "right" protein and fatty acids. Pumpkin seeds also keep my prostate healthy, which is important in my age. Hemp seeds give the mixture the additional taste and flavor.

review/text: We love the taste & texture of these seeds.  I put several tablespoons in our salads & my husband has started scraping out his salad bowl with a spoon!  Perhaps the people who did not care for this product are simply not used to the somewhat different taste of raw nuts & seeds, compared to roasted?

Delicious/nutritious way to start the day....and sustaining energy!  Years ago, i started buying hempseeds by one pound amounts from a bulk section and realized the air exposure may not be good to the product, so i found these 3# bags online....i get them auto-shipped and can be sure i never run out.  They arrive fresh every time....in addition, this is helping support the Hemp industry in general....by buying food, clothing, personal care products made from Hemp, we are voting!

review/summary: Nutritional delight
review/text: I've purchased Nutiva hemp seed many times over the last year, and so far it has been delivered fresh and good tasting. Be aware that it turns rancid quickly and needs refrigeration. I use it to make hemp seed milk. I find this to be the most efficent and effective use of the product. I blend 1 cup of hemp seed, 3 cups of distilled  water, a small amount of kelp powder, and 3 pitted medjool dates, that have been soaked overnight, in my Blendtec blender. I then strain it through a nut milk bag. The blending is so complete that the only thing left in the bag are a few hard shells left over from Nutiva's mechanical processing and small amount of fiber. The Nutiva processing is pure mechanical and kept under 104 degrees F. They then store it under 40 degrees F. The plastic shipping bag is vacuum sealed. Hemp seed is a nutritionally complete food. It has all of the essential amino and fatty acids. 3 tbsp. supply 11g of protein. In order to keep it fresh I store it in a plastic tub in my freezer.

review/summary: New to eating hempseeds
review/text: After reading about all the health benefits of hempseeds, I went ahead and bought this 5-pound bag of them even though I've never eaten them before (coming from an islander culture, I was always taught to learn about and respect the healing qualities of various foods). Another reviewer here said that these hempseeds taste like raw pine nuts, and I would agree with that. Nutiva's hempseeds are delicious; they taste fresh, and I love their texture: they're soft like pine nuts, small like quinoa or couscous, and mild in flavour with a tiny bit of sweetness. As I type this review, I'm eating them with a spoon; it's good to eat even by itself. I'm very glad I got the 5-pound bag (with repeat delivery every three months), because I will happily incorporate hempseeds into my daily eating habits. I want to pour this over all my meals now; I may finish this big bag before month's end. If you're even a little bit curious if hempseeds are right for you, I'd recommend getting some and trying them out -- you may discover another superfood that you actually like. If not, then at least you had the experience of tasting something different.

review/text: has anyone else noticed a rancid smell with these? they are also slightly green in color (the white parts are white, but the black shells also have a green counterpart.) I don't know if this is normal. I keep a small amount in the fridge for several weeks use, in a mason jar, the rest in the freezer. I usually mix them in smoothies, and didn't try them alone until just now for the purpose of this review. The taste is nutty, I don't detect any rancid taste... just the smell that makes me inclined to stop using them. I read that hemp seeds go rancid like an hour after being hulled.

review/text: I have been eating Hemp Seed Hearts for breakfast since Aug. 15, 2011. I love them!! I've lost 15 pounds because my appetite is significantly reduced and my energy level is great. I eat a big salad in the morning with 2oz. Hemp Seeds, with plain yogurt and Mrs. Dash spices. Since August, I've not had a salad in the AM about 6 times. After a weekend of eating like a 'normal person', I can't wait until I can go back to eating my salad for breakfast. My acid reflux is GONE, I'm no longer bloated and gassy. Hemp Seeds are full of nutrition and I plan to eat them for the rest of my life (I'm 52).

The first time I became very nauseous and I did not connect it to the Hemp Seeds.  The next time I sprinkled it on my salad.  Approximately two hours later I got horrible stomach cramps and uncontrollable vomiting.  It was so awful!  I was in pain the whole night.  I was afraid to eat anything the next day.  I just had Gatorade and a banana.  I don't think I could ever try Hemp Seeds again.  I don't know if this was a bad batch or if they share equipment with a wheat facility. I will never buy this again.

I was buying the trader joes hemp powder protein mix but when I found this I switched.  This has more protein, less sugar, less calories and less fiber, it was a no brainer.  More expensive but worth it.  Its great to mix in any smoothie for a little more protein.  Hemp is the best possible protein you can get.  I recently started to make hemp milk with this and its great.  The recipe is simple: 4 cups of filtered waters, 3/4 of cups of the hemp seeds, put into a highpowered blender until white and creamy.  Its delicious!

review/text: I absolutely love these hemp seeds. They come vacuum-sealed and I just transfer them to a large freezer bag when I open them, and store them in the freezer.<br /><br />Hemp seeds are a perfect protein, supplying your body with all the essential amino acids. In just 3 tablespoons of these seeds, you're getting 11 grams of protein! They are also super high in other minerals and vitamins, as well as omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />We sprinkle these on just about anything - oatmeal, yogurt, pizza, you name it. I mix them in with all types of food for my now 15 month old son. They are SO good for babies and young children with all the omega-3 fatty acids, protein, minerals.<br /><br />I subscribe to this item and only pay $50 with free shipping - can't beat the price for such a healthy item.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I really enjoy these hemp seeds on salads.  They have a slightly nutty flavor, so it is a perfect compliment to a crisp, dark green salad.  One word of warning, though, toss the salad well, and sprinkle the seeds on after you put your dressing on your salad.  The reason is because I once put them on my salad before the dressing and I ate a large cluster of seeds in one bite, and they got caught in my throat.  I coughed a bit and was fine, but it was something that could've been avoided.<br /><br />I highly recommend these little seeds as a dietary supplement for the omega-3's and 6's.  NEVER, EVER heat them or cook with them, or they will lose their nutritional value completely.  No hyperbole, just fact.
