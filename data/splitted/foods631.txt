review/summary: Pretty watery
review/text: I normally drink coffee in my keurig but I tried these for something different. They tasted almost like the weak hot chocolate you get out at an amusement park from a machine or something. I would not recommend them. I have a machine that lets you pick what size cup you want, small or medium and even on the small the hot chocolate is watery.

review/summary: Tastes like diet chocolate water
review/text: I am a hot chocolate freak.  I was very anxious to try the varieties of hot chocolate with my new Keurig.  This cocoa was my first purchase.  It was so terrible I almost brought it back.  First, it took half the box to get the plastic taste out of the drink. A Keurig issue.  That last half of the box didn't redeem itself.  This cocoa tastes like flavored water, flavored with diet sugar.  It has the same aftertaste you would get with a diet soda or a sugar-free yogurt.  Also, you can't get more than 8 oz per cup. If you do, the taste just gets more watered down. A huge disappointment.  I will be trying other brands but my expectations are very low based on this first experience.<br /><br />I read a few reviews and learned that this product contains sucralose.  It is not listed as an ingredient.  Explains the diet taste plus I don't trust manufacturers who pull stunts like this.  The manufacturer is Green Mountain Coffee - very disappointing.

review/summary: Will never buy again
review/text: This is probably one of the worst hot chocolate brands I have ever purchased.  It is one of those things that has a "something is wrong but I'm not exactly sure what" kind of taste.  In some ways the flavor is like chocolate water.  In others it is more like carob. It just tastes fake.  I will not ever purchase this brand again.

review/text: I'm not an avid coffee drinker, so when I bought my Keurig I really had my eye on the other drink types (teas, cocoas, hot cider.)  These was the first hot chocolate k cup, and I'm sorry to say that I don't like them at all.  The drink is watery, and has a strange after taste.  I hope one of the other hot chocolate k cups are better than this.

review/text: I don't drink coffee but our office got a keurig machine so I thought I would try these.  The word that comes to mind is "meh".  It's not horrible, it's not the worst thing I've ever tasted, but it's really not that great either.  For as expensive as it is it should rival Starbucks.  I was really hoping for some wonderful tasting hot cocoas to try with this new machine but so far no such luck.  I'm just going to buy some packets of hot cocoa at the grocery store and use the hot water function of the machine. It will be cheaper and taste much better.

review/summary: Worst hot cocoa ever
review/text: Thankfully this came in a variety pack, so I only had one.  But god, was it nasty.  I'd already been told by a family member not to go with the "large" setting on my Keurig, as it could make cocoa taste watery.  So I dutifully chose "medium," and oh, how I wish watery were the problem.  It had such a horrible bitter taste that I at first thought my water had somehow been contaminated.  After reading other reviews here, I realize that it must be the sucralose.  I consider it not only very misleading advertisting for each cup not to be labeled as "diet" in some way, but sucralose also happens to be my least favorite of the major artificial sweeteners.  I don't know what the calorie count on these things would be, but if it happens to be low then I'd recommend trying this only if you're dieting and really desperate.  For people wanting a normal hot cocoa taste, avoid at all costs.

review/summary: Does not taste like Hot Chocolate
review/text: This product is very bland. I got it because my kids love hot chocolate, and usually they use my keurig just for hot water to mix their own hot chocolate. They were so excited to get this, but they didn't even drink their first cup of it because it has almost no chocolate flavor. I had to mix chocolate syrup in with it to give it any kind of flavor at all.

review/summary: Yuck, and needs better advitising for the sucrolose ingredient
review/text: I got a bunch of these from a friend and wondered about the bad after taste. It wasn't like products completely flavored with Splenda (sucrolose) but it still a slight strange taste (I describe it as slimy) and left that after taste in my mouth. On the k-cup it self, it doesn't say it has artificial sweeteners or is diet, so I came to the internet and it is almost impossible to find the ingredients listed any where. The reviews were the confirmation at first. Too much Splenda makes me sick to my stomach so I know it is not good for me. Too much is more than a few tastes. Oh well, I guess I'll try the Grove Square or Swiss Mix as those are the only others I can find.<br /><br />I find the taste of this product unappealing and the after taste sickening.

Not watered down and not too sweet.  It's not gourmet but this winter, when you want a quick cup of hot cocoa after shoveling snow or playing outside, this will do nicely.

review/summary: To each his own; I'm okay with it.
review/text: Back when I made my first cup (last year), it was indeed watery.  I thought how it would be nice if so much chocolate wasn't left in the k-cup after brewing (yes, I removed the foil, to recycle the cup).  I decided to shake the cup before inserting into the Keurig, and I'll remove it and re-insert after twisting it 180�, giving it another hole to brew from, which DOES help.  I prefer the taste of this to Swiss Miss or Nestle for sure.  I also add Vanilla or Irish Creme powdered CoffeeMate creamer which thickens it up a bit, or will add some Bailey's or Amaretto after shovelling show.  I like the Dark Chocolate version as well.

We love having it around so we can give the kids hot chocolate, or just curl up as the weather gets cooler and make a cup ourselves.  It's chocolatey but if it tastes too watered down like some suggest, then just set your settings to a smaller cup size.<br /><br />For us, it's just right!  Creamy, chocolatey, warm and delicious!  Give it a try if you like K-cups and hot chocolate!  Why not?  There are great k-cups coming up for the winter months, and this one is definitely going to stay stocked throughout the winter.  YUM!

The chocolate was stuck to the top of the paper they are wrapped in. . They were still edible, but didn't quite taste the same, the chocolate was gooey instead of solid, even days later when stored at room temperature. They really disappointed me :( So I am hoping the next case I purchase will be fresh, as I am ordering in October a cooler month, and hoping it was ruined in delivery and not the sellers storage.

review/text: Thought that I was getting a gr8 deal when i ordered the 2000 pack for $44 from amazon...the order arrived in time and in good condition but while visiting a nearby costco in the following week of receiving the order, saw that the 1000 pack box was on regular price for $19 each....plus they have $3 - $5 coupons from time to time which could have brought it down to $16 - $17 per 1000 pack.

review/summary: careful about bulk packs like this
review/text: We've used Splenda and Kirkland brand sucralose packets. either product is very good for what it is, a no-calorie sweetener for hot or cold drinks, desserts, and breakfast cereal.<br />For convenience, rather than the best price, I purchased this 2000-packet box of real Splenda-brand from Amazon. After using the product for a few days, i noticed my wife replaced her normal morning ice coffee with diet soda. She couldn't stand the Splenda, it was giving her a dry mouth and bad taste. i had noticed something a little "off" but just dismissed it as my imagination. Later i tried a sample straight from the envelope, it had a very acrid taste and seemed to burn -- it certainly wasn't SWEET. i then did a blind taste test using a new, small box that i bought from a local grocery store. night and day difference.  in summary, i think i got either an old/expired box (there's no obvious expiration date on the box), or the product might have soaked up an odor/taste from something during transit.

review/summary: Great sugar substitute
review/text: I and my wife use this product more than 15 years and totally satisfied with it. Before this product i use Sugar Free,Sweet n Law,Equal but the test is not like splenda. There are bitter test in Equal and other product. I am 58 Years Old and with weight and blood Pressure.<br />I like this feature from Splenda:<br />They are a great way to sweeten beverages and can be sprinkled on cereal, fresh fruit, and more.<br /><br />Each packet of Splenda provides the same sweetness as two teaspoons of sugar.<br />Each packet has less than 1 gram of carbohydrate and less than 5 calories, which meets FDA's standards for no-calorie foods.<br />24 packets of Splenda provide the same sweetness as one cup of sugar.

review/summary: Forget sugar and aspartame!
review/text: Splenda is the way to go and buying it in bulk like this saves a lot of money. The cost really racks up when you get at the grocery store.<br /><br />I've ordered this a few times and will order it again when I need a refill<br /><br />If you're going to buy this do NOT purchase it if it's being sold by "segouna." After over charging for shipping, she takes a week to email that it was shipped. But she hasn't actually shipped it [but you don't know this]. So you wait and wait and email and email. She only responds to email sent through Amazon.com, never to email sent through your personal email. Then a few weeks later she claims she can't find any tracking information on the original package. A few days after that she finally sends you your purchase, but only if you threaten to report her to Amazon.

review/text: As I reported to Amazon previously the packaging was terrible. alot of loose sugar inside the box. When I opened the shipping carton My wife and I noticed the original Splenda box was not properly sealed. The Splenda box was literally unsealed and open. It made us leary to think that someone might have tampered with the shipment. As of today no harm has come. The sugar is the same. The quantity is wonderful. The price well I've seen it for less.

review/text: when i turned 30 i cut sugar out of my diet purely as a health maintenance measure.  now in my 40's my blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol and blood sugar continue to be healthy for my age and height, despite being inactive.  so something has got to change if you want to stay healthy - lifestyle or diet, but preferable both if you can manage it.  i use about 20 Splenda packets per day in my beverages.  I have tried all other sweeteners for at least a week each, and while I'd like to support Stevia use - I just could not handle it's leafy taste even in my ice tea, which is already leafy.<br />i was concerned that may be too much since many web sights warn of aluminum buildup in your liver - so i contacted Cargill and tried to find out what amounts of Splenda did their human trails involve - but they would not tell me - only said there is no consumption limit.  that's why I took a star off my review - i wish Splenda's maker would be more forthcoming when a consumer contacts them with a legitimate concern.  if you can tolerate sugar, when making a gallon of beverage, add one tablespoon of sugar per 16 grams of Splenda, to soften the metallic taste of this sweetener.

You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from. Buy in bulk and save :)<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story.

review/text: Mrs. Butterworth's Waffle Mix / B002J997RC<br /><br />I love, love, love this waffle mix. Seriously, all other waffle mixes just taste like sand to me, but Mrs. Butterworth's is so sweet and tasty. I've eaten Mrs. Butterworth's since I was a kid, so that may be part of it, but since I've introduced my fianc&eacute; to this mix, he can't seem to get enough of it, so it must not just be me. And it's SO easy to make - a touch of vegetable or canola oil, some water, and a waffle iron is all you need. No eggs, no milk, nothing perishable that you might not have on hand at the moment.<br /><br />What I can't understand is why none of my local stores seem to carry this mix anymore. Pinnacle Foods is apparently still making this mix, but no one seems to carry it in my area. I wonder if that's because of the "contaminated" scare that went around when people first started noticing the brown sugar crystals scattered through the mix and assumed that the evenly distributed, dissolves-in-water, brown crystals were a contaminate of some kind. Honestly, it seems that everything has to be bleached white as a ghost these days, ruining all the flavor and nutrients, and introducing goodness knows what chemicals into your system before people will eat it. And now even Amazon doesn't seem to carry it, which breaks my heart. Fortunately, we were able to find it on Shop Food Ex dot com, and everything arrived with another year-and-several-months to go on the expiration dates, so we're all stocked up for the winter.<br /><br />Nutrition Information<br />---------------------<br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup of mix<br />Servings per Container: ~19<br />Calories per Serving: 170<br />Calories from Fat: 20<br />Total Fat: 2g<br />Saturated Fat: 0.5g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 5mg<br />Sodium: 450mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 34g<br />Dietary Fiber: 1g<br />Sugars: 6g<br />Protein: 5g<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

An added bonus is that they seem to digest well (unlike cheese and some other lamb-based treats I've tried).

review/summary: A healthy new treat
review/text: These are extremely popular with the canines I've offered them to - a nice small size and, being grain-free, a very healthy treat as well. My only objection is that they're kinda smelly to carry around in your pockets, as I usually do, altho the dogs consider the scent a very tantalizing aroma!

review/summary: Great Healthy Treat
review/text: I've been giving these to my 2 little dogs for over 5 yrs.  They love them and I love giving them to my girls.<br />They are a nutritious salmon protein treat with essential amino acids and calcium. They're low calorie<br />with no artificial anything.<br />And... they're made from Alaskan Wild Salmon in the Pacific Northwest -- not salmon from the polluted<br />waters of the east coast. We use them for training treats, just because treats and in their puzzle toys.<br />They never lose their interest when rewarded with these treats. I highly recommend.

review/summary: Amazing for Udon
review/text: It's funny that most of the other reviews talk about using it straight, when I've never used it that way or even thought to try using it as shoyu! I use it as a soup base for zaru soba, somen salad, and udon. We mostly use it for hot udon. You basically put different amounts of water for whatever noodle you're eating and it tastes amazing each time. For instance, udon uses 1 part memmi, 12 parts water. It's extremely simple and tastes soooo good. Me and my daughter always drink the soup after and I make extra now so that we can have a lot of soup to drink with each noodle! This is really an amazingly good sauce! I'm hoping they eventually add subscribe and save for it.

review/text: I'm a big soy sauce fan but after tasting Memmi Noodle Soup Base, I don't think I can ever go back. It tastes much less salty and has a lot more sweetness (without being overly sweet) than regular soy sauce. I should probably actually try it as a soup base sometime, haha, but it's great over veggies and rice!

review/summary: Memmi sauce for soba noodles
review/text: We go through 3 bottles of this every 6-7 months.  We buy Annie Chun's soba noodles from amazon, cook those and flush with cold water, drain and in a bowl with this sauce, some water, sliced or shredded cucumber, carrot, chili, etc.  Get the salad shooter out ;)<br /><br />Very refreshing on a hot summer stretch, you can actually cook the noodles in advance and store in a ziploc in the fridge with your vegetables, then make this delicious cold dish in a flash.  Since the noodles cook in just a few minutes, dinner can be done in 5.<br /><br />This sauce is somewhat like a teriyaki sauce, and its very popular with my son and his friends.  Soy sauce, sugar and seasonings.<br /><br />Besides our favorite cold noodle dish, you can also make hot and cold soups.  With a little prepared dashi (dried bonito flake) broth mixed in, you can bring together a tasty hot or cold soup quickly.<br /><br />Best of all, you can buy all of this from amazon at the same time.  Our supermarkets are spotty with selling soba noodles, none of them carry this memmi sauce, and instant dashi can be challenging to find.

review/summary: The best soup base...EVER!
review/text: We have a restaurant here in town that has a fusion of Asian cuisines...and they have this absolutely delicious Taiwanese Beef noodle soup...for $10 a bowl. I rarely have it because it's expensive for a soup! Still...I crave that flavor. Hard to describe. So...did a little digging around on the internet and found this. We made it tonight for the first time using about a 6 parts water to one part soup base and adding garlic, crushed chili flakes, Chinese five spice and some mushrooms...then served over linguini in a soup bowl. Soooo good. It's clear, dark, somewhat sweet but yet salty and has that mushroomy-umame taste that just makes you addicted to it!! Next time, we are adding some shrimp or beef and topping with sliced green onions/scallions.

review/summary: Great taste ... Black & Orange Round-Up Lollipop
review/text: This is a lollipop that has flavor (orange) throughout and quite yummy!  It tastes different, less artificial, than other lollipops and that is what made us order more than once!<br /><br />High school colors are orange and black so used this first for graduation party (having the lollipops fanned out) and then just for special occasion (birthday) or celebrations (sports banquets, etc.).<br /><br />Loss of one star: Part of the lollipop goes over the top of the stick and that is the easiest part to eat, the rest is swirled around a stick that is a small diameter dowel stick. It was a bit of a drawback that part was swirled around this hard stick and you had to try and lick it off or bite it off--you end up leaving little pieces of it on the stick. Would have loved to have had a softer stick that had a bit of give to it or even had a round lollipop that had the majority of it off of the stick. The stick part probably means that this is not for preschoolers.<br /><br />But yummy flavor and thinking of ordering more!

review/text: My lab mix has a very sensitive tummy. He had recurrent bouts of diarrhea, vomiting and constant wretched gas. I had given him pedigree for awhile but realized that was no good for him. Then we tried science diet, but his gas seemed to get worse and his tummy would gurgle all day.<br /><br />I read about this dog food and its natural ingredients. There's no corn meal or other fillers. He's been on this food for about 2 weeks now and his gas has disappeared! He has not had a single bout of diarrhea or vomiting. I'm impressed. Yes it's pricey and I normally wouldn't buy something so expensive, but it is well worth it for the health of my dog.<br /><br />*Updated* to say that he has been on this food for a few months now and has continued to be free of tummy troubles and wretched gas. He hasn't vomited at all or had diarrhea. His coat has gotten so much shinier and he seems to be a much happier dog without all the tummy issues!

review/summary: Best Dog Food for allergy sufferers!
review/text: We finally found this food, just by luck at the pet store.  Our dog (boxer/bulldog mix), now 6, had suffered mysterious allergies from the time he was 2 until I found this food.  We went to a Veterinary Allergy Specialist for over a year, spent thousands of dollars, went to extremes trying prednisone (which the side-effects are very problematic) & antibiotics, and tried over 6 different prescription pet foods; nothing helped.  Our dogs paws/feet would blister up in between his toes, burst, and bleed.  We even had our dog run grassed with synthetic/artificial turf in case it was due to grass allergy.<br /><br />The food is a little pricey, he eats 6 cups of food a day, but I cannot express the relief we have had from finding a food that eliminates his allergy symptoms.  I have to admit that the smell of the fish is a little overwhelming.  We had had to resort to feeding him outside now, which wouldn't be so bad, except the birds seem to like it too.

review/text: I love this food. It actually is the only food I have found that my dog is not allergic to. (except for an extremely expensive prescription diet) I have a boxer on this food. He is allergic to almost everything. However, he is not allergic to salmon or sweet potatoes making this food the perfect choice for him. All food related allergies have disappeared and his coat has improved tremendously. He still deals with outdoor allergies, but this food has shown a big improvement in him. The only issue I have had is that he packed on a few extra pounds, which he has now lost. I cut down his dry food amount and mix canned green beans and carrots in with the dry food so he has enough to eat without the extra weight. He loves it and eats every bite!

I hate to say it, but I didn't even like petting him.<br /><br />We went to the vet and spoke to a nutirentest, they gave us some small samples for each dog to try and find out which brand of dog food they liked the best.

We have been using this dog food for almost 3 months and I have seen a dramtic change in both of their coats!<br /><br />The one with great skin, is even softer and shiner. But the one with bad skin has had the most change. He has a beasutiful shiney dark black coat. He has completly stopped itching and all the bumps are gone.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this food!

review/text: My Golden is my heart.  And she has allergies, and with a Golden ear infections are very possible.  Switching to a limited ingredient dog food has been a huge positive.  And, she loves this stuff.  Give the option of a few dog foods, she'll go to this one and bark for it.  Her weight has remained consistent since the switch, btw.  I do recommend it.  For those on a budget, I would add: this flavor (as opposed to their Venison and/or Bison flavors) tends to be about five dollars cheaper; stalking the items price fluctuations tends to save another five.  This size bag is about a six week supply for us, I think.  The plus side to ordering is that you can get the bigger bag, and someone else carries it to your door.  However, if you have a local business in your area that stocks this (I don't, but my Mom does) they will probably load it for you.  And the local Natural Dog Food store actually gives samples.  Anywhoo, wherever you buy, I think this is a product worth trying.

Had lots of tests run and then one of my clients dogs developed the same issues with his dog on the same dog food and has also spent a lot of money trying to correct the gut issue.

Sadly, some animals were sickened, and even died. After this recall, it's fair to say that many of us had become even more aware of how the pet food industry is regulated and how lapses are corrected, which is a great thing. Knowledge is power, as the saying goes.<br /><br />The FDA posted a new announcement for a voluntary pet food recall on June 18 - relating to Natural Balance Pet Foods, Inc. More specifically, the company discovered that there was the possibility of salmonella contamination in 5- and 28-pound bags of their Sweet Potato and Chicken Dry Dog Food. Consumers who have purchased that formula need to look for a "best by" date of June 17, 2011.<br /><br />Flickr photo courtesy of Denise Chan<br />Salmonella, also referred to as salmonellosis, causes digestive problems, and dogs will typically present with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and weakness. Other symptoms can occur.<br />Salmonella is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it can be passed to humans as well, so care needs to be taken. Hand washing is a must - even when handling dry pet food that may be contaminated with the bacteria.<br /><br />To keep up to date with current recalls and information on pet food safety, visit the FDA's website to view the updated list that includes not only dog and cat foods, but also horse feed.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Never Would Have Thought I'd Call a Dogfood Awesome
review/text: Over the summer my girlfriend and I adopted an American Bulldog who, unbeknownst to us had a number of allergies.  In the beginning these allergies manifested themselves through excessive scratching and some overwhelming stomach related ailments, which, for the benefit of the reader, I'll only describe as the type of thing which made us wonder if our dog's insides had been possessed or become otherwise engaged in some advanced stage of decay.  As cute as he is, he'd come into a room, gun-hot so to speak, and very quickly force us to find another place to sit.<br /><br />This food changed all of that.<br /><br />After trying him on two or three other products this food caused him to all but stop scratching and, for all intents and purposes, put an end to that earth-shattering, life-changing, climate-altering flatulence (there, I finally said it) of his.  He's now the perfect dog, this food has improved his life, our lives, and the lives of anyone who comes to visit.  It's definitely worth it.

I've been buying it off Amazon because, with Prime, it's cost effective.  But it was $50 in February, $55 in March, and now $60 in April?  What gives??

review/summary: Amazing for grain and poultry allergies!
review/text: My french bulldog developed SEVERE allergies at around 8 months.  Within a few weeks he was covered in bumps from head-to-toe, his hair fell out, he wheezed horribly, had really bad gas, went to the bathroom a lot and had loose stools.  I wasn't sure he would live, and the Vet said he had severe allergies, probably to his food, and put him on several months of prednisone and a prescription allergy food.  I was upset with the prednisone treatment as I knew it was dangerous and my dog hated the prescription food.  Two weeks later there was almost no change and he was still miserable, so I started researching my own solution for allergies, comparing food ingredients, and ideas to try.  I found that salmon/fish and sweet potatoes are not ingredients found in many other dog foods so an allergy to them would be more rare...and this food doesn't contain any grains or poultry products.  I started him on this and added a heaping spoon of canned pink salmon with it, and he still licks the bowl clean every time.  His breathing started clearing up within a week or so and I was able to stop giving him prednisone.  The bumps gradually went away after about a month and a half and his hair slowly grew back.  It took about 4+ months for 100% of his symptoms to go away, but he has been doing great for over a year now.  (For treats he is only allowed raw baby carrots, apple chunks, frozen green beans, or salmon jerky.)<br /><br />This food is an excellent option for dogs with both grain and poultry allergies as I can't seem to find another quality dog food that doesn't contain a little bit of chicken or rice, eggs, oatmeal, etc.  My only issue is that it is a bit low on protein, but since I add canned salmon to his food each day anyway isn't a problem for us.  The canned salmon and salmon oil are good for his skin so it works nicely, especially since he will eat the dry dog food just fine, but when I add the canned salmon he goes nuts for it.<br /><br />If your dog has allergies, try this!!  Don't let the vet sell you prescription dog food and put your dog on dangerous doses of prednisone.  My vet put my dog on the most common one sold; it was really expensive and I was so upset after I researched it and discovered that it has almost zero nutritional value.  (Look at petfoodanalysis. com as it does an amazing job of reviewing all foods and ranking them on quality ingredients, etc.)

review/summary: Dog isn't interested in it anymore; fishy smell; causes gas
review/text: I've been feeding this to my 7 year old collie for the last 6-7 months.  She has allergies and a vet recommended that I put her on a limited ingredient diet to help ease the symptoms.  She was originally prescribed a prescription Science Diet food made with fish.  For reasons I don't remember, I stopped that and eventually ended up with this food.  At first, my dog LOVED it. But I've noticed that with the last two bags, she seems to have lost interest. On the second to last bag, I end up throwing out several cups of kibble because she'd let it sit there for an entire day (and she's fed twice a day).  Though I store the food in a tupperware container, it seemed like my dog was snubbing it because it wasn't fresh.  With the next bag, she excitedly ate the first few bowls... and now we're back to the same thing. She'll let it sit there for hours. I sometimes have to put treats in it just to get her to eat it. Maybe this food doesn't keep well?<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this kibble has a noticeable fish smell which is detectable on her breath.  Also, I've noticed in the last month or so that my dog has had TERRIBLE smelling gas. Maybe that's just middle age catching up with her, but it's got to be at least somewhat related to what she's eating!<br /><br />So overall, I give this three stars.  My dog is one of the most food-motivated creatures you've ever met. Having food she won't eat is just frustrating!

I wasn't asking for any miracles, I just wanted some answers and I got a big fat NOTHING.<br /><br />After switching vets my new vet discovered the yeast infection and we switched the dog food.  He started to gain weight but we have a long road ahead of us to keep the yeast at bay.<br /><br />I am just disappointed in the company's customer service. I spent about $50 on a bag of food every two weeks plus treats.  My money will be better spent elsewhere.

review/summary: Amazing!!
review/text: My ten month old doxie/mix started having horrible stomach problems.  She would regurgitate her food within minutes after eating it.  After spending $1000 at the vet and having no reason for why she was getting sick, I decided to look into a different kind of food.  She was on Wellness before and the vet switched her to a special canned food.  Then he had me switch her to Science Diet Sensitive Stomach.  She did fine on the canned food, but got sick with the Science Diet.  Once I started this food, she stopped getting sick.  It was a miracle!  Her gas has gone away and she has kept the food down for over two months.  I'm so happy with this food!  I switched her brother onto the food too, and they both love it.

review/summary: Would give more stars if I could!!
review/text: This product is great if you have a dog with allergies.  You know how awful it is when your "baby" is miserable.  Our pet's skin was so sensitive and itchy that he could barely be touched without trembling all over.  His skin became raw with open sores from his constant biting and scratching . At his worst, he began losing large sections of hair.  He also suffered from chronic ear infections.  We were back and forth to the vet every few weeks for steroids, antibiotics, etc.  We finally determined he had many food allergies. (beef, dairy, lamb, liver, chicken, kangaroo(??-they tested for this-not sure why) really all proteins except for fish.)  If you have a pet with allergies like this you know how hard it is to find products they are able to eat.  Meat/chicken by products seem to find there way into everything.  The Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Fish and Sweet Potato dog food is great.  Our dog loves the taste and the difference it has made in his skin in amazing.  His skin is completely healed, most of his hair has grown back and his ears are doing better as well.<br />I know this food is more expensive than many brands you find at the grocery store.  At first, my accountant husband was not thrilled  with the cost.  However, when he saw the tremendous improvement in "Kelso's" skin and saw the vet bills going away he realized what a value it really is.<br />AMAZING PRODUCT-AMAZING RESULTS-HAPPY/HEALTHY DOG!!

review/summary: Not the same quality as an in-store purchase of the same dog food would be
review/text: Natural Balance dog food is great, but the dog food I purchased from Amazon was not completely satisfactory.  There was about a 4 pound clump of dog food that was so hard and compressed, it would have been unreasonable to break apart or use.  a 5 pound bag of this dog food goes for $13, so  I feel like I lost money on this purchase for the convenience of having it delivered instead of an in-store pickup.  I won't be purchasing dog food from Amazon again.  I don't feel as if they rotate the food out as well as it would if one were to purchase it from Petco or PetSmart.

review/summary: Great for Doodles
review/text: The breeder we got our Goldendoodle from uses this dog food because it's great for doodles that may have sensitive stomachs, which ours does. He is now a 1year  and we continue to use this dog food, plus you get such a great deal for this bag on Amazon.

review/summary: Helped our ten year old shelter pup with cushings
review/text: We talked to the folks at petco and their dog also had cushings.  They said their dog responded well to the diet change so not having much to do on the vet's end we gave it a try.  Our dog did not like the taste at first, but began to prefer this over her old food (natural choice for sensitive stomachs which she had been on for years).  It is expensive, which hurts the wallet, but it has been worth it to see the improvement and to see her playing and more active again.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: This product arrived on time and it was in perfect condition. My dog loves this food, she has a really sensitive tummy and this does not bother her at all.  I would buy this product again and I would order from this seller as well.

review/summary: Not as good as other Natural Balance formulas...
review/text: I decided to purchase the Fish and Sweet Potato formula from Natural Balance when they inexplicably jacked up the price of their Bison and Sweet Potato formula.  Unfortunately, the fish formula doesn't work nearly as well as the bison (and venison) formulas do.  I own a Boxer and also a German Shepherd and both have noticeably softer stool with the fish formula.<br /><br />This is less an indication of the product's quality, but the fish formula also smells awful.  I guess this can't be helped given the nature of the ingredients, but it's worth mentioning at least.<br /><br />As a result of the price hike on their better products, I'll no longer be supporting Natural Balance or their products, which is a shame since I've been a loyal customer for over four years.
