review/summary: BAD, do NOT buy!
review/text: Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling "corn gluten meal" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google "U.S. Patent 5,030,268" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.

review/summary: Over priced compared to BJs Wholesale club
review/text: Bought these Cheese crackers after doing some shopping for other food items here on Amazon that I thought were good buys. After placing the order I was shopping with my wife at the BJs Wholesale club and found this item for $5.50 for 45pc, You can imagine my surprise when I realized I had spent almost $10.00 more on the item through Amazon.. I tried to cancell the order but items shipped anyway. I highly recommend doing alot of research on food items before you purchase anything from Amazon. you may end up saving huge if you shop around.

review/summary: Good tasting noodles, but very high sodium content
review/text: The good news: Very easy to make, tasty good noodles, a few veggies<br /><br />The bad news: 1280mg of sodium (over half your daily allowance) -- Yikes!<br /><br />Notes: 290 calories, 0 mg Cholesterol, 2g fiber, 2g sugar, 7g protein, 12g fat (6g saturated fat)<br /><br />These noodles are tasty, the broth is OK, there are a few veggies sprinkled on top. Pour in boiling water wait 3 minutes (or longer) and you're done. A good, quick, hot lunch when you're in a hurry. But don't eat too often as the sodium content is incredibly high and would not be good for you. OK once in awhile, though, unless you're on a sodium restricted diet, in which case, why are you even reading this far? ;)<br /><br />Tip: You can probably reduce the sodium content by pouring off the liquid after preparing and eating just the noodles and veggies. Or add your own healthier liquid broth, even, if you wish.<br /><br />Also, you can let this sit for 6-8 minutes of even longer and it will be good and still very hot.

I keep these in my emergency supplies & my winter ditty bag in case I get snowed in at work. I work in a field where even if you're shift is over you don't leave until a relief staff gets there. Sometimes they can't get in. So having these good noodles around is a plus. They are great.

review/summary: They Like It, They Really Like It
review/text: After experiencing success with Royal Canin dry food, I decided to take a leap with the wet food. Once again, they adapted to it right away. They don't always finish the can that they are each served half of it. Heeding the warnings of the junk food qualities of Fancy Feast. Admittedly, they love Fancy Feast. But I think of their vet's comparison to McDonald's fast food as they devour it. But Royal Canin Intense Beauty is a lot healthier than Fancy Feast will ever be. I am happy to report that both of my cats are quite beautiful and healthy. With a beloved water fountain, and the right foods, I hope that I have another decade of receiving their devotion and love.

review/summary: Good product with a dumb name
review/text: With a name like Tender Quick you would think this was some kind of meat tenderizer. It's not. What it is is a mixture of table salt, sugar, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, and propylene glycol; used to rapidly cure meats like bacon, ham, jerky and sausage. It's very convenient in that you don't have to buy and measure these ingredients separately. There are literally dozens of recipes for curing meats using Tender Quick on the Internet and a quick rule of thumb of 1 tbsp per pound of meat for a dry cure and 1 cup Tender Quick to 4 cups of water for a brine helps take the guesswork out of developing your own. Some of the recipes you'll find include liquid smoke, so you can try things like bacon or ham without actually owning a smoker. However if you do have a smoker that works at low temperatures, many additional avenues of deliciousness will open for you.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent product for people new to the world of home-cured meats. If you've ever wondered if you could make your own summer sausage, Canadian bacon, or corned beef, this will get you started with minimal fuss.

review/summary: Fast Shipping, Problem with dry cure
review/text: Five stars for shipping speed.  Ordered on Friday, 25 May, estimated delivery Friday.  Arrived Wednesday morning via USPS, as FedEx Smart Post delivered to my local post office on Tuesday...around Memorial Day weekend.<br /><br />Local stores stopped carrying this product.  I have had great success using product to brine meat in water solution.  I have only had failure in my three attempts using the dry cure method, all beef turned brown and not pink, succeeding in depleting my cure stock.<br /><br />Reviewers have mentioned this size quantity should last users for a prolong time period.  Perhaps I will expand to try sausage and Canadian bacon.  Thanks for those ideas.  My primary goal is seasoned corned beef and pastrami.<br /><br />If I resolve the technique for dry curing London broil for above meals, I will upgrade this product to five stars and pass on the correct amount of cure per pound and inch thickness.<br /><br />Also, deduct one star from Morton website, who removed cure information and now offer a pamphlet customers can buy online.  I used to review the website information before curing.

review/summary: Never Buying Store-made Sausage Again!
review/text: I bought this product because of Jacques Pepin's recipes for sausage in his book, "Essential Pepin". Never ever again will I buy store-made sausage! I have used this to cure pork sausage, and chicken sausage, as per the recipes in Pepin's books. It is easy to work with, and it takes 2t per pound of meat, so the multi-pack is a great investment if homemade sausage is going to be in the regular rotation of dinners, like at our house.

review/text: I am making sausage and jerky so I needed some curing agent, which is what this is.  It is NOT a tenderizer as the name would have you believe.  It has sodium nitrate and nitrite as well as sugar and a LOT of salt in it.  It works very well to preserve the meat and prevent botulism (reason for the nitrite).  Since I figured I would be doing some deer meat with it this winter I got a pack of 6, which is a lifetime supply.  The extra is sitting on my reserve, emergency food supply shelves for AHBL DAY.  (ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE).

It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though.  If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out.  Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable.  Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier.

I guess they just assumed you couldn't tell the difference between pecans and cashews.  p.s. the product label was a real exercise in obfuscation if not downright illegal.

I loved the taste and how they fit so great in a jersey pocket.  I was excited my local sports store had them but they only sold them individually.  After looking online you can't beat the price Amazon.com has per box!  And most importantly these things taste good but also give you the energy you need to polish off that 50 or 100 mile ride.  I find eating one every hour keeps me going with out the bulk of stuffing other larger type bars in my jersey pockets.  I can easly get 4 in a pocket (maybe up to 6 if the jersey isn't real tight).

review/summary: Can't Eat Just 1
review/text: Bought these last week and I love them.  I purchased Vanilla but now I'll try the others.  Flavor is amazing..it just oozes flavor.<br /><br />My only gripe is in the packaging.  When I tear them open I end up crumbling the waffle a little bit, leaving some either in my lap or in the packaging.  For this, I give packaging a 3 or 4, but product a 5.  I'm still rating the product a 5 because maybe I'm just not doing it right.  But I fear if I wanted to do attempt to open while on a bike ride or in the middle of other activities it'd be a catastrophe.<br /><br />Highly Recommend.

review/summary: Looking for an energy source??
review/text: I am a triathlete and runner who has tried many food sources for endurance events. This is by far the best I have used. The Stinger Waffles are easy to carry, easy to use while exercising and do not upset my stomach. I highly recommend the Stinger Waffles as your energy source for endurance sports.

review/summary: Great Snack for Exercise or Not!
review/text: I have to say that the Stinger Waffles are the best energy snack to come on the market in years.  I love these things.  I cycle, and the fact that these are flat make them really easy to carry in a jersey pocket.  They don't have huge amounts of calories, but they definitely help me keep going during a long workout.  And they taste so good, that I keep them around as regular snacks, even when I am not exercising.<br /><br />The only downsides to these (and the reasons they get 4 stars):<br />1) The vanilla flavor is a little stronger than I like, but not bad.<br />2) The packages aren't the easiest to open.  I usually only open them when stopped if it is during a ride.

I would eat one in my car on the way to the gym, or in the locker room changing from swim suite to running clothes, and it doesn't bother my stomach at all. They aren't heavy feeling.

review/summary: Simply delicious, but messy.
review/text: These things are delicious!  I used the Stinger Waffle today on my 11 mile run and was surprised by its fantastic taste.  It looks like a flattened waffle cone, but it is softer which makes it easy to break off a piece to eat while running.  I pre-opened the package before I left because I didn't think I could tear it open while on the move.  That was good choice, however, it left the inside of my pocket filled with crumbs and coated my phone with pieces of sticky waffle.  It may be because I had an older one that was a little more crumby and not as fresh, but I don't know.  It also left a sweet after taste in my mouth, which would be good if I needed a pick-me-up during a long day, but not something that I like during a longer run.  I will definitely buy these again, but I will probably stick to the chomps.

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

You may have moved on to a bit more "chocalaty" hot cocoa, and you can now add these marshmallows!!<br /><br />No, they are not "haute cuisine", but they do bring back memories of cold winter days and hot cocoa after sledding!

Sadly I couldn't finish my marshmallows and I left them near a window with direct sunlight. Not a good idea. They will get sticky and icky (not the good kind either). Try them out if you like mini marshmallows this will not disappoint, kind of.

review/text: This ketchup tastes great, but if you want an unsweetened ketchup, this is NOT it. It contains maltodextrin, which is a sweetener, and important to be aware of if you are concerned about the effects sweeteners have on your blood sugar. It also has a higher glycemic index than sugar. However, if you don't care about those issues, than I'd say this is way better than average store-bought ketchup, but the label is totally misleading. It is sweetened.

review/text: Westbrae Natural has wonderful vegetarian products and this is just another one of my favorites! There is no strange alternative sweetener aftertaste as this is simply unsweetened.  It has a wonderful savory flavor and while a little thicker than regular ketchup its perfect for burgers, fries, and anything else ketchup fiends love to put it on.  I fully admit to being one of those ketchup fiends who puts ketchup on everything so the fact that this impressed me should be taken seriously.  For those who like a sweeter ketchup, Westbrae Naturals also has a fruit juice sweetened ketchup,  but as I enjoyed this so much I will not need to try that one at all and can not speak to its flavor.  Note with this unsweetened ketchup there is a mere 1 g carb per 1 tablespoon serving.  This is great for those following the low carb diets!  Highly recommended and its a great price here on amazon!

review/text: The primary and overriding flavor of this ketchup is tomato paste. The color is nice and bright, and its contents are healthier than most (except for the salt), which is why I give it 2 stars. The ketchup is simply too thick (you need a knife to get it out) and would serve as a base from which you can experiment. But if you want to do that you will be better off paying less and just starting with a can of tomato paste and add your own salt and vinegar. To sweeten, if that's your thing, add agave nectar or fruit juice or fruit puree or even just white balsamic vinegar. A dash of allspice, and a bump in the garlic, would help this product tremendously.

America is at toxic levels with all the sugar in the foods out there and no one is aware of it or cares or even realizes how horrid it is.  This is why we have heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems across the board.  This country is in a very sad state.  I'm doing my best to let everyone around me know.

review/text: They used to be good and mild. The kids and I both liked them. But then they changed them slightly, and they are too tart now.<br /><br />Good source of dried fruit.<br /><br />I hope they go back to the old recipe.

review/summary: Delicious, healthful, and well-priced!
review/text: I love stretch island fruit bars!  Our local Costco started carrying these a few years ago, for about the same price found on amazon. I quickly became attached to these delicious and healthful treats, and was very disappointed when Costco stopped carrying them. Amazon to the rescue, of course!<br /><br />Great for kids, no added sugars or bizarre ingredients, and try a few of these in lieu of an "energy bar" before strenuous exercise, along with a small handful of nuts...  Plenty of energy whatever the activity!

review/text: This product's description was definitely incomplete and possibly missleading. Although it was titled "Fruit Leather", it is essentially a very thick rectangle of processed fruit flavored plastic-like substance that is very unappealing. Although the price was good, the product was not what I expected or can use.

review/text: I actually have bought these often at various stores. They are typically around $0.60 a piece (give or take a nickel). I bought them here for $12 (for 30, or around $0.40 a piece). This particular flavor is actually my favorite. The Green Apple is quite pronounced, and it is really the perfectly sized snack. Very enjoyable. Bueno, bueno.

review/summary: Fantastic Snack for Toddlers!
review/text: My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES these.  And I can honestly say the word "LOVE" about this product.  The first time we gave her one, she not only ate the entire fruit strip, but she actually licked the wrapper!  She considers them a treat and prefers them over just about anything else.  She loves every flavor we have tried and we love that they are so good for her.  I feel great about giving them too her instead of fruit roll-ups or fruit snacks that are basically all sugar.  I highly recommend these to anyone with kids.  Plus I love to eat them myself for a quick snack.  They are really delicious!  And with Amazon's pricing, they are completely affordable and I can get them delivered to my door for free.  This is a no-brainer for us!

review/text: I've tried Apricot which is excellent, but these Apple leathers are not nearly as good.  The flavor just isn't there and the texture is a little strange.  I've recently ordered Raspberry and Strawberry in order to try those out.<br /><br />Generally these Stretch Island packs are a good value considering individual leathers can sell for $1 or more each in stores such as Trader Joes.

And they don't know it's not the awful commercial kind which is loaded with high fructose corn syrup. These are not low in sugar, mind you, but at least it's not much worse than handing the kids an apple in that respect.

You take a real apple, process it somehow, then try to reconstruct an "apple."  Something is missing.  The snap of biting a ripe apple.  The bulk of the apple in your mouth and stretching your stomach.  This product has to be a crude representation of the real thing, the apple for a person who needs to convince themselves that they... just ate an apple.<br /><br />And when was the last time you ate an apple and had to throw the plastic packaging away?

review/text: Let me say being a Chicago native I was skeptical of this popcorn as the only popcorn I know as being the best is Garrett's Popcorn...Ever since I moved away from Chicago I have been desperately trying to find a substitute that can somewhat compare to the awesomeness that is Garrett's. Well let me say I am now a believer! This popcorn is great and is the closest comparable popcorn to Garrett's that I've ever tasted. I'm not sure what the 3-star reviewer was talking about as I noticed NO hulls in any of the two bags I ate (so far). It's not sweet heavy I actually find myself grabbing more cheese than caramel but in the end if you aren't sure about getting this popcorn because of the price trust me because it's worth it.

review/text: I bought these on a whim. The mix sounded interesting and the reviews were outstanding. Wow, this stuff is so good. Not only are the flavors great, but the popcorn itself is the perfect consistency. Just very fresh tasting. I read other reviews on here that described the mix as more sweet. That is not my experience. The cheese popcorn may be a little lighter than you would expect (and by that, I mean not laden with tons of salty orange powder), but it definitely makes its presence known in the mix. Will most certainly order again.

review/text: Cretors carmel-cheese popcorn is awesome!  I live outside Chicago, so we can get Garrett's Popcorn.  And if I am going to eat it all while it is warm then fine.  But Cretors really is as good and it keeps way better and is way cheaper.  I can have an open bag for two weeks and it is just as good.  I just saw that Amazon will be carrying it and am waiting for it since Costco no longer carries it.  Their loss, and mine.  Hopefully Amazon will HURRY!!!  Keep in mind though that the though there is not tons of carmel corn there is enough and it mostly settles.
