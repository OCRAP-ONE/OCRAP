review/summary: Wonderful Matcha Flavor
review/text: I have been using matcha tea for about a year now.  Stash Japanese Matcha Powdered Green Tea is the third brand that I've tried.  It is my favorite thus far.  The color is exquisite and the flavor is pure matcha.  Being able to pick this up as a subscribe and save adds to its attraction.<br /><br />I have begun adding matcha to my morning smoothie on those mornings when I don't make it hot to ensure that I get all those lovely bioflavinoids.  It is actually a nice addition to the vanilla flavored smoothie.  One piece of advise:  if you are adding the green to a vanilla drink, don't add colorful fruit.  It makes a dreadful gray color which is far from appetizing.

review/summary: Good value - maybe not the highest quality for drinking straight
review/text: This is a great price, and good for cooking/blending in smoothies. With hot tea, still enjoyable, but the taste is a little sub par in quality compared to some of the "finer" matcha products. For example, I wouldn't recommend drinking this "alone" with hot water as in a traditional japanese hot matcha tea; I'd add some looseleaf green or a tea bag to bring out the true flavor. Other matchas that I've tried, to contrast, stand up on their own (and a little goes a long way  - unlike this matcha, where I felt I was adding more to get the same "green" taste.)<br /><br />The correct way to prepare is to add a bit of powder to an empty cup, add some hot (not boiling) water and stir briskly with a bamboo whisk or fork until blended. You can then add hot milk, more water, etc to your taste.<br /><br />This also tastes great mixed into yogurt, milk/berry smoothies. It's a small tin - note the 1.06 ounce size - but this is pretty standard for matcha. Using the subscribe and save feature knocks off more dollars off the price (compare to $30+ at Whole Foods for rishi brand matcha, same size).<br /><br /> Overall, it's definitely a very good product, unless you're a super-discerning tea drinker - and I recommend it!

review/text: I love the Starbucks iced green tea latte. So when I found this, I was extatic. The power is great, tastes great too, just like I bought it from Starbucks. The only thing is that it does not mix well with a spoon when you put it in milk. I use a blender and that works great.

review/summary: Worth the price!
review/text: The flavor and quality are excellent.  It is not too strong of a coconut flavor so it works in many foods.  The price was so low compared to other brands.  I almost gave up using coconut oil because it was becoming three times the price of organic butter (the only two "safe" high-heat cooking oils according to my Naturopathic Doctors).  After shipping it is just a bit more than organic butter!  Now my 10-year-old son makes popcorn with half coconut oil and half butter that exceeds theater popcorn!  My 12-year-old daughter says it tastes great and I have used it as the only moisturizer on my face for two years in our hot, dry climate.  I am a satisfied customer!

review/summary: Cocofabulous
review/text: Unrefined oil is not processed, bleached, deodorized and stripped so I will always pick that over the refined, but I must admit that I don't use coconut oil for cooking, I use it on my skin and hair! Although this oil has a very high smoking point, I am always worried about the true health benefits. Coconut oil may be associated with atherogenesis (disease affecting arterial blood vessels) so I choose to use for the topical benefits rather than ingesting it.<br /><br />I have learned from my boss who is form India, the secrets to her lovely shiny hair, and it's simply about warming up some coconut oil. I spoon it out if it's solid into a small glass bowl and microwaving for about 15 seconds then massaging my hair and scalp then tying a bun and letting it soak in for as long as I can ( anywhere between 15 minutes to hours or even overnight) then shampooing out with a clarifying or non moisturizing shampoo. Usually one shampoo is enough, sometimes if I have extra oil on the hair I shampoo again and then condition as usual.<br /><br />The sheen, bounce and manageability is incredible, I have never been as impressed with a product for the hair as with this simple treatment. The oil is inexpensive and lasts forever and the results are simply dazzling. For those with dry and fried hair, colored, tired or simply hair that needs a deep treatment this is heavenly. Even fine hair that has never been abused can benefit for it.<br /><br />I use this as often as I can, but once a week is sufficient, although the way the hair feels after is addictive and I can never wait to do it again.<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: BEST WEIGHTLOSS BUDDY EVER: COCONUT OIL
review/text: If you want to lose weight i seriously consider running/walking a few miles and eat a few teaspoons of coconut butter everyday, eating healthy combinations of fruit (not too much though fruits contain sugar and makes you fat if you eat to much) seeds, nuts, beans, meat, raw eggs, kefir etc. to dramatically lose body fat and gain a healthier heart mind and body. All around this coconut oil jar contains all the nutrients and essential vitamins you need to sustain a healthy body. People get scared away because coconut oil contains calories/cholesterol/fat, but what people don't know is that there is no BAD FAT or BAD CHOLESTEROL, our bodies NEED cholesterol and fat to prevent from dieing! Those that demonize cholesterol have no idea what they are talking about and only parrot what they are told. The truth is, all men and women need what is in this jar everyday. This is a must have over any supplement especially if you want to lose weight! You see, the people who have difficultly losing weight are the people who ONLY eat cholesterol-free foods and are let-down every time they work out and get on that scale and see no change.. it's because they aren't getting the proper amounts of FAT/CHOLESTEROL in their diets. When the body lacks fat/cholesterol it goes into PANIC MODE and starts to keep the remaining fat from being burned by day to day movement and exercise. When the body sees the proper amount of fat/cholesterol comes in it automatically starts burning MORE EXCESS WEIGHT on your body and the metabolism starts burning like a hot coal fire! Trust me when you start working out, eating good food including coconut-butter, you will be surprised how fat the weight just burns off your body.. let me rephrase that, MELTS off your body!

review/text: This was orignally purchased because I use it for a scalp conditioner, as well for my hair. This product can be used cooking, but I like using the extra virgin organic coconut oil (not necessarily the same brand) for cooking because it gives off a coconut taste into dishes that make the dish really come to life, comparable to coconut milk, but need less ingredient for the flavor. Anyways, back on topic, this oil can be used as a skin conditioner for the body if used in a homemade lotion. Great product.

review/summary: Real nice, Clark..
review/text: I was turned on to coconut oil as an alternative good-additive, instead of using some of the unhealthy ones out there like butter, like on baked or sweet potatoes.. Coconut oil isn't something you'd want to eat all the time, due to the saturated fat; however, it's mostly good fat that it has and it tastes frickin' awesome. Good to cook with on a pan too.  It says it has a "neutral" flavor, but to me you can definitely taste a distinct flavor.  I guess that it may be considered neutral due to being able to mix well with other things, but you can still taste it's richness.

review/summary: Doesn't Work With Smart Cats UPDATE!
review/text: My cat is pretty laid back, but when it comes to pills, it is a two person job to "pill the cat".  The pill pockets worked exactly two times before the cat got wise to the ruse and refused to have anything to do with them.  He won't even eat a pill pocket as it comes straight out of the package now.  You might improve your odds by making certain that you  pinch the treat shut with the other hand, so that the outside does not pick up the flavor or smell of the pill.  I did this, but I think that the cat still knew that there was something "funny" about this treat.  Maybe my cat really doesn't like Salmon flavor, but he did eat them twice.<br /><br />UPDATE!<br />I decided to give the Pill Pockets one more try, this time success!<br /><br />The key, as I hinted above, is that you must take extreme care not to get the flavor or odor of the pill on the outside of the treat. If you are right handed putting the pill in, use your left hand to pinch the treat shut.<br /><br />Even better is this sequence of steps:<br /><br />1. Withhold food from the cat for three to four hours so he is good and hungry.<br /><br />2. Lock the cat in another room so he can't see or smell what you are doing.<br /><br />3. Get out the pill and prepare it (such as cutting in half if this is the doseage given), then set it on the counter.<br /><br />4. Wash your hands carefully, using a soap that the cat doesn't mind, rinse your hands well and dry with a paper towel or clean dish towel.<br /><br />5. Use tweezers to insert the pill into the Pill Pocket, do not use your hands!<br /><br />6. Now pinch the Pill Pocket shut, being careful not to touch the pill.<br /><br />7. Now feed it to the cat.<br /><br />I first thought that when the cat started chewing, he would spit out the pill, but he didn't! He licked his nose, which is a sign that he swallowed everything.<br /><br />Based on this new experience, I have upgraded my rating to three stars. The product would get five stars if the package had given instructions similar to these.

review/summary: Mixed results, and some tips
review/text: I have three older cats who take arthritis pills.  One also takes a thyroid pill.  I decided to try the pill pockets.  For the first month or so, they all loved them, and they made it easy to give the pills.  However, after three months:<br /><br />One cat still loves them.  I have to watch her carefully or she will steal the pills from the others.<br /><br />One cat has figured out how to eat around the pill.<br /><br />One cat sometimes takes them, but at other times just sniffs the pocket and skips it.<br /><br />I have figured out a few tricks that help:<br /><br />There are two types of pockets for cats:  chicken and salmon.  The chicken is slightly larger and more pliable and works better with larger pills.  However, I think that the cats find the salmon tastier.<br /><br />Get another cat treat and stick it to the side of the pill pocket.  Then place the pocket so the treat faces down.  My finicky cat is much more likely to eat the whole thing that way.<br /><br />The pill pocket still helps with the cat who eats around it.  After she eats the pill pocket, it is easier to shove the pill down her throat.  She is more likely to swallow it instead of spitting it out if it tastes of pill pocket.<br /><br />If you have two pills, try to fit them both in one pocket.  Giving the cat fewer pockets will make it seem more of a treat.

review/summary: Dogs love them, too!
review/text: I realize this review may seem a bit odd, because I don't have a cat. I actually have a 100lb dog, an Akita who HATES taking pills. But I think my review of this product may still be of value to any dog owners who might come across it.<br /><br />Andie has been taking pills for her hypothyroidism for the past 9 years. Wrapping the pills in meat or cheese never worked; she simply eats around the pill or spits it out. For years the only way I could get Andie to take pills was to, literally, shove them down her throat. (My hands are small enough and her mouth is big enough for me to do this. Thankfully she's a very trusting dog!)<br /><br />Then one day I was at the vet and noticed packages of something call "Pill Pockets". They had two kinds -- one for dogs and one for cats. Both came in a variety of flavors (any of which Andie would like), but the dog packages came in different sizes (small and large) while the cat packages only came in one size (small).<br /><br />I looked at each package very carefully and noticed that the packages for cats had 45 Pill Pockets, while the packages for small dogs only had 35 Pill Pockets. And yet, the packages for small dogs cost MORE than the packages for cats -- huh? (On Amazon.com they are the same price, but the quantities are different.) So I looked at Andie's tiny thyroid pills, then looked at the Pill Pocket pictures on the packages and decided, "I might as well save myself a buck and buy the kitty Pill Pockets. What the hey, Andie won't know she's eating something intended for cats!"<br /><br />I've been happy with that decision ever since.<br /><br />I've bought both the salmon and chicken flavored Pill Pockets FOR CATS and Andie likes both of them. The pockets are the perfect size, just big enough for her thyroid pills, and to date she has gulped down every one, then begged for another! And I like the fact that I get 10 more in each package than I would if I bought the "doggie" Pill Pockets.<br /><br />This is a great product, for cats OR dogs. I have never owned a cat but for any dog owners out there I can definitely attest that Pill Pockets for Cats are NOT just for cats! Dogs love 'em, too! If your dog takes tiny pills like Andie does, go with the more economical choice -- your dog will never know the difference!

review/text: These are truly a life saver product.  I have a cat, Blackie, who is needing to take two pills a day.  But, she is beyond expert at taking a pill that is all the way in the back of her throat and managing to spit it back up, even with a water chaser, at which point it gets soggy and I have to start over.  Plus, I had to hold her down each day to do this, twice (once for each pill).  Not fun for her or me.<br /><br />Then my vet, listening to my tale of woe about getting the appropriate amount of medicine into her, suggested I give these (the salmon flavored ones) a try and gave me 4 of them to try out.<br /><br />They are incredible.  Sort of like a soft playdough in consistency, with a small pocket.  I stuffed the two pills inside, molded the stuff around them so there was no sign, and simply placed the pill in front of Blackie.  She did her usual suspicious sniffing, then a lick, then she took the whole thing and scarfed it down and looked up and meowed for "more please!!".  OK, I was beyond impressed.  But, it wasn't until she repeated this over the next 3 days where I was convinced.<br /><br />Thank you *so* much whoever invented these!!

review/summary: Kushka loves pill pockets
review/text: I have being pilling my cat, Kushka, who has chronic renal failure quite successfully for the last couple of weeks using salmon flavored pill pockets. The salmon flavor in them appears to be quite strong, strong enough that it brings all 4 of my cats running from wherever they are in the house whenever I open the packet; and strong enough to overcome the taste of the pill. After I give Kushka her pill pocket, I immediately start handing out salmon flavor Wicker Lickens treats to my other 3 cats, including 4 or 5 of them to Kushka.  The treats for my other cats are so not to show favoritism, but they still think Kushka is getting the best treat (but since other treats are only around a dollar a package, the pill pockets are only for pills).  I do really love the pill pockets, for  Kushka has been a real terror to pill, even when I used a piller;  beside scathing and fighting me, she also bit, and not friendly bites either, but bleeding puncher wounds (this from a normally very passive, affectionate Himalayan). I had never had to give her a pill before she was diagnosed with CRF 2 months ago, she had never been sick before in all 12 years of her life. Now, with the pill pockets I just open a packet and she comes running to get it.  I have even stated given her night dose of pepcid AC in a pill pocket as her reward for being good during her nightly subcutaneous injection of fluids.

review/summary: Pill Pocket only worked twice
review/text: Our cat is pretty mellow with the exception of taking pills.  We tried pill pockets and it worked only twice.  I was VERY, VERY careful with not contaminating the pill-pocket with the medicine taste.  Cats, unlike dogs, are chewers, and once he chewed the medicine in the pill pocket, he stopped eat them altogether.  Another time he ate around the pocket and left the pill!  Later, I tried with just an empty pill pocket and he gulped that up!  Arghh.  I finally resorted to crushing the tablet and mixing it with a very small amount of baby food (ham or some kind of meat) and now I just smear it on the cat's teeth or put it directly inside his month (he won't eat the baby food with the meds otherwise). SUCCESS!  Thank goodness we found a way to administer the pill, since our cat has to have a daily dose for 60 days!

review/summary: Worked once sort of....
review/text: You get a good number of the treats, even thought they are still pricey.  They are very soft, and quite a few were pretty squished, though the treats are soft enough you could likely mold them around the pill if need be I suppose.  As for the cat... he gobbled up the empty ones in seconds.  He eagerly gobbled up the one with the pill as well, only as soon as he bit into it and discovered the pill, and out onto the floor it went.  He did like the treat enough to lick the treat off a bit though, leaving the soggy pill behind.  Another empty he ate slightly hesitantly, and for a wonder the next with a pill actually went down the way it was supposed to.  Yay! I thought, no more struggling with pills.  The next time though, he bit into the treat and found the pill again.  In fact, he'd deliberately nibble at it, uncovering the pill.  After that, when I tried again, he started to refuse the treats at all, even without a pill.  In fact, he'd gotten so distrustful so quickly of the hidden pill trick, he even distrusted any soft treat for several days after and I had to resort to crunchy ones as his reward for swallowing pills.  It's too bad he seems to chew his food rather than bolting it. (hiding pills in food never worked for him either) I think if he didn't chew, they might have worked better.  As it is, we now resort to a routine.  He gets fed, then picked up and carried to a particular chair.  He gets sat up to recieve the pill, pill goes in, and he's rewarded with treats as soon as the pill goes down.  After several times of the routine, while he doesn't come running for it, he settles down and stops struggling and running away right after.  Rather, he looks about eagerly as if to say, "where's my treat?  I'm supposed to get a treat now you know."  At least the pill pockets were useful for that much at any rate!

review/summary: Works like a charm!
review/text: I cannot believe how unbelievably simple these are to use!  My cat recently started needing to take two pills every morning and night.  I purchased a "pill gun", but it was not pleasant to put it down his throat every time I needed to pill him.  I was always worried about putting it too far down, and sometimes he would just spit it back out anyway.<br /><br />I found these at my local pet store for $10.50 for the bag of 45, and although I thought they were pretty pricey, I figured it couldn't hurt to try.  I put both pills in one pocket, and he ate it right up.  He even chewed right through it, and still was rubbing up against my ankles after.  Now he comes running when he hears the pill bottle and he watches me put them in the pockets, purring the whole time as he can't wait for his "treat".<br /><br />Knowing it is made from wholesome, nutritous ingredients makes it even better too.  I can't believe someone didn't come up with this sooner, and that vets don't let their clients know that it can be a life saver for some pets.

review/summary: Good product and good price
review/text: If you have to give your cat pills alot this product will save you alot of hassles. It is a very soft treat with a hole in it and you just drop the pill in it and feed it to the cat. My finicky cat also readily eats it. Also, if your cat is taking an antibiotic, these pill pockets have a probiotic in them that is good for the cat.<br /><br />I used to just put a pill in a soft cat treat but, I have not found a cat treat that is easy to jam a pill into because they are too dry or not soft enough. The only complaint I have is, the last batch I ordered were kind of smushed together and some were broken apart.<br /><br />The Amazon price is good too. Some sites sell this for alot more.

review/text: after about two weeks of twice daily blood pressure meds Flannel (15 yr old russian blue) was fed up and growling at anyone who would come near him.  He has a tiny appetite and hiding the pill was getting ridiculous at about a 50% success rate.  It took forever..... No longer the case.  He takes a couple licks at it and then swallows it up.  Perfect....!  He's a dignified little guy I hated the problem of prying his mouth open to give him meds and nothing else could promise me that he would get all of it in his mouth.<br /><br />He's going to have these meds for the rest of his life.....this is the best thing going.

review/summary: Good, but dries out quickly
review/text: I have been using pill pockets now for about 2.5 years now EVERY DAY for my cat, Baby, for her heart medication. While she's come accustomed to the treat, and won't eat it on its own any more, she will most of the time eat it with other treats she likes.<br /><br />I have noticed, however, a few things: 1) If you don't close the package tightly and keep air out of it, the treats will dry out, and will become MOST undesirable to the kitty. My solution: put the treat bag in another zip lock sealed bag, squeeze out the air, and voila, treats stay fresher longer. 2) The treats for cats are actually VERY large (even for my obese and often hungry kitty!). My solution is to basically cut the pill pockets in half, and smoosh pill inside the pill pocket that way.<br /><br />I have been using the chicken flavor for the last couple years, and have yet to try the salmon flavor, but I'm really hoping the change will be quite palatable for my Baby! Thanks, Greenies, for making a great product that makes pilling my cat so much easier!

review/summary: Pill Time Becomes Treat Time
review/text: This has turned what used to be a necessary (but not very pleasant) ritual into a twice daily treat.  I've been medicating my cat twice daily for several years now and although she never overtly fought me at pill time she wasn't crazy about it either.  Recently she had begun to run away and hide when it was "that time".  Now I can't get the pills out of the bottle fast enough.  She LOVES these little pill pockets.  As soon as she hears me open the foil bag she runs to me and waits eagerly for her "treats".  I no longer have to feel bad about forcing pills down her throat.  What a relief.  A twice daily chore has become a twice daily delight.

Giving him a pill is a nightmare....... until I started using the salmon flavored Pill Pockets (which were recommended by my Vet).  They are just wonderful.  You put the pill in the 'pocket' and squeeze the end closed, and give it to the cat.  My cat loves them.  Now giving him his pills is quick and easy and painless for both of us.  I've been using the Pill Pockets for a couple of months now with no problems.  I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Great Way to Give a Cat a Pill
review/text: This review is written for Pill Pockets for Cats (Amazon ASIN:B00061MVTG). Amazon will sometimes post this review next to Greenies Pill Pockets. Unless Greenies bought Pill Pockets for Cats and has reissued it under their label, this is a mistake. I've NEVER TRIED GREENIES. I took my original 2004 review down and am reposting it with this warning.<br /><br />Pill Pockets for Cats are soft, hollow, little cat treats. They are shaped like a cup. The concept is simple. Put the pill in the opening and then seal it by pinching it closed, then feed it to your cat. Our cat was a little hesitant the first couple times, so we would put a little catfood gravy on it (which she adores). She ate it right up. Sometimes she would get fussy and not eat it (mainly because she's an annoying, spoiled little critter), but I've found that dressing it up with dried bonito flakes works really well too. Now she looks forward to her daily treat and would remind me if she didn't get it.<br /><br />The pockets in the first bag were similar to the consistency of Velveeta, though the second bag was a little more dried out and tended to crumble. Our cat prefers the pill pockets when they are moist, but she will still eat the drier ones. I think that the product dries out as it sits on the shelf. If you are buying the product from a store (as opposed to Amazon), shake the bag. If it rattles a lot like the pieces are loose, the product is more likely to be dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Unless you have a lot of cats, I don't recommend buying the product in large quantities. After the bag is opened, the product tends to start drying out. For us, the 45-count bag was just right, by the time we got to the bottom, the pills were drier, but still moist enough for my cat to eat them without too much coaxing.<br /><br />Our veterinarian prescribed tiny tablets for our cat (cut in half), so there is plenty of room to spare. I would guess that you could probably fit a pill the size of an aspirin in there, but you might have to stretch it a bit.<br /><br />The Pill Pockets are a bit pricey (around $7 for 45 pieces), but it's so much easier than stuffing a pill down the cat's throat, that it's really worth it.<br /><br />Pill Pockets for Cats (salmon flavor) comes in a metallic pinkish bag. The chicken flavor comes in a yellowish bag, but we've never tried it.. Pill Pockets for Cats used to come in clear plastic bags, but I think they found that opaque bags keeps the product fresh longer. Greenies comes in a green bag.

review/summary: Awesome!!!
review/text: I tried everything I could think of to disguise my cats' pills, and nothing worked... until now!  My kitties love the pill pockets so much that they try to steal each others' pills! The pills I am giving are too big for the cats to swallow whole, so I break them into quarters and wrap each piece in 1/2 a pill pocket (they are soft like playdough so it's easy to mold them around the pill pieces).  I start by giving the cat a little piece of a pill pocket (without a pill) to whet his appetite, and then he quickly gobbles up all 4 quarters of the pill one after the other after the other... and still looks for more!  I'm surprised the cats don't chew these and discover the pill inside, but for some reason they don't. These are amazing!

review/text: And a great idea -- my husband and I are wishing we had invented these.<br /><br />My two cats find these to be the best thing ever.  I break each pill pocket in two, as suggested by my vet.  I can only put 1/4 of an asthma pill in each half-treat -- kitty who requires the meds was finding (and rejecting) the pill when I tried putting 1/2 pill in each treat.  But with 1/4 pill per treat, he has no clue -- and is focused on eating it as quickly as possible so our other cat doesn't get it.<br /><br />So each cat gets half a pill pocket every night in our house.  And they're very excited about it.  No more wrestling with trying to jam pills down an unwilling cat's throat!

review/summary: Godsend, if you can tweak it right...
review/text: The first morning, I gave her little pieces of one pocket to see if she liked it.  Used pieces of a second one to cover each pill - she takes three every day.  Down they went, with a little cat smile on her face, and then a slightly puzzled look when I didn't try to pill her.  LOL.  Then, later that night her food allergies must have kicked in and she threw up in 5 places in the house.  A sincerely big disappointment, given our fights lately over pills.<br /><br />We then tried having a liquid compound made that you squirt into the cat's mouth.  Neither the vet nurse nor the pharmacist caught that one of her meds, Chlorpheniramine (kitty Sudafed), creates extreme salivary gland reaction. So after she spit half of it all over me, she was drooling profusely all over the place for about 15 minutes.  One unhappy sticky cat, and an even more unhappy sticky mom chasing her with a napkin.  The liquid must be refrigerated, she hates cold things, the "roasted" chicken flavor smells awful, and I think it would be potentially messy even if the cat didn't kack and shake it off all over me.  But the final kicker is that it is so expensive: $75 to $225, depending on where you have it made, which meds included, for 30-day supply.<br /><br />So we went back to the pockets for a second try.  We gave her breakfast first, and tore out little pieces of the pill pocket to wrap each pill - totaling 3/4 of one pocket.  Thank everything that lives on earth, it worked, and for three days she's been tolerating them well. I have to wait around a bit after breakfast, until she forgets she's just eaten to give her her "treats", but this is like heaven.<br /><br />Update: It's been a couple of months and she now tolerates a whole pill pocket broken up with no problem at any time of day, with or without a food buffer.  She still looks forward to her treats!

I gave him 2 Pill Pockets without the pill just to see if he would eat them, and he loved them.  I placed a pill into one of the pockets and pinched it closed, then gave him the one with the pill, followed by an empty one.  Not a trace of pill or Pill Pocket left behind!

I even tried to starve her just she would eat anything I would serve. I guess Sophie my cat would rather go hungry than eat food laced with medicine. After almost giving up a friend mentioned this to me. I 1st tried to feed her 1 pill pocket w/o a med that worked, then I fed her another pill pocket w/1 pill inside. OMG success! I felt so happy.

I've even given him some pretty noxious tasting pills in these, like flagyl, and down they go. Thank goodness because giving him pills is not easy!<br /><br />Three complaints though.<br /><br />1) They contain wheat gluten which is really tough on a lot of kitties digestive tract.<br />2) The non-allergenic ones without wheat gluten, my cat doesn't like. I suspect it's the pea protein... have you ever tasted pea protein?  It tastes hideous.<br />3) Too expensive! At my vet's they cost almost $8 and I paid $11 for them once.<br /><br />You really do need to be careful not to get the pill's flavor on the outside I think they state that on the instructions.

review/text: I have to give my cat 2 pills everyday.  I am horrible at force feeding the pill and feel awful when it comes to that.  My cat would eat the Pill Pockets brand that I purchased from my Vet.  My Vet switched brands to Greenies and my cat won't touch it.  I tried covering the Greenies Pill Pocket in tuna "juice" and cover the pill pocket in wet food, he didn't fall for it.  I purchased this product because it said it was the Pill Pocket brand.  I received the Greenies brand.  I e-mailed the company that sent me the product and they informed me that Greenies bought out Pill Pockets.  The company that shipped the item has offered to take back the item and are sending me a pre-paid package to send it back.  They have also said they will provide a refund.<br />What I have found that works, some of the time, is covering the pill in cream cheese (rolled into a little ball), chicken and beef.  If these do not work, I sandwich the pill between two soft treats and mold them together so the pill is fully covered.<br />Greenies Pill Pockets might work for you and your cat, just not mine.<br />Good Luck.

review/summary: Great concept/didn't work for my cat.
review/text: I have a cat that must be given a daily pill.  It has been getting more and more difficult to struggle with him to take the pill, so I purchased these pill pockets hoping they would solve the problem.  But, they only worked on my cat two times.<br /><br />The first time I put a pill inside one of the pill pockets and gave it to him---he ate it without a second thought!  The second time I tried it on him, he thought about it for a minute...and he eventually ate it.  Ever since then...he will pick it up in his mouth, but then spit it out!!!  I don't know if it is because he doesn't like the texture of the pill pockets (they are kinda "mushy" and he is more of a "crunchy" treat eater), or maybe he senses that there is something inside?  Or...maybe he doesn't like the flavor.<br /><br />Guess maybe I'll try a different flavor.

review/summary: Absolute Lifesaver
review/text: I really didn't think these would work, my cat is pretty smart and also a picky eater. He just got put on thyroid medication twice a day for the rest of his life and the first few days of administering pills left me gushing blood - he bit the heck out of me including one bite that went right through my fingernail. I started crushing up pills, dissolving them in milk and squirting it into his mouth but was seriously wondering if I would ever be able to go on vacation again and expect a pet sitter to do this. So I was willing to try anything. He didn't even give the pill pocket a second thought - snarfed it right down and came looking for more!!

review/text: I really wanted this to work for my cat. He's recently been diagnosed with MegaColon and has to take a pill 2 times a day.<br /><br />The first time I tried this, it was a success. Second time I tried it.....Cat found the pill and spit it out along with the rest of the pill pocket in his mouth. Now he won't even eat the empty pill pocket. =/<br /><br />The pills are Gel capules and hardly fit in the pill pocket (I had to use 1 and 1/2 pill pockets to fully cover the gel capsule)...maybe thats why this didn't work..If you have a smaller pill it'll probably work better.<br /><br />*I might give the chicken flavor pill pockets a try, heard they're a bit bigger then Salmon pill pockets.

They may be a bit more expensive than other bones but my G/S likes to be entertained by me so anything that keeps him occupied for a while without my participation is worth the money!<br /><br />I gave this 5 stars because it is a product that my dog likes. I didn't want to be unfair and give it 4 stars just because I wish it lasted longer. Realistically, how long it last will depend on your dog. Mine is energetic, big, has sharp teeth and a powerful jaw. They may not last long for us but he likes them. So if these keep him chewing for a half and hour or so then that is worth 5 stars and the money.

I understand that they are now building a baking facility in the US - I guess most of their products, if not all, were coming from Europe. ???<br />What I don't like are the prices being charged online.  If one of our somewhat local Walmarts have the bread, it is about $5+.  I think there is another supermarket that carries it for about the same price.  Online prices can be as much as $7.50/loaf.  Ridiculous!  A lot of us who must eat GF food are also dealing with major medical costs associated with the diseases that force us to go GF.  I will never pay the exorbitant prices.

I tried and it doesn't thicken the cream as acidic juices usually do, and you can't add any sugar or sweetner or it will become too sweet, the syrup is already sweet enough. Keep in mind that, if you intend to use sweetened condensed milk (which is what I did), it will be way too sweet.

Looks like they cut the stinger off of its tail (see my customer image), so it appears as if this product is not actually poisonous. I'm not about to taste it though to find out. Why does such a thing exist? That's not for me to answer. I'd say this thing is worth the purchase price just for the story value. Or prank value. Or internet marketing phenomenon, 'snakes-on-a-plane' style.

review/summary: AMAZING
review/text: We buy this cat food from Petsmart for like 35 dollars so like 40 after tax. It last like two months for both our cats we have. They are sooooo healthy, full of energy, their coat is so shiny and soft. They love the taste of it. It took a while for my girl cat we adopted to adjust to it, (clearly ate crappy food) shes had no hair on her belly and just awful, now she looks sooo healthy and has SOO MUCH HAIR, super fluffy!!!<br /><br />The wet cat food is great too, actually smells like human food, not like vomit like most cheap cat food smells like. Give it to them once in a while for treats, they LOVE it and get super happy!

review/summary: Both my cat and I LOVE Natural Balance ... she is happy, helathy and this food helps minimize the hairball activity!
review/text: Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals. I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food. Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.<br /><br />I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis. A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing. I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results. I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food. I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity. I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it. This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:<br /><br />* Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.<br /><br />* Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.<br /><br />* Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />* Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.<br /><br />* Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.<br /><br />* High Digestibility<br /><br />No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.<br /><br />If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco or head to the Natural Balance website. Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals. You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat. I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic. I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days!<br /><br />Note:  This is essentially the same review I wrote about Natural Balance a couple of years ago, but my cat still loves it and I'm still buying it ... on Amazon.

review/summary: Natural Balance Indoor Ultra Premium Dry Cat food
review/text: This product has been recommended to me by the shelter that I adopted my new cat from and also the vet that I took her to for her wellness visit.  The price is good especially for the product that I am getting.  It's an excellent source of dry food for my indoor cat and she likes it so this pleases me.<br /><br />I would easily buy this again and again.

review/summary: Really Works
review/text: This is an excellent product that really keeps dogs teeth clean. My dogs like it much better than greenies. It may not work for you if your dog is an aggresive chewer, if you have an aggressive chewer I suggested getting though breathless for the water. I marked with four stars instead of five because I think it is expensive. I buy it though because I am very happy with the results and my dogs always get good comments on their teeth at the vet.

review/summary: Wonderful treat gone bad
review/text: My two dogs USED TO LOVE these treats. Just the right size - not giant (and therefore affordable) but they still took a while for them to chew through. These WERE their favorite treats. And they were healthy and good for their teeth and gums.<br />But having received a recent re-order, I am now editing my own review and downgrading from five stars to one. THEY HAVE CHANGED THESE TREATS. They are NOT WRAPPED IN CHICKEN anymore. They have some kind of PAINT on them instead of chicken. It doesn't even smell like chicken. This is so disappointing. If you are re-ordering these thinking you'll get the old wonderful Chewritos - you won't. Change is significant enough that I recommend NOT ORDERING. It's misleading labeling. It's NOT a chicken wrap. It is a rawhide wrap that has been dipped in some kind of chemical/yeast/smoke flavor coating.

review/summary: Now basted not wrapped!
review/text: This product used to be great and my yorkie loved it. She spent time pulling the thin duck wrap out of it.<br />Now, instead of duck wrap we have duck paint with some bits floating about. A rip off and  misleading. My dog rejected this product and is complaining.

review/summary: Sorriest excuse for a dog treat I have ever purchased
review/text: Product says "duck wraps rawhide treats", sounds great, right? well this is the sorriest dog treat I have ever purchased, and I have purchased a lot of them.  First, there is no duck, the item is coated with some brown crusty dyed-on stuff, looks like it is painted on.  Then the so-called rawhide is more like a 3 by 4 inch piece of cardboard, folded into thirds.  I know cardboard when I see it!  My dog likes to lick the brown stuff off, but then nothing.  And he even likes cardboard!! don't waste your money.

review/text: The quality of treats are not the same as before. My dogs are spoiled but they will not eat this batch.  Beefeaters has scrimped on what made them good.  Will not order them again and will be returning these.

review/summary: Agree with "basted not wrapped"
review/text: Like others, I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it. I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine, my dog LOVED them like always! When I went to re-order, I read the review about the treats now being "basted" with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird, because my order was the same. That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched. We are both VERY disappointed -- not at Amazon, but at the manufacturer for changing their product

review/summary: Will No Longer Buy These!
review/text: Retracted my ringing endorsement of the product from 6 months ago.  Like other reviewers, I just now experienced Beefeaters (the manufacturers) switch from an excellent product to one that is subpar at best. Even more insulting is the dramatic increase in price $5.99 to $8.99-$10.99 per pack) for this terrible product. My pug will no longer touch these "duck wraps", the product name is false advertising at best. Previously these rawhides were wrapped with dried duck.  Now they are spray painted orange and smell funny.  I have nothing against the online sellers of this product.  However these sellers should contact Beefeaters and voice concern about losing so many loyal buyers.  And the buyers?  Well all of us should contact Beefeaters customer service and voice your disappointment regarding the duck wrap product change. Fingers crossed we can get back to the excellent duck wraps of the past for our beloved dogs!
