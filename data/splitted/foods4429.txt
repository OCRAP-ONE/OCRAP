review/summary: unethical and misleading labeling...
review/text: Amazon doesn't allow zero star reviews...and the one star I had to allow is far too generous.  This product deserves about a negative 10 star designation.  It is not organic (one reviewer described finding it in the "organic" section of their local grocery store).  The label on the bag claims "100% pure & natural granola" (this claim is meaningless) and on the back has the following:<br />"No artificial flavors; No cholesterol; No hydrogenated oils; No high fructose corn syrup; No artificial preservatives; 0 g trans fat"<br /><br />Notice it does NOT claim to be GMO-free and the likelihood is that this granola DOES contain GMOs, as it has non-organic canola oil.  Please be aware that "Bear Naked" is not some folksy brand - it is a subsidiary of Kelloggs...the same Kelloggs that has donated substantial amounts of money to defeat a California November 6th Right-to-Know Ballot Initiative (Proposition 37) that would require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods and would, in the words of the Organic Consumers Organization put "an end to the unethical practice, unfortunately common even in the alternative food sector, of marketing or labeling GMO-tainted food as "natural."<br /><br />The group GMO Free USA, has launched campaign #1: Boycott Kelloggs, noting "In this digital age, you have to wonder why a company would spend more money than it could possibly cost to change their product labels to fight against the consumer's right to know what we are eating."<br /><br />Why, they might even have to label a seemingly "clean" brand like Bear Naked with the truth...and then how much of this phony product would they sell? Don't be fooled...I certainly won't be buying from Bear Naked again...or any Kelloggs products.

review/text: Bear Naked Granola Fruit and Nut is our very favorite granola, but my order on 1/5/07 arrived, and the batch I ordered did not seem as fresh as the others I have ordered.  Specifically, the raisins in each bag were so hard we had to spit them out. So hard you could not chew them.<br /><br />The other six bags I ordered on 1/5/07 were a gift.  I sure hope the batch the recipient received was not that stale.<br /><br />Our previous orders of this same product proved to be just great!

review/summary: Super! But nutritional information is devious.
review/text: This is my favorite granola. Great taste, chewy, generous with nuts, natural ingredients, and the company has a wholesome and green attitude. Super! There is one significant caveat . . . they are very devious with the nutritional information, so beware!  The "serving size" is listed as 1/4 cup, enough to feed a small bird. I always mix this with Post Shredded Wheat/Wheat'n Bran (and use soy milk), probably the most nutritious and honest cereal out there. Perhaps the only cereal with no sugar or sweeteners (or salt). Tasty and plenty of fiber, too. And reasonably priced. If you are concerned with healthy eating, don't pass Post Shredded Wheat, Wheat n'Bran by. It has a nice crunch and taste, though mixing it with Bear Naked Fruit and Nut makes for a more roundly delicious meal. The Post Shredded Wheat/Wheat'n Bran lists a serving as 1 1/4 cups. Realistic. Compare that to Bear Naked's 1/4 cup and you will see that Bear Naked, despite its great taste, is extremely caloric. 1 1/4 cups of Bear Naked has 35g of fat, or 55% of the Daily Value and 700 calories! 1 1/4 cups of the Post cereal has 2% of the Daily Value and 200 calories. So for taste and enjoyment I would give Bear Naked five stars, but for the dishonest nutritional information, I lower that to 3.

review/text: I never expected granola to contain flax seed -- something I'm allergic to.  I sat down to a nice bowl of granola, and it sure tasted good! Then my throat started to itch. Then my stomach started to cramp. I stopped eating and checked the label -- sure enough, near the bottom, 'ground flax seed'.  My husband, who is not much of a granola eater, tried some a few days later, and although he isn't allergic to flax, he found it still made his mouth and throat itch. If you're not allergic to flax, by all means enjoy it, but if you are -- DON'T TOUCH IT!

review/summary: Premium Price - SoSo results
review/text: Ordered the Acana Ranchlands because of the reviews that I saw on various websites.  The dog (Miniature Poodle) liked it so-so, and then the worst part was his stool became really, really (!!) HARD on this food.  Tried other Acana varities (e.g., Grasslands) - and had the same result.  He was nearly constipated on the Acana and had a very tough time trying to pass a stool.  Then the stool itself had a very hard consistency - not at all normal.<br /><br />So, for the money, I would say pass this up and go for something else!!  We've switched to Taste of the Wild (which is also grain free) and are finding that the dog loves it as much - if not more - and aren't having any of the stool issues that we did with Acana.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I've had better green mint teas, but really only in restaurants.

These are great for training because they are soft enough to break into small pieces and the cat can eat them quickly and await your next command.  You do need to keep them sealed and in the refrigerator after opening and use before the expiration date.

review/summary: Cats favorite treat
review/text: I have a fish driven cat, vs chicken or beef products, and he absolutely loved them.  I had to keep them wrapped in something that wouldn't let the smell through and up and away from his reach.  He could smell them through just about everything, even though I couldn't.  He would have ripped through anything to get to them.

review/summary: Great special treat
review/text: My two young Siberian Huskies like these.  A lot.  The only downside is that 2.5 oz of freeze-dried treats is REALLY small for Siberian Huskies.  The container is about 2" to a side with the treats closely packed of varying sizes.  Marked with "Made in the USA".  I have bought several other flavors of Stella & Chewy's products, all were well enjoyed by my dogs.

review/summary: My Picky Dog Loves These
review/text: We won our first jar of these treats in a pet Halloween costume contest but I wasn't  sure if my chihuahua mix would eat them.  He is a very picky eater.  Surprisingly, he loved them!  I would take them with me when we traveled because they easily stay fresh in the jar.  The duck treats come in very small pieces so they work well as rewards.  When the jar was almost empty I could not find anyone who sold them in our area.  Happily, I finally found them on Amazon.  They are a bit expensive but the jar lasts us a long time and my dog gets almost as excited when he sees these as he does when he sees bacon, so it is well worth it.

review/summary: Best Easiest Salsa You'll Ever Make!
review/text: This is not only the best salsa mix you will ever use, but also the easiest. This size packet is perfect too, makes the perfect size bowl for 2 people to enjoy. I just add a few fresh tomatoes if it's season or Red Gold whole canned (reg 15oz)work well enough in winter. I like the Classic Med. heat packages best because I can make several types of salsa from the same packet. For those who cant stand much heat, I might just add some chopped green pepper & onion. Add some finely chopped cilantro if you want. My favorite is extra chopped green pepper & onion, finely chopped cilantro & either a chopped habenero or jolokia pepper for a great HOT salsa. Just add it all to the blender & "chop" it to the consistency you desire, give it 5-6 minutes for the flavours to blend & you have the freshest salsa you can get.

review/summary: Do Not Buy
review/text: I have a 33 pound 8 month old puppy who loves to chew (50% Pomeranian, 50% Australian Shepard). I sure caught the name "everlasting" in this product. I got her one and gave it to her the other day. She ripped it open and ate the treat (which is big) in 12 min, and then started to rip the rubber/plastic. This thing is garbage, any dog will rip right through it. Not only is it not "everlasting", it was about the worst lasting chew she has ever had. My advice is do not buy this product, your dog will eat right through it and end up ingesting plastic.

This is supposed to provide hours of interactive chewing challenge(as it states on packaging) but it didn't even give 5 minutes!

review/summary: Dog loved this toy, but my pocket book didn't.
review/text: The toy is a great concept.  My dog loved to roll it around and knaw on it.  Totally kept him occupied.  The unfortnate thing is this "everlasting" treat ball is far from everlasting.  My dog had both sides chewed down within one day.  After it was chewed down flat he wanted to have nothing to do with it.  The ball it's self is around 17 dollars and only came with one treat.  The ball fits 2 treats so you instantly have to buy the refill pack which costs about 8 dollars.  Cant afford 8 dollars a day in treats.

review/text: I thought it would be a good product for my rottie and bullmastiff, not so much, I was super mad that I spent so much money on something that didn't work. These are not cheap, and the refills are not cheap.<br />Pros:<br />Keeps them entertained<br />gives them a yummy treat<br />Cons:<br />keeps them entertained for about 5 minutes until they separate the treat from the ball. On the large size it is super hard to get the treat in the ball for the first time, but after the first round of play it becomes easier- there's a reason- the seal isn't any good anymore, so it's super easy for the dog to hold down on one side of the ball, and lift out the treat.<br />expensive<br />super messy, slobber and treat goo get all over this thing and on your floor<br />hard to wash and get dirt out of center folds

review/text: I bought one of these (the small size) from a pet store for my 15 lb Jack Russel mix. I was hoping for a toy that would hold together like a kong but was harder to get the treat out of. The first day we had it, it took a while for him to get the treat out but once he got it there was no problem and the plastic started to weaken. This wasn't a big deal because you can stuff the inside with more treats but after a while the plastic started to come apart in little chucks and the toy went from a possible kennel toy to have to be supervised...

review/text: Within the first day of giving this to my dog ( a large breed puppy), he chewed off several chunks of the ball on the side that holds the small treats and ate most of the "everlasting" big treat, but it kept him busy.  He chased it and chewed it, and even when I thought the treat was too gone for him to lick any more, he still was able to get more out of it.  While it's not as durable as it claims, it's durable enough and my dog does love it.  Also, it's dishwasher safe!

Unfortunately, the second dog I brought home from the shelter can get the large treat out in no time.  He then uses those strong jaws to break it up and swallows pieces too large for him to digest.  So I've had to stop giving them to him.<br /><br />If I still had just the pointer, I would have given this 5 stars.  So  you might want to try it to see if your dog will find it "everlasting"

review/summary: PitBull's best friend
review/text: I have a little pitty that chews through everything! No toy other then the black "extreme chew" Kong has stood the test of my dog Marley. I bought this on a whim after I had got fed up with wasting money on toys marketed as "super durable" and for "power chewers" that she would demolish in minutes and would ultimately end up garbage in a day. I figured the treat would keep her busy for while and the rubber felt fairly strong. Boy was I impressed! First though I have to mention that my dog has some unpleasant behavior with certain treat items (rawhides, beef bones, pigs ears) in that she has a drive to bury these things in what ever she can cover it with, which often tends to be bedding or under rugs. SO once I put the treat in the ball she was bound and determined to "bury" it in our apartment. The treat got nixed and I gave her just the ball. It has been her favorite toy for years! In fact she once lost it playing in her grandmas muddy yard on a rainy day, looked all over for it and gave up. She was devastated, kept searching for it at home, I was really surprised because she's never gotten attached to a toy like that before. I went out and hunted down a new one for her. Well about a year later while at her grandmas house I let her in from the yard and she's got TWO of these in her mouth the old one and the new one! Leave it to her to find it after all this time. I purchased the first one when she was 2yrs, it spent almost a year outside in Wisconsin's elements and yet it is still in perfect on condition going on 3 years old! Will post photo. Love this toy!

review/summary: Great for teeth, tough on the hands
review/text: I have a 50lb GSD mix who is, like many of the other dogs mentioned here, a ball of fur and teeth. We initially did not crate him (mostly because members of my family have a phobia of cages) and as a result are out four pairs of shoes, two pairs of prescription glasses, a desk, a leather chair, a leather couch, two desk chairs, and portions of our walls and several door jambs. Needless to say, we crate him now, but while that saved our furniture (what was left of it), it didn't solve our dog's need for mental stimulation. We saw this at Petsmart (for about 10$ more than it is listed here) and figured we had nothing to lose. (As a side note, he does now go to daycare 3 days a week, which helps with his energy levels substantially.)<br /><br />Our dog loves it! Where soft, squeaky, or any other kind of toy lasts only a matter of minutes (though he never did like Kongs) almost 7 months in, and the dog has yet to destroy the blue rubber ball. We have gone through at least a dozen packages of the "everlasting treats" made by the same company, which last on average about two days each for him. When we're out of those, we find we can put moderately sized training treats or bits of his kibble in the middle area and he has a grand time rolling it around and bouncing it off walls to get them out. In the summer we also like to smear peanut butter on the inside and freeze it for ten or fifteen minutes before giving it to him.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great investment for us. So much so that we ended up purchasing a second one that we fill with alternate flavors of treats or keep in reserve.<br /><br />My only complaints are these: One of the balls is very easy to get the everlasting disks into (consequently, it's also relatively easy for my dog to get them out again), while the other is so stiff it takes a very long time to get a disk into at all. After all that effort, I feel like my hands are completely worn out. (Edit: I hadn't seen a few other users trick of getting the edges of the treat wet to make it easier to slide into the ball. I will have to try that next time around). Also, the ball is expensive upfront, but lasts long enough to be worth it. The treat disks are also expensive, though, so that's something I've had to work into my budget.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a great toy for those dogs that need a toy that can stand up to them. Definitely recommended!

review/summary: My dog's favorite toys
review/text: I have a 70lb male Doberman who is capable of destroying nearly every toy I've given him.  The Starmark Everlasting treat toys, including this Everlasting Treat Ball are indestructible.  He spends hours playing and chewing this toy.  Sometimes he opts to just lay down and lick the treats I put in it.  You can opt to not use the everlasting treats if you don't want to.  Just throw some other treats in the center and the dog will be happy.  It's also a big enough toy that won't roll under my couch.  A huge plus.  I also tried some of the different flavor treats and my dog loves them.  I can't say enough good things about the durability of this toy.<br /><br />Some people mentioned that the treats pop out too easily.  I've seen this happen before, and for some reason only happened when I first got the toy.  I'm not sure if the inside gets stickier over time, but the treats have only popped out prematurely for my dog, and I put it back in and haven't a problem since.

review/summary: Beware of Carpet Stains
review/text: My 35 lb cocker loves his new treat ball. The postman brought the treat ball in the morning and the dog spent all afternoon playing with it. Because I was busy and the dog was happily occupied I failed to notice for quite a while that the Everlasting brand chicken treat that came with the toy was making nasty stains all over the beige wall-to-wall carpet in my office. I'm pretty sure my pup isn't any more slobbery than any other avidly chewing canine. But his slobber and the chicken treat combined to create a trail of ugly mustard-colored carpet stains all over the room. In addition to a bunch of spots all over the place, I found a few large stains in out-of-the-way places where my dog had settled for awhile to lick and chew away at the toy. The treat ball itself is just fine -- I have no complaints about it as a quality dog toy. But I have serious issues with the food coloring that's used in the Everlasting treats that pop into the ball. I've just used up an entire aerosol can of carpet cleaner and an hour of elbow grease to remove the stains from my carpet. After this experience I won't be buying any Everlasting brand treats to put in my pup's new chew toy. If you're going to be using this product outdoors, then the Everlast treats might be just fine. But if you're planning to let your dog play with this toy indoors, and you've got nice flooring that you care about keeping reasonably clean, it's best to avoid the Everlast treat inserts.

review/text: Excellent for my small-breed dog. Your dog may prefer specific flavors so try them all as they come in two chews to a pack, small size treat for small size ball/holder. My pup likes the chicken it came with, but does not care for the liver; I put a different flavor on each side. My dog loves to lick and chew this and it seems to not be affected. I think this is my dogs favorite chew toy and I highly recommend your dog try one of these. The chews seem to last a long time and not break apart, so far. I recommend all chewing devices be supervised during use.

review/summary: treat out in &lt;1 min. devoured in about 5 minutes
review/text: My dog loves the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YD8NS">StarMark Day-Glo Everlasting Fun Ball, Medium, Green</a> that you can stick treats into or just roll around and play fetch. I bought this one because I wanted him to chew on treats longer. He'll take his time with a small bully stick, but those get expensive. These would be more expensive because he had the treat out in a few seconds and chewed it up in a few minutes. Bummer!

review/summary: Keeps my dog busy for hours!
review/text: I had a friend who bought this for her malamute and told me he loved it, but that he figured it out very quickly and would somehow get the treat out in a few minutes. My dog is a more gentle pointer mix, so I thought I would still give it a try. I ordered it and have been extremely happy with it ever since! My dog is more of a "licker" than trying to chew or bite the treats off, so it lasts him at least an hour, and he absolutely loves it! He gets so excited when I bring it out for him to play with! I also love that you can buy a lot of great flavors. We started with the beef but they were so stinky and my dogs breath smelled awful, so we tried the mint ones and my dog loved them just the same AND his breath smelled better! The only downside is that my dog seems to have a little big of GI upset after chewing these in that his stool is a little softer. He also has a pretty sensitive GI tract in general, and my friend never reported her malamute having any issues so it's probably more of a "my dog" issue than with the treats themselves. I'm definitely happy with how the treat ball stands up to my dog's chewing and playing with it, and the one that belongs to my friend's malamute is still intact after years of use. This truly is a great product!<br /><br />I have definitely heard though of some other dogs finding a way to chew this apart, so if you have a very powerful chewer and want to try it, I would make sure to supervise them the first few times you let them have it.

review/summary: Truly Everlasting
review/text: This ball has lasted for almost a year with the zone of destruction that is my dog. She loves this ball simply for the fact that she can't defeat it. This thing even survived a battle with the riding lawn mower... The only reason why I didn't give it five starts is because the treats it comes with are too easy to get out. But if you stick treats in the middle compartment they last a bit longer.

review/summary: Works exactly as stated.
review/text: I had heard about these little toys about 2 years ago from my oldest sister who has a Shar Pei. She told me he absolutely loved it and she had to take it away because he would be panting out of excitement from chewing on it. I went to my local Petco and picked up just the treats without the ball to see if he liked them and the rest of my afternoon was spent chasing my Rat Terrier/Sheltie mix around my apartment trying to get the treat back.  Needless to say he devoured it after about an hour or so. I picked up the whole kit for about 19.99 at Petco. It comes with the ball and one chicken treat insert. I have read MANY reviews saying how there dog destroyed the ball or removed the treat in minutes. I'm not really sure how that happened as my little guy has pulled up carpeting before and has yet to even make much of a dent in the treat, let alone the ball. At first he was actually so frustrated that he just looked at the ball and whined/barked at us to get it out for him. Eventually I just took the treat out of the ball, let him lick it and chew on it just for about 10 seconds to get a taste for it again, and then I put it back in the ball.  He hasn't quit now for 45 minutes. I stuck some little treats I had laying around in the other side but it seems he could care less. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a way to keep their happy pet occupied and out of your hair!

review/summary: Great Feeding Puzzle
review/text: My adult dog was easily able to remove the included treat within a few minutes even when it was inserted backwards as another reviewer suggested, so I don't plan to buy refills. However, when I filled the toy with kibble, Regal and our Malinois foster puppy both had to work for a couple of hours to empty it. Neither of them damaged the toy so it seems to be pretty safe for them. However, as with any toy, I will continue to monitor them frequently to be sure they haven't managed to chew off a piece that could be ingested. The puppy still has most of her baby teeth so I don't know how the toy will fare with her in a couple of months when her mouth will resemble that of a crocodile, but Regal (a Bulldog/Siberian Husky mix) didn't faze the material and he is a dedicated chewer. I'd feel better about this toy if it were made in the United States rather than China but I believe it will be OK with restricted use. Regal gets all of his meals from food puzzles and this one adds some variety to the mix.<br /><br />I'm adding to this review because we have been using it for several months now. I raised the rating to 5 stars because it has been so useful and the dogs have not damaged it at all. The puppy mentioned above got all of her adult teeth but I was still able to put peanut butter in the toy to pacify her in the crate when she fussed. It kept her happy for a couple of hours and she was never able to bite off a piece of the material. We now have our own adult Malinois, Sizzle, and we use it with him as well. I put kibble in it and let him get his dinner that way when he needs to be crated. I bought another one so that I can give Regal and Sizzle their own. The new foster puppy is doing well without a peanut butter pacifier for now, but I won't hesitate to use it with her if necessary. I still suggest watching any dog carefully with a toy. They are all different, but so far our three serious chewers have safely enjoyed this toy for several months so I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Incredibly Long Lasting Treats, at Last!
review/text: We currently are fostering a Black Lab, and she likes to chew on anything and everything that might happen to fall in the floor. I tried getting her some rawhide bones and supposedly "long lasting" chew treats and she got through all of them in a matter of minutes. The everlasting treat ball has lasted for many weeks now and she is just about done with both sides. I put a BBQ treat in one side and the chicken flavor in the other and she loves both. She will sit and chew on it for hours. You can also put kibbles in one side and they fall out as they play for variety. If you have a dog that likes to chew, this is a must have.

review/summary: He Likes It!
review/text: I have an Australian Cattle Dog who, like most ACD's, tends to fixate on things . . . in the case of toys, this means destroying them as quickly and as thoroughly as possible (and then looking disconsolate because he has no toy). When I first put this down for him (with one of the everlast treats it came with), he wasn't particularly interested (though he did get anxious when the cats went near it, so clearly it was on his mind). But eventually he got into it. He worked the treat out pretty quickly and ate it with gusto. So I moved on to treats on the inside (a little jerky and some liver biscotti); it doesn't take him long to get them out, but he sure enjoys it. He's also getting a kick out of playing with it and chewing on it even now that it's empty. So far it's holding up, but I worry about those little flaps for treat entry; I can't imagine they're long for this world with his obsessive chewing. Frankly, I don't expect it to "everlast" -- but he's so happy in the meantime that I'm okay with it.

review/summary: Didn't realize my dog could love a toy so much!
review/text: I have an American Eskimo, she's only about 18 lbs but I got her the medium ball so that if she didn't take interest in it, I could give it to my sister's dog. My dog is very passive about the things I give her, she loves rawhide, but if Turq (my sister's dog) takes the rawhide from her, she doesn't care, same for pig ears, buffaloves, and all her other toys. She also chews through things pretty quickly, she's not very big but she can certainly destroy stuff. So anything everlasting sounds pretty good to me. I didn't realize how good it would be. My dog will always stare at myself and my family when we're eating, she'll beg and beg, until my dad gives her a scrap off his plate, she's completely spoiled. Doesn't matter what we're eating, she wants it, she'll drop anything to see if she can get some people food from us. Except this toy. Last night my sister and I were both eating and Kerrigan (my dog) wasn't even in the same room as us, and she was happily focused on this ball with the treat that comes in it. Even when I walked over her with my food, she didn't stop for anything. The first treat lasted about an hour for her, and she still plays with the empty ball a little, expecting me to throw it. It was also the first and only toy she has been possessive over, when Turq tried to take it from her, she growled. I love this product and I'd recommend it to anyone. I'll be getting refills as soon as I can make it out to the store!

They were awesome for about 90 minutes until the puppy started to eat pieces off the sides of the "virtually indestructible" toy.  I would never buy this toy again and would not recommend it to anyone.  Save your money and buy a pack of tennis balls for under $10.  They will last just as long!

review/summary: 4 stars for the toy; 2 stars for the treats
review/text: I keep buying puzzle toys for my Border Collie mix with the hope of finally finding one that will take longer than 10 minutes for him to figure out. I had high hopes for the Everlasting Treat Ball after reading so many good reviews. However, when I gave him the ball with the treat in it, he popped the treat out in about 5 minutes. I tried flipping the treat over so it points in as suggested by other reviewers and that lasted another 5 minutes or so. Then I jammed it completely inside the ball. That bought me another 5 minutes. I eventually had to take the treat away because he was eating it too fast. It later affected his digestion in a less than pleasant way. The treat is kind of gross-- it smells bad and leaves significant residue on the floor, dog bed, etc. I'm sorry I wasted the money on buying two (ridiculously expensive) replacement treats before knowing what I was getting into. That said, the ball itself is good for other things. I find that stuffing treats, frozen fruit, etc. inside of it keeps my dog occupied for much longer than the treat itself did. He spends more time with this ball than with any of the Kong toys he has, even the Kong Genius ones. I've also started feeding him his kibble shoved inside the ball. That way he has to work for a while to get his dinner instead of just inhaling it within 30 seconds. I'm still hoping, though, to find that holy grail of puzzle toys one day.

review/text: The treats designed for this thing are made from pretty poor ingredients,  and had my dog coughing for a few hours after eating one.  It also took 5 seconds for my dog to get the treat from the ball.  However,  i stuck a piece of beef jerky inside the ball,  and my dog was busy for an hour.  It was like catnip for dogs.  Toss the treat,  stuff something tasty inside the flaps in the center of the ball,  and its worth the money.

review/text: I have three boxers that destroy most toys.  I have found the Everlasting Treat Ball to be one of the most durable toys I've gotten for them.  They've figured out how to pluck the outside treats out and chew them separately and on that note, the outside treats leave a bit of slime and brown coloration on the floor/carpet/blanket but they do last a while.<br />In my opinion, the best part of this toy is the durability of the structure and the ability to put kibble or treats inside - that's the part that keeps my dogs occupied for hours.<br />Even though they've finally (over 6 months) damaged the structure of the toy, it is still usable to stuff treats in for their enjoyment.

We put some treats in here and she will play with it for a long time, which is great when I am trying to study for school. Only problem is the little treats that are meant to put in the middle fall out and she pops out the everlasting disk in a matter of minutes. We just break up other treats we have that stay in the center for her and we will be buying the interlocking everlasting disks in the future. We actually have to buy another because our older dog that never has any interest in toys wants to play with it and our new dog doesn't like to share.

review/summary: Great toy for a gentle chewer
review/text: The large Everlasting Treat Ball has been a great toy for our 55-lb Basset. It fits just about every type of treat, and you can choose different ways of stuffing it. Our dog isn't a big chewer, so we haven't had the problems that others have had with this toy.<br /><br />A few notes on our experience:<br />- MOST IMPORTANT: The rawhide piece you see in the pictures came out right away, and became a chew-disk rather than part of the toy. We had to take it away so she wouldn't accidentally swallow it. (And there's another, sad review from someone whose dog choked on the rawhide and died - rawhide can be dangerous!!) I'd recommend supervising your dog the first time and seeing whether the rawhide comes out. Don't buy replacement rawhides until you're sure you need them.<br />- You can vary the challenge level by how tightly you allow the tabs to hold a treat. You can fill the inner section with kibble, or you can wedge a biscuit or hard treat into the tabs, or you could freeze soft stuff in there. There's no need to buy special treats to fit this toy - it'll work with whatever you have.<br />- Our dog likes to play with this ball even after the treats are out, throwing it to herself and chasing it around the house. We now give it to her (filled with treats) when we're going out as a way to reduce separation anxiety, and it almost always keeps her busy so she doesn't notice we're leaving.<br />- It's silicone plastic, so it's softer and quieter than hard rubber toys on wood floors.<br />- It cleans up very easily in the sink or dishwasher.<br />- Unlike the Kong or the Squirrel Buddy, it has big holes on two sides (the holes in the picture are on both top and bottom). So I'm not sure how much of a mess it would make with peanut butter or frozen soft treats - we haven't tried, because hard treats work fine for us.<br />- Doesn't fit a huge amount, so probably wouldn't work to feed your dog. Our dog takes about 15-20 minutes to get the treats out, then plays with it for a little while after that.<br /><br />Different dogs have different interests, but I completely recommend giving the Everlasting Treat Ball a try for your dog!

review/text: This product is a Godsend! I work from home and have a 1-year-old German Shepherd who constantly panders for attention. She's a very strong chewer and usually tears through anything I give her within one day, at most. The Everlasting Treat Ball has withstood the test of time! It usually takes her a week to get through one of the treats and she'll spend several hours working on it, which helps me get a lot of work done. She usually loses interest once she gets it down to a half-inch "teething ring" type shape, so I pop it out using a butter knife and give her a fresh one. I highly recommend this product, with no complaints!

review/summary: Great toy, skip the "everlasting" treat part
review/text: We picked up one of these on spec from the local pet store and ended up ordering another from Amazon because our older dog loved it so much he wouldn't share. We've put dry treats and some fresh cooked meat in the center area and it's led to 60 minute-plus play sessions for our dogs. We have 80-100 lb. dogs so we purchased the large size toy which has worked out just right.<br /><br />The "everlasting" treat included and then sold separately as a refill by the company should just be skipped. Our boys figured out how to pop them out from the toy inside of 20 minutes and I think that the treat must be very salty as they needed a lot of water to wash it down.<br /><br />Long story short it's the best toy we've bought in a while for catching the dogs' attention and being something they keep coming back to play with.

review/summary: great treat to occupy my dog
review/text: I have had the medium one for a couple months. In that time my dog's adult teeth have come in. When she first got the treat ball, she would bark and whine at it in frustration because she couldn't figure out how to get the treat after she licked it flat. She has her adult teeth now. It takes her a while but she can get the treat mostly eaten now; she hasn't figured out how to pop the treat out yet. That's a good thing! I gave a large one of these to a Lab friend who had it for all of 10 minutes before popping both treats out. For now this is still a great treat for my dog, but I don't leave it out unsupervised because our other dog gets jealous even though he doesn't really care to chew on it (he has never been a big chewer). So, I don't know if she would chew through the plastic if I left it out all the time like I've seen in some of the reviews.

review/summary: Get the right size and you'll be happy.
review/text: I can't imagine that any dog is a stronger chewer than my seventy pound lab girl. I didn't think I'd find a toy that interested her that she couldn't destroy in seconds.  We're working on day three and still see only a little difference in how much is gone from the treat, and she LOVES it!<br /><br />I appreciate the advice of some of the reviews I've read here.  Make sure you err on the side of purchasing a larger, rather than a smaller, ball if you have a question about size.  We bought the large for Ellie.  I can see that a dog would be able to chew it to shreds if it were too small for them, because they could get their jaws wrapped around it easily.  I think part of the fun of the toy seems to be the challenge of getting a grip on it.<br /><br />I've liked a lot of the suggestions I've read here, including items to stuff in the middle, and putting the disks in upside down.<br /><br />The disks pop in easily if you put them on a hard surface, put the ball over them and press down, popping the disk in place.<br /><br />Today the ball rolled under the bed, all the way to the wall.  She crawled under the bed to get to it.  She is obsessed with this toy, and that makes us both happier, because this girl needs to chew and I'm tired of buying toys that she rips to shreds in seconds.<br /><br />I'm sold on this toy and will order more disks online.  They come right to my house that way.  Five stars, two thumbs up, and all that!!  Now I'm going to look at other Starmark products.

review/summary: Good toy
review/text: This treat toy would get 5 stars if it weren't for 2 very important things: 1) the small treat ball is almost impossible to get treats into, as the opening is so tiny; 2) my dog had the disc treat out and wolfed down in less than a minute. Now I also have this treat ball in the large size for my German Shepherd and have not had the same problem with the disc treat coming out so maybe it's a function of the size, I don't know.

review/summary: Best dog entertaining device yet!
review/text: I have a very energetic young dog who loves to chew but most bones and rawhides last no longer than 5 minutes.  This treat ball with one of the treats in each side lasted her days with hours of nonstop chewing until I would have to take it away for a while.  She loves it and so do I!  I will say, once there is only a little rim of the treat left along the side you may want to go ahead and take it away because I let her have it past that point and she sorta tore up the rim a bit that holds the treats in because she was trying to get the last bit out.  I think it will still work just fine though for hours more entertainment for her.  Great product!! By the way, for people who say it is dangerous or got destroyed by their dog here are 2 points to consider:<br />1. you should never let your dog chew on any treat or bone like this without supervision<br />2. yes this is a tough product, but some strong chewers will just naturally destroy anything that comes their way no matter how durable it is and that is something you should know about your dog.  If they are a very strong chewer then you should try products like this keeping in mind that it may not last very long.

review/summary: The dog loved it....a little too much
review/text: My Jack Russell terrier mix loved this treat. More than life itself. He had it out of the ball in no time flat, so that wasn't much of a puzzle. But the treat is like crack for dogs. It's the only thing he's guarded. He's never growled when his dinner or a juicy beef bone is approached. He'd leave either for a chance for some lap time. But not with this treat.<br /><br />So...I would be wary. I'm just hoping it won't make him guard other things now.<br /><br />Oh, and for the price? It seems like they could include two treats, which the ball will accommodate.<br /><br />ETA: the ball does seem to be durable, which is good.

review/summary: Not too "everlasting"
review/text: So my pup is smarter than the average... Pup. And she figured out this thing in less than an hour. I literally had just put it together and gave it to her new and when I got back home an hour later she already had one side out, and was working on the second already. To her credit she didn't need to shred the silicone mold to get the end treat out, but none the less, this shouldn't be bought as a stimulation toy.

review/summary: This toy is amazing -but smells
review/text: After 5 months of near-perfect behavior, my golden retriever apparently discovered the puppy within herself and started destroying nearly everything. Toys that we have had for her entire life were suddenly being destroyed and stuff strewed across the house as if it were a warning to all other toys. She was destroying and swallowing 3-4 inch pieces of rope, curtain ties, everything! So it is with desperation that I went to my local pet store in an attempt to find anything destructible. From previous experience, I knew she didn't like Kongs and I couldn't bring myself to purchase anything that was merely a used tire marked to up a pet-toy price. With that, I found this toy and another "indestructible" chew toy. While the other toy is good, nothing holds her interest like this product. It has drastically improved her behavior while crated and all other toys have been spared a painful death.<br /><br />The only downside is that the product doesn't smell the best. As she is always playing with it, that means it is always near us. We have tried instituting a "no toys on the couch" policy but its hard to enforce.

review/summary: Boxer loves it but doesnt last long
review/text: My boxer absolutely loves this thing but it doesnt last long because he is constantly chewing on it just wearing down the actual treat. With that being said he usually keeps chewing on the ball because it has some extra treat stuck in the edges.

review/summary: I'm still amazed!
review/text: I have a 9 y/o English Bulldog that is very food motivated. In fact, the only time he seems to be happy is if he's chewing on/ingesting something tasty. He goes through 9-inch compressed rawhides in a day and at $4-$6 a pop that gets pricey. He's got kongs and rollable treat balls but as soon as the food is gone he loses interest (naturally) and if he can't get the treats out easily enough, he gets bored and gives up.<br /><br />The Everlasting Treat Ball, however, is an entirely new ballgame! We had a rough start with it at first. He had the chicken ones that came with the ball and they really upset his stomach. If anyone knows about Bulldogs and their GI "issues" then you know that when their stomachs are upset, the entire house is miserable, if you catch my drift! (pun intended).<br /><br />Another issue we had the first time around was that he was able to get the second treat out within a few minutes (but not the first one it came with). That led me to believe that we weren't putting it in correctly, but no matter what we did, the end result was the same. So we gave up.<br /><br />On a whim I bought him some liver-flavored refills the other day and it's been almost 3 days and he's STILL working on the first one! It's a godsend! He'll leave it alone and come back to it a few hours later then spend another good hour or so with it. The best part about it (for us at least) is that there isn't any belly upset this time around! I paid around $8 for a refill of 2 and the first one alone has already lasted longer than a $5 rawhide...AND we don't have to dig slimy pieces out of his throat after he tries to swallows them. A win-win as far as I'm concerned.

review/summary: Large Everlasting Treat Ball + 1yo English Mastiff = Fun!
review/text: This is one of Mama's favorite toys. Sometimes I put small training treats and some larger treats inside. I don't bother to buy the refill discs. They are smelly, messy, and slimy. Plus, once they pop out if you aren't watching, they will be devoured in seconds!<br /><br />She has been unable to destroy it and has had it for at least 4 months.<br /><br />She can squish it in half with her chewing, but she has been unable to "tear" pieces off of it. She will play with it filled or not filled and she seeks it out when it is put away.<br /><br />Easy to fill by lifting a flap with one finger and stuffing (or dumping) treats inside.<br /><br />It's pretty heavy for a toy, but I've seen our yorkie pick it up and run off with it. (He prefers the Large Bento Ball).<br /><br />Large sizes are expensive at Pet Stores. If you don't need this toy right away, save the $$ and purchase on Amazon.<br /><br />2/21/12: Ball still going strong. Purchased the small sized for the yorkie, but it is way to small for Mama. I try not to let her have that one at all due to a potential choking hazard.

review/summary: Keeps an active dog busy for almost an hour at a time
review/text: We have a 75 lb doberman who is constantly on the move. We bought this toy and he loves it. He was able to pop the treat out within the first 15 minutes but we took it and crammed the whole thing in the middle of the toy. He now works at getting it out for an hour or more at a time. If he leaves the room where the toy is and comes back to find it, he immediately picks it up and starts playing with it again.<br /><br />He has only had it for 2 days but it seems to be holding up well.

review/summary: The best dog treat I have found!
review/text: I have a Newfoundland, a Golden Retriever, and a Westie.  Large, Medium, and small.  Each of them have their own toy and it keeps them occupied for HOURS.<br /><br />Okay ... yes, it can be a pain to force the treat into the ball.  And sometimes, they get the treats out quickly.  But when they stay in, it is a wonderful toy.<br /><br />I have taken toys before and placed wet dog food inside with some treats and froze them.  This works extremely well.  and since this toy is dishwasher safe, I just plop them all in the dishwasher with their food and water bowls and clean everything at once.<br /><br />I don't think you will be disappointed if you get this toy.

review/summary: Good, but...
review/text: I bought this with the hope of getting something that would give my dog a challenge in getting the treat out.  It took her all of 5-7 min before she had it out!  Either she was very smart at figuring it out or this was just too easy.  The concept is wonderful though and for a smaller dog it would probably be great.
