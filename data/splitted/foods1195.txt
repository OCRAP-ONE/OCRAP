review/summary: Inferior Product/Customer Service
review/text: Previous orders for this item just as I can buy at grocery.  Same great quality.  This time the first case arrived with many individual packages open, oatmeal spilled out.  Came in white box instead of red and labeled "not for retail sale" (red boxes do not say this).  Amazon resent another case, with my instructions to not send it if it were the white boxes (there is very little brown sugar/maple flavoring in the packets - unlike red packets).  Amazon sent the white boxes again.  I wrote to them but never heard back about my complaint.<br /><br />I have been ordering from Amazon for some time, but will not order this product again as it is inferior to the real deal.  I'm unhappy with Amazon's customer service for the first time, they dropped the ball on this order.<br /><br />If I could submit with NO STARS I would.

I searched for over 10 years. Although I didn't think I would find them on Amazon I gave it a try, and bingo, there they were. The Joan of Arc have just the right amount of spice and when I mix them with hamburger, onions, garlic and green pepper you get the best chilli ever.  If it wasn't for the Amazing Amazon, I would never have found them.  Thanks Amazon you guys are the greatest.

review/summary: The best !
review/text: This is the best gluten free, peanut free, and tree nut free,dairy free soy based butter on earth.  It tastes awesome and is safe for schools,  requires no fridgeration and is a healthy substitute to peanut butter.  I buy this all the time & it is available in creamy, chocolate and un-sweetened varities.  I LOVE this & so does my family;  we never buy anything else due to allergies of peanuts & gluten.  Nutritional facts are;  calories 190 for 2 tbsp, total fat 14 grams, sodium 100 mg, zero cholesterol, zero trans fats, protein 7 grams, fiber 4 grams and sugar 4 grams.  Its delicious with a honey taste so yummy you can eat this straight with a spoon from the jar.  This is identical to the creamy variety except it's crunchy with specks of roasted soy nuts for texture.  It is made from NON GMO roasted soybeans and has no trans fats.  5 stars on this brand !

review/text: My son has a peanut allergy so we had to find a substitute for peanut butter.  This product tastes pretty close to the real thing, and I think it's actually slightly healthier. I'm really glad that Amazon now sells this by the case, because my local grocery store was charging way too much for this product and my son was consuming it like crazy.  It was getting very expensive to feed him and very inconvenient running to the grocery store constantly.  Amazon has now solved both problems.

review/summary: more than a peanut butter substitute
review/text: i love peanut butter, but my wife is highly allergic. of coarse i can eat as much as i like but then it's decontamination time for me and the kitchen. now we have two children and they can spread p.b & j from here to timbuktu. i first saw "i.m. healthy" soy nut butter (maybe 10 yrs ago) at a natural foods store and brought it home for my wife to try. she loved it and has been eating it almost daily. the kids, we were afraid, might have the same peanut allergy so we started them out with the soy nut butter. in time we discovered they are not allergic to peanut butter at all but are allergic to tree nuts. (weird huh?) so they've been eating the soy nut butter too, they like it much more than peanut butter. i myself have been gradually changing over to the soy nut butter and eat it all the time! it's better than peanut butter on things like apples and celery.<br />btw~ the containers are great for odds and ends like nuts and bolts, loose change or even other food. (wash by hand though they warp in the dish washer)

review/summary: Great Soy Nut Butter
review/text: Due to my daughter having a peanut allergy we made the switch to soy nut butter.  What I like about this brand is that the oil doesn't rise to the top as in some other brands.  You don't have to stir and stir and stir and make a mess before you use it.  The price on Amazon.com allows me to purchase five jars and get the sixth free, so that is roughly $1 off a jar from what I pay at the store.  Yes, I go through a lot of soy nut butter!  The taste is very good, too! I would recommend it.

That being said, two of my children love it!  The other child does not, but he has a life-threatening allergy to peanuts and tree nuts, so I suspect his dislike stems from that.<br />This brand soy butter is a great replacement in cookies, etc for peanut butter.  It is much thicker than the Wal-Mart brand creamy style.  We have been using this product for a few years and there can be quite a bit of variation in thickness of the soy butter from jar to jar.<br />Overall, this is a great product and this 6 pack was a great price!

review/summary: Not entirely like the real thing, but still pretty tasty!
review/text: If you're like me, you are probably considering purchasing this because you are allergic to nuts. (Or maybe you are just a fan of soy products.) Whatever your reasons are for not being able to eat regular peanut butter, I feel your pain. Until I was diagnosed with an allergy of the bad sort, I loved eating peanut butter straight out of the package & I almost immediately started looking for a replacement. This one was the first one I purchased.<br /><br />This product contains no peanuts or not products, so if you have a terrible allergy then you will have no problem with this- assuming you don't have a soy allergy. The taste isn't bad. It doesn't exactly taste like peanut butter but it's fairly close. It's just got that slight taste of soy that most soy products tend to have. In fact, the taste is pretty darn good. The texture is where I had a problem. The crunchy bits of it were fantastic, but after a moment of having the spread in your mouth the texture becomes slightly grainy. It's not an alltogether unpleasant feeling, but it's different from the texture of peanut butter.<br /><br />Overall though, I really liked this product. It tastes enough like peanut butter to satisfy my cravings & is pretty yummy. The texture is a bit strange, but I will probably get used to it after a while. (The switch from eating nuts to choosing soy products just happened recently.) Besides, slap on a little jam or marshmallow fluff & it's faboo. I heartily recommend this to anyone looking for a nice nutritious & nut-free peanut butter. (Now if they'd only make a Nutella version of this...)

I love almond flavor so the almond is my favorite but they make all different flavors (natural, of course, not artificial) even one that just tastes like plain coffee.  I should add that the flavors in the flavored ones are subtle, it still tastes mostly like plain coffee with just a hint of almond or whatever flavor you choose.  They smell great too!

I make this in my espresso machine, And it comes out perfectly, with a beautiful crema. The chicory flavor is a bit strong for my taste, which is why I gave it four stars.

review/summary: Wow.  This is really a life saver.
review/text: I tried this when I started seeing a holistic doctor who said I had to stop drinking coffee (I was up to 4-5 cups per day and loved it).  I was down to one cup of coffee per day but missing the warmth of coffee in the cold weather.  I was sure I'd never get down to zero cups, but I got some Teeccino and it is really awesome.  Warms me up like coffee and tastes very much like coffee.  AND, it doesn't make me shake or give me acid indigestion.  I've only tried original and this flavor - they're both good.

review/summary: The best of the Teeccino flavors!
review/text: In an effort to wean myself from coffee, I turned to various coffee substitutes. Postum was actually pretty good, but they don't make it anymore. I tried some other instants without finding what I was looking for. Then I tried Teeccino products. This is absolutely my favorite flavor, especially if I add a tablespoon of carob powder to the almond amaretto in a 4-cup coffeemaker. It's good on its own, too, but the carob adds another layer of pleasure. Excellent price at Amazon (it was like getting one free!) and great service.

review/text: Hmm; well, I should've read the description more carefully. I didn't realise this is a natural alternative. All-the-same, the flavor, to me, was most overwhelming. Next time, well, after actually reading the directions, LOL (I just brewed like my usual coffeee which I LOVE, btw) I'll blend to dial down the flavor several notches. Also, I'm a huge almond flavor lover. Maybe I did it wrong, it's just so strong to me.

review/text: I am not much of a fan of Amaretto.  I followed the advice from other reviewers (purchased the variety pack and tried them all).  The Amaretto and Vanilla flavors are my favorites.  I normally don't drink flavored coffee but that is about to change.  I am so glad to have found this caffeine free option so that I can continue to enjoy a cup or two in the morning.  I really suggest you order the variety pack first and find out what suits your taste.

review/summary: Best Coffee Substitute Yet
review/text: This has the closest flavor we've yet found to real coffee, and makes a wonderful after-dinner substitute. It also blends well with real coffee for a less-caffein beverage. Between Teeccino and decaf (even "Swiss water process" decaf), I'll take Teeccino any day! And Teeccino's Almond Amaretto is in my opinion the most satisfying flavor.

review/text: This is a great flavored "coffee". The coffee flavor is strong enough for me to enjoy, but the Amaretto flavor is strong enough for my non-coffee drinking wife to enjoy a cup with extra cream. Of course, as will all Teeccino products I've tried, you get double the value in every package because you use half the amount of grounds that you use for regular ground coffee.

review/text: Our local market used to carry this product, but then they closed.  I was sooooo happy to see it on Amazon.  I use it every morning when I brew my coffee.  I use 1/2 coffee and 1/2 teeccino;  this cuts down on the acidity of the coffee.  Now I can drink as much coffee as I like and not worry about my stomach getting upset.  I've tried all the flavors and this one is my favorite!

review/summary: Tastes more like coffee than I could have ever expected
review/text: This tastes great.  Its smooth, no weird off tastes, no aftertastes, no stomach problems that coffee usually gives me.  Personally this one is a bit too sweet for my taste, even without adding sugar the amaretto is a tad overpowering, but then again I prefer really strong bitter coffee.  This goes great with dessert like materials as the sweetness is complimented by anything else sweet you may encounter.  Though for a 'first thing in the morning' cup, I need something with less sweetness like their original java flavor or their insanely delicious chocolate mint.  Overall, this actually tastes like coffee with almond amaretto sweetener and I would highly recommend it.  Go for the sampler package from the Teccino's website to give you an idea of what you like,  Im working my way through all 12 right now (each sample makes 2 large cups of coffee, about 40oz total).  I've only made it through 4 of them so far but I expect great things from the other 8.

My only complaint is that the flavors in the flavored coffees for this company could be more prominent but this is probably a personal preference. Also, purchasing the coffee through the automatic shippment option really makes for a great price. You can't get it for this price directly from Teecino.

review/text: The taste of Teeccino Caffeine-Free Herbal Coffee Mediaterranean Almond Amaretto is not the kind of taste I was looking for. I love the taste of coffee with no flavors added, but someone recommended this to me, so I tried it. My goal was to find something I could replace coffee with for a warm drink in the morning. But this is not it. I guess if you like the taste of Almond you will like it. But I thought it was going to be a mild flavor. Oh well back to real coffee until I can find something different.

To me they are my favorite cookies! I can see having these with ice cream, whipped cream or just all on their own. They are the best!

This sweetener works very well instead of sugar in most applications (beverages), though with black coffee it is clear the product is not sugar.  Its probably the acidity level in the coffee that creates a different result than that with Iced Tea, which tastes very good with stevia.<br /><br />Other Stevia products have tasted more like a chemical to me when tried.

It has a strong and very distinctive aroma that is heavy and sweet. The smell is reminiscent of herbal tea and is a bit vegetal and earthy. Upon my first drink, the feel is very full and creamy, a bit milky, and almost no carbonated feel to it. The taste is sweet, earthy, grassy, and herbal. It is somewhat bitter, but not so much since the sweetness has more of an effect on the taste. There is a slight milky and tea like feel on your mouth after you finish drinking it, and it is very sweet. I am not sure what it pairs well with but if anyone has any ideas, I would love to hear. Overall, it is a great tasting and sweet drink, but I personally wouldn't be able to drink the whole bottle due to the sweetness and the earthy/herbal taste. It is a nice drink to try at least once.

Google "blue 1 adverse reactions" for a long list of complaints. Heck even the FDA issued a press release linking this petroleum derived food color as "casually linked to fatalities." Buyer beware.<br /><br />I now make our own healthy "honey Catalina" using basic ingredients of water, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, sugar, onion, honey, sea salt, Italian seasoning, garlic, black pepper, turmeric and paprika (listed in order of quantity). I blend thoroughly and freeze the extra in 1 to 2 week supply freezer containers.

review/summary: Be Careful - "New Taste" or "Classic" Catalina Dressing
review/text: Update for 07/06/2012:<br />Excuse me, but ONE 16-oz. bottle of Kraft's dreaded and infamous "New Taste" Catalina dressing for $8.50??  Be very careful about this purchase from supplier 'Mi Antojito Latino.'<br /><br />My previous comment:<br />Some retailers seem to be scrambling to dump the "New Taste" Catalina dressing they have in stock after numerous complaints about the horrible reformulation of our old favorite Catalina dressing.  Beware of claims about whether the dressing you buy is really the "Classic" or the "New Taste" formula.  The difference is significant!  Just a word to the wise.

review/text: This cake looked beautiful, in the photo online, and I couldn't wait to get it! It came on time in a good container to keep the item frozen, but when I opened it and saw the cake I was very disappointed. The cake, in the photo, looks like on the top that it has a lot of frosting but it was flat and didn't have much at all. There was very little white chocolate shavings on the sides of the cake like it said that there would be. There was suppose to be a flower in the middle of the cake but there were none. This was a birthday cake and it was suppose to have "Happy Birthday" written on the cake, this also was not there. Now for the taste... It was the worst cake I ever tasted! It was suppose to have buttercream frosting but it wasn't buttercream at all! I really don't know what it was, maybe a whipped cream, but even if it was whipped cream it was awful! The cake was moist but it too didn't taste real well. I thought that maybe it was just me but when my husband took a bite, (I didn't tell him that I didn't like the way it tasted), he almost threw up!!!!! We threw it out. The customer service was nice and they tried to get me to agree to another try at the cake or for them to send me out something else that they have, but I wasn't going to take the chance again with this place. So they said that they would refund my money.

When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as "MADE IN CHINA". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!<br />One Star is much too high a rating. I had to throw out all the Dogswell products I purchased, Shame on Amazon for selling without disclosing the source!

review/summary: BEWARE - MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I am so appalled at this finding as my dog has been taking these treats for 8 years, now this explains to me why my dog became so ill back in October 2011 and still no diagnosis as doctors kept pumping me for money and told me all tests were negative. I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like "THREE DOG BAKERY" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label "MADE IN CHINA" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it. Thanks again for the reviews and concerns of the caring people out there.

review/summary: Dogswell chicken and apple, banana, sweet potato treats
review/text: I've purchased the 3 types of treats thru Subscribe and Save.  They are no longer supplied by Amazon and I am not surprised. You can still obtain them from other vendors on Amazon.  Be aware they look nothing like the product pictured. The quality has deteriorated and is now poor at best. The apple treats are now nickel sized pieces of apple(more like little sponges)and the chicken strip around the apple is nearly black in color. It is beyond hard. Whats with this?  The ingredients state this is supposed to be chicken breast!  BEWARE-THESE TREATS ARE MADE IN CHINA!!  I cringe to think what may have been substituted.<br /><br />There was no notice by Amazon that these came from China-known for manufacturing deadly dog products.  I would never have purchased them. I suggest you don't either.  My dog no longer eats them.  I have nearly $100 of product.  I can't with a good conscience donate these to the animal shelter or even toss them out for the crows. Inquire as to the country of origin before you buy - "distributed by" doesn't count.  There are many other safe and healthy treats available and they proudly state 'made in America'!

I spent several thousand dollars on vet care and testing.  It never dawned on me it could have been these chews -- I just realized that they were made in China and the brand is listed as one of those implicated according to this month's Whole Dog Journal.  Amazon should stop selling These until the manufacturer stops using their China plant.

review/text: I bought these for my Dalmatian for the first time about a month ago. He LOVED them...so much that even though I only gave him the recommended amount per day for his weight class he STOPPED EATING HIS FOOD.<br /><br />I went in to Petco and spoke with a customer service rep who told me a couple of people had come in with similar experiences. He said he was personally curious about it and did some research online and pulled up some reviews (which we looked up together while I was in the store) of people with the same issue. We discovered Dogswell now makes this product in China. Whether or not that automatically makes it unsafe I don't know but given the other reviews and the sign from my own dog I am no longer willing to risk it. Do some research - google "Dogswell made in china" and decide for yourself.

review/text: On occasion, my daughter and son-in-law will go away and leave their Shitsu (Dodger) with us for a few days visit.  When that happens he seems to come with all the material things that help make him happy.  That includes a large jar of assorted treats. Sometimes I'd wonder why they're called treats because he often doesn't get excited by any of the many varieties that jar contains.  I mentioned this to my daughter and she referred me to this product. We ordered it (from Amazon) on his last visit and I was amazed at how quickly he accepted and consumed them when offered. Unlike others which he might shun or sometimes take and may not actually eat, the Happy Hips treats were always eaten right away. Both Dodger and I rate this product as a "buy now".

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these.  I knew my dog liked sweet potatoes and because I've been buying Dogswell Happy Hips brand treats for years I thought we'd give it a try.  Here's the skinny:<br /><br />They are smaller than the other treats.  This is because they are pieces of dried sweet potato with chicken wrapped around them!  This makes them a bit chewy and thus should work well to aid in the daily cleansing of your dog's teeth.  There is no unpleasant odor, nor is there an oily or greasy residue.  They are the same high quality treats we've become accustomed to buying from Dogswell.  Our dog LOVES them and we'll be buying them again in the future as they are a nice change from the "meat" jerky varieties she has been eating for years.  Next time we'll try apple!

review/summary: Another favorite snack of my dogs
review/text: For them, they just like how they taste.  For me, I like the fact that they have the glucosamine added to them, and that they are just very basic food, chicken and sweet potato.  I would have given this 5 stars if it was made in the US.  I'll probably always, now, be somewhat suspicious of any pet foods or snacks that are made in any part in China.  My older dog is very creaky and arthritic, and so far we haven't found anything that helps ease her pain, so I can't attest to the healing properties of the glucosamine/chondroitin in these snacks, but I figure it can't hurt to feed her foods that contain them.

He is also a picky eater when it comes to treats and he takes these every time.
