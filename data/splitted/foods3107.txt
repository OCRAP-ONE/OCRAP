review/summary: Dogs go nuts for these liver treats
review/text: When I first go my Havanese puppy 1 1/2 years ago, the breeder suggested these liver treats for using when training.  My dog will do ANYTHING for these treats.  They even use them at the name brand pet hotel we use in Phoenix.  You have to be careful not to give too much, but my dog, Tanner, got over his separation anxiety when I started the routine of asking for a kiss, then giving him a treat and then leaving.  Now he just wants the treat, I have to beg for the kiss.

review/summary: Training Reward-High Protein and Non-greasy
review/text: Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats are wonderful used as a reward during obedience training. For a dog motivated by food, this is high in protein, low fat, and not greasy so that you may keep it in your pocket! Because a great deal of  treats are used during positive reinforcement training, I have found that by cutting the squares into pieces the size of my pinky fingernail, the dog is not being overfed and will be able to take the treat without having to stop and chew it up, clean the crumbs, etc. This product is especially good when training puppies, because it is a soft treat to chew, therefore, no pressure or pain on those sensitive gums while the pup is in the teething stage. I cut the squares up and place them in a plastic container. When the pieces are gone, there are powdery crumbs left which I sprinkle over the dogs food at feeding time. There is no waste with this product. I have been using Pro-Treat for more than 15 years. The quality is excellent, and I found the best price to be on Amazon after doing a considerable amount of comparison shopping.

review/summary: Rolls Royce of dog treats.......
review/text: This product is a real bargain, considering the fact that dogs love liver. I've used this as an addition to another dog treat product I use for my dog. My dog goes nuts when he knows that he's about to be rewarded with<br />Pro-Treat Beef Liver treats. The instructions advise to give 2-3 pieces per day when using. At this rate, the container will last you a good while. The product itself is very fresh and the pieces are all of various sizes and thickness. Average size of treat is small rectangular pieces of different thickness. They're easy to break into smaller pieces if necessary. My Springer Spaniel pup is 5 months old and he just loves these. I tried this product on my girlfriend's 10 yr old teacup Poodle, who is pretty slow at this point in her life. She absolutely came to life and jumped all over the place for a taste of one of these treats. Buy it....your dog will love it!

review/text: My dog is a rescued stray.  You'd think she'd be happy to eat any treat offered to her.  Not so.  She's pickier than any dog I have ever seen or heard of.  I have thrown away many bags of treats and dog cookies.  But these things, she adored.  And since they are real liver, they aren't just processed grains flavored to taste like meat.  I recommend them to any dog owner.

review/text: The product is wonderful! It stays clean and dry in your pocket and dogs will obey your every command to get a treat. But, it is very expensive and you are suppose to limit the daily amount, so I cut smaller slices of each cube to make it last longer and give my dog less product each training session.

review/summary: Our dog loves them!
review/text: Freeze-dried liver treats are easy to carry around in a treat pouch, don't have to be refrigerated and, so far as I know, are healthy, high-protein snacks without a lot of chemical additives and preservatives. All of those attributes are nice but wouldn't be so important if the dog didn't like them. Our dog, who gets lots of small, bite-size treats as part of his continuing training, gets tired of diced sausage-shaped moist food from the pet store and cut-up franks from the grocery, but he'll run a mile for a liver treat! I do wish they were smaller and/or less expensive. We usually cut them in quarters with a sharp knife to make them last longer.

review/summary: best dog treat-- great for training---  all dogs love them
review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%

review/summary: Pure Puppy Addiction
review/text: Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Liver Dog Treats / B000255OIG<br /><br />This is the sort of product that makes me wish I could give more than 5 stars... My puppy absolutely adores these liver treats - our dog trainer calls them "puppy heroin". With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat - and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.<br /><br />These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training. Really, once you try this treat, you will never need another!<br /><br />As always, purchase and shipping from Amazon was easy and painless, and the liver treats were packed carefully enough that there was no extra treat breakage - which is remarkable for dried treats.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Travis loves them; inconsistent in size.
review/text: I have ordered these a number of times for my terrier mix (part pit bull?) - usually a little cheaper than in-store.  I initially used them for training only and then found that with the larger pieces I could jam a piece or two inside a chew toy, hide a treat toy or hollow bone that has already stood Travis' test and this can give my dog hours of enjoyment.<br /><br />My issue with them - and why I went with a 4 instead of a 5 - is the size of the pieces are inconsistent.  My first couple times there was a good mix of some larger squares - 3/4" - 1" cubes and smaller that I use for training bits.  My last order was completely smaller pieces - making it difficult to use it inside a toy/ bone as they come out too easily. Play time no longer lasts as long.<br /><br />I am hopeful that my next order in line with the others and have a mix. I would have given it a 5 prior to my last order.<br /><br />As a training treat these are AMAZING.

It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!

review/summary: This it like dog heroin.  There's nothing my dog won't do for liver treats.
review/text: I've been using Freeze Dried Liver treats to train and reward my dogs for about 20 years.  It is like dog heroin for my dogs, there is nothing they won't do for these treats.  It makes training a breeze.  My current dog, Samson, will sit in front of the pantry and drool until I give him a treat.  The treats are expensive so I cut them in quarters so they last longer.  These are 100% meat, no scrap or filler.  These are the only treats I give Samson, my Rottweiler.  You can't go wrong with these treats.

review/text: I was pet sitting recently and the dog I was sitting for had these in her treat pouch. She loved them so I tried them with my dogs. All 3 dogs were quite well-behaved whenever they saw me reach for these goodies. My son and I jokingly call them "doggie crack". They're good for them, they work as training tools, what else can you ask for in a dog treat?

review/text: These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog.

review/summary: Great treat, but probably not for small dogs
review/text: These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites.

The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.  I do cut up the larger pieces as I don't want to give them too much at once.  The prospect of getting one of these treats makes them much more receptive to training and just coming when you call.  Also, we find the largest size very economical as you don't pay for shipping.

review/text: My 2 year old German Shepherd loves this treat.  I keep it on my counter as a quick and handy treat for "mini, spontaneous training sessions".  The only issue I have is that most of the treats are a bit big and difficult to break into smaller pieces which is necessary for obedience classes where we go through many treats.  Therefore, I do not use these treats for that purpose.  (The container recommends only 3-4 cubes per day for large dogs).  Having said that, they are an excellent treat for occasional use and I would highly recommend them.

review/summary: My dog would do anything for this treat
review/text: By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay, but it does have a really strong odor when you open it; for that reason we always keep a small ziploc with the treats in it that we use regularly and only open the bin to refill that bag.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the sizes of the treats varies incredibly - but if one is too large we just split it, we will give 2 of the small ones, and the powder and bits at the end just go in his dinner one night for an added treat!

These are made from honest-to-goodness chicken breast meat and not the kind that are shaped and formed by processing lots of chicken meat(and filler or edible adhesive stuff) into a chicken tunnel filled with some filling. If you want a real treat, try these. (Consider how many you are feeding, and buy accordingly!)

First, I tasted one mushroom right from the oven, then I waited until they cooled before the next attempt.  Then, I waited one hour and tasted the product again.  There was absolutely no taste.  I couldn't discern a crab taste or aroma; nor could I sense the taste of mushrooms.  I  felt like I had a mouthful of tasteless bread crumbs.  I'm not willing to ingest a boatload of calories while experiencing no taste, so I threw the entire tray of 9 mushrooms into the garbage.

review/summary: Coconut shrimp--coconut flavor OVERPOWERING...
review/text: We received these Omaha Steaks brand Coconut shrimp as a gift. I like coconut is some preparations (pina coladas, certain cookies), but I don't eat it as a snack. I enjoy the scent of natural coconut.<br /><br />Though these shrimp are edible, the coconut aroma and subsequent taste overpower anything else. Even from the oven, the only thing that I can smell is coconut. When eaten, they leave a strong aftertaste that for a while makes one wonder if by mistake you consumed a coconut-scented wax candle by mistake. This holds true even when drenched with cocktail sauce to try to drown out the coconut.<br /><br />I cannot imagine that the overpowering odor is natural coconut, which I find to be pleasant. One of the listed ingredients is "Artificial Flavor," which likely means that Omaha Steaks attempted to "enhance" the flavor in some way. Unfortunately, I can't tolerate the resulting smell, which is an integral part of the perceived flavor when eaten.<br /><br />In short, if you're a huge coconut fan, or if your sense of smell is inoperative, then these might be for you. If you are an occasional consumer of coconut, then proceed with great caution.

They, along with several other items, were a nod to brunch on Sunday, which I find is always kind of trying,in that people feel they must stay, but would rather be getting home.  The mini jars were a big hit.  Thanks,

review/text: My wife received these roses at work today, opened the box, closed it back up and brought them home. The colors are absolutely terrible - no red roses at all and the rest are all drab, washed out colors. There are a few yellow and pink but the rest are a pale, pale mauve color and the most horrible dirty tan color you have ever seen (those are now in the trash!!!) This was our first Valentine's Day since our wedding and needless to say, she was very disappointed.  I have ordered a completely different arrangement for her and will definitely think twice before ordering from ProFlowers again.

review/text: I've purchased most of the MCormick Recipe Inspiration packs at the grocery store and have foound most of them to be very good, especially this Quesadilla Casserole and the Asian Sesame Salmon.  The recipe card is included, so after you make it once, you need only have the spices on hand to make it again.  This casserole is a favorite with the men in my family.  Sometimes certain of the packs aren't available at the store.  It would be nice if Amazon would carry these in bulk and with Prime shipping.  I was told by a relative who works at McCormick that these recipe inspirations are experimental and so I don't know if they'll be around forever or not.  I personally wish they would keep bringing out new recipes.

review/text: We were looking for a Mexican meal, and I did not want to use the prepackaged products with lots of extra chemicals and sodium. This recipe inspiration fit the bill perfectly. It was a hit - which is not always easy with a 14 and a 9 year old!! As another reviewer noted, the recipe comes off the package, and I have the spices in the house, so it will be easy to recreate. There is definitely room for modification if you want to alter it too. We added sour cream at the table, which complimented the food well. You do have to purchase the ingredients of course; this is just the spice. But it was very helpful the first time making it, to have it all premeasured and ready to go.<br /><br />Definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Good in a pinch but consider the cost and other factors
review/text: First of all, this isn't a complete quesadilla casserole kit. It is simply the spices and seasonings you add to the quesadilla recipe on the package. So you'll need extra ingredients. And once you've made one quesadilla casserole, you don't have to buy the packets again. Why? Well...see below.<br /><br />First, consider the price ($6.99 at the current time). That's hefty for a few teaspoons of seasonings! By the way, I've also tried Mccormick Recipe Inspirations for Rosemary Roasted Chicken with Potatoes and while it was delicious, I didn't need to Inspirations package to create the exact same meal the next time around.<br /><br />Why? Because McCormicks lists each ingredient (in that case, paprika, crushed rosemary leaves, garlic and ground black pepper) and even notes the required amount of teaspoons to use for each spice or seasoning. So all you really have to do is save the back of the Inspirations packages and you can create the same meals - at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Yes, it may cost more the first time you purchase an entire box or jar of spices. But you'll end up saving money in the long run because they'll last far longer, making them far more economical. So by all means, grab a couple of the Inspirations seasoning packets to get the recipes for some yummy meals. After that, you can easily recreate the results. After all, it is all spelled out for you.

review/summary: My new favorite chocolate
review/text: I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to Lindt Chocolate, especially their Dark varieties. 85% has been my primary indulgence for awhile, with some 99% on occasion.<br /><br />Then I discovered 90%. It is truly a confection masterpiece. I expected it to be like 85% but darker or like 99% but sweeter. It isn't, it has a totally different flavor, rich in cocoa, lighter on the bitterness. I actually find it to be much smoother than 85%.<br /><br />For those that don't like Dark Chocolate, please realize that like wine, coffee and dark beer it takes a little bit of time to acquire the palate to appreciate the complex flavor. But if you go slowly, starting with 65% and going up to 70, 85% and 90% as your palate adjusts, you will discover how wonderful it can be.<br /><br />When you're starting out, don't chew on the chocolate, just let it melt in your mouth.<br /><br />I find that when I eat milk chocolate, it tastes good but it never satisfies me. Dark chocolate is different, it is rich and deeply satisfying.<br /><br />Enjoy your 90%,<br />Nicky<br /><br />p.s. This used to be much cheaper on Amazon! Now it's outright expensive. I can get 12 bars for $24 at my local supermarket.

review/summary: Really good but...
review/text: I was inspired to go out and buy this bar by research released by Harvard this past march about the health benefits of flavanoids in cocoa.  I just went out and picked up the bar with the highest cocoa content assuming I'd be getting a the highest dose of flavanols (the class of flavanoid that is found in cocoa)... after a little more research though, I realized I'd picked the wrong brand for that.  Looking at the ingredients, you'll see that the cocoa is "processed with alkali" (aka Dutch processed chocolate).  Apparently, 60-90% of flavanoids are removed during Dutch processing (according to wikipedia).  From what I read, you're much better off trying trying to find "natural" chocolate if you are going for the health benefits.<br /><br />On the other hand... I'm totally addicted to this chocolate!  At first I found it too bitter and ate it along with some grapes to help sweeten it up, but after a few nights my palate has changed and am loving it just the way it is.  Too bad about the Dutch processing.<br /><br />If you are going for the healthiest brand regardless of price, it looks like the Xocai brand is the way to go.  Not only is it natural, but it's cold pressed (heating the chocolate also removes flavinoids) and is sweetened with a�ai berries.  I couldn't find any data on how big of a difference in flavanoid content of cold pressed and non-cold pressed chocolate, but I doubt it's worth the current cost.<br /><br />There's a few good dark chocolates available here at amazon that are natural and dairy free with high cocoa content including:  Dragoba makes an 87% cocoa organic chocolate bar, and Endangered Species makes one at 88% (Black Panther Extreme Dark Chocolate).  Stay away from bars that don't post their ingredients on Amazon (such as Green & Black's organic 85% cocoa dark chocolate bar which contains whole milk).

review/summary: My Favorite Eating Chocolate
review/text: I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but I do love chocolate. I have even been known to nibble unsweetened baking chocolate on occasion (when desperate), but this is WAAAAY better. I'm a little baffled that some people think this is so bitter. I suppose it has a slightly bitter flavor, but it's so creamy and smooth and delicious that who cares! Cappuccino is bitter too, but does that make it unpalatable? I actually find this much mellower tasting than American dark chocolates of 60-80% cocoa which tend to have an acrid, sour after-taste. Granted this is not very sweet AT ALL, so if you need an intense sugar fix, this won't do it. Personally I find that more than a touch of sugar gets in the way of the cocoa flavor anyway.  For my taste, this chocolate is extremely fulfilling,  not to mention that it is probably borderline good for you :)<br /><br />By the way, another great one (though slightly inferior) is Chocolove 77% (Belgian).

review/summary: Heart-healthy, extremely dark chocolate
review/text: Lindt is a famous Swiss chocolate maker, and all its various chocolates are wonderful, including this extremely dark chocolate--in its own way. For those who are used to semisweet or sweet chocolate, the flavor of this bar may seem surprisingly bitter and take some getting used to, but if you are a connoisseur without a strong "sweet tooth," you will likely enjoy this chocolate very much. As for my own particular tastes, I found it rather too bitter, and so did my husband. I personally prefer dark chocolate with a bit less cacao, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019ZHU2Q">Ghirardelli Chocolate Intense Dark Twilight Delight 72% Cacao</a>.<br /><br />The question some may ask who love sweet, milk chocolate is, why pay more money (often quite a bit more) for dark chocolate such as this that doesn't taste sweet? The main reason for most people in the over-50 crowd is the health benefits to be gained from consuming dark chocolate. The more chocolate contained in a chocolate bar, the more of the good stuff--cacao--that you are getting. In short, the more "bang" for your "buck."<br /><br />Over the last four years there have been dozens of scientific studies analyzing and confirming substantial health benefits from a small amount of dark chocolate consumed daily. The latest findings from a Harvard study released in early 2011 indicate that as little as 6 gm. of dark chocolate (about 30 calories) is a sufficient daily "dose." The original German studies in 2007 used Ritter Sport chocolate, but I haven't so far been able to discover which kind of Ritter's dark chocolate was used by the researchers. However, since Ritter's only makes two types, 50% cacao and 71% cacao, this product, at 90% cocoa, fits well within the parameters of that study. An equivalent amount of this chocolate compared to that in the study would be a little more than one-half of one of its 10 gm. individual squares. (Note: the package lists a "serving" as "four squares" which is 40 gms. This is almost seven times the 6 gm. amount that researchers found is sufficient to improve health.)<br /><br />The health benefits of dark chocolate are due to the flavonoids contained in cocoa. Flavonoids act as antioxidants in the body, which both prevent and reduce inflammation. Over many years of medical research, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471202711">inflammation</a> has been found to contribute to or directly cause a host of diseases, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and cancer, as well as autoimmune diseases like arthritis.<br /><br />Flavonoids are found in the pigments of fruits and vegetables which give them their color. The darker and deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the greater the amount of flavonoids it contains. Cocoa is derived from the dark-brown cacao bean, which is the fruit of the tropical tree, theobroma cacao. In any chocolate product, such as this one, the higher the percentage of cocoa/cacao, the more flavonoids the chocolate contains.<br /><br />Dark chocolate such as this product is better for your health than milk chocolate because it contains more antioxidants, which are good for you, and less sugar, which is not good for you--especially if you have diabetes or are struggling with your weight.<br /><br />The FDA defines categories of chocolate based on how much cocoa/cacao is in a given product:<br />1. Unsweetened chocolate with no additives is 100% cocoa. Most all brands of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FY8I">unsweetened baker's chocolate</a> fall into this category. Their ingredient list will state simply, "chocolate."<br />2. Bittersweet chocolate contains 35-99% cocoa (35% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. There is a large range of products in this category, and the product names reflect the amount of chocolate they contain. Unsweetened chocolate is very bitter, and the more cocoa in a product, the less room for sugar, and the more bitter it will be. In order to avoid frightening off customers who are used to sweet chocolate, marketers often substitute the words "dark," "extra dark" or "intense" for "bitter" if that word is not paired with "sweet," for example as "bittersweet" or "extra bittersweet." This product lies at the top of this range.<br />3. Sweet chocolate contains 15-34% cocoa (15% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids.  It is sometimes also marketed as "dark chocolate," even though it has a much lower percentage of cocoa solids than bittersweet, which can cause consumers, in such cases, to purchase a product with less cocoa in it than they realized they were getting. Everything else besides the cocoa and milk solids is essentially sugar.<br />4. Milk chocolate is only required to have a minimum of 10% cocoa, a minimum of 12% milk solids and 3.39% milk fat. The rest is sugar and milk.<br /><br />The ingredients of this particular dark-chocolate bar, per the package, include:<br />Chocolate<br />Fat (pure chocolate contains a very healthy saturated fat called cocoa butter)<br />Sugar<br />Fiber (pure chocolate is also rich in fiber)<br />Protein (pure chocolate contains some protein)<br />Vanilla<br /><br />People who are allergic to nuts (including peanuts and tree nuts), soy, and milk should not eat this product since it is manufactured with the same equipment that processes those things and traces could be in this chocolate.

review/summary: Booo... processed with alkali which signifantly reduces health benefits
review/text: I usually purchase the Lindt 85 on Amazon.  However, the last time I went to purchase, the usual supplier was temporarily out of stock so I purchased the 90 instead.  It is definitely smoother, even though it is higher in cocoa content.  This made me curious, so I checked the ingredients... the 90 is processed with alkali which significantly reduces the flavanoid (antioxident) content of the chocolate thereby significantly reducing the health benefits of eating such high cocoa content chocolate.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very dark chocolate that is not too sweet and is very smooth, the flavor and creaminess of this chocolate is very palatable.

review/summary: Surprisingly smooth
review/text: The natural bitterness of the intense cocoa is very well balanced by the carefully chosen quantity of other few and simple ingredients -- especially the vanilla.  It melts slowly in your mouth into a very fine, rich, and especially smooth presentation, allowing one to really appreciate the taste of cocoa.  I'm not a food snob, but I've tasted a LOT of dark chocolate, and the other ingredients in this Lindt dark chocolate really "dress up" and present the cocoa well.  Not overdone with too much sugar, nor underdone leaving it neither too bitter in taste, nor too chalky/chunky in texture to enjoy.<br /><br />I have to agree with other reviewers, too:  the 90% really is smoother than 85%.  Essentially that's the challenge, right?  Get as close as you can to enjoying the bean for what it is.  They work harder to do this (and succeed in my opinion) with 90% versus 85%.

review/summary: Good for atkins/paleo eaters......
review/text: I find this chocolate an amazing little cheat if you're doing atkins or paleo.<br /><br />I used to HATE HATE HATE dark chocolate of any kind and was a big milk choco lover, but after 2 weeks eating paleo without much fruit I find this satisfies me even better than my old milk chocolate.<br /><br />It's still considered "junk food" for a paleo guy but it's about the tamest junk you can eat.

review/summary: Great item, terrible price
review/text: I love the 90% Lindt and find it superior to most other (too sweet) chocolates i have tried.  Imagine my surprise when the "bulk" price on Amazon turned out to be significantly higher than the NON SALE price  my local supermarket charges for individual bars.  $2.95 per bar for Amazon 12-pack, versus  $2.69 at the store for an individual 3.5 oz bar.  When it goes on sale, as it often does, for $2.00 per bar, I will stock up.  What a shame they con people with these overpriced so-called "bargains".  Check your local Stop'nShop.

review/summary: Most amazing chocolate
review/text: After trying some 90% chocolate at a local store I decided to buy it. Unfortunately, I will never be able to eat regular or milk chocolate ever again. The 90% chocolate from Lindt is just plain amazing and full of flavor. After you bite into it, let it sit there and melt. The flavor is something you won't be able to find in a regular sugar filled chocolate. I will never eat anything else than real chocolate every again.<br /><br />After eating Lindt chocolate for a month now, I can say that I can't taste the bitterness. It is highly fatty though and may not be for regular joe schmoo who is used to sugar and not real chocolate taste.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Wonderful stuff
review/text: Just like other people were saying, the chocolate was very bitter at first but once you start eating it you will love it.  Remember to start sucking on it then you will appreciate the chocolate taste also you will be able to taste the sweetness.<br />Takes about a couple weeks to really get used to it.<br />I have started eating this kind of chocolate and now, the chocolate you get from the store is very nasty.<br />This is some good stuff.<br />Another thing I love, my children used to eat up all my other chocolate but now this chocolate does not have all that sugar but my children hate it and I love it.

review/summary: best high concentration chocolate for the money
review/text: After a year in France buying very high quality chocolate of 70% or higher, at a typical price of about $1.50/100g, I was dismayed to see that in the USA such products routinely fetch $3 or $4 per 100g.  Outrageous!  Then I found Lindt 90% (and others) at Amazon for nearly as good a price as in supposedly expensive France. This is the smoothest textured high density chocolate widely available in the USA.

review/summary: The best ultra dark chocolate I have ever tasted
review/text: This is the smoothest 85%+ dark chocolate I have ever tried.  Some ultra dark chocolates can make you want to scrub out your mouth due to either a chalky texture or too much acid or tannins.  However this 90% chocolate had none of those problems!  Just a rich earthy chocolate flavor that slowly melts in your mouth.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have stated, you really can't taste any sweetness in this chocolate but that tiny amount of sugar balances out the flavors in this chocolate and makes this a delightful treat!<br /><br />It is rather waxy due to the high cocoa butter content so the best way to enjoy this chocolate is to let it slowly melt in your mouth.<br /><br />The price on Amazon is pretty high though... I've found this at supermarkets in the US for $2 or less ea. and currently in Europe it's about $1.88 depending on the EUR/USD exchange rate.  I'm going to take advantage of the falling EUR and stock up on some more before I fly back!<br /><br />Update:  Okay, so I've tasted some really amazing varietal dark chocolates in France like Bonnat, Cluziel, and Bernachon Chocolat and these absolutely blow Lindt out of the water.  However these chocolates are also very $$$ at 6-10 EUR for a 100g tablet.  So while Lindt is no longer the best dark chocolate I've ever tasted, it's still really good considering the price.

review/summary: Best dark chocolate around
review/text: Lindt 90% is the best dark chocolate I have found; and I have tried many different kinds.<br /><br />I suggest eating this bar with a side of your favorite fruit! The natural sugar of the fruit combines with the amazing cocoa taste of Lindt creating a one of a kind experience! :) You will never want, or need, "normal" sweet chocolate again! (Not to mention great health benefits of almost pure cocoa)

review/summary: Now That's Chocolate
review/text: A chocolate this dark is an acquired taste... a delicacy to relax and savor. This is the kind of chocolate you nibble on, and it is so rich that it doesn't take a large amount top be satisfying. I also find the 90% to be a wonderful melting chocolate, and an excellent addition to the unsweetened chocolate I use while baking....it helps take my brownies to another level.

review/text: It's also decent for cocoa, just add a square to boiling hot water, maybe some sweetener and milk and stir.  Tastes for strength probably vary.<br /><br />It's only $2 a bar at Kroger grocery though.

review/summary: BLACK COCOA?
review/text: I enjoy this bar and appreciate the mellow flavour for such a high cocoa percentage. However, there's one aspect of this bar that's nagging at me...<br /><br />I believe that they use BLACK COCOA in the recipe. Not that there is anything innately wrong with that, it just speaks to the lack of bitterness and the fact that, to my palette, the flavour is reminiscent of Oreo cookies and ice cream sandwiches...<br /><br />Correct me if I'm wrong, but one of the ingredients listed on my bar is "FAT-REDUCED COCOA" - could that not mean it is Dutch process cocoa (e.g. black cocoa) and thus less bitter?<br /><br />I am definitely a fan of this bar - my most frequently purchased chocolate product, period - but I really want to resolve this question that's burning a hole in my brain...

review/summary: Delicious chocolate!
review/text: Being lactose intolerant, I learned to like dark chocolate. Mixed with a low-carb diet, it was difficult to find a chocolate to satisfy my sweet tooth while keeping in my diet restrictions. I was really surprised by this chocolate. While it is 90%, there is a nice sweetness to it that other brands don't have.<br /><br />Two squares seems to be enough to satisfy a craving for sweets, but if you're not careful you could find half the bar gone before you know it!
