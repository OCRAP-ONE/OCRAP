review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best "bang for the buck" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/text: A great food for my little dog. He certainly likes it better than all other foods that I fed him before I discovered the Paul Newman Organics. It's healthy, nutritious, and certainly provides for good metabolism too. It's not cheap, but maybe in a long run it saves you some money on vet bills. Also, it's good to know that a good part of the price that you pay for it goes to animal shelters.

review/summary: Helpful for joint pain
review/text: I began taking this to help with my joint pain and stiffness. It worked quite well. I found the strong taste a bit off putting but can't argue with the results. Initially I mixed it in water but did not like it at all. Next I mixed it in fruit juice ( orange or orange-pineapple-banana) and found it more palatable.  I purchased some tart cherry capsules and have been taking them instead. If I could not get the capsules I would certainly go back to the juice concentrate due to the results.

review/summary: Worked wonders for my gout
review/text: I had a recent flare up of gout which caused my big toe to swell up with a lot of pain. Taking the meds my doctor prescribed helped but didnt quite get rid of all the discomfort. I tried this drink for about a week (2 tablespoons in 8-10oz water twice a day). I was amazed at how this worked for me. I'm not saying it's a cure for gout, but it did help me get over that hump and now I'm pain free. I ordered a larger bottle recently (32oz) - now that I know that this helps. The taste is robust, smooth, and sweet. Not really a great tasting drink, but still not bad at all.

review/summary: Outstanding Product
review/text: I ordered my first bottle of Tart Is Smart Tart Cherry Concentrate after reading several reviews.  I ordered several other items at the same time, and the cherry concentrate was shipped with the other items, not by itself in one box.  During shipping, the seal became broken.  There was foam at the top inside the bottle, and quite a lot of the concentrate had leaked into a bag with some important papers, before I was ready to use it.  I called the manufacturer immediately, and I was in close contact with them for a few days.  They were kind enough to ship a 32-ounce bottle to me in its own box, and I thoroughly enjoyed my first "dose" last night.  I am using only one tablespoon in 8 ounces of water, and I find the taste absolutely delicious.  Perhaps my body chemistry needs this juice to function optimally.  I understand that TART cherry juice is good for people with arthritis, although I haven't noticed any particular benefit for my joints.  It also contains melatonin, which my body needs at the present time. I have been taking tart cherry joice from various sources, particularly Trader Joe's, until their present crop source failed.  I have purchased this juice from Wholefoods, but I much prefer the consistency and flavor from Trader Joe's.  I have also tried Indian Summer juice that I purchased from Amazon.com, but the smallest order is 8 48-oz. bottles, which makes the package way too heavy, and it requires storage space.  I can't afford the juice from Wholefoods, as the cost is prohibitive for regular use.  I will be happy with Tart Is Smart as the brand of choice.  In communication with the manufacturer, I was assured that the product doesn't need to be refrigerated until it is opened.  The Best By date on the lid is coded for month and year.  07-13 is simply Best By July, 2013.  It has a shelf life of approximately one year.

review/summary: Healthful until bottled
review/text: This product is supposed to be refrigerated, according to the maker. Not refrigerated after opening, but refrigerated. They claim to ship it to retailers in refrigerated trucks. This is a concern, because it's bottled in #1 plastic bottles, unlike most health juices, which use glass bottles. A concern to me in Arizona, where even in winter the UPS trucks heat up. I received mine late today, and it was quite warm--luckily it was under 100 outside, but on an 80 degree day the insidees of vehicles reach above 102 degrees. So it was somewhere under boiling.<br /> Very bad packaging. They could at least use #2 plastic. The taste is fine but the anti-oxidant effect is bound to be either a wash or negatively affected by the heat. I will have to go back to purchasing another brane from a health food store where they keep it in a refrigerated case.<br />I have an email in to the maker and will post an update.

review/summary: Good product, but the 16-oz. size leaked during shipping
review/text: I have been ordering this brand of cherry juice for about 8 months.  I have always gotten the 32-oz. size, but due to the huge price increase, I ordered the 16-oz. size because it was a slightly better deal.  When the bottles arrived, they were sitting in a sticky, red puddle due to leakage.  The 32-oz. size has an airtight safety seal (I'm pretty sure) but the 16-oz. bottles definitely do not.  I decided to clean up the bottles and use them anyway (not wanting to cause a problem) but as they sat on the counter, the bottles started to bulge and the labels ripped open!  I do not think they are safe to drink, and Amazon stated that they will return my money, thankfully.  Tart is Smart Cherry Juice Concentrate has always been a good product that has helped decrease the inflammation and pain in my back.  I'm not sure why the company does not put a safety seal on the 16-oz. size.  I will pay the extra money for the bigger size with the safety seal so my juice will be SAFE to drink!

review/summary: THREE WAY WINNER!!
review/text: I enjoy reading comments from buyers of Products. I read somewhere where Tart Cherry Juice was good for GOUT, helps your sleeping pattern improve & supplies the body with more Antioxidants than Blue Berries? I googled TART CHERRIES & found that Amazon was a seller. I read the comments there & decided to buy some. I joined their Buyer Delivery Program, got discounted prices & they remind me when I should need a new bottle or two.TART IS SMART is the brand. Many commenter's said they tried DARK RED, RED & other Cherry Juices without 3 way success.<br />  My BIG TOE pain has vastly been controlled, I now sleep 6-7 hours in a row, not waking up many times & feel good about the fact I am supplying my body with elements to protect my health. I add it to low cal juice & use as directed. Some people advocate using more than directed, choose for yourself. I imagine I will be using this product for the rest of my life.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CFMGGI">Tart Is Smart Tart Cherry Concentrate, 32-Ounce Bottle</a>

Since wheat and gluten is not all we have to avoid, I'm glad that Papa's loaf is a bread my son enjoys.  The best ways to eat this bread are toasted and if one wants a softer bread, I put a spread (Mothers Margarine) on the bread and warm it up in the microwave.

review/summary: Interesting - if only for the color
review/text: I must not be enough of a salt afficionado to be able to tell the difference in taste between this and regular sea salt.  It looks marvelous in a salt grinder ball, but other than that, it tastes like salt.  I gave it as a gift to my husband along with a couple of other varieties and a grinder and he was pleased, mostly for the visual appeal.<br />I would have given a 5 if I had been able to discern any difference in flavor with this on my food.

review/summary: Good Flavor and Soft Chew
review/text: I like most of the Trident flavors, however this particular type of Trident provides a softer chew and lasting flavor.<br /><br />Their regular Trident is a more dense and stiff chew.<br /><br />These are packaged differently and are branded "Trident Layers" in large and bold lettering.  I highly recommend any of the flavors as long as they are the "Trident Layers" brand because of the improved chewing quality.<br /><br />Just search for "Trident Layers gum".

review/summary: Great for convenience bulk purchase
review/text: I found this as a good way of purchasing gum in bulk (I tend to chew a lot) rather then purchasing them in 3 packs from the grocery store.  The gum is fairly long lasting, better then other similar gums.  The price is still a little high compared to alternatives, I found that bj's had a 15 pack at a price significantly cheaper per stick so it might be worthwhile to price it out with any local bulk stores.  If those types of warehouse stores aren't an option, then this is a great alternative.

review/summary: The Best!!!!
review/text: I don't care for beer at all.  Most wines including champagne give me heartburn.  Hard liquor is too serious for me.  Montebello Long Island Iced Tea is just right. You can just serve it over ice or you can add a splash of Pepsi - it's strong enough to take it.  This is the best libation you can purchase from a grocery or convenience store and the taste is comparable to a nice bar or restaurant mixed drink.  It's better than any other Long Island Iced Tea mixed drink on the market.  Worth every penny!!!!!

review/summary: Not Bad at All
review/text: Not a really drinker, don't keep booze in the house.  That said - every once in a while I get in the mood for a libation... Always liked a Long Island Iced Tea but to make one requires buying 1/2 a liquor store's worth of clears.  Gave this a shot - for like, 12 bucks in a big 1.75 liter bottle totally on a whim when out to pick up a red wine for guests.  How awful could it be?  No worse than any of the other pre-made cocktails (which is to say "horrible") I've had.  Figured if it was terrible, I could mix it with real iced tea to kill the flavor. Gotta tellya, not too shabby!  Totally bested my low expectations - especially at its bottom shelf price and cheap-azz plastic bottle.  Have certainly had worse out at places that apparently don't know how to make a proper Long Island Iced Tea. Put this in a tall iced-filled glass with a lemon wedge?  Good to go. As always with recommendations, YMMV, but this will be purchased again.

review/summary: Surprised, beyond belief!
review/text: I am a grown A$$ woman, a grandmother, and I am writing a review about a Hostess cake.  A friend brought the into work and casually offered me one, I opened it, balking at the crumbs that scattered on my desk, and then took a bite carefully, not to make a mess on my clothes. Well, the topping that was dusted on top of the streusel fell off gently landing on my tougue and it felt like snow as I bit down the streusel which had a slight crunch.  It was sophisticatingly delicate allowing the warmth of my mouth to melt some of it.  Then the yellow cake itself streaked with cinnamon-sugar mixture that was not overwhelming - just added a bit of interest.  The cake was flavorful, light and had a wonderful texture juxtaposing the gentle crunch of the topping.<br /><br />Bar none, this is the gold standard.  I've been to restaurants since and their fancy bakery cakes have fallen short.

review/text: Despite its appealing list of ingredients (This green tea blend contains Japanese sencha green tea, dried ginger, orange peel and lemongrass), I found the tea disappointing.  After ample steeping, The blend remains devoid of flavor, color and aroma.  The tea teeters between having 'less taste' than expected and being 'tasteless'.  It may seem a bargain when purchased in bulk but if you're looking for a flavorful green tea blend tea, look elsewhere.

The Southwest Caesar dressing is great on rueben sandwiches, or with corndogs!  The Cardini Pesto Pasta is magical--all you need to make a pasta salad is  your pasta, some black olives, a few chopped tomatoes and Pesto Pasta dressing.  Sad thing is, for some reason, Pesto Pasta dressing has become very difficult to find.

review/summary: Great fish flavor, essential in many Asian foods
review/text: I've used all kinds of fish sauce over the years but I think Three Crabs is my new favorite.  It has a nice fish flavor yet isn't overpoweringly salty like some brands.  That's a plus when you want to add soy sauce to your Asian food in addition to the fish sauce.  The ingredients are water, anchovies, hydrolyzed wheat protein (secret name for MSG) and sugar.  I wish it didn't contain MSG, so I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />The price for two bottles is $16, but you get two 24 ounce bottles.  The average recipe calls for a couple of tablespoons so it will last a long time.<br /><br />If you cook lots of Asian food like I do, give this tasty fish sauce a try!

My family (including parents, siblings, and my own adult kids) really like this seasoning, which we used to buy locally, but, the store no longer carries it.  "Montreal Steak seasoning" is slightly similar, but, it has too many flavors and larger particles of spices, including carraway seeds (not a flavor I enjoy).  The Garlic Pepper has a slightly finer grind and adds a more enjoyable (IMO) flavor to grilled steaks and in our hamburger mix.

And the fact that they are organic is a bonus, I suppose, for folks concerned about such things.  I purchased these pretzels through Amazon, since the pricing was better than I could get at Whole Foods.

review/summary: These are fantastic!
review/text: My family has recently switched to eating organic, and we've also given up white flour and white sugar. Since there are no health food stores around, this change pretty much meant going without some of our favorite snack items. When I saw these pretzels on Amazon, and read their simple list of ingredients, I was skeptical but decided to at least give them a try. HOLY MOLY THESE ARE GOOD! All of the salty crunch of regular pretzels, but with organic ingredients including whole wheat flour and NO sugar.<br /><br />We love them. In fact, I just subscribed to get more each month!

review/summary: Good boost gum
review/text: This product use to be available at the local drug store chain by me in Wisconsin. It was disco'd and I never saw it again till I did some searching and found it on Amazon for the best price. The taste can leave a little bit to be desired. It does work though. I have a augmented schedule for my job which borders around third/first shift so any kind of personal life late on the weekends can get too be late for me. That's where the Jolt gum comes into play. I usually will chew it while I'm out with friends, have a couple of adult cocktails to keep me awake or, I will chew it while getting prepared to play with my band at a gig. If you do the Math, It use to cost me $2.00 a pack at the store before vs only $.80 a pack via Amazon. Good stuff

review/summary: A delicious caffeine gum!
review/text: I have been using this gum as my late night, little pick-up for a long time now. It's useful for drives where I just need a tiny oomph to wake me up, and the flavor is nice(though not long lasting). There are very minor bitter hints of caffeine in this(like most caffeine products), but it's not noticeable unless I chew 8 or more pieces in one sitting. I can't drink coffee, and tea unfortunately means that I would need to hit the bathroom often on a long drive...so this is perfect. I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Best Gum EVER
review/text: Gush alert - I love this gum! I think I have an entire box stashed intentionally and unintentionally in the house, office, and car.  I even found a left over pack with one long piece in my gym locker (that could have been gross.  Thank heavens for blister wrapping!) I kept forgetting the gum it and wanting it - now I keep finding it and loving it! I want it when I'm working out. I need it during snoozer meetings.  True story.  My 60-year old mom even takes some when she goes to the movies! That's actually kinda funny to me.<br /><br />If nirvana could be achieved by chewing a gum, I'd say this about as close as it gets. I tried another energy gum (sorry Jolt, I wont' be unfaithful again!) and it got disgusting after four or five minutes. Jolt tastes good and gives me energy. I don't normally get excited by trivial consumer products - in fact, this is my first review for a candy of any kind - but this gum is a life changer!!! Thank you!!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G8W7YC">Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum, Spearmint, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G8W7SI">Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum, Icy Mint, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: Regular old gum
review/text: I am extremely caffeine sensitive and this gum just doesn't do it for me.  I sometimes chew 3-4 pieces at a time (which is equal to two cups of coffee) and nothing.  I don't feel any sort of "jolt" at all.  I feel like I'm chewing regular old mint gum.  So much for help staying awake working the night shift!  Two stars for the flavor.

review/summary: Perfect for a Busy Day!
review/text: I recently began working a second job delivering pizza where my brother works.  I remembered this gum from about 4 years ago when I used to be able to purchase it by the pack at the gas station.  I went searching for it at gas stations, pharmacies, Walmart, and other places but could no longer find it.  I was so happy to see it available here on Amazon!  Also, it is much cheaper than it used to be when buying it by the pack ($2.50 per pack) so I took this offer.  I am very glad I did, as I am often scheduled for very long work shifts late into the night.<br /><br />Never in my life have I liked energy drinks besides coffee and Jolt cola, as they are just too sweet and often include tons of artificial chemical sweeteners, which carry a horrid aftertaste.  They also tend to take 30 minutes to an hour before they really work.  Jolt gum works in 5 minutes since it is absorbed under your tongue, and it is a low enough dose of caffeine that you can safely chew one piece every couple of hours while working and stay very alert. It is wonderful to have a piece or two of Jolt before going to the gym or running, as it will increase your stamina.<br /><br />Just one thing to watch for with this gum - whatever you do, never pull a World of Warcraft-player type of suicide by chewing 100 pieces quickly to try and stay up all night and play a videogame.  Caffeine can be harmful in massive doses, but one piece of this gum is about equal to a Coke can, it just works much faster and better.

review/summary: Outstanding Organic Coffee
review/text: We have been buying beans from Larry's for several years now. Living in Raliegh we found Larry's local coffee shop. Now that we live in Florida I still order all my beans from Larry!<br /><br />Coffee is like wine; Everyone has different tastes so don't let any negative reviews prevent you from trying the best coffee (EXCEPT FOR KONA while in Hawaii) we have found. It's all organic, fair trade coffee with lots of different roasts and blends... Our favorite stand by is Cowboy Blend and Frankie Blend (use to be Frank Sumatra). Recently we tried Mountain Sumatra and it was outstanding.<br /><br />If you want great roasted coffee from a great person that is pure organic fair trade than Larry is your man.<br /><br />(BTW- I don't not work for Larry) I was just prompted to write this review since we really love his coffee)

review/text: Ok. So i ordered this cheese set for Christmas. The packaging was very good, and I didnt even need to wrap it. We opened the cheeses and none of them were the cheese that were advertised, ok well they did say that they may substitute them. They were still similiar to what they had advertised. Once we opened them we were surprised to find that 3 of the 4 smelled horendous. Once again some cheeses will, we'll try and get past it. One cheese was so bad however that we almost got sick. I dont plan on buying this again for the price and what I got. If you like smelly cheese than you may like this. I cant say it was all bad, but not what I was expecting.

I just received mine, and made sure store them properly.<br /><br />I decant my paprika into a glass jar with a screw on top that is used for canning.  That way it keeps it wonderful scent and flavor, and it doesn't pick up any plastic or metallic traces.<br /><br />I also make sure to label it clearly with the best by date so I don't have to open it up and expose it to the air too much.<br /><br />Keep them in a dark area of the cupboard if you use clear glass.<br /><br />It's also nice that they are certified organic.  I will definitely be buying more of these in the future!!
