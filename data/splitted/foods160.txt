review/summary: A taste winner for sure
review/text: Our cat practically raced over to the food dish to sample this, and ate with intent devotion. This cat food is definitely a taste winner. I also like the fact that this package doesn't have tuna -- which cats like but to which it's said they can become addicted.<br /><br />Not sure what else to say. The Petite Cuisine website is quite convincing about the nutritional value and careful screening of ingredients. The small cans mean the food, once opened, says fresh enough under refrigeration to appeal to the cat the next day. If you can afford it, this is a great cat food.

review/summary: People Food?
review/text: As this cat food has the somewhat comical tagline "People food for cats!," it may either at first appear charming or like a gimmick.  I think it is fair to say that it is a charming gimmick.  The foods are indeed fashioned after human food, but are more like food for baby humans than us adult humans that prefer strong seasoned flavors.  Of course, that is a good thing, as a healthy diet for a cat is quite different than for a human.  The ingredients, then, are basic, with nothing offensive like wheat-gluten.<br /><br />As for the taste, I agree with other reviewers that this comes down to the preference of each cat, but it has been a great hit with cats in my experience!

review/summary: One ate, the other didn't
review/text: This cat food is really special. It doesn't smell like cat food. It smells like canned chicken. The cans are easy to wash for recycling. It's a joy to serve.<br /><br />My ditzy calico cat, Creampuff, loved the food. She scarfed it down immediately. The other, a new adoptee named Ophelia, said, "Thanks but no thanks." She's quite finicky but alas, I think her taste buds have become accustomed to the traditional, more pedestrian Friskies type food.<br /><br />Seems like a good cat food, if you can get your cat(s) to eat it.I'm not qualified to evaluate the nutritional quality or the taste, bt appearance and smell are excellent.

review/summary: Ex's cat likes it--need I say more?
review/text: My ex-girlfriend is a lovely woman in many ways, but her cat...well pretty much everybody and everything is beneath him. He is picky about being petted, how he is being petted, how long he is being petted, and by whom (I think the phase of the moon figures into this somehow too, but I digress). This persnickety nature also applies--in spades--to his food. When I gave Zede (the cat, not the ex-gf) some of this food, he actually ate it without giving me his "How dare you put this slop in front of me, knave?" look. I got reports later that he became even more enamored with the stuff as time went on. So there you have it: an endorsement from Zede the finicky feline. Well, how else do you rate cat food? I'm not going to try it myself...and besides, I'm a vegetarian!

review/summary: Nigel is gonna be sad - we're out of chicken pot pie
review/text: My cat Nigel is very into food. When I opened the first can of Petite Cuisine, he thought he'd died and went to heaven. This was bits of chicken breast, broth and a few very finely chopped vegetables. The chicken pot pie had a more watery broth - the sesame chicken was in a more gravy-like sauce - but both flavors were devoured.<br /><br />My cats are big, outdoorsy cats. They were all once feral. They still frequently bring home a snake, vole or squirrel for entertainment - or supper. I have six: 4 big guys (14-17 pounds) and two slightly smaller girls (11 and 12 pounds).) They appreciate fancy little tidbits of food on a saucer. They especially liked Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />They have free access throughout the day to dry kibble: Purina One Chicken&Rice and Purina Indoor  mixed half and half. We have 3 small <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DI30O">Petmate Le Bistro Feeders</a> which they love. Then in the evening I feed them 3 ounces each (1/2 can) of Friskies Salmon&Chicken Dinner Shredded. Because the Petite Cuisine cans were so small (3 ounces) I first gave them one can per cat, but that was too much. I split 4 of these tiny cans between six cats and that was just right: no leftovers. They liked the Petite Cuisine better than Fancy Feast or Purina Selects.<br /><br />This package contains 24 cans. 12 cans are pot pie - 12 sesame. The price is comparable to Purina Selects, Fancy Feast or Sheba from the grocery store - but I think the quality is higher. This looks and smells like chicken my Moma cooks! At the end of one week of feeding Petite Cuisine, all of six of them - their fur just glistened.<br /><br />Nigel is plotting: How to work computer and get Petite Cuisine on auto-subscribe shipment from Amazon? Hmmmmm? Bodhi just wants the A-4 Smiley Box* it comes in!<br /><br />* A-4 Smiley Box - the new cat sleeping container that is delivered almost weekly by the man wearing brown. A sleeping cat's smile is on the side.

review/summary: Pleasing for the cat and for me - a good alternative for my Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys addict
review/text: My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys. It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens! When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him. After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food. First, I want it to have real ingredients listed. I don't like for it to have by-products. (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food) Second, I don't want it to stink. If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it. Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria. Next was the big question: would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off. He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting. Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior. He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day. I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn. It really looks like people food. He seemed to really enjoy the "soupy" broth. This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off. He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest. Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken. It smelled pleasantly like Asian food. His reaction was to sniff and wander off. After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food. So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor. I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM. It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day. A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior. He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits. I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily. Clearly, my kitty has preferences. I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)) that are available on Amazon. He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past. It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand. I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance. That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general. The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.

review/text: My kitty loves tuna and dry cat food.  I've never tried to give her soft food until this.  She didn't eat it until it was in her dish for most of the day when she had eaten her regular dry food.<br />It looks like it would be good.  It looks like pieces of fish, but for some reason this didn't excite her as much as tuna.<br />I'm getting a new kitty soon, and I'll update it when I try to give new kitty this food.<br />Edit: New kitty likes it fine.  This isn't her favorite choice.  She likes tuna, chicken, and beef all better than this.  Unlike the other cat, she likes this more than dry food - about as much as she likes the Iams wet food I also feed her.

review/summary: If it looks good, is it good for the cats?
review/text: My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term "all about tuna fish".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.

review/summary: Tempted to eat them myself!
review/text: This is quite a unique brand of cat food. Their tagline is "People food for cats" and they are quite right. They smell and look delicious.<br /><br />There are basically two types of canned cat food in my experience, the first kind is the solid kind where you tip the can into the plate and the food retains the shape of the can. The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate. For me this second type is preferable because it has a higher content of liquid which I consider to be healthier for the cats urinary system. This cat food is of this second type.<br /><br />My cat is a very finicky eater and he takes time to adjust to new foods.<br />This package contains two flavors; the first is chicken pot pie which looks just like real chicken pot pie, right down to the light gravy, there are cubes of real chicken breast and it really looks like pot pie. My cat laps up all the sauce then moves on to the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Second flavor is sesame chicken: This smells really good and the chicken is not chunked but in thin strips. My cat loves the sauce and will drain it all dry but is not too fond of the chicken. He will probably adjust to it over time. This is why only four stars.

review/text: One of my cats who eats everything loved this food. The other more picky one, not so much.<br />My cats are old though, and weren't raised in this era of healthy cat food, and most of the time wont touch the stuff. So I was happy that at least one of them liked it.<br />I like how all the ingredients are fresh and how there are only a few; not a list 30 things, where half of the words are unpronounceable. The food doesn't smell as bad as most cat food, the kind where as soon as you open it wafts through the house. It also has fresh chunks of chicken and fresh corn and carrots. The gravy in it is very watery and not thick like most cat foods, so it spilled everywhere the first time i opened it. Since then it hasn't, because I haven been more careful.<br />I wish both of my cats liked this food because I know it is so much better for them than what they do like! But I give much kudos to Petit Cuisine on making healthy food for cats.

review/text: I had a whole case of this to try, so thought it would be fun to try it on as many cats as possible. Thus, by recruiting 5 friends, we ended up trying Petite Cuisine chicken cat food on 13 cats--7 males & 6 females; 4 inside cats, 5 outside & 4 inside/outside. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food--namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.<br /><br />I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat--a 2 year old male--ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male--a 16 pound inside/outside orange tabby--would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the broth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of broth, which I think is brilliant, since all the cats I know always like the broth of canned cat food or tuna best.<br /><br />I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked. It has great ingredients and smells like human food. I hope to try Petite Cuisine seafood catfood one day...I think they all might like that much better.

review/summary: Luxury Meal
review/text: Opening both the Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e and the Chicken Pot Pie, there is not a lot of aroma, it looks like chicken soup with carrots and it is brothy and wet.<br />Having so slight an aroma, I thought my cat may not like it, but she does like both flavors.<br />Small in size like Fancy Feast, one can isn't a meal. My cat eats dry food and this is a treat for her.<br />It is expensive though. It seems like a very high quality food for cats.<br />I would recommend this to someone whose cat is very fussy.

review/summary: People Food For Cats!
review/text: They aren't kidding! The albacore smells better than people food! My cats LOVE this cat food, and it is gluten free, so there is no worries about our cats getting poisoned! Great stuff! I'll likely be buying this cat food instead of their regular brand, especially for treats. If your cat likes a lot of sauce, there is plenty of it here, and it's not just water. If you want to give your cats a healthy canned food, this is the best one by far that I've fed them... Better than even the high-end fancy foods. The cans are small, but the nutrition is better than most cat foods. They even use yellow-fin tuna for the albacore! 1st rate cat food!

review/summary: sesame awesome and chicken pot water
review/text: The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the "chicken pot pie" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the brand ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up.

review/summary: 3 cats give 5 stars to 5 out of 6 flavors but  should I?
review/text: This review covers the two chicken flavors offered here as well as four fish flavors in the variety pack offered elsewhere on this site.  My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of "menadione sodium sulfite in pet food" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page.

review/summary: The Cat's Meow
review/text: All four of my cats loved this canned cat food!  The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.<br /><br />The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.<br /><br />I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends.

review/summary: Source of protein and hearty enough to serve as one meal
review/text: First of all, your cat should hopefully like fish-flavored foods, because obviously this variety pack is all seafood - yellowfin, snapper, tuna, and shrimp. And if your cat is picky about which fish he/she likes, you won't be breaking the bank by discarding the cans of the flavors he/she doesn't approve of. There is also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I">chicken variety pack</a> available by Petite Cuisine, which contains Chinese chicken and chicken pot pie dishes. Give that a try if your cat is simply a lover of all foods.<br /><br />The food actually could pose as human food if someone was unaware they were being served cat food. But do yourself a favor and just buy a can of tuna or whatever it is you like - leave the cat food to the cats. The dishes are quite moist with chunks of meat/fish and broth. They are a source of protein and are hearty enough to serve as one meal for a small cat. You may try adding dry food if one can isn't enough. Or simply use two cans and order more as necessary.

review/summary: Five Paw Salute !!
review/text: My selection, which contained 12 cans each of Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken, arrived quickly, and I looked forward to seeing how my kitties would like it.<br /><br />I liked the fact that:<br /><br />(1) Petite Cuisine has NO Wheat Gluten,<br /><br />and<br /><br />(2) it's made from "Human Grade" ingredients -- which means even I can eat it if I really wanted to -- and truth be told -- I DID sample a bit from each of those 2 selections -- and both selections tasted better than anything I have tasted when I buy a Brand Name can of canned chicken for myself.....<br /><br />But ok -- this Petite Cuisine is for my kitties, so let's see what THEY think of it:<br /><br />Well, I had no idea what to expect when I opened the first can --  Chicken Pot Pie (and word of caution -- open the "Chicken Pot Pie" can over the sink--there's alot of Broth inside and it sloshes out if you are not careful).<br /><br />However, Big Bad Baby Twinkle was standing behind me watching my every move, and once the top came off the can, her Supreme Largeness, BBBT, surprised me with several OCTAVES worth of Mew-sical praise for the tempting smell.<br /><br />Yes - I know you are supposed to mix new cat food with their old food, but I had no desire to mix this pristine, tasty, fresh diced chicken and veggies entree with any of their stinky canned stuff - so Big Bad Baby Twinkle and Sweet Cee Cee feasted on 1/2 can of "Chicken Pot Pie" each, along with the liquid broth. I waited for a reaction -- nothing untoward happened. They licked their chops and came after me for more of the same.<br /><br />Now, it has been noted that there is alot of "water" (Broth) in this can of Chicken pot Pie -- I am familiar with "Spot's Stew" and that brand also has alot of liquid in its can. I have no problem with this Chicken Pot Pie broth -- if anything, it helps to hydrate my kitties (cats, being descended from desert animals -- get most of their liquid from their food-- and as long as the sodium content of this broth is low, then they can slurp it to their hearts delight -- and they certainly did, as the dishes were licked clean)<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken, was less liquidy and looked very nice, shredded with its vegetables -- it had special smell, which actually was just the smell of Sesame Oil. But my cats inhaled this as greedily as they did the Chicken pot Pie. I was impressed that Sesame oil would be used (along with Soy oil) as an ingredient. I'm looking forward to seeing what these oils will eventually do to nourish (former abandoned, street-kitty, but thoroughly vetted) Cee Cee's somewhat dull coat. * * *<br /><br />And to top off the Petite Cuisine experience, each box comes with a coupon worth $2 -- $1 off when you buy a four-pack, or four cans of Petite Cuisine from the supermarket -- and another $1 coupon will be sent to you if you fill out your name and address on the first coupon before you present it to  the check out clerk.<br /><br />The only thing I take an issue with is the origin -- Thailand -- why not keep this "at home" and produce it in the USA?<br /><br />* * *UPDATE -- Dec 18 2008 -- Cee Cee's coat grew out a little more, is BEAUTIFUL and silky!! Since the only new thing in her life is this food, I can surmise that this diet of Petite Cuisine DID help flesh her out and beautify her fur (She is a former street-kitty, and has always been a little wan (although she goes to the vet regularly) since she was rescued and I brought her inside.)

review/summary: More watery than expected; cats are not digesting it well
review/text: Our cats usually get the "green can" Fancy Feast shredded varieties (they aren't interested in the green can souffle types, and the Florentine varieties give them gastric problems).  The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back.

review/text: All three of my cats are wild about the Chicken Pot Pie variety of Petite Cuisine.  It's real chicken in a clear broth, and it actually looks like something you'd serve yourself.  All the ingredients are "real" -- no meat by-products, wheat gluten, preservatives, dyes.  There is actually quite a bit of broth, which concerned me when I opened the first can because I thought the can was mostly water.  However, it's real broth and evidently pretty tasty, because my cats practically inhale it -- they love it!  Once they finish the broth, they start working on the chicken and always clear the whole plate.  I'll definitely buy more of this.

review/text: My two cats loved these Petite Cuisine chicken flavors, and that's where the rubber meets the road in cat food. Happily, the food itself is very healthy and does not contain garbage byproducts. It's not human food but it's darn close. My cats preferred the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp)</a> which I also received, but they certainly didn't turn up their noses at the chicken flavor!<br /><br />My sole complaint is that the chicken-pot-pie variety is very watery.

review/summary: Delicious, says my cat; messy, says I...
review/text: It's a cute idea to produce a cat food that is similar to people food, and Petite Cuisine seems to fill the nutrition needs of cats, if you can believe the label. However, the "in sauce" makes things a little messy, especially with the "Chicken Pot Pie" entree. There's so much sauce (aka gravy/water/whatever) that my cat would pull the pieces of food out onto the floor and slurp up the sauce afterward. There's just too much liquid in this cat food. The Sesame Chicken is a bit more solid.<br /><br />Whatever the consistency, my cat gave this product high stars, if licking up every morsel and drop is any indication. And I have to admit it smells pretty darn good, not like a lot of cat foods. (Of course, funky smells have never bothered my cat -- the more odorous the better, in her opinion). The daily serving size suggestions are a bit too generous:  1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight. That means 3 to 6 cans for an 8-pound cat, and if you've got a healthy 10-pounder, that means 4 to 8 cans a day? No way.<br /><br />I don't think we'll be using this as a daily food, but rather as an occasional change of pace. It's certainly palatable, but the messiness is a negative. I say 3 stars, and my cat says 5, for a 4-star average...

review/summary: The spiciest chai
review/text: I am a chai snob. I love chai, but have demanding standards about what I will and won't drink. Most lattes are too sweet and not spicy enough for me. This tea is far and away the most spicy, full of a rich flavors of cinnamon, ginger and cardamom, and yet, it has a very sweet note as well, probably because of the carob. The oolong tea leaves allow you to steep it long enough to get a strongly spiced flavor without the tea tannins going bitter. I don't even blend it into milk or add sugar -- I think a strongly brewed cup is perfect as it is. It's great to travel with if you have a strainer mug or brew it before you go, because even as it cools off it continues to taste spicy yet sweet. I much prefer it to Teavana's other chai blends, and over any other chai I've had really. While pricey, I find 2 oz. lasts about two weeks if you drink one large 12oz tumblr of tea a day, and longer if you're drinking an 8oz mug. The used leaves don't rebrew particularly well and take on a kind of "metallic" taste if you boil the leaves to try and improve the weak flavor of the rebrew, but this seems a small criticism of an otherwise excellent and robust tea.

review/summary: What a Deal
review/text: About a month ago, I found a deal on Amazon by which I was able to order two, three lb. bags of this flavor of Fancy Feast and so I set the three lb bags up to come to my house every three months. Then, I was cruising through the Fancy Feast aisles looking for some wet food with cheese in it by Fancy Feast when I happened across these bags. After I read up on these, I decided to cancel the other order and put this in to be delivered at 6 month intervals with Subscribe and Save.<br />I will be getting more food at one time than I was previously BUT there are some real positives to it for me.<br />Number one: I like getting my wet and dry cat food delivered to my home. It saves me from tromping off to PetCo so often. When I go to PetCo, I am like a kid in a candy store. They have SO MUCH stuff. I tend to get carried away and buy things I don't need. Now I will be going only once or twice a year to get foods that my kitties cannot get from Amazon. That I can handle.<br />Number 2: Since these are packaged in 16 ounce packages, I can just rip one open and put in in my Kibble bowl which holds 48 ounces. It takes my kitties quite a while to eat their way through that. Now, I do not have to store open cat food in my closet. With the larger packages, I was doing that. I would mix the flavors to keep the kitties happy with a variety of tastes, but as a consequence had 3 open bags of cat food in my closet. That meant that the kibble got spilled on the floor and I was forever having to pick it up. With these packages, I can still mix the 3 flavors, but will not have kibble dripping in my closet as a result.<br />Number 3: the kibble will stay fresher. In addition to still providing the kitties with a variety of tastes, I will now always have fresh tastes for them. Lord knows how stale that stuff gets after it sits in a 7 pound bag which is open, for a while. Now the spoiled mousers will always have fresh food which is carried to the door by someone else.<br />Number 4: Kitties stay healthy. The primary staple of my kitties diet is Fancy Feast Kibble. They each get a can of wet food each evening as a supplement. I do this to increase the fluid intake of the male to keep his urinary tract in good shape. I just had the cats to the vet and he said they are in great health and to keep doing whatever I am doing. So, Fancy Feast Kibble it is.<br />Number 5: The Ferals like it too. I have one or two feral cats who come to my door each night for their supper. The basic ingredient is Fancy Feast. Needless to say, they continue to show up night after night, so I gather it pleases their palate also.<br />So all kitties are happy and healthy here. I am really thrilled with this item and will use it as long as it is available.

review/summary: A good way to try the other flavors
review/text: I loved half of these flavors, liked one, and dumped the one down the drain. I'm glad I ordered this six pack though so I didn't make the mistake of buying a three-pack of one of the flavors I didn't like. Here's what I thought of them:<br /><br />Vanilla - EXCELLENT! I've used this syrup in ice cream, coffee, diet cola, and even in a low-carb crepe recipe. It's really good and one that I will re-order on it's own.<br /><br />Hazelnut - Yummy, rich flavor. It's great in coffee. I would order this again.<br /><br />Raspberry - I loved this one also. It's great in coffee and berry smoothies.<br /><br />Chocolate - I liked this one but it is VERY STRONG. Literally, one drop in a glass of diet cola will make it into a chocolate coke. It's good, but you don't need much. It didn't work well in coffee.<br /><br />Irish Creme - I knew I wouldn't like this one so it remains unopened. I made a mistake of buying a three pack of this one once and hated it. I'll give it away to someone who will enjoy it.<br /><br />CLASSIC Caramel - I don't know why Torani insists on making "Sugar Free Caramel Syrup" and "Sugar Free CLASSIC Caramel Syrup". The Classic Caramel is terrible. After experimenting and trying to find a use for this syrup I just dumped it down the drain. It's not worth it. Avoid this one.

review/summary: Six for the price of two ...
review/text: I actually got this package as a "Black Friday" deal on Amazon, so my price was even lower than the one posted here. I couldn't believe that they had it on the sugar-free variety pack! So 6 bottles for less than 2 bottles, with my Amazon Prime ... was a deal I couldn't resist.<br /><br />My favorites are the Raspberry, Vanilla, and Chocolate, although I also enjoy the other three flavors.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with the Torani syrups, they are an excellent addition to your coffee, your frappes, your oatmeal, your hot chocolate:  almost anything you sweeten, you can add a little Torani flavor. And unlike the creamy texture of other liquid chocolates, these are "clear."  In fact, if you ask for a squirt of flavor at your local coffee shop, most likely you will receive it from one of the Torani bottles!<br /><br />This summer I bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a> and started making Ice Blended coffee at home. While I love using the flavored coffees, it is difficult to find my favorites locally in a decaf blend. It is also impossible to find most of the Torani sugar-free flavors locally, which I need as a diabetic. So throw some of this in with my regular decaf, and WOW!!! I'm in love.<br /><br />Note - The one kind available in my local grocery store is a 12-oz bottle for $5, comparing to  than $10 for each of these bottles. Do be cautious if you are buying the single bottles on Amazon - which run much higher than that. However, this variety pack works out to a fantastic price.<br /><br />Great Taste - Great Price - Great Product. My husband only wishes that the cherry flavor came in this deal, but hey, that means I get to use all of them.

review/summary: Great price and selection
review/text: The package of 6 price is amazing.  I have been buying these in my store.  One small bottle costs about $6.00.  When I saw these, I thought I would never go through all of them, I'm now ordering my second set.  I even ordered the pumps, which makes it super easy to measure how much you are adding, one pump or two.  Normal flavor 2 pumps, chocolate often just 1 (it is strong), extra flavor or large cup might be 3.<br /><br />I mainly use these in coffee.  I've found flavored coffee just doesn't taste as good.  I talked to a friend who owns a coffee store and he said none of the coffee stores will use the flavored coffee because you just don't get a lot of the flavor, that is why they all use the syrups, more variety and better flavor.<br /><br />My main suggestion is to not be afraid of mixing the flavors, again a trick I saw in the coffee shops.  I found mixing the caramel and chocolate in my coffee with milk is as close to a starbucks latte that I can get.  I didn't like the raspberry much until I added a tiny bit of chocolate.  Wow chocolate covered raspberries!  This is great on vanilla ice Cream too.  So if you find you don't like one of the flavors, try adding a bit of another.

review/summary: Good variety
review/text: I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PFWNSE">Torani Variety Pack, Regular, 25.36-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>.  I had never tried Torani products before and I had wanted to try them as I heard good things about their sugar free syrups.  I have tried 4 of the flavors that I thought I would like.  They are so good that I have trouble believing that they are SUGAR FREE and FAT FREE!<br /><br />My two favorite flavors are Vanilla and Hazelnut. I stopped using fattening products in my coffee and stopped buying lattes and cappuccinos because they are so fattening.  However, my coffees were now so ordinary that I practically stopped drinking coffee.  Torani syrups changed all that! Both the Torani Vanilla and Torani Hazelnut are so incredibly good tasting, that they turn my so-so coffee into a lattee-like drink.  Wow!  It is hard to believe these syrups are sugar free and low in calories! The Torani Chocolate appears to be an equally good product although I was disappointed when it did not enhance my coffee.  Torani Chocolate is very strong which means that you should add less than you do with the Vanilla and Hazelnut flavors.  For Vanilla and Hazelnut, I add about 1/2 to 1 oz of syrup to a very large (12 oz) coffee.  Putting the same amount of Chocolate in coffee did not enhance the flavor.  In other types of shakes, I will probably use less than the usual amount of Chocolate.  I think it might be better in milk shakes.  Since I love Chocolate as a flavor, I should be able to find good uses for it.  I also love the Raspberry flavor in iced tea and it adds an interesting twist to lemonade.  I think Raspberry will be good with other fruity flavors.  Although I am disappointed in a few of the flavor bottles that came with this 6 pack, I am basically happy with the purchase.  The bottles that are good are REALLY GOOD!  Additionally, purchasing all 6 varieties gave me the chance to try a number of different Torani SF syrups that are yummy and let me know which to choose and which to avoid. I probably will not like either the Irish Creme or Classic Caramel flavors because I am not partial to these flavors by any beverage maker.  I will probably not open them and give these flavors away to someone who will appreciate them more than me.

review/summary: I've Had Better but Not in Sugar-Free
review/text: My local grocery store only carries the vanilla Torani syrup in the sugar-free version, and so I decided to order the variety pack from Amazon to see what I thought of their other flavors.  I try to limit my sugar intake, so that's why I was so keen to get a variety of sugar-free ones.  Interestingly, I found that the different flavors do better in different types of drinks.<br /><br />Vanilla - This is still hands down one of the most versatile flavors. I add it to carbonated water and make my own creme soda. It also does well in hot chocolate and coffee, and I've also added it to baking recipes when I've been in a pinch and out of vanilla extract.<br /><br />Raspberry - I'm not usually a huge fan of artificial raspberry flavors, and I don't like this one in coffee or hot chocolate, but it is absolutely wonderful in iced tea! Who knew? I was prepared to donate this one to the office coffee stash, but on a whim added it to my iced tea when I was out of Splenda, and wow, it's very good and seems to lose the funky aftertaste in the tea.<br /><br />Caramel - I'm not overly impressed with this one, but it does work well in adding to my oatmeal in the morning to liven up the plain oats. It tastes even better with a dash of cinnamon, but I don't use this one in drinks because it just tastes kind of odd. It's almost like they couldn't decide between caramel, butterscotch and some other random flavor and kind of went with the middle ground.  I wouldn't order this flavor by itself.<br /><br />Chocolate - This is another one that I've added to my oatmeal at breakfast and have been happy with the result.  This one also works with coffee, but not tea.<br /><br />Irish Creme - I'm a big Irish Creme fan usually, but this one is just kind of so-so.  I do like it in a glass of hot milk for a steamer, and it's okay in hot chocolate, but tastes weird in coffee.<br /><br />Hazelnut - This is a good one for coffee, hot chocolate and oatmeal.  I combine it with the Chocolate one in the oatmeal and it tastes kind of like a Ferrero Rocher, and makes my daily breakfast feel like a bit more of an indulgence than it really is.<br /><br />I ordered the Variety Pack on the Subscribe and Save 4 month rotation, and had to go in and cancel the second shipment because I'm only about halfway through the bottles. It's a toss up as to whether or not I'll completely cancel the subscription because these are sugar-free and it's so hard to find flavor additions that don't come laden down with teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Amazon - it would be wonderful if you could offer a make your own variety pack of the Sugar-free syrups! I've seen other Torani sugar-free choices, but I don't want to make the commitment to a 6 pack of a single flavor. I'd definitely order a lot more of these syrups if I could mix up the Variety pack to be more than just these 6 flavors.

review/text: In the past I have bought my syrup from World Market when on sale and when I lived in Seattle. Although  our local  Fred Meyer store stocks Torani the flavors are limited. So I  subscribed the the sugar free variety pack thinking I could tolerate the two flavors I don't much care for. Wrong. the Raspberry and Irish Creme keep piling up because I don't like them. But some reviewers have given me a few ideas. I merely tolerate the hazelnut and vanilla. Love the caramel and chocolate. What I would really like is to be able to select my own sugar free variety pack and or be able to purchase one that has coconut (my absolute fav), white chocolate, almond, caramel, peppermint, and gingerbread syrup (I am addicted to this flavor). I would even settle for sugar free coconut in the three pack. PLEASE add more flavors.

review/summary: Kind of expensive, but good flavors and they last a long time
review/text: I've never bought flavored syrups before but wanted to try them. These six flavors are each 25.4 ounces, are sweetened with Splenda and come in plastic bottles.  There is no pump on the bottles, although you can buy one.<br /><br />I think it's generous to call these "syrup" as they are the consistency of water.  But the flavors are bold, and if you're careful pouring they will last a long time.  We've experimented with the vanilla, hazelnut classic, caramel, chocolate and raspberry flavors so far.<br /><br />I've used the vanilla, hazelnut, caramel and chocolate in my morning coffee, and they add a nice flavor without overpowering the coffee.  I'm guessing I added about a tablespoon per cup of coffee.<br /><br />My kids liked the chocolate flavor mixed into hot cocoa.  We mixed some of the raspberry flavor into homemade yogurt, and that was pretty tasty too.  We haven't tried the Irish cream flavor yet, but I've used it in coffee before and I'm sure it will be the same.<br /><br />Overall, this is an expensive indulgence (for me) but one I'm glad I tried.

review/text: The vanilla, chocolate and irish cream are yummy. The others . . . not so much. But it does make a nice addition to my ever-growing wet bar. they are sweet, so go easy with them.  I find all it takes is about 1-1.5 cap fulls to flavor the drink. anything more than that and you get that artificial sweetener taste.  Also, for those that care, the irish cream, chocolate, hazelnut and raspberry are gluten free.

review/summary: Very happy I purchased these!
review/text: April 12, 2012<br /><br />I am very happy that I decided to purchase these.  The shipping was super fast.  It said estimated shipping was going to be about 1.5 weeks but it took only four days!  The packaging was great and the products are pretty large; I live alone and I know they'll last me for quite some time.<br /><br />I have been on a low-card no sugar diet for about a month now with great results.  I'm allowed water, coffee (with minimal amounts of extras) and unsweetened tea (it's tolerable but it's much better with sugar).  However, the only thing I've really been missing is my McDonald's Vanilla Iced Coffee (Bummer).  I have been trying to find a way to recreate my own this past month but those non-dairy creamers have about 10 grams of carbs per 4 tsp - not happening!  I am not a huge fan these days of artificial sweetners but I was looking for something with low sugars/zero sugars and low carbohydrates.  I'm not using it in excess, only about one cup of coffee per day so I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />I only opened one so far as I just got them in the mail today.  I'm trying to be patient and only open one at a time so they keep well.  I am hoping to use the raspberry for my iced tea and the others for coffee.  At the moment I'm only making hot coffee but I should be getting a Ninja food processor/blender in a couple of days and I'm hoping to blend up some amazing creations.<br /><br />It states to use about 1 oz per serving but I opened the Classic Caramel (I have read that many hate this one) but it's tolerable, it's probably not going to be my favorite but I like it enough to drink it, I only used 4 tsp of syrup in a travel mug.  It's not overly sweet as the originals may be but it's not bad and it's a great substitution!<br /><br />I'll update my feedback once I've opened a few more which should be a while. I'm also hoping I like all of them enough to make a repurchase in several months when these are gone.  I went to the Torani website and found tons of recipes so I'm hoping I can make something delicious!  I'm glad I didn't place myself on the auto ship because I don't think that I'll go through them fast enough but I will definitely be considering a repurchase!<br /><br />Does anyone know the nutritional info on the full-sugar ones?  I'd be interested to know!

review/summary: They seem all right
review/text: I would have preferred them to have been made with stevia as opposed to splenda for ease of mind out of health concern reasons surrounding the safeness of splenda, but it is what it is. I also wish they'd come in glass as opposed to plastic bottles in these sizes maybe even flip tops because then they could have been recycled and used for wine or beer bottling purposes which would be great. As for the flavor I've tried 3 out of the 6 so far raspberry, chocolate, and caramel. The caramel has a nice aroma to me and tastes all right, but my least favorite so far. The chocolate seems to mix really nice with the raspberry and also seems to really stand out better to me in iced coffee. The raspberry was my favorite out of the 3 I've had the opportunity to try thus far. I think they are nice additions to flavor coffee's with, but you need to figure out the right consistencies on the amounts to use with them too much tastes a bit artificial and too little and it can be too subtle and difficult to discern the flavoring in them. I'd give them 4 out 5 overall they seem decent really, but has areas for improvement though I wouldn't exactly hesitate to recommend them or give them away as a gift to the right person.

I am doing a subscription plan, which cuts the cost and ensures there is enough for everyone. I'd love to see a 'pick your own flavors' six pack, so I could try more kinds.

review/summary: Great flavors, many uses, excellent price
review/text: I'm not huge on sugar free items sweetened with anything but Stevia, but I have to admit these syrups are really great tasting.. At the subscribe price, I got each of these really large bottles for about the same price I paid for a very small bottle at wally world, and they only carry a few sugar free flavors..<br /><br />We're on Atkins, so we've really cut down on carbs, but we both like sweets, so these syrups let us still have sweets without the carbs..<br /><br />The Hazlenut is not my favorite flavor, but I've used it in MiM's (muffin in a minute) and it tasted a lot better than I expected.. I know a lot of people use this flavor in coffee, but I don't personally like it in coffee. If you do, it'd be great for that.<br /><br />The Classic Caramel is delicious.. I've used it in MiM's, Italian sodas, protein shakes and in coffee.. I've also mixed it with the chocolate sugar free syrup and the two together make another delicious taste treat.. The two combined make the best Italian soda ever! I've made chocolate MiM's with cream cheese frosting flavored with this flavor.. Love the taste.<br /><br />I read some other feedback concerning the Classic Caramel, stating it isn't very good and to be sure to purchase the tradition Caramel.. I've never tasted the traditional, but have to say, I think the Classic is delicious.. Taste's like a piece of caramel candy to me.<br /><br />The Chocolate is delicious. Works good in MiM's, italian soda's, coffee, cream cheese frostings, protein shakes, anything you want to add chocolate to without the carbs..<br /><br />The Raspberry tastes exactly like raspberry's.. It's great.. We use it on home made yogurt with raspberry's on top.. pour a little syrup over it, and it's a delicious, low carb treat..Also great in a low carb protein shake mixed with raspberry's and a little syrup, mix in a blender and it's like a shake.. Delicious! I also used it in MiM's, or as cream cheese frosting on a chocolate MiM...YUMMY...Mixed it with chocolate in an italian soda.. Delicious..<br /><br />The Irish Cream is delicious used in a MiM in both the muffin and mixed in softened cream cheese to frost it.. Also fantastic in Italian soda's.. Haven't tried it in a protein shake yet, but imagine it'll be great. Probably great in yogurt, too.. Very tasty!<br /><br />I'm not a huge vanilla fan, but have to say, the vanilla is really good! Can be used in all kinds of things calling for vanilla, but really good when mixed with the chocolate in an italian soda or mixed in softened cream cheese to frost a chocolate MiM...<br /><br />All in all, great variety of syrups.. The one I would change is the Hazlenut.. I've just never been a big Hazlenut fan, but I'm sure I'll find more uses for it eventually.

review/text: Shipping was fast. Note that this isn't really a syrup consistency, it's more watery.<br />As far as flavors:<br />Chocolate: Very strong, only need a bit. Great in coffee!<br />Raspberry: Not my favorite, but my roommate liked it- it's a little too sweet for me.<br />Vanilla: Great in everything!<br />Irish cream: Good, only ok.<br />Caramel: Too sweet, but ok if only a little is used.<br />Hazelnut: By FAR my favorite, will order just this flavor again (maybe vanilla). Great in italian sodas and coffee.<br /><br />Overall, I like this package, I think it was a great value. Planning on using up all of the bottles, although I will probably not re-order this package again. But I think the brand is great!

review/summary: Great for new users; disappointing for those with an established favorite.
review/text: I can be a little timid when it comes to trying sugar-free products. Many leave that horrible aftertaste or at the least take some serious getting used to. But I gave these a shot because I'm not willing to consume 4 cups of coffee a day with each having an extra 70 kcal shot of the regular syrup. That's an extra 280 calories at the start of my day! But these were positively delicious with no bad taste or guilt from empty calories.<br /><br />So I gave the variety pack a go, knowing I was sure to find a quick favorite.<br /><br />My favorite was the Vanilla. Sweet and earthy just like vanilla should be. I will definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />The Irish Cream was my second favorite out of the six. It adds an amazing creamy, buttery finish to each sip of coffee that you are sure to die for.<br /><br />In third, was the Chocolate syrup. I am generally not a mocha fan so I used the chocolate syrup a bit sparingly at first. But soon I was splashing in even more. It has a very gentle dark chocolate flavor without the bitter notes usually associated with dark variety.<br /><br />Next was the hazelnut. I am neither impressed nor detested by this flavor. It is a bit mediocre when compared to the more full-bodied syrups but will do in a pinch if you're craving that touch of sweetness.<br /><br />Second to last we have the Classic Caramel. This was absolutely disappointing. I hoped for hints of cream and brown sugar, but instead got a simple sweet syrup with hardly any actual flavor. It did the job of sweetening my coffee but did not provide the caramel heaven I desired. I have heard the Salted Caramel is much better, so that flavor has been added to my "To-Try List".<br /><br />Last is the raspberry, my least favorite. I am detested by the idea of fruity coffee (ei. blueberry, raspberry, etc.) so this was not a good coffee syrup for me. Instead, I decided to make raspberry tea with it. After several tries with black, green, and cranberry-pomegranate tea, I have decided this syrup just doesn't work well. As most of the syrups are made to add a subtle flavor to robust coffee, you have to add much more syrup if you want to actually flavor your tea. And all of that extra syrup just makes it way to sweet. This was also the only flavor I actually tasted that sugar-free aftertaste, though possibly because I had to use so much.<br /><br />It's hard to give a good rating for a variety pack as there are three spectacular flavors and three slightly disappointing flavors.<br /><br />Overall though I say this sampler is great if you're new to their syrups and would like to try a good variety of their flavors for a great price. But if you already have established your favorites, I'd suggest buying their 3 pack of a single flavor at the same retail-reduced price of under $5 a bottle.

My favorite flavors are the caramel, hazlenut, and vanilla.

Hard to find Torani where I live so, so I'm happy I can reorder on Amazon. There is no artificial sweetener aftertaste as long as you don't overdo it on the quantity you use per beverage. It's great in yogurt too!

review/text: I've tried only the caramel, chocolate and hazelnut flavours so far and am disappointed. This is the first and last time that I will buy a sugar=free syrup. I don't usually do sugar-free but I was recently on a diet so I gave in. In any case, I've had regular Torani syrups in the past, and they never failed to please. The sugar-free chocolate was gross. Did not taste like chocolate at all. The caramel smelled very hopeful, but ultimately tasted awful as well. The only one so far that actually tastes like its indicated flavour is the hazelnut. For the time being, I am back to my regular Torani syrups, but perhaps one day soon, I'll brave another sugar-free one...

First of all I do not like Splenda sweetener because to me it has a lingering after-taste. I had hopes that the flavored syrup would at least hide the bad taste but to me it only seems to make it worse. I will buy the Torani Flavored syrups again but only in the sugar sweetened versions.The true flavors of these Sugar Free syrups seems to be overpowered by the Slenda after taste.

review/summary: Decent taste, but some definite drawbacks.
review/text: Amazon doesn't list the ingredients of this, but it does contain lots of high fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup.  Corn syrup, especially the high fructose variety, is quite bad for you.  It's cheap for manufacturers, that's partly why they use it.  I'm disappointed in Heinz about his.  Due to this, it has 4 grams of sugar per 1 Tbsp serving, double the sugar of another bottle of regular ketchup I have.  Since most of us use at least 2 Tbsp per serving this is quite a bit of sugar.<br /><br />Second, this uses Potassium Chloride, the main ingredient of No Salt salt substitute.  This can be fine for many people (used in moderation) but it is a strict no-no for people taking certain blood pressure medications, such as myself (I think many medications in the ACE-inhibitor family especially).<br /><br />I should have somehow found the ingredients list from Heinz itself (or somewhere on the net) before buying this.  Maybe I tried, I forget.  At any rate, for your convenience, here is the list of ingredients, in this exact order from the label:<br />"INGREDIENTS: TOMATOE CONCENTRATE MADE FROM RED RIPE TOMATOES, DISTILLED VINEGAR, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, *POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SPICE, ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER, NATURAL FLAVORING.  * NOT IN REGULAR KETCHUP"<br /><br />Interestingly, this did not come in a case, even though 9 is the minumum order.  It came as loose bottles in a box.  Also, there was a barcode/description label sticker over part of the manufacturer ingredients list and nutrition info label in the exact same place on each bottle.  This was probably for internal Amazon purposes.  I bit of a pain to peel back to read underneath, but you only really need to do this on one bottle anyway, so not that big of a deal.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I have CHF with cardiomyopathy.  I have to limit my sodium to under 2,000 mg per day.  Because of great products like this ketchup - I can do that pretty easily most days!  My CardioElectroPhysicist had never heard of no-salt ketchup, he thinks it's great!<br /><br />Heinz no-salt ketchup tastes wonderful!  It has a slightly stonger tomato flavor, but I wouldn't have guessed it was no-salt.  I use it for homemade BBQ sauce, french fries, etc - it's awesome!  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Surprise
review/text: I always thought alot of salt was tasty and good for you. Maybe that's why I need to take pills for high blood pressure. Bout time someone steps up to the plate to help provide products that improve your health if you choose.<br />The strangest thing that happened is that I have tried a number of no salt items, and I thought that I would hate them. Guess what, a number of items are much better tasting than the same items with salt. I am stunned and healthier.

review/summary: Tasty Treat for Dogs with Grain Allergies
review/text: My dog absolutely loves these treats.  He's allergic to wheat, corn, soy, chicken, pork and fish, so there aren't a lot of options to choose from, but he really and truly loves these.
