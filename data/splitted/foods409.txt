review/summary: Amazon sent the wrong item
review/text: Amazon sent the chicken and brown rice by mistake.  I'm old and disabled.  I can't mail it back and get the chicken and regular rice.  It's too heavy for me to deal with.  What a disappointment.  But I still gave it all 5 stars because this brand of dry cat food is excellent even though Amazon sent the wrong kind.  Epilogue.  Amazon kindly sent me a refund.  All's well.  The problem is that Blue Buffalo doesn't clearly label their products on the bag. You have to read the ingredients and look at the color of the bag to figure out what you have.

review/text: Yes its a little cheaper online but you better be prepared to wait. For some odd reason they say it takes 2 weeks for them to be able to ship it out. I forgot and didnt order early enough and just had to order a bag on 5/11 and its 5/27 and still no cat food. Says it will be here June 2. Thats nuts. Not sure I will order online anymore. Its worth an extra $5 to just buy from petco.

review/text: These are the absolute best gf crackers and flatbread - any flavor!  The flavor is subtle, not overbearing, but not understated either.  The crackers and flatbread are crunchy - great with cheese or just plain.  The only problem with them is you can't put them down until the box is empty!  They are a bit pricey, but worth every penny.

review/summary: The Ultimate Aquired Taste
review/text: Okay.  I wasn't raised Jewish, I grew up in a series of small towns in the south where the possibility of Kosher food was....remote.  I don't even like celery.  So can someone explain to me why I find this stuff so incredibly addicting?<br /><br />This drink is an enigma wrapped inside a mystery wrapped inside a pea-green can.  Most people in the country have never even heard of it.  It seems the only people who do enjoy it are people who grew up drinking it at their local Kosher deli.  And even *then*, it's a niche all to itself.  Mention celery soda to someone, and they won't believe you.  Give 'em some to taste and ninety-nine times out of a hundred they still won't believe it.  But ohhhh, that one percent!  They are hooked for life, and you've found a fellow sufferer.<br /><br />You'd think, with all the "indy" soda companies popping up nowadays, experiments with new flavors and so on, we'd see more innovative flavors along these lines.  I guess we're still playing catch up with 100-year-old recipes from  doctors who may not even have existed.<br /><br />Seriously, not for everyone by any means, but if you're one of the chosen few, you'll never find anything like it.

review/summary: The elixir of life itself!
review/text: Dr Brown's Cel Ray soda is the pot of proverbial gold waiting at the end of the rainbow. My favorite part of drinking Celray soda is the fresh, slightly peppery, celery bouquet that greets you upon opening the can. For me, this is one of those rare culinary treats in the world, and I have traveled the world.<br /><br />Dr Brown's Cel Ray soda is best enjoyed freshly poured into a 12 oz glass filled with fresh dry ice cubes. Lifting the glass to your face to feel the tingle of the fine spray of escaping carbonation, you inhale the celery bouquet, as if tasting a fine wine. Unlike wines however, the refreshing bouquet and taste of Dr Brown's Cel Ray is always a dependable and repeatable experience. The increasingly difficult part is unfortunately, that it's becoming more and more difficult to find, even in New York. Someone needs to contact the company and find out why this is so.<br /><br />5 star product!

review/text: If you are of a certain age and remember going into a deli and having a hot dog or knish with some celray soda then you are going to be delighted with this purchase. The taste is not for everyone because it really does kind of taste like a combination of ginger ale and cellery - but I just love the stuff. And it's cheaper than a plane ticket back east.

review/text: When I lived and worked in NYCity, years ago, I enjoyed celery tonic at various delis as accompaniment to a sandwich. I recently searched for it on the world-wide network and found it at Amazon. Although it was quite expensive (but free shipping), I ordered 12 bottles. My memories of its taste were exagerated. But it is a refreshing drink, and distinctive.

review/summary: So addictive
review/text: I recently tried this soda when I was in NYC in June.  My girlfriend, I and my best friend went to the Carnegie deli for lunch.  I haven't been there in a long time and I asked my friend what he would reccommend on the menu.  He said to get a pastrami sandwich and the cel-ray soda.  I thought to myself, cel-ray soda, yuck as I am not a big soda drinker to begin with and this did not sound too appetizing.  I ordered the Woody Allen which was pastrami and corned beef on rye with cel-ray soda.  The sandwich was huge, only ate half.  The cel-ray soda was simply amazing, a slight hint of celery in a light refreshing drink.  When I got home back to upstate New York, I began to try to find this amazing soda in my area.  I googled it to see who would carry it in my area and it said select Wegmans stores carry it.  I have 5 Wegmans in my area and not one carries it.  The only Wegmans I have seen it in is in Williamsville, NY a Buffalo suburb.  I am lucky I am out that way every few weeks, so I stock up.  Do yourself a favor and try this amazing soda, you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Lacking fizz
review/text: I ordered this as a gift for my husband, who loves Cel-Ray but can't find it locally. Unfortunately the bottles appeared to have frozen during shipping -- some still had ice chunks inside when I opened the box. Even worse, some had leaked, making the box bottom sticky and soggy. Most of the bottles were fine, but a few were flat when opened, probably from being frozen. I'd look for cans instead of bottles if I ordered them again; I suppose they could lose their fizz too, but at least it would avoid the soggy mess.<br />As for the flavor (which was new to me), it was better than I expected - definitely a recognizable celery component, but in a pleasant way.

The product is tasty enough, but she can't eat it due to it being packed with zillions of hard, miniscule seeds!<br /><br />Did someone change the rules? Last I checked, Preserves = ground up fruit. Jelly = seedless, pulpless... JELLY!<br />Red Currant Jelly is easy enough to find in the store, and it doesn't have any seeds. Is making black currant jelly a crime against nature or something? I can't find it anywhere!<br /><br />Is there anyone out there who makes a seedless Black Currant jelly? Anyone? *cricket cricket*<br /><br />Poor mom. She was so disappointed.<br /><br />Both the people who make this and the people who sell this need to find the highest points in their houses and jump off them onto something sharp for labeling fruit preserves as jelly.

review/summary: Substitute for my coffee!
review/text: I was looking for a substitute for my coffee since my Doctor told me I could no longer enjoy my morning cup. I am not a huge fan of Tea, but I do enjoy a glass of Apple Juice. In the mornings now I grab my coffee mug, fill it with my favotite Tree Top apple juice, heat it for 2 minutes in the micorwave, and drop in a bag of this WONDERFUL Mulling Spice. I LOVE the fact that I can have a KICK of flavor and a nice warm beverage. This is the best substitute for my coffee I have ever found.<br /><br />I rather liked the large packaging, this will give me many months of worry free morning routines. The boxes are tucked in the cupboard where my coffee and tea were stored and fit nicely. If you remember this wonderful flavor as a child around Christmas, you must try this product. It has all the right combinations of flavor to make it the perfect addition to anyones morning.

And apple sauce, ginger, some vinegar, sugar, spices and, of course, Habanero peppers. No preservatives whatsoever.<br /><br />I don't know why, I expected a super-hot mixture, something likely to burn a hole in my stomach if swallowed but, as it happens to be the case with the other Fischer & Wieser sauce I sampled, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3Q0QK">Fischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, 20-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>, this one too is a well-balanced - it means NOT HOT - concoction that discretely but effectively enhances the taste of whatever it may be added to. My uses so far, and the Habanero met and exceeded expectations: an Egyptian omelette (don't ask how or why), lamb chops, salmon.<br /><br />When used as directed, the Habanero sauce will tilt any dinner toward the mysterious, the flavorful, the exotic.<br /><br />P.S. - it's a 5-star ONLY if you don't mind 'sweet' in a hot sauce.

But I might in the near future :)<br /><br />I should offer a warning to people who are subjected to random urinalyses: at work, in the military or on probation: some of the recipes that call for a large amounts of poppy seeds (like Hungarian "Beiglis") can cause a positive result for opiate use.<br /><br />I run these tests for people in my department and for some employees, it can cause serious problems, so please be careful! I unofficially tested myself after eating a Czech Kolache, and my pee was positive for opiates for four days!! (using the OPI2000 indicator kit)<br /><br />Probably best not to bring these dishes in to work and share them with your co-workers! They covered this on Myth-Busters I heard, and its absolutely true.

review/summary: pasta lover
review/text: My family love pasta (we are not Italian!) and over the years it seems that we were addicted to the heavy tomatoe base sauces and gradually ventured into others. Then I found Parma Rosa which is just the right combination of tomato, cream, subtle flavors etc. It is perfect for a main dish or a side dish. There are other similar ones on the grocers shelves and I've tried them but nothing does it better than Knorrs!<br />Pasta Lover

review/text: Crown Prince sells some good oysters, but these aren't it.  These oysters are packed in industrial seed oil (cottonseed oil in this case), which is not only horrible health-wise, it also doesn't taste good.  And they're from China, which has notoriously bad water pollution issues.<br /><br />These are the good ones: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CD4PM0">Crown Prince Natural Smoked Oysters in Pure Olive Oil, 3-Ounce (Pack of 9)</a>.  They're packed in olive oil and they're from South Korea.  Unfortunately, Amazon is currently out of stock in them, but these are the ones you want.

review/text: I'm trying to increase the seafood part of my diet and my local grocery has a small display of canned seafood items. I'm trying them out. One of the items is Crown Prince Smoked Oysters in Cottonseed Oil (3.75 ounce can). It says that one serving size is one can and that seemed just about right for a light evening meal. I had the oysters with some low fat "Wisecrackers" having roasted garlic and rosemary. It was a good combination with the oysters. It was a good snack-sized meat and quite delicious. The oysters were a little high in fat and cholesterol but had 28 grams of protein, 28% of my daily needs! The oysters were quite good tasting and I'll be picking them up again in the future.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Well, whether it's sand or shell bits that my teeth are grinding on, I'm sure to get some extra minerals that I didn't pay for each time I'm hungry enough to wolf down a can of these little mollusks.<br /><br />Oh, and they come packed in Cottonseed oil.  You know, the oil squeezed right from the seeds of the plant your T-Shirt is made of, and we know how great T-shirts taste!<br /><br />Seriously, what was I thinking?  I suppose I'll finish the package I bought because I abhor wasting food, and there are many in the world who don't even get to eat stuff like this, but I'll never buy this product again.

review/summary: It is good for "soba" noodle
review/text: "Soba" is a noodle made from buckwheat flour, and is one of my favorite Japanese foods.  If I lived somewhere in east or west coast, I could find Japanese food restaurant where I can eat it.  However, it have been only the way to use dried noodle here.  Once I tried to make "soba" with a buckwheat flour found in a store, it was ground whole buckwheat including pellicle and inner skin. It's flavor was "soba" but contained too much fibers.  Then I had given up to make it until I get this.<br />This flour is from good part of buckwheat, and suitable to make "soba" noodle.  I'm enjoying making "soba" with this flour on each weekend.<br />This flour is not "sa-ra-si-na" (in Japanese) that is a flour using the most inner starch rich part, but "ichiban ko" (1st grade flour) or "nami ko" (general purpose flour).  "Soba" from this flour becomes "Edo mae" (Tokyo style).  If this has little bit more of inner skin (or pellicle), I can make "Inaka soba" (country style), I like more than "Edo mae".

Relying on a carefully balanced blend of flavors it is  a rich thick sauce that absolutely shines on chicken, shrimp and pork. I love it on ribs! Roasted vegetables are a natural for this sauce. We have a grilled shrimp recipe that is an absolute crowd pleases. Take some jumbo shrimp and marinate them in a mixture of honey and African Rhino Peri-Peri sauce skewer and and pour the marinade on the shrimp while grilling. Works great for chicken kebabs too.

Tootsie Roll Pops are alternatively called Tootsie Pops, as noted on the Tootsie Roll web site.<br /><br />Tootsie Roll Pops, invented in 1931, have been one of my favorites since my childhood. Of course, some of us never quite grow up, and the pleasure of sucking on a Tootsie Pop remains.

review/summary: The best!!!
review/text: These are the best "sugar free" (non-enriched wheat flour) crackers I have ever eaten. These are the best & sweetened w/ fruit juice! I am on the sugar busters diet & one of the few snacks you can have is triscuits. Now, you can dress them up, but a reduced fat triscuit is not very satisfying all by itself. I am very finicky about taste & IMO, these are better than Ritz, which can sometimes be too salty. I love these, I can eat 3 or 4 & stop a hunger craving until my next meal or put some smuckers natural peanut butter on them for a more satisfying snack. I promise you, you will not think they taste bad at all. They may not become your fav cracker, but no nasty after tastes or anything negative about them! One last thing, they come in a plastic bag, so I don't feel compelled to eat part or 1/2 of a roll...I just take out a few & close the box.

I was very excited to try the new Post Great Grains Cereals, especially after seeing the television commercial comparison between Post Great Grains and other cereals. The difference really is in the grain. Post Great Grains looks like it was just picked fresh from the field. And the taste is absolutely wonderful. It's not cardboard-y tasting at all; the flavor is delicious and just the right combination of ingredients. Of the two boxes I received, the Post Great Grains Raisins, Dates & Pecans is definitely my favorite but that's probably because I love raisins. :) Do yourself a favor and try Post Great Grains. You'll be amazed at the difference in the grain!

review/text: I don't understand how anyone could eat this cereal.  It immediately turned to mush.  Maybe that's because I use almond milk, but I doubt it makes a difference.  Even as I was pouring the milk, I could see the cereal soaking it up like a sponge!  I have never said this about anything before in my life, but it was not sweet enough.  It tasted flat.  I usually choose cereals with little sugar, but even I thought this needed more.  After I added sugar to it, I still couldn't force myself to finish the bowl.  This soggy bowl of slop was just too disgusting to be edible.  I really wanted to like this cereal -- it's got excellent nutritional value.  Very disappointing.

review/summary: Low quality product for a top quality price
review/text: While the pod I received was of the advertised size, it did not meet my expectations in terms of product quality. The container was quite obviously handmade by someone with no attention to detail and poor metalworking skills, using materials that can best be described as city dump scrap. It is stainless steel, but it's pitted and of uneven thickness. The rolled edges were done very badly and are quite uneven. And while the box is of the specified dimensions, what was not specified is that it is not true-to-shape, making the fit between the top and bottom far less than ideal. In my opinion, this box should be valued at no more than a dollar or two. I think the seller has a lot of nerve offering this as first-quality merchandise.

review/text: These are just the size the description states- snack size.  Ours came from the 3-in-one (which we LOVE).  I've never used these for anything wet, but it's perfect for pretzel sticks, or to put cucumbers in to keep the rest of the food from getting damp.  The lids always feel secure, but at the same time, easy to pull off.  Four stars insteade of five, because of price.

review/summary: A great spicy snack
review/text: This tastes pretty much exactly like the instant/non-cup version, which says a lot.  There's quite a kick to it that the hot/spicy intolerant may find difficult to stomach but that can easily be fixed since the seasoning package (hot) can be adjusted.  Finally, this is perfect for a snack since 2.6 oz isn't enough for a meal.

review/summary: Healthy Option
review/text: Pros:<br />No added sugar (1 g per 2 Tbsp serving)<br />No added salt (30 mg per serving)<br />Great taste<br />Organic<br />No stirring needed<br /><br />Cons:<br />Expensive, even for sunflower butter (we paid $6.20 per jar here at amazon, with free shipping)<br />Thin consistency (closer to a pourable topping than a 'butter')<br />A bit higher in calories than many nut/seed butters (220 cal per serving)<br /><br />This makes a nice optional butter for anyone with allergies (facility is peanut and tree nut free) or someone just looking for variety.  It is a bit messy to use because of how thin it is.  On the plus side, though, I'm sure I use less than a serving on my sandwich to avoid having it drip or squirt out, which keeps calories lower.  It remains thin when refrigerated, which the package recommends after opening to maintain freshness.<br /><br />We eat a reduced sodium and low sugar diet, and did find that we could tell that this was made without either.  It is definitely less sweet than a "no added sugar" peanut butter.  Since we usually make our sandwiches with either a banana or strawberries, we didn't mind the missing sweetness, but someone used to a more traditional butter product may.<br /><br />Amazon shipping on this product was fast and without any problems (USPS).

review/summary: ~*~ Yummy Sunny Seed Butter ~*~
review/text: I gotta admit when I first tasted "Sunbutter," I wasn't thrilled.  I guess my tongue was just rejecting this slightly new taste--"this isn't nut butter," barks my taste buds, lol ;)  But it just took a time or two after that for me to become quite pleased with this new spread.  In fact, it's now become one of my staple goodies.  Besides now loving the flavor, I also love that it's organic and it has not a dab of sugar.  Note, this is just the ORGANIC; I think their others have sugar--just remember green lid is on the organic.  I love it on whole grain crackers drizzled with local raw honey.  And to keep my carbs/fats/protein balanced, I also usually add some chocolate rice protein.  As well as some healthy sea salt and a teaspoon or so of ground flax.  I blend it all into the butter, then spread.  I really doctor it up, but that's not to mask the taste--which is great on its own--I'm just big on the healthy stuff :-)  Another great thing about sunflower butter (and oil) is that it's a good source of vitamin E and also has magnesium, a mineral many of us need more of. And if all of that isn't enough, I also re-purpose the green lid.  It fits (pretty well) a cute glass salsa jar that I also re-purpose (keep nuts in them in the frig).  Oh, also I keep all my seed and nut butters in the frig on the door, and I think the sunbutter's consistency is improved (thicker) by doing so.  The company also suggests doing so to maintain freshness.  So there ya' have it, enjoy! :-)

review/text: Organic. No peanuts (which have mold and are not very good for you). Since I took peanut butter away from my family a few years ago they have begrugingly used other nut butters until we found this. Now they ask for it. Wish the organic version came in chunky style. No oil separation like almond butter, although refrigeration of all nut products is recommended (anything with high oil content can easily go rancid, so keep all nut products cool/cold.

review/text: I use SunButter as part of a program to lower blood pressure, and it works, but I'd eat SunButter anyway simply for the taste of it! If you love sunflower seeds, this is a product for you. Many people need the nutrients of sunflower seeds but can't digest seeds (folks with Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, for example). They can, however, enjoy the taste and nutrients of sunflower seeds with this product. I but this in multiples because so many friends and family members become hooked after trying a jar at my house! It tastes best (in my humble opinion) on toast.<br /><br />It is richer in healthy oils than other spreadable products, but I stir it up as soon as I open a jar, then refrigerate it. The oil doesn't separate again (although I do give it a quick stir with a knife before spreading it on toast).<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: SunButter Organic Sunflower Seed Spread
review/text: I have been eating Almond Butter, but I wanted to try something different and save a little money.  Almond Butter is delicious, but expensive when compared to Peanut Butter.  When I first read about the SunButter Organic Sunflower Seed Spread, I read it tasted like Peanut Butter.  When I got it, it didn't taste like Peanut Butter at all.  Matter of fact, it tasted a little bitter.  Then I put it in the refrigerator and tried it the next day again.  It definitely tasted better when cold than it does when it is warm.<br /><br />I have tried it with some apples, mixed in with some oatmeal, and just a tablespoon of it as a snack.  I'm really enjoying the taste and the price and have an order coming every month.  Still doesn't taste as good as Almond Butter, but at nearly half the price, I'll take it.

review/text: Same quality as Swanson's brand.  Both are great products and taste the same.  I sometimes buy raw organic sunflower seeds and roast them myself, then grind them into butter.  Organic sunflower butter is twice as expensive as organic peanut butter.  But, that's to be expected, or is it?  Sunflower seeds are as common as peanuts, so why is the cost twice as much?

review/text: This sunflower seed butter has a nice roasted taste & is very creamy.  The consistency is actually runny compared to peanut butter.  I just pour it out of the jar, but it is still thick.  I've never eaten it like a "peanut" butter & jelly sandwich, I usually mix it into yogurt with fruit.  It also makes a good fruit dip if mixed with equal parts of coconut oil, a little cocoa, & a little honey.  If you freeze the dip in mini muffin papers, it becomes "candy".  All in all, very tasty & no additives.

We both like salt and this seemed like a reasonable deal.  There isn't much difference in the taste... cleaner and you have to use less I'd say.  The salt isn't quite as fine as we expected... a bit many grained size, but they all come out of the salt shaker well.  We found out that our local upscale grocery store carries it in bulk, but it's "rock salt" size.  We've bought a Bodum grinder that grinds both pepper and salt for when the salt we have now runs out.  The Bodum is great and they sell it on Amazon...<br />P.S.  Fairie's Finest had the best prices for both the pink salt and Red Hawaiian sea salt...

review/summary: I liked it in the tea shop but ...
review/text: Okay, this is going to sound really strange because I loved this tea.<br /><br />I met some friends for tea at a quaint little place nearby.  I can't do caffeine so I decided to try the Two Leaves and a Bud African Sunset Red Tea because I like rooibos tea and figured I couldn't go wrong.  I really enjoyed it so asked the woman if I could see the box--I wanted to know what was in it other than rooibos. She brought the box to me and I saw that there was lemongrass in it.  That's what made it even better (for my tastebuds).<br /><br />I decided to buy the box of tea (I think there were 10 bags in the box).  When I went up to the counter, the woman told me it was $15!!!  I was shocked but had already given her my money and decided to proceed with the purchase.  When I got home I immediately went onto Amazon to see if I could get it cheaper.  Of course!!  So I bought the 100 Count box.  You're probably wondering why I'm giving this a low rating after the rave comments so far.  Here's where it gets tricky.<br /><br />The tea from the small 10-bag box was just as good as the one I had in the tea shop. However, the ones in the large quantity box just never tasted the same.  They lacked flavor, even if I steeped the bags longer.  I wonder if they're old?  I have no idea.  But I won't buy the 100 bag box again.  Sure they were way cheaper, but I'm not enjoying the tea as much.  Just drinking it to use it up and giving several bags away to friends.
