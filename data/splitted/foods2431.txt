review/summary: Purrfect!
review/text: A few years ago I bought a few packs of this at Walmart to give as a special morning treat for our 4 cats.  I would give them each a small spoonful and they were happy.  It quickly became a regular morning ritual with the cats sitting patiently in the kitchen each morning when I entered.  As time went on it became harder and harder to find The Tuna Entree at Walmart.  Sometimes I would drive to two different stores looking for it.  I tried some of the other 'flavors' and my cats let it be known they didn't like anything except this particular one.  They don't like any chunks of fish or whatever in their wet food.  In December when I was back in the U.S., after not being able to find this in the local stores, I turned to Amazon and I was so happy to not only find it available on here but we can get it shipped automatically  every 4 weeks.  Now, the cats always have their special morning meal and my daughter doesn't have to drive around looking for it.  I even haul 24 pouches in my carry on bag each trip back to Venezuela with me so my cat here can have her special morning treat.

review/summary: Whiskas
review/text: My cats love the food. The food is formed in the shape of the pouch so I do chop it up with fork to make it easier for them. The food looks and smells like fish. They like the snapper the best. Not to much moisture that had one cat throw up. No more wasted food. They eat it all. I wish it came all snapper but they probably like variety.  Price beats local stores. I buy the auto. delivery method and it saves even more. With auto ship the following deliveries come USPS.  They do notify of up coming shipmnt and you can postpone if need be. You can also get an early one.

review/summary: White meat chicken with dark bits
review/text: This product is made in Thailand with what appears to be really nice white meat chicken and some sort of dark bits.  The dark bits I guess are made out of chicken, but appear to be manufactured - like hot dogs - you know fillers and dyes.  Plenty of juice and chewy looking.  I purchased the cheaper pouches - Choice Cuts -, but those do not compare in quality to this one.

review/summary: My cats love this food
review/text: We have two cats, one of which is 16 years old and had lost quite a bit of weight.  She looked like she was ready to die any minute.  I purchased this food for her in a local store and she loved it.  She has trouble chewing and this food is easy for her to chew, plus it has juice that she licks up every drop of.  This food has made her start eating again and she has put back on some of her weight and is looking really healthy.  Although we have dry food out all the time, the cats run to the kitchen every time we are in there hoping they will get a serving of Whiskas.  I now buy it on Amazon's subscribe and save program - we never run out and it saves me money.

review/summary: Kittties Liked at first, Then Turned Up Nose
review/text: When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is "THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says "Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on "Subscibe and Save" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off "Subscribe and Save" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something "different" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year! (Even if the economy tanks and things go to pieces, we can all rest assured that Amazon will continue to thrive and let us pass our thoughts on to complete strangers for many years to come)! Thank you for your attention to my review.

review/summary: My cat loves it
review/text: My cat loves this stuff! The nutrition is fair and it has alot of juice in the packet. It is a mixture of chunks of meat along with some shreads. It looks like real shreds of chicken. The sale price here at Amazon was awesome - less than half the price at my local stores for a whole case.<br /><br />I never have any trouble getting all of the food out of the pouch - it all slides right out. This particular flavor though for whatever reason does have a bit more product in the pouch and to make things easier when opening, I usually just cut the top off (to avoid any messes while tearing open) or, I tear from one side half way and then from the other side the rest of the way and the entire top comes off then. If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties. They have nice big chunks in them instead of a bunch of mush or all shreds. My cat likes the chunkier ones better.

I haven't been able to find much nutritional value of this particular wet food, but there are real bits of fish and chicken in the pouch.  Sometimes, the chicken pouches almost make me want to taste them.  The rich gravy and flaky bits of white meat smell like Thanksgiving.  I haven't tasted it yet, but if I do I'll update my review.

review/text: But i wont be buying any more variety packs from Amazon anymore, as they raised the price by $10. Too bad. I can get it local for much cheaper now.<br /><br />Tip for the people who have problems with the packages. Grab the package firmly above tear line, shake the package back and forth a few times until all the food and juices get pushed down to the bottom. Then open, hardly ever have the "squirt" or "dribble" anymore, after giving it the shakes.

review/summary: My picky cats love Purrfectly Fish
review/text: Having owned cats for about 4 years now, I know that they all have their likes and dislikes, just like any animal. With that being said, I came across this product about 6 months ago and my three cats love it. None of my cats like the soft food that is usually cut or shaped into squares. When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over. I was glad to find that Amazon carries the tuna entree, so I know that my cats will eat it. Add in Subscribe & Save, and you have a winner.

review/summary: Great product for older cat
review/text: We found this product when we were looking for something to supplement my elderly cat's diet.  She had gotten pretty thin, had lost interest in eating, and had problems with keeping food down.  She went crazy for the chicken, and we started feeding her three times a day.  We had problems finding it locally until we located it on Amazon.  We liked the autoship option and signed up.  My little old lady has put on weight and is clearly feeling a lot better now that she has something that she likes to eat.

review/summary: My cats LOVE all 3 of the chicken flavors
review/text: I have four cats who all love any flavor in the purrfectly chicken multipack.  I always leave dry food out for them and only feed them the wet food twice a day, before I go to work and as soon as I get home.  Whenever they smell the food them come running to me, purr, and rug against my leg.  It is super cute.<br /><br />Although I agree with previous reviews it is a little annoying to open.  I cut the pouch open, empty the food onto a shallow bowl, and then spoon the rest of it out (definitly worth it, there is always ALOT left within the pouch), I then add a pouch full of water.<br /><br />Adding the water seemed to really help alot.  Adding the water made the wet cat food smell much less noticeable and helped to get the last pieces of chicken out of the pouch ( I add a tiny bit of water and shake it really good). My vet stressed that my cats needed to drink more water he was the one who suggested adding the water.

review/summary: Four Paws up
review/text: I have owned cats all my life, and over the years we have tried a variety of canned, dry and frozen foods with mixed results. So I feel fairly confident to provide a review of the Whiskas Purrfectly Fish line.  Here are my observations:<br />1.) ALL the cats I've given this to seemed to like it. Even my picky eater quickly devours the food, and now that we've switched back to this he will remind me if I am running late with dinner.<br />2.) From my point of view the image on the package is slightly misleading. Yes, there is obviously fish in there, but do not it expect it to be all slices. I say this because some of the newer cat food products out there, such as Fancy Feast Appetizers, do look like chicken or fish chunks. Rather it is a combination of mush food, fish slices and jelly.<br />3.) On the nice side, while it is fish based the smell is not over powering (I hate fish), so dishing it up is not overly offensive.<br />4.) It has also been my experience, that unlike most wet cat food that contains fish, I have yet to find the small bones.<br />5.) While my cats seem to like the Fancy Feast Appetizers much better, I like the price of these much better.  I can buy two of these for the price of one of those.<br />6.) Storage.  If you buy it in the packs or boxes, they are easy to store and it is compact.  If you buy them by the package in the store, you will need something to keep them from sliding around (they don't stack well like can do.)<br />7.) Easy to open for most.  For most people they will easily tear open.  However, I suspect some people with arthritis might have some difficulties gripping the package enough to tear.  The bonus about them being pouches is that there is no aluminum lid to cut yourself on.

review/summary: Cats LOVE the food, I hate the mess of packaging...cats win.
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/text: My 4 cats seem to prefer the "Whiskas Purrfectly" brand to any other wet food I've tried.  These fish flavors are not sliced; there are big blocks of pate in each sack that I have to break up with a knife so they can eat it.  My cats like this flavor set for a change, but really like the same brand in "Chicken" flavor, which is sliced.  If you have trouble with it splashing when you unzip each sack, try keeping a pair of scissors by your cat food area and cutting the bags; it's less messy and you can get more of the food into the cat bowl.

review/summary: great cat food
review/text: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish is a good quality food and our cat seems to really like it.  It is mostly fish with very little grain filler.  This is healthier for a cat as they are carnivores.  Some of the fish varieties have chunks of actual fish and others have a more mashed tuna-fish like appearance.  We found that the pouch is convenient - you can just tear it open and squeeze it out without using a fork.  It kinda pops out in a big  lump so it's not too messy.  Thankfully, even though it's fish, the smell is not too obnoxious.

review/summary: Not the best for your cat's long term health
review/text: I started buying these after another brand discontinued. I refuse to buy by-products for my cat so of course I was drawn to Puurfectly because it has real meat. The downside, 2 "magical" ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />Both useless to your cat and in my case eventually cause my cat to develop an allergy to corn and wheat. After a few months of her loving this food, she now refuses to touch it after throwing up repeatedly from it and having severe diarrhea.<br /><br />So now being more informed that corn and wheat aren't great for cats I've move on to natural cat foods. No more throwing up and a happy cat. Hooray! I suggest you do the same if you want to avoid vet bills and chronic health conditions in the long run.

Anyways, a few days later we realized that both our cats who ate this food began throwing up in agony. Initially we didn't take it too seriously but they did this repeatedly two days in a row right after they ate this food. Hence, we have now switched back to the food we used to give them before and they are doing much better now.<br /><br />We also found that this food is NOT made in the USA but imported from Thailand, which they have not mentioned on this website.

review/summary: Purrfectly Chicken NOT!  Purrfectly Mystery Meat is better
review/text: Once upon a time Whiskas Purrfectly items were not too bad, our 3 cats loved them.  But the product has gone down hill, WAY DOWN HILL!<br /><br />The cats like an evening snack, and Whiskas was at the top of the list.  I used to go 3 days on, 1 day off (no treats).  This kept them eager.<br /><br />But today I failed to purchase any more.  Why?<br /><br />Here's why:  First, look at the picture on the pack,,,, see all that lovely white meat?  I DARE you to find even one package out of the whole box that matches that picture.  You will not find one.  Now all you find are bits and pieces of red / brown mystery meat, with perhaps, if you are REALLY lucky, 2 or 3 small slivers of white meat.<br /><br />The last box I tried was a total failure, the cats would look, sniff,,, tentatively lick the sauce and maybe nibble a piece of white meat if they could find it, and walk away, allowing me the pleasure of throwing it away.<br /><br />No more.  They need to take a serious look at this product.  DO NOT BUY!!

review/summary: The Best Wet Cat Ever - Whiskas Perfectly Fish Tuna Entree
review/text: Tuna Entree is THE ONLY wet cat food my cats will eat. Obviously many cats feel the same way since the grocery stores are usually out of this selection.  There are many other flavors available; but like I said, Tuna Entree is THE ONLY wet cat food for my babies, Comanche and Lakota.  Thank you so much.

review/summary: Superb!
review/text: That's what my cat would say. This is the best food that I've found for my cat, and the extra cost shows it, but my cat's worth it! I was suprised to see the big chunks of real fish. I agree with other comments about the packaging, so it didn't take me long to figure out that if you use scissors to cut the top off instead of tearing it, you avoid all the mess. Just squeeze the contents away from the top first before you cut it. I actually prefer this package over a can, because since I give her half in the morning and half in the evening, I can just fold over the top and put the rest in the fridge. I have always bought the cheaper Whiska's pouches because, well, I'm a cheapskate. But at this point in both of our lives, I figure it's time to enjoy ourselves, and treat us both to the good stuff! Steak for me, Purffectly Fish/Chicken for her!

review/text: The Purrfectly Chicken is the only pouch variety all the cats love. That's 5 inside spoiled rotten princes and princesses aged 6 to 13 and anywhere from 2 to 5 outside feral cats.I can deal with the inconvenience of pouches spilling chicken juice but wish I were sure they were eating a quality product. The fact that they're from Thailand bothers me. The dark pieces are always left in the bottom of the bowls.

review/summary: My fancy feast only cat loves it at first but now he only likes the juice in it!
review/text: My 5yr old cat eats only Fancy Feast Grilled products. He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled. It seems like he enjoys juicy textured food in his mouth. He is primarily on wet food because of his stomititis. I am on subscribe & save for the FFG, but have been looking for a good wet cat food to provide some variety. The real meat in a pouch idea appeals to me. Got the 10-pack box today at local Petsmart for $5.99. My cat usually favors the chicken flavor so I opened the chicken packet first. Lots of juice and soft meat and smells more like human food(to human nose). My cat finished it in record time. Success!! We are going to try out other flavors like Seafood next. It did draw my attention that this product was made in Thailand. I am not sure if that should be a concern (?). And if your cat is like mine, who sometimes cannot finish the 3oz portion in a meal, just store it upright in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge for the next meal.<br />-----<br />Follow up: After two boxes, my cat is not so enthusiastic about it anymore. He would lick all the juice up and leave the content (especially the red color meat) in his dish...:-( He also doesn't like the chicken & duck flavor. If they sell only the chicken soup for cats, my cat would love it. The seafood (especially) tuna was a success for the first and second time and then he just doesn't like it any more. But he still likes his fancy feast grilled. So I guess I have to keep searching for alternatives...

review/text: My cats love this.  The meat does not look like chicken or beef to me. However the Whiskas "Cat Chefs" know what the kitty cats like.  My picky bunch love to pig down on it. I was even able to sneak in their monthly flea meds with it with no problem.  A first ! The only down side is the juice runs out on the top of the package when you open it. So I just snip the top a tiny bit first then, hold a second and pull open. No mess to clean up then.<br />Will purchase again.

review/summary: Whiskas Tuna Entree for Cats
review/text: After Wal-mart discontinued the tuna packets product from Whiskas I turned to Amazon and found that I could purchase this product by the case (24).  This has been the best wet food our cat has ever had, and this is how we deliver his medicine, pulverized into the tuna!  He is a picky eater and has rejected every other wet product we have found.  So, I am very happy with this product and by subscribing for an automatic monthly delivery, using Amazon Prime, I am saving money and paying less than I did at Wal-mart.  Amazon Prime takes care of the postage and the automatic subscription saved me even more.  I know I sound like a shill, but I am a happy cat owner.

review/summary: my cat prefers this over the other Whiskas brands
review/text: My cat is a fussy eater.  I have to cycle between two or three different varieties of cat food in order to keep her happy - and eating!  She'd much rather yowl all day long, than eat the same meal twice in a row.<br /><br />So, when I discovered that she actually likes all three flavors of this Whiskas Purrfectly Fish variety pack, I was very pleased.  (Incidentally, she doesn't like two of the flavors in the other Purrfectly fish variety pack, but oh well...)  Also, this is a pretty good price for 4 packs of 10 pouches.<br /><br />I would have been happy to give this food five stars, except for a few minor issues.  For starters, pouches are always difficult to open and the food inside tends to often be messy to serve.  I've often gotten my hands splattered in juice, whilst I'm trying to feed a hungry cat.<br /><br />The major issue I have with the food is that it comes in one big piece.  When you open the pouch, it kinda slithers out - which is a bit less messy than feeding chunks (and at least all of the meat does come out of the pouch) but my cat won't eat this stuff until I chop it up for her.  Usually, that's not easy when she likes to shove her head in the bowl and start licking up the juice.<br /><br />She'll probably tire of this brand given a few more months, but for now, she definitely really likes it and I appreciate that I have three varieties of flavor to offer her.

When I mixed the Whiskas Chicken and Duck with his Whiskas dry about 10 minutes later he licked his plate clean.

She did a lot of throwing up and had the runs so I immediately switched to a natural canned cat food, all back to normal - no more sickness.<br /><br />My even greater concern with these flavors is the tuna/salmon - not only are you feeding them things they can't really process{wheat/corn} but your also feeding them a daily dose of mercury. Worth it?? You tell me when you get the vet bills that could have rather been spent on good food.

They watch me prepare each of their dishes with great interest. They follow me as I place their dishes out for them, and then dive in with great gusto. They did not do this when I served competing National Brands. My Cats also love Wiskas dry Cat Food which I make available to them 24 hours a day in a special serving bowl for that.

We were getting down to the wire and the kittens had to eat solid food before they were given away.

However,  when I brought this flavor of Whiskas out all 8 of them gathered around the food dish and gobbled it up as if they were starving.  I realize kitten food is said to have the nutrients kittens require  but there must be something to this formula for the kittens to take to it that well!

review/text: Okay, so I admit I spoil my cat.  These Whiskas Purrfectly Tuna pouches are hit with my furry kiddos. The pouches are easily to open, just simply grasp at the notch and twist.  The food is relatively easy to get out of the package.  I found it easier to massage the bags first before opening to mix the filling up, otherwise you'll end up with one blob of congealed cat food.  Sometimes I'll still need to use a fork to separate and clean out the pouch.<br /><br />These pouches per ounce maybe more expensive than some of the other canned food, but the convenience of not using a can opener and easy at putting the food in the bowl are worth the extra nickel or two you might save.<br /><br />Truth wise, my cats love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283K02K">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Chicken & Beef, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 12)</a> and if given a taste test would probably prefer, but at about $1.46 per tub, they don't get to eat it very often.

review/summary: Cats love it; I hate the pouches.
review/text: Whiskas came up with a winner as far as my cats are concerned; they love all three of the "Purrfectly Chicken" varieties.<br /><br />The pouch it comes in, however, has to be a cost-saving thing because it is totally terrible. It is messy, and the only way to get all the food out is to dig it out with a spoon, and dig some more, and dig some more.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars for the food, and 1 star for the package. I know that averages out to 3 stars, but there is no other food that my cats will eat day after day, so one more star for that.

review/summary: My cats favorite food
review/text: I use to get this product at my local Petsmart until they no longer carried it other than in a variety pack.  The Mackeral is their favoite and my cats were soooo upset when I couldn't get it. So I turned to Amazon to find it and now order it online in large quantities just to have it.  They're happy once again.

review/summary: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken Improved My Cats' Health
review/text: I used to never feed my cats wet food because they preferred dry and I thought it was fine as long as they drank plenty of water.  After losing one cat to death mysteriously and another one to kidney disease I decided to follow the advice of many on the web and switch to wet food.  I tried many brands including the most expensive, but my three cats prefer Whiskas Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken to all others.  I mix them together in the bowl.  All three of my cats run to the bowls to gobble up the food and they don't leave a morsel.  Also, my cats do not throw up this food like they do dry food.  I can't believe the change in their health.  In just a short time my two older boys went from being round fatties to having shape and nice healthy curves.  And their coats are absolutely gorgeous.  The oils in the food obviously create a nice sheen.  Also, the shedding is way down.  Thanks Whiskas and keep it comin'.

I was even more pleased when I found that I could adjust the schedule when I needed to order it sooner than expected.  This is a great service for us and we have since set up another schedule for two of their other chicken products.

review/summary: The Pepeprmint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/summary: Good flavor, but doesn't last, better options out there
review/text: Good:  The flavor of the gum is fantastic.  Comes in a large vitamin-like container with a flip-top, it's fortified with B12 (I'm lacking), and assuming the label is correct; it's the perfect gum for vegans, lactose-intolerant, and celiac sufferers.<br /><br />Bad:  It maintains its good flavor for at most 10 minutes.  That's not a joke or exaggeration; it's a max of 10 minutes of flavor before it hits that "I feel like I've been chewing this for 2 hours" taste and the gum itself becomes very tough and unpleasant to chew.  Also, for the amount of total chewing time you get out of it, it seems fairly over-priced (it's about 3 times the cost per piece compared to buying regular gum at Costco, but that's probably an unfair comparison being that it's vegan, indie-food, non-aspartame, etc.).<br /><br />Bottom-line:  There are better choices out there (like Xyla, which still isn't that great...), but if you're looking for a delicious flavor of gum that you need a new piece of every 10 minutes, then this might be your brand.  For me, I'm looking elsewhere.

review/summary: Amazing for shelf-stable filled ravioli.  These are delish!
review/text: I've had this ravioli and they are completely delicious. For an authentic Tuscan preparation, brown some sutter, tear up some fresh sage leaves, and toast some rough chopped hazelnuts. This ravioli is perfect and the filling is lovely despite its shelf-stable form.  I also like the tiny size because the the leftovers keep their shape  better. (Large ravioli tend to get flattened by their own weight when saved in the fridge, often leaking their filling.) I throw a Tuscan themed dinner party every year and used to order fresh squash ravioli shipped from a pasta factory in LA that supplies high restaurants.  No more.  These do perfectly for 1/3 the cost. (For the reviewer who hated it, if your taste is such that you were wanting cheesy-creamy alfredo sauce on top of butternut squash ravioli, this product was lost on you to begin with. If you liken the earthy vegetal sweetness of squash to "cardboard," again, this was lost on you. And if adding tomato sauce somehow improved these, again, not for you.)

I paid $7.29 for a box in the local store, so I was pleased to see them on amazon for less. Boil them in some chicken stock, toss in some veggies and you have a fantastic, hearty soup. Even my 6 month old enjoyed them.

review/summary: Delicious taste, but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose
review/text: I eat this jam occasionally with peanut butter on crackers, and it is quite tasty. While it is less unhealthy than other sugary jams, I don't deceive myself that it won't raise blood sugar, because it is essentially 100% fructose, which is just as capable of raising blood sugar as sucrose (white/table sugar)--more on this below.<br /><br />Most people buy this product as a presumed health food due to it being lower in sugar than other jams. It's ingredients are: "Juice concentrate (pear, grape), strawberries, maltodextrin (dietary fiber), fruit pectin, citric acid, natural flavor." This product contains no artificial sweeteners, which are associated with various health hazards.<br /><br />This product's primary claim to fame is that it is, as the label states, "sweetened only with fruit juice." Any jam will have its sweetener listed first, meaning that is its primary ingredient. If you are on a low-carb diet or diabetic, you might want to know that this jam basically substitutes fructose for sucrose. Since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose, the producers only need to use half as much as they would have of sucrose, so it has about half the calories of regular jam. (On the other hand, many cheap jams contain high-fructose corn syrup--but that's another health issue entirely.) The problem for many people is that they are used to the taste of sucrose, and 100% fructose tastes very different from a combination of fructose and sucrose which is the case with regular jam made with white sugar. To my own taste, since I'm eating a fruit spread, it tastes quite sweet enough to me.<br /><br />The fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber, so I am not sure why the company decided to add in maltodextrin and call that "fiber" too. Anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam. The producers claim on the label it is "gluten-free," but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn, and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten.<br /><br />Another ingredient that is problematic as to how healthy this product can be is the "natural flavor." It is possible that the producers add a strawberry extract so they can get away with using less real strawberries, which are more expensive than a flavoring. The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: "The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.

review/text: I shop at my nearby Fresh and Easy Grocery Market every once and a while and, while I'm there, I pick up a bit of their out-of-this-world candy. They keep in a special section of the store away from all of the more conventional candies. This candy is imported from England and, man, is it good! This trip's treat is a bar of Nestle Aero Milk Chocolate with a somewhat bubbly interior filling. It's the same bar as listed here and you'll probably note that even though they imply that it's from Canada, if you read the fine print is says it's from England. This stuff literally melts in your mouth (and all over your hands, I might add). My wife is from Russia and has lived in London and she claims that European chocolates are better than American. I would wholly agree. I've never tasted an American chocolate bar that was this good. Five Stars!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

This is my only real complain; however, due to the extremely low price I'm willing to forgive this aesthetic issue. The flavor is great, and you can get two to three good infusions from a set of leaves; use warm (~165 F) water for the first infusion, and allow the temperature to rise by a few degrees each additional steeping. I'd recommend using an airtight container for storage though; the bag the tea ships in is good, but two pounds of tea will last most several months.

review/text: In case you have never brewed gunpowder or wonder why the name: This tea is very dry and the leaves are small and rolled tight. When the hot water hits the leaves, they "explode" - they swell to many times their original size. Thus, the name gunpowder refers more to the dry preparation technique of the leaves and the way they expand than it does to thy type of leaves or their taste. Warning, if you brew this tea (or any other gunpowder) use about 1/2 or 1/4 the amount that you would use with another tea. The tea is pretty bitter, a taste I like but it isn't for everyone. Since I like the taste and the explosion means less tea is used (less expensive per pot), I rated it 5 stars.

review/summary: Does not disappoint
review/text: I am new to loose leaf tea, but I've been wanting to try it for a while, and I was lucky to find Coffee Bean Direct, as their teas had better reviews than the next cheapest bulk tea, at almost half the price. I am used to bag tea, but this tea is miles above anything I've had before, so I can't imagine what some tea snobs are drinking when saying this is only half-decent; for being almost a quarter of the price of most quality loose teas, this is fantastic.<br /><br />This gunpowder green tea is great; I didn't like plain green tea bags very much, but this has definitely turned me on to the world of loose leaf green tea. It has a wonderful and unique smoky, but sweet, flavor that lasts for several infusions. Because the rolled kernels are so dense, two pounds of gunpowder tea came in a bag about 1/4 the size of two pounds of peony white tea, so enjoy it and make it last!

review/summary: Great tea for the price
review/text: After reading other reviews, I decided to give this tea ([...]) a try.  For the price, it is a good tea, as long as you take care and brew it properly.  Let it steep too long and it gets very bitter, but that is true with all teas.  I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Really Excellent Iced
review/text: Our family drinks a lot of iced tea, and I wanted to get something to alternate with our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F40966">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Tea Gold Tea</a>. This tea works very well for iced tea, provided one is very careful NOT to use too much tea. If one uses too many tea leaves, it makes a very bitter brew - which would probably be very fine with a lot of sugar. But for iced, use only a little. I make two quarts of tea with only about the equivalent of two tea bags. The resulting brew is refreshing and satisfying, not at all bitter, and a nice change from normal black tea.<br /><br />I recommend this for those who like their tea iced and want a little change, or if you are creating one of those super-strong "gunpowder" hot tea drinks.

review/summary: Great flavor and texture
review/text: We have found that Coffee Bean Direct has a great product quality and selection. We use several types of their teas and use it enough to make the larger bags very worth while. The bags are high quality as well and reseal effectively using either the attached strip or our food saver machine.

review/summary: High quality gunpowder green tea at a great price.
review/text: This tea has a delicious toasted flavor that I've come to appreciate about quality gunpowder teas. I can make 4-5 cups of tea out of a single pinch. You get a lot for your money. I haven't been able to find a better deal on Amazon for bulk loose tea. Davidson's used to be good, but since people discovered it, the quality has gone downhill. Buy this instead of that.

review/summary: Really good
review/text: I started ordering this green tea after I got an extremely bad shipment of the Davidson's Gunpowder Green. I really like this, and it is a good price with the subscription. Sticking with this one and I will not go back to Davidson's. So much better. Uses less tea also, which further reduces cost.

review/text: This is a great Green Tea for the price I have used this Gunpowder Tea for 3 years now and the quality has always stayed the same, the best results I get is when I used a French Press Machine, this is mostly used for coffee, but great for tea as well, what is really cool is that Amazon offers automatic re orders, meaning they will ship me a bag of the Green Tea once a month at a discounted price, this is wonderfull, what a GREAT SERVICE!!, so I wont forget too,have a good one

review/summary: Cereal is Tasty, But....
review/text: The cranberries kind of ruin it.<br /><br />Don't buy this cereal if you're not ready to give your teeth a real workout.<br /><br />Honestly, I could have done without the cranberries as the cereal itself tastes great with a mild sweetness and just the _slightest_ hint of a sweet ginger flavor.  Delicious. Stays crunchy in milk, like other Nature's Path cereals -- don't know how they do it -- and otherwise has a good mix of textures.<br /><br />It's just that you always have to be on guard for those cranberries lest you bite down onto a spoonful of them without paying attention.  As others have commented, the milk does not re-hydrate it (though I did consider microwaving it to see if that would help).<br /><br />Fix the cranberry issue -- or just take them out completely -- and it's a 5 star cereal!

review/summary: My favorite cereal -- now called Optimum Cranberry Ginger
review/text: Nature's Path just changed the name. But the cereal is identical. I "subscribe" to this product from Amazon, and they simply substituted the "new" variety.<br /><br />Not too sweet. Not cardboardy like lots of the healthier cereals. I love ginger, but I don't like any granolas with "ginger" in the name; I wouldn't have guessed there was ginger in this. It tastes great to my palate and I eat it almost every day.<br /><br />If this helps identify what I like, the other packaged cereal I like is Post's Great Grains Pecan (but I don't like the similar variety called something like Great Grains Pecan Dates Raisins(?), which I find too sweet).<br /><br />I've had all or most the Nature's Paths cereals, and I like this one much more.

review/summary: Startlingly high in sugar.
review/text: The cranberry tang and hint of ginger are all to the good, and the fiber content is a whopping 40% per serving. But if you eat cereal as a breakfast meal rather than a snack, that 0.75 cup serving size the box prescribes isn't realistic.  So say you eat one cup: not counting milk, you'll have taken in more than 18 grams of sugar.  I like the taste well enough, but agree with the previous reviewer: it doesn't need to be this sweet.  As someone who abides by a healthy diet, expending a whole half of my daily recommended added-sugar intake on this cereal just doesn't feel worth it.

review/text: I initially purchased the product for mostly its value along with the fiber and fruit.  I was surprised that the cereal remained crunchy even after adding milk (I prefer almond milk) and setting it aside a few minutes.  The ginger and cranberry are added benefits of the taste.

review/text: I like the taste of their Cranberry and Ginger cereal. I bought it from Amazon because Whole Fields stopped carrying that flavor. I take issue with their so called Envirobox, which they have reduced in size by 10% to save on the environment. The box is still only half full.

review/summary: Great healthy cereal with a great taste
review/text: Nature's Path makes some great cereals and the Cranberry Ginger is my second favorite of theirs with the Red Berry Crunch being my favorite.  Being organic and using very good ingredients this cereal is one that you would be happy to give your children much less eat yourself.  The carb content is quite high (pretty normal with most cereals) but a large portion of that is tied to the high fiber content, which is a huge plus since American diets tend to be fiber deficient.  On the downside, the cranberries tend to stick to your teeth and tend to stick together in the box.  This leads to uneven distribution throughout the box and sometimes you get large globs of cranberries together.  That's mainly what knocked a star off.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a great cereal that you are bound to love.

review/summary: Didn't enjoy as much as I'd hoped
review/text: I prefer the Optimum Power breakfast with blueberries, but the flavor of this version is good, and the texture fine.  My biggest complaint though is the cranberries - they add a nice flavor to the mix, but they're way too hard, feeling like they'll pull my fillings if I chomp at them too much.  Even sitting in milk for a while doesn't soften them much.  It could just be this batch, though.  In any case, pulling the cranberries makes this a less appetizing cereal - not the best they've made.

review/summary: good breakfast (and snack)
review/text: This is a delicious cereal.  One of the better ones from this company.  It's a good, light breakfast or snack.  The ginger is there, but not overwhelming.  The cranberries are a nice touch of something sweet.<br /><br />If you like the other cereals by this company, this is a good one and worth trying.
