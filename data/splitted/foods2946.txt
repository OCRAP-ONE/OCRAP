review/summary: boring
review/text: I know this was supposed to be some great funny movie, but I just didn't get it. It started off OK, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis were fine, but it just got boring. I couldn't see the point of the movie, even in retrospect. Why make this movie? Plus, the Michael Keaton character was so annoying, I just wanted to go away. I know he was supposed to be annoying, so fine, he did a good job with that, but I don't want to have to listen to it. We watched as a family and my 8-year-old son hated it too. My husband liked it. Maybe it's a guy thing, a grown-up guy thing.

review/summary: Just gets better with age!
review/text: This is a review for Beetlejuice Blu-Ray.  The video transfer from Warner Bros. is pretty good given the films 25 yr pedigree.  On my disc you must manually select the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless auidio track; it defaults to the Lossy DD 5.1.<br /><br />The Orig. 1.85:1 is slightly stretched to properly fill a 16:9 screen.  Danny Elfman's musical score is showing its age as it is not as crisp as a typical new movie.  Although it is noticebly better than the DVD audio track.<br /><br />It was a must have to fill my ever growing Blu-ray collection!

review/summary: BEETLEJUICE..A TIM BURTON CLASSIC!
review/text: [[ASIN:B001AGXEAG Beetlejuice (20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)]<br /><br />Beetlejuice, the Tim Burton classic from 1988 now comes to you packaged as a 20th Anniversary DVD edition.  Michael Keaton, I think in one of his best film performances brings down the house.  Also starring Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, two actors you would have never thought to put together in a movie of this genre, it is classic comedy at its best.  The DVD also has special features, although nothing to make your head spin, but it offers several episodes of the cartoon series from the late 1980's.  But beyond that, nothing too spectacular; not that it needs that much more. A simple classic comedy that if it doesn't make you laugh, something is wrong with you and you should be exorcised!  With that being said, buy it if you don't own it. It's a must have dark comedy.

review/text: Beetlejuice one of Tim Burton's best movies he has done during the 1990's.  I enjoy this movie loads and watch it time and time again.  I never get tired of the movie no matter how many times I watch the movie Beetlejuice.  The actors did such an amazing job and musical score perfect timing on the exact scenes.  But if you love a good comedy movie and talented actors and a very talented director then pick this movie up and enjoy laugh after laugh time and time again.

My favorite is actualy Geena Davis...she is an amazing actress that just controls the screen with her natural abilities and little effort involved.  The Movie is GREAT in Blu-ray...as usual!

review/summary: A Really Bizarre Spectacle. Classic Tim Burton.
review/text: For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of "Beetlejuice" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, "Beetlejuice" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: After the Maitlands (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) are prematurely killed in an automobile accident, they are returned to their home as ghosts. Meanwhile, the old country house is sold to trendy New Yorkers that entertain unwelcome changes to its charm.<br /><br />The Maitlands want them out, but have difficulty scaring the New Yorkers. So, their 'afterlife' case worker suggests hiring a bio-exorcist, Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton), to do the job.<br /><br />The New Yorker's daughter (played by Winona Ryder) serves as mediator and plays a strong supporting role.<br /><br />These words best describe the direction of Tim Burton:<br />"Know what they say about people that commit suicide? In the after life, they become civil servants."<br /><br />This flick is entertaining and worth the price.

review/summary: Fun Then, Fun Now; Blu-Ray An Upgrade
review/text: This movie always was: 1 - very popular; 2 - very different; 3 - very entertaining; 4 - a very fast-moving hour-and-a-half of a film.  It now IS available on Bllu-Ray and it looks better; nothing outstanding, but a definite improvement in shapnress.<br /><br />Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character "Beetlejuice"- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..<br /><br />It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who many times has  played nice people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a "haunted house" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.<br /><br />Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.<br /><br />Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.<br /><br />Overall, a unique and entertaining film. It's different, to say the least!

The afterlife concept of the film is excellent as well as entertaining; this film is a must for your video library... It's to be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The casting for this film is perfect, Michael Keaton is the outrageously funny and whacky witted (Betelguese - the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist) with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis playing (Adam and Barbara Maitland), a young couple that die prematurely. Adding to the cast are Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara (as Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter Winona Ryder (as Lydia).<br /><br />One of the most hilarious scenes is the dinner party accompanied by Harry Belafonte's Banana Boat song `Day-O'.  This is truly Tim Burton at his finest taking the significance of being dead and dousing it with humor.

Moreover, the music instead of being a background mood helper is actually as important as the other characters in the story.

review/summary: Tim Burton's imagination goes wild!
review/text: I'd have to say that this isn't really a top favorite from master filmmaker Tim Burton, but it's not at all horrible. It's a classic display of Burton's wild imagination and clever imagery. It's a great comedy, and it's not only Burton's directing that makes it a laughfest. Michael Keaton is perfect as Beetlejuice; I don't think no one else can equally play the character like he does. But it's too bad he only appears in the film in a total of ten minutes. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis shine as the deceased married couple, who want an eccentric family out of their perfect house. Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder give nice performances, and Robert Goulet's cameo appearance is a treat.<br /><br />Oh, and let's not forget Danny Elfman's music score. This is awe-inspiring pre-Batman stuff right here; the main theme is VERY catchy. Art direction and costume design are a plus. The only flaw I can find here is the dance sequence in the end of the film. It's pretty corny, and I find it very annoying. But overall, this is a fun film for the older crowd.

review/summary: "It Keeps Getting Funnier Everytime I See It!"
review/text: "It keeps getting funnier every time I see it,"  says Beetlejuice, the mischievous ''bioexercist'' of the title who is superbly played by Michael Keaton. And this quote pretty much sums up how I feel about the movie, especially the famous dinner party scene. The premise of the movie is great, the score is memorable, and the acting from the entire cast is just about perfect. I highly recommend this film, which is often tagged as a ''Halloween movie,'' but can really be enjoyed at ANY time of the year.

review/summary: Macabre Fun For the Whole Family
review/text: "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" was director Tim Burton's first film but "Beetlejuice" was the film that made people take notice as to what an original talent he is.  Think about it.  Who else could have made death so much fun?  The script by Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell may deal with the departed but it's fresh and original with ideas deliciously from left field.  I particularly liked the waiting room for the recently departed and the case worker played by Sylvia Sidney.  Bo Welch's art direction is highly imaginative as is the Oscar winning make-up effects.  Michael Keaton's ribald renegade bio-exorcist plays like a deceased stand-up comedian.  I couldn't tell which parts of Keaton's schtick was scripted or improvised.  This also the film that heralded Winona Ryder as a talent to be reckoned with and hopefully soon again.  An unqualified success.

review/summary: burton's best?
review/text: Tim Burton's fantastic vision of life after death.Michael Keaton plays one of the best characters in film to the hilt and should have not been forgotten.Winona Ryder plays the goth-type daughter of Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones all who are great in their roles.The story though is based upon a couple,played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis,who drown in a car accident and struggle with the after life and the new owners of their beloved home.The movie is dark,especially when Baldwin and Davis have to go to the head of the dead to find out how to get rid of the new owners.It's interesting how those that have died tragically have to spend the after life working.Harry Belafontes music is put to good use in 2 big scenes.Definitely one of Burton's best works that should not be missed.

review/summary: Another Twisted Masterpiece From Burton
review/text: Here's the plot of 1988's "Beetlejuice", significantly simplified:<br /><br />A young couple who've recently died find that another family is moving into their house. They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm's menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.<br /><br />As for some of the cast and crew:<br /><br />Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman's theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.<br /><br />And for my personal opinion:<br /><br />Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he's one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own).

review/summary: One of Tim Burton's earliest and best films
review/text: Edited this review on 10/28/08.<br /><br />Ever since I saw Beetlejuice as a kid I have found more and more to like about it with each viewing. Throw in some bizarre concepts and characters, add humor and cool old school special effects, top it all off with an outstanding wacky performance by Michael Keaton and you might begin to understand why it works. This movie is just so much fun to watch mainly because it combines so many genres and to this day it remains one of the most unique takes on a ghost story.<br /><br />I have the old 1997 (were DVDs around then?) DVD release and the picture and sound isn't that great. This Blu-ray is like a whole new experience in terms of video and audio quality. It's worth the upgrade if you like Beetlejuice as much as I do.

Tim Burton made a great movie with a simple story, a great imagination and cool actors(Winona Ryder is VERY young in this one:) and I couldn't imagine Alec Baldwin with such sense of humour. Michael Keaton is sensational and the FX, 15 years old are still very correct. Beetlejuice is a very funny character and you can't wait for the moment when finally he becomes free to act. Just say BEETLEJUICE three times and have a great laugh.

review/text: Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's 2nd film after Pee Wee's Big Adventure and it's his most popular next to Batman. A lot of films such as Monkey Bone have tried to copy it's strange originality and have failed. It wasn't the best reviewed movie when it came out but that's because critics most likely didn't know what to think about it.<p>  It has fun effects, a wacky and energetic performance by Michael Keaton and an original plot. After all these years there's still nothing quite like Beetle Juice. I mean what other movie has giant sand worms that eat dead people ?

review/text: This movie is a very odd movie but I love it because it doesn't follow that Hollywood way to make a movie.  This movie stars Winona Ryder who plays Lydia Deitz, who is very sad and depressed.  The movie is about a couple who dies and a new family moves into the house and the couple doesn't want them there because the mother wants to redecorate the house.  this movie has an all-star cast Geena Davis, Alec baldwin, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey jones, and many others.  This movie was released the 30th of March 1988.  The DVD I think could have been so much better and they could have included deleted scenes and bloopers because you know there has to be some.

review/text: Beetlejuice is not a movie that you can't watch under . . . 5,000 times! It is one of the funiest movies ever made, mixing a strange reality to the story, along with a romance between Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. The funny thing about this story is  the strange world between the living and the dead, and the recently deceased handbook, ha. You have to wait in your house for 125 years, while haunting the people that come in, and trying not to break your cover, and in the story, that is why hauntings take place. Tim Burton did an excellent job, and you have to see this movie.

review/text: When this movie first came out about fifteen years ago, my father owned a video store and every Wednesday night was "Beetlejuice" night. I'm older now, obviously, but I still cannot get enough of this movie. <p>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara Maitland, two Connecticut yuppies who die prematurely in a car wreck. Within a couple weeks, their home is overrun by an ultra-trendy New York City family, Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter, Lydia (played respectively by Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want their house back, and attempt to scare the Deetz's out of the house by wearing sheets and even by possessing them over dinner, making them sing and dance to Harry Belafonte's "Day O." Those attempts fail and enter Michael Keaton as Betelguese, "the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist." The movie is dark without being scary and funny without being ridiculous. <p>In my opinion, one of the real gems in this film is the late Sylvia Sidney as Juno, Your Case Worker. Sidney was pushing eighty when this film was made, but turns in a great performance as the embittered equivalent of an afterlife social worker. Love how the smoke from her ever-present cigarette comes out of the slit in her throat. <p>If you've never seen this movie, see it. If you have seen it but don't own it on DVD, get it. The picture quality is better than ever.

review/summary: Off-color, Irreverent  Hilarity
review/text: I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

I give the movie itself 5 stars; it's a wonderful example of Tim Burton's energy and style.<p>This DVD has no extras worth mentioning.  No deleted scenes, no featurettes, not even a lousy commentary track!  To make it even worse, the film has been CUT DOWN from the theatrical release!  I have never seen a DVD release before where you get LESS than was originally presented in theaters.<p>My advice is to save your money until somebody figures out that when a movie is released on DVD, it needs to live up to the capabilities of the medium, and should always provide more material than was originally released, not less.

review/text: Just to let you know, this movie is one of my personal favorite ghost movies. That said, I feel I need to tell you some details about this terrible DVD. The packaging is fine, nothing great, but it works. The picture and sound quality are good and make it a good cinematic experience. However, the menu is complete trash, the extras are EXTREMELY embarassing, and to play the movie you actually have to click on scene selections and click on the first chapter because there is no PLAY button! What's the problem here? As I recall, this film is on AFI's top 100 funniest movies ever made, so don't you think they could make a better DVD than this garbage? I am so sick and tired of these movie companies getting away with selling us trash.<p>This double sided disk is no good. Pick what format you want the first time you watch it, and stick with that side the whole time...because if you switch each time, both sides get scratched! Personally, I think fullscreen is for idiots who think they're getting the whole picture when they're not. You people put no actual thought into making DVDs, you just slap some crap together and think its fine. No, it's not fine! Clean up your acts!

I guess it was a marketing plan to make the movie more for families or something, but they  have eliminated all strong profanity and elements that are usually edited  in the television version.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  If you want the uncut  version, AVOID THE CLAMSHELL EDITION!

review/summary: Five Star Movie, No Star DVD
review/text: This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of.<br /><br />Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing. Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of "production notes" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.<br /><br />All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more. If you're a Beetlejuice fan, wait for the inevitable Criterion Collection or Special Edition remaster.

review/summary: Great Movie Which SCREAMS for a Special Edition DVD
review/text: I won't go into detail about the movie itself, which has been reviewed in much greater detail and much better than I can do at the moment (it is one of my all time favorite movies - 5 stars).  I'd like to focus on the DVD for a moment.<br /><br />This DVD was released in June, 1997, a scant three months after the initial rollout of the DVD format.  As such, the inadequate menus and lack of functionality reflect a company just learning its way around the capabilities of the format.  The early releases have standard menu designs (with the Warner Logo), standard extras (cast & crew, production notes, trailer (sometimes)), and are usually double-sided with a widescreen format on one side and a fullscreen format on the other.  This was all quite adequate for 1997, but....<br /><br />In 2006, Beetlejuice seems to have been forgotten by Warner.  In a time when so many movies have "Special", "Extra Special", "Extra-Extra Special Extended", and "Ultimate" editions, this is one movie which has missed the bandwagon.  What's it going to take, Warner?  A bio-exorcist??<br /><br />BEETLEJUICE<br /><br />BEETLEJUICE<br /><br />BEETLEJ....  SPECIAL EDITION, PLEASE!!

review/summary: Will probably never get tired of this movie
review/text: I've watched this movie so many times I know the dinner table dance routine. Somebody linked it on Facebook, and it made me want to watch the movie again so I did--haven't seen it in years, and I'm surprised I still know the routine. Michael Keaton does a great job as the oh-so-disgusting Beetlejuice, and the rest of the cast plays their roles just as well. The film's plot is just plain weird, but they pulled it off. Couple gets into car accident, dies, tries to figure out how to still live in their house while being dead, and a new family moves in. Should they haunt them? Should they be seen? How do both families coexist, especially with the daughter (Winona Ryder) able to see the ghosts who thought they were in the clear? And why is Beetlejuice always there to crash the party? The movie had a quick pace, funny dialogue and plenty of memorable visuals.

review/summary: Really gets those juices flowing...
review/text: Maybe the definitive Burton film (or maybe more like a tie with `Edward Scissorhands'), `Beetlejuice' is a perfect representation of what Tim Burton is all about.  It is loud and boisterous and at the same time dark and edgy.  The film very much looks and feels like almost everything that comes out of the Burton factory, yet it is surprisingly fresh in a way.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that it is one of his earlier works and so the colors and graphics are not as crisp, which adds an almost gothic layer to the films feel.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it is the mere fact that Michael Keaton gives the best performance in any Burton film; ever.<br /><br />The film follows Adam and Barbara as they learn to cope with life after death.  Yes, a horrific car accident leaves Adam and Barbara dead yet confined to their home.  The problem is that their impatient neighbor takes no time in selling their home to an eccentric family that does not meet with their approval.  Determined to remove these people from their home they enlist the help of a `bio-exorcist' to do the trick, but they get far more than they bargained for when Beetlejuice comes on the scene.<br /><br />The film has been labeled as `pointless fun' by most of my friends, and to an extent I have to agree.  Many would claim the film is not pointless, for it teaches lessons of acceptance and friendship, and I guess loyalty and respect, but really, are we concerned with any of that?<br /><br />The acting is really good here, and it elevates the film from `pointless' to `pointless fun'.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis (complete with those alien eyes she had popping in `The Fly') are absolutely amazing as the dead couple, Adam and Barbara.  Catherine O'Hara is marvelous, award worthy even, as the insanely annoying Delia, and Jeffery Jones knows just how to compliment her as Charles.  Winona Ryder is effectively weird as their daughter Lydia.<br /><br />This film belongs to Keaton though, in what may very well be his finest performance, ever.  There is a fine line to be ridden between hilariously on-point and drastically over-the-top; especially when you are dealing with a typically campy performance.  As Beetlejuice, Keaton finds that line and rides it well, delivering an all over the place comedic performance that never feels `too much', even though it probably is.  He understands how to make his characters insanity justifiably funny and makes him an iconic character.  Everyone knows who Beetlejuice is, even if you haven't seen the movie.<br /><br />In the end I can recommend this movie because it does the trick.  It's sweet and charming in that Tim Burton style, complete with edge and creeps and hilarious thrills.  It looks better than his new stuff because it still has a level of grit, and while it is not as good as `Edward Scissorhands' (his best movie, ever) it is definitely a film that every fan needs to see.

review/summary: A Gothic Tim Burton Classic!!!
review/text: I thought this was a really good movie! Since it's a film by Tim Burton, you get a dark, depressing feel, and Danny Elfman music, and stripes. Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, and Winona Ryder all did a perfect job! Michael Keaton is hilarious and awesome as Beetlejuice! Adam and Barbara Maitland die in a car crash, they are given a rule book to go by on how to be dead. The Deetz family moves in, but Adam and Barbara want them out. Somehow, they're hot gothic daughter, Lydia can see them. They become friends, but they still want to scare them out. They seek the help of Beetlejuice, who is extremely obnoxious, and a bio-exorcist who tries to help Adam and Barbara, but he's too scary and obnoxious to leave and stop. The Deetz's bring Adam and Barbara back from the dead, but Lydia doesn't want them to because it'll torture them. Desperately, she asks Beetlejuice to help. If you love gothic comedy, you'll love BEETLEJUICE!!!

review/summary: Heads off, I mean up, Beetlejuice fans!  New DVDs due out in September, details here
review/text: Beetlejuice is coming back to DVD in a newly remastered 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, in both standard definition and Blu-ray, on September 16th, 2008.  The extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series ("Skeletons in the Closet," "Spooky Boo-tique," "A-Ha!"), and for the Blu-ray version an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but don't count on it.  The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the specs for the sound haven't been announced.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat Song" ("Day-O"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />If you don't have the old, not-so-great DVD, the new release might be worth waiting for.  Amazon has a page to pre-order the new standard DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AGXEAG">here</a>.  The Blu-ray version has a pre-order page <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AGXEA6">here</a>.

This larger than life, colorful, yet dark, very funny, bizarre tale broke into the cinemas, and changed the face of storytelling as we knew it forever. Tim Burton was born, and a whole new dimension of dreams, imagination broke free. Movie was never the same again. And thank Tim Burton for that! You cannot do anything but enjoy this crazy story about a ghost, about the importance of life and love, friendship, and all this covered in an unbelievable cloak.

review/summary: TIM BURTON MADE A FUNNY GHOSTS TALE.
review/text: *** 1/2 stars rating for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. This movie was one of the biggest surprises in 1988, it revolutionized the visual effects field, established Tim Burton as a director with a huge imagination, put Winona Ryder on the map, and helped Burton & Michael Keaton to be signed by Warner Bros. to film their strongest 1989 project: &quot;Batman&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a very funny ghosts tale with a lot of creativity and imagination, the characters are easy to love, the situations are funny and bizarre at the same time, all this translates into a very entertaining movie.<br /><br /> There are several memorable scenes in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, among them a possession scene at the tune of Harry Belafonte's &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, another is the one on which Adam & Barbara (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis respectively) are taken to the underworld offices.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a good option to see the gorgeous Winona Ryder in one of her key roles, to see the creativity of Tim Burton at his best, and to see a very funny supernatural comedy.

The sound is very good on the surround but not much on dialog separation if any at all. But Alec Baldwin makes up for the rest. I have always told my partner that Alec would be the only guy in the world that i would leave him for.  I know it would never happen but each time i watch this movie my fantasy runs wild just like the movie itself.  This is just pure fun, pure entertainment, no thinking involved, no serious plot, no hardship, non racist, non potical just pure fun.  Get  it,,,,,you won't be disappointed.  If anything get it for Alec,,,,they don't get any hotter than him.

review/summary: A Afterlife Success
review/text: Many movies, have dealt with the figure of death and the dead, from the Good angel clarence in &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; to Brad Pitt's abysmal turn as Death himself in &quot;Meet Joe Black.&quot; However, Tim Burton has presented the world with the most interestng look at the dead with Beetlejuice. In the first moments of the movie, Barbara and Adam Maitland go to town, And die in the oddest possible way. They return to thier house, and find them selves confined to it's premises. Thier leaving sends them to a strange desert world Populated by multi-layered sandworms.  Eventually, they find that they are dead, and must remain in their home for 128 years, which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the family of NYC artisans that moves in and remodels the place. After consulting with thier &quot;caseworker&quot; Juno,(Sylvia Sidney at her chain-smoking best) they hire a bio-exorcist,Betelguese (pronouced &quot;BeetleJuice,&quot; hence the title) who agrees to help. Unfortunately for the Maitlands, Beetlejuice is an extremely PO'ed demon who refuses to return to the underworld. The visuals and special effects of this movie are completely stunning, and Micheal Keaton gives a performance that must have been a blast to play. Beetlejuice is a beer swilling,cussing,moral-majority's worst nightmare with superpowers, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is one of Tim Burton's Best works, and something he should be proud of.

review/summary: They got more than they expected for out in the country
review/text: When Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam(Alec Baldwin) Maitland move out into the country, they have rest and relaxation on their mind. Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) fancies herself an artist, but husband Charles (Jeffery Jones) just wants to relax in the country after having survived stressful city life. Both he and gothic daughter Lydia (Winnona Ryder) are the most likeable ones in this family.<br /><br />After their own attempts at the supernatural fail, the Maitlands call up Beetlejuice, a disgruntled former bureaucrat for the living impaired. Because their caseworker will not help them get rid of the Detzes, the Maitlands soon turn to Beetlejuice for assistance. The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big. During the supernatural ceremony he puts on an attitude of being in charge 'until something goes wrong'. Since it's likely that he was reading this ceremony as he went along, Otho had not known what he was doing. In other films, this would be dangerous for everybody within a close radius, but Beetlejuice comes to save the day.<br /><br />Michael Keaton steals the show as a fast/smooth-talking demon. He's not an angel, but you definitely want him on your side when the chips are down. The only thing he is really scared of is sandworms (in the otherworld). Keaton would later continue to work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.<br /><br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note. The Maitlands and the Detzes end up living together in the same house and Lydia actually gets along with the former couple.

review/summary: Wild, Crazy Fun With Ghosts
review/text: Well, we already knew Tim Burton has a delightfully warped sense of humor, didn't we? So it came as no surprise to me that this movie was both warped and hilariously funny.<br /><br />Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a charming young couple that live in a large old house on the edge of a small town. They love each other very much, very playful and fun together, and have just settled in for three weeks of vacation to work on their hobby: a scale model of the entire town. It's really good, too. Also, apparently they renovated the old house themselves.<br /><br />One day they went into town to get some supplies for the model and on the way home, went through a covered bridge. That is, through the side of the covered bridge into the river. They found themselves back at home, but eventually realized that they had died and were now haunting the place. That would be OK, except that their neighbor, a real estate agent, promptly sold the place to the Deetz, a severely dysfunctional family from the city. In no time at all, the wife has thrown out all the comfortable old things Adam and Barbara had, and put in horrible modern junk based on the dreadful tastes of her friend, an interior decorator. Also on her own sculptures, which are arguably the ugliest things you have ever seen produced by anyone over the age of five.<br /><br />The only redeeming aspect of the Deetz family is their teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). She dresses in black, is very morbid, but also is the only one able to see Adam and Barbara. And she is in sympathy with their assessment of her step-mother's horrible taste. Also horrible attitude.<br /><br />They don't quite know what to do, but when they returned to the house after the accident (actually, I think it was after the funeral), they found a book titled "Guidebook for the Recently Deceased." They tried to read it, but there was no index, and it didn't seem to make a lot of sense to them. They did manage to draw a door through to a bureaucratic nightmare where they were told to talk to their caseworker. Turns out their caseworker is an abrupt, shriveled old woman who smokes constantly and the smoke seeps out through a large slash in her neck. She warns them not to contact Beetlejuice, who used to be her assistant but "went out on his own." He had left an advertisement in their handbook, and for good measure, managed to put one on their TV.<br /><br />Still, when Lydia reads their handbook and does all she can to help them, they still haven't gotten rid of the Deetz family. In desperation, they call on Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton). You have to say his name three times to call him, which suggestions that he is a demon. Actually, I think the suggestion is also made that he's an alien. It's hard to be sure.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the movie are Beetlejuice's attempts to frighten the Deetz away: or at least the parents. He likes Lydia, and in fact wants her to marry him.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of inside-joke type references throughout, especially in the underworld bureaucracy. It's a very Tim Burton sort of film altogether.

review/text: Michael Keaton's portrayal of the ultimate fun-loving ghoolie Beetlejuice is fantastic.  While his portrayal in Burton's BATMAN of the lead character is dark and brooding, Beetlejuice lets loose all inhibitions and the actor plays it to the hilt.  The supporting cast is wonderful and Burton's story and direction superb.  Maybe not for young children under 12, as it does have a decidely dark side and some scary ghoolies, it is great family fare and good fun.

review/summary: Awesome movie, not very "deluxe" dvd
review/text: I must agree with the few people who complained that this dvd was lacking in special features and whatnot. However, if you have never seen the movie at all, or enjoyed the movie but do not already have a copy, it's still a good buy. It's a great movie, no matter how it's presented on the dvd, and you do get a few episodes of the cartoon as well. I watched Beetlejuice as a kid, both the movie and the cartoons, so I probably would've bought it even if it was a poorly recorded VHS :) In short, don't expect it to be "deluxe", but I definitely recommend buying it (unless you already have a standard version of it).<br /><br />As for the movie itself, if you've never seen it, it's basically a ghost story that is purposely presented in a cheesy manner to be funny. If you're familiar with Tim Burton at all, you'll know he tends to stray from the norm. Don't expect to be scared; that's not what this movie is about. It's basically about a nice couple of ghosts who try to scare away the family who lives in their house, but the family isn't scared; in fact, they invite other people over and try to show off the ghosts - so the ghost couple hires a... rather disgusting guy to help them out, and things pretty much go downhill from there. Definitely and old 80s classic.

review/summary: Best Tim Burton film. He should just stick to this format.
review/text: In beetlejuice I was entirely sucked into this dream like film. The afterlife was a complete quirk, and if it hadn't been accredited to, I would have known already who had directed it. It felt like Batman in it's tone, in its wet darkness, and then the cubistic art world of the urban. I always feel like I'm drawn into the mind of a deeply rooted "pure abstract" painters mind. I love the demensions of his creativity. He takes risks also, something I don't see enough of in his latest works. I always feel like it's halloween after watching this film. In fact it's a sort of tradition to watch this film, along with "a nightmare before christmas", around halloween time. Nothing gets me into the mode better. An ecclectic scare, with a foolishness appropriate enough to remind you of the cartoon.

review/text: This is one of my most favorite movies. I'm ashamed at my self. Because it took me so long to finally get it on DVD. This is truly one of the most funniest movies about being dead.<br />Barbara and Adam, are a young couple who die in an accident. Their house is bought by another couple whom they have nothing in common with.<br /> But when Barbara and Adam start to like the father's daughter Lydia. They start to question wither or not scaring the family off, is really what they want.

review/summary: Tim Burton's Best
review/text: This is Tim Burton's best work, well this and Edward Scissorhands are his best work closely followed by Ed Wood and Big Fish.  This movie is witty, imaginiative and a little gory at times but not too gory.  This movie seems to get funnier the more you watch it.  Michael Keaton proves himself in this that he can be one of the funniest comedians if he tries.  He portray's Betelguise really good.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are great in this too.  The dvd is good.  The picture and sound is clear and crisp, but my only thing is that the menu in this dvd is HORRIBLE.  It doesn't even have a play button for it.  Come on Warner, you can do better then this.  Special Features are average considering this was one of the first dvd's to come out.  Warning: Keep kids under the age of 4 years old or younger away from this movie.  It's to bad and violent.  It even has the f word in it.  But that's why it isn't rated G like other kids movies you can watch with them instead.  This is the movie that really started Tim Burton's career.  I mean, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure was good but this was way better ny far.  I recommend this to any Tim Burton fan, or evwn if your not a big fan of his work, you'll still love this movie.

review/text: It was on the other night, and, having been a big fan of the cartoon when it was being shown, decided to watch it (I'm also trying to see all the Winona Ryder movies I know.). <p> It's a well known fact i like seeing her [Winona Ryder] dance at the end of a movie (hey, it's funny!), but apart from that, it was just a hilarious film and i liked it very much. The only thing  wrong was that it was too short. Maybe the special efects were a bit &quot;off&quot;, but hey, it's an older movie1

review/summary: Awesome Cheese
review/text: This is one of my favorite movies (and, now that I've purchased it, one of my kids' favorites, too!). This movie is so hilariously cheesy it's irresistable. The soundtrack is great, and the kids always jump up to dance along with the characters at the dinner scene. While some of the lines border on awful, the actors are (usually) believable... and who wouldn't mind watching a young Alec Baldwin (remember? back when he was a hottie?). This movie is a classic and a great addition to any movie library (if for nothing else than historical value).

review/summary: It's Just So Gross!
review/text: I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.  Now I realize that it does have a plot, and a very good one.  I don't recall any other movie where ghosts have trouble trying to scare living people out of a house and have to hire another ghost who claims to be an expert.  However, after this set-up happens, THAT'S when the movie becomes a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.<br /><br />Whenever someone mentions Beetlejuice, I think of nothing else but all the weird stuff that's in it.  For instance, when the ghosts try to leave the house, they wind up in some crazy desert place where giant sandworms threaten to eat them.  The movie doesn't do a great job of explaining where this place is, but I think it's the planet Saturn.  Needless to say, since the ghosts can't leave their house, it definitely motivates them to scare away the living people moving in (a bunch of weirdos by the way, so that provides some extra incentive)<br /><br />Then there's the lost souls room, the guy stretching out his head to look like some sort of chicken, the shrimp cocktail turning into hands, Beetlejuice living in a model of the city, the chalk-drawn door opening up to a portal, and the moving art statues.  This movie is just flat-out bizarre.  There's so much that's packed into it.<br /><br />But its kind of a downer that the afterlife is shown as some kind of overly-administrative going to and fro, where you have to read a handbook, wait in an office, talk to a case worker, and do all other kinds of boring things.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  I work in a funeral home, and this movie STILL grosses me out.  Walking dead folks are all over the place.  Some sawn in half, others flattened by a truck, and Beetlejuice himself looks to have some kind of mild skin decomposition.  But by far the scene that's hardest to stomach is the seance.  The ghosts are summoned in their wedding outfits only to grow older and older until they start to fall apart.  I should be thankful that they weren't shown as green and bloated throughout the whole movie, since drowning's the thing that killed them.<br /><br />This is one of the most original and disgusting films you'll ever see.  I think everybody should see it once, just to see how bizarrely creative it is.  Obviously a whole heck of a lot of work went into it.  Beetlejuice himself made me laugh quite a bit, with lines like, "Attention K-Mart shoppers!" but he sure did gross me out a lot too.<br /><br />I kind of wish Burton would have stayed away from the Halloween type movies and did more stuff like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  I've been wanting to see Big Fish for a while, but I heard its not very good.
