review/summary: Worked for 1 season, not 1 year
review/text: My fault for listening to false advertising on the radio & not reading the fine print on the inside label. Live in Central FL where we have heavy rain in the summer. Just read on their website that this lasts only 6-8 months in areas with heavy rainfall. Well, I've been seeing weeds sprouting out by my bushes in March & we sprayed this in November.<br /><br />I wish they wouldn't play their no-weeds-for-1-year ads in areas where that are known to experience heavy rain. The liquid border/edger thing worked better than this, at least there's still no grass/weeds at the edges of my yard & that was sprinkled earlier that the groundclear.

review/summary: So far so good
review/text: I purchased this product to take care of weeds that come through a small brick walkway leading to my house.  I was tired of spraying the weeds every few weeks so hopefuly this product will take care of the weeds for the whole year.  I mixed this whole bottle with 1 gallon of water and sprinkled it onto the walkway.  Within 2 days all of the weeds have turned brown and are dead.  Now all that has to be done is to go back out and pull all of the brown dead weeds.<br />***It has been over 2 weeks now and there are no signs of new weed growth coming through the bricks.  Hopefully this will continue to be the case for the rest of the season.<br /><br />Please read the coverage area for this product as I used up the whole bottle just for a small walkway.

review/summary: Delicious, full of flavor, and easy to make
review/text: After watching all those cooking competition shows scream about how amazing risotto is for the past decade, I finally decided to try some for the first time in my life and chose this product. It took about 30 minutes to make (on top of having to cook the chicken separately), but was so worth it! It's delicious, loaded with flavor, and easy to make. It's also gluten free, which is important to me.<br /><br />My only complaint is it says there are 4 servings per box, but it's so delicious that a normal, hungry man will only get two (maybe more like one and a half). If you add your own protein (like chicken) to the risotto, you can get a full meal out of each of these two (or 1.5) servings.<br /><br />I'm impressed with the quality of all the Lundberg rice products I've tried over the years, from rice cakes to just plain old rice and now this. Seriously, get some!

They sell a 10 pack of the same bars for $33 plus $5.62 shipping for a total of $38.62. I saw this was $26.98 plus $7.05 shipping for a total of $34.03. I thought I would save $4 and order this. I was surprised to find only on bar instead of 10. $34.03 for one bar that is ridiculous.

review/summary: Excellent product, not-so-great shipping
review/text: I'm absolutely addicted to this product.  I first purchased a package of them at Whole Foods Market, where they're sold for $4.99/package.  Since we don't make trips to Whole Foods on a very regular basis, I knew I'd either have to buy them in bulk from there (which would be outrageously expensive) or try to find them elsewhere, so I looked on Amazon.  It was an excellent deal with both Subscribe & Save and our Amazon Prime Student membership.  When I received the box of six packages, however, I noticed that the first had slightly broken/crumbled fig bars in it... and then the second and third and fourth.  So basically, it just looks like someone or some people handled the box very poorly.  I will purchase this again though, and hopefully all of my fig bars will be perfectly intact next time!

review/text: I actually love this product. Because I can't have sugar, I have to seek out products like Barbara's sugar free/fruit only fig/blueberry bars.<br /><br />The only problem is that the expiration date on this product was Jan 9 2008, and this product was sent to me in March 2008.  When I asked for another batch with a later expiration date, I was sent another 6 boxes<br />in April with the same Jan 9 2008 date.<br /><br />Get with it Amazon, that's not okay..... The product gets noticably goey<br />and is not a firm cookie past the expiration date.  I really wanted this<br />product, but had to ask for my money back due to this expiration date problem.  Amazon gave me a $10 coupon for other Amazon products,<br />but no cookies. Oh well, I guess I'll loose a few pounds....

review/summary: Addictive - beware of sugar.
review/text: Funny how this product seems so polarizing.  I dislike Fig Newtons but love these bars' true-fruit sweetness and gooey density.  Some bars do stick together. The filling is by no means hard to chew or gigantic, though, as some reviewers have oddly implied.  If freshness was ever a problem, it may have been corrected: the shipment I got was several months before the expiration date.<br /><br />My only qualm: though naturally sweetened, each piece contains 8g sugar. The serving size of 2 bars is more filling than you'd expect, but if eaten as a quick breakfast or even lasting snack you'd need at least 4 -- for 32g sugar.  "Natural" or not that's too much sugar.

review/summary: Delicious Raspberry fig bars!
review/text: First, I second the comments of some who have noted shipping issues.  My shipment came with the cookies very tightly packed in a single box that was of less than sturdy construction leading to some crushed packages. Luckily, few bars/cookies were affected, but that was a big surprise as the box corners had caved in.  But putting that aside...<br /><br />These cookies were very tasty.  The Raspberry fig filling is delicious.  Lots of good raspberry flavor.  The thick "cookie" wrapper has a distinct grain (barley) flavor.  A new flavor to me, but I got used to it.  Overall, though, simply delicious.  I love figs, fig bars, and raspberries so a taste treat for me.<br /><br />I purchased via "Subscribe & Save" for the best price.  My biggest problem now is not eating too many of these as they are fairly high in calories (120 cals/2 bars).  But they are good, healthy calories! ;)

review/text: These fig bars are big step up over the typical supermarket brands, but you do have to like a strong whole-grain taste and the lack of additives makes them a bit dry. They freeze well so it works ok to buy the six pack. They actually make a nice cold sweet if you eat them frozen, but they do hold their texture once thawed too.

So, it's all well and fine that this company is touting them as wheat free but they're made with oats as well as barley (gluten ingredients) so that's a big turn off. I don't get it. This product suggests that it is intended for a specialized market but it's made of ingredients that would prohibit purchasing it. Illogical. I wish Barbara's would make this product w/o the gluten so that I could buy it for my family! Meh!

review/summary: We love them, but not for everyone
review/text: Okay, we try as hard as we can to eat as little sugar and as little white flour as we can, but it is hard, one still needs sweets and snacks, especially with kids.  These are great, 100% whole wheat, and sweetened with fruit juice instead of a more refined sugar.  This may make me a bad mom, but on mornings when we are running late and I know we don't have time for a good and normal breakfast, I will give the girls one of these with milk, they're getting fruit and whole grain, so...  I say they are not for everyone because if you are used to Fig Newtons you will probably not like these, if you are not used to eating products for their whole grain content and lack of refined sugars, you probably won't like these.  I used to love Fig Newtons, but in a effort to be more healthy I gave them up and now only eat these, it has been long enough now that we have been eating healthier that I like the taste of these.  The girls knew no better, they had never had a real Fig Newton so had nothing to compare to and they just eat these up.  I don't know that we could go through a case of 6, we just buy one package at a time at our local Coborn's, and we don't go through them that fast as they are a treat not a daily thing or anything, so....

Once our guestssssss were awake and stirring, each had their choice of coffees or teas and I offered the fig bars as an accompaniment as I worked on getting breakfast prepared and on the table. Everyone loved the bars, even ME who is not typically a lover of blueberry flavored foods.  I had guests who hate FIG NEWTONS, but loved these. The first package was gone in a flash and I will open another tomorrow morning to buy me some time in the kitchen with breakfast prep once again.  I anticipate that after the Holidays, these will be a new addition to my IN THE CAR, morning COMMUTE, easy to eat breakfast items to have as I sip coffee along the route to work. Thanks for the great pricing Amazon!

review/summary: Way better than newtons
review/text: We just got our first shipment of these cookies on Saturday, and we've already eaten two packages!  They are wonderfully textured - soft, and not a bit dry.  The raspberry and fig flavors are nicely balanced, and the filling is generous.<br />I can't think of a way to improve on these.

review/summary: Taste is "OK"
review/text: Buyer Beware: I ordered this product 4-11-08 (rcvd it promptly) and the expiration date is 7-7-08. I'm a single gal - so that means I'd have to chow down 2 of these packages each month just to consume them before they expire.<br /><br />For the health concious - these are fruit juice sweetened which means no white sugar is added! They are 60 calories per cookie with 13g of carbs, 1g Fiber, 8g sugar, and 1g of protein.<br /><br />I had to leave a rating of only 2 because of the taste - just "ok" for me. They have a very heavy flavour almost a slight fermented after taste to them. If you're a die hard fig lover, these might be for you but I personally prefer the whole wheat version by Nabisco

review/text: Why can't I give this a negative amount of stars???<br /><br />I love these cookies and have bought them from Amazon before. The expiration date was always just a few months away--but I love them and had no problem eating all six packages in a short time.<br /><br />This time, I got my shipment May 2009 and the cookies all had a "best used by March 09" date on them. So....Amazon has now sunk to shipping goods past their expiration date. I haven't eaten any of them yet---I kind of turned off by the idea they are two month beyond the date they should be taken off the shelf.<br /><br />I will  never buy these from Amazon again unless Amazon can assure me the product will be fresh.

review/summary: Misleading product name
review/text: This product may indeed be delicious but the product name is at the very least misleading, at worst deceptive. Anyone with celiac disease or other wheat intolerance needs to know that this product, though free of wheat, is made with multiple grains, including barley flour, and so is unsuitable for their use. Rightfully, the product should be named Multigrain Fig Bars as that is what they are. I don't see why anyone would specifically choose a wheat-free product over one containing wheat unless one is wheat intolerant (and therefore intolerant to all wheat-related grains). What possible legitimate reason could there be then to name this product "Wheat Free"? My rating of the product is based not on the product per se but on the unfortunate and misleading name Barbara's Bakery has chosen to give it. Please note also that a representative of Barbara's Bakery in a private communication to me in response to my objection to the name of this product stated there was no claim made that the product was gluten free then added that the few products Barbara's Bakery makes which it does claim to be gluten free are made in non-dedicated facilities which also process wheat. This is absurd as those products are subject to contamination with wheat and cannot legitimately be considered gluten free. It all comes down to a matter of truth in advertising. Where there is no truth in advertising what trust can there be in any of the products the company produces?

Maybe you have to pay more and concentrate on the quality of the spice instead of the attractiveness of the packaging.  Seller delivered product in timely manner. I just wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.

Although they contain less sugar than a candy bar, they are definitely not a health food. They have a nice crisp texture, and taste delicious. The caramel taste is there, but for me does not overpower the apple taste.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon is about half what this costs in my local grocery store, though of course you have to buy 12 bags.<br /><br />Bottom line: A delectable snack food.

review/text: I got these olives as a Christmas gift and I have to admit I was apprehensive before I popped the first one in my mouth. It was definitely hot, but not as fire-breathing, brow-sweating hot as I had anticipated. More importantly, the FLAVOR was incredible! I've had habanero peppers in different foods, and they usually overpower whatever it is they are in. That was NOT the case with these olives. It was as if the olive enhanced the good flavorful qualities of the pepper and tamed the overpowering qualities. Who knew it would take an olive to bring out the best of a habanero? As someone who likes spicy foods where the heat enhances the flavor rather than ruins it, these were an excellent treat for me.

review/text: I ordered the 3-jar pack and 2 of the 3 were totally stale...yuck!  None of the jars had dates on them (sell by...) and the olives did not have habanero in them.  The tiny habanero pieces were at the bottom of the jar.  I'm assuming they were so old the stuffing fell out.  Granted, one of the jars was very fresh...and I loved it.  But 1-of-3 doesn't cut it when you spend $20 on them as a trio.  I won't order these again.  I'd rather have regular pimento olives from the local market...fresher...tastier...and 1/3 the cost.  By the way, habanero chili is the hottest available.  These were not (in my opinion) habanero's.  They weren't even of jalapeno calibre.  Buy a jar of $1.99 plain olives and put Tabasco on them.  Much better.

review/text: First off, let me say that this Walker's toffee is the finest in the known universe! The problem lies with the packaging. The toffee comes in rather hefty, 3.5 ounce bars, sealed in heavy plastic, like the kind they use to make small electronic items more theft-resistant. To make matters worse, the product stuck unmercifully to the plastic. Think huge 'Sugar Daddy', without the stick, covered in shrink-wrap. One star was deducted for the trouble...I wouldn't order again. Incidentally, what the devil is an 'Andy Pack' anyways? It certainly isn't handy.

review/text: This granola is ok, but nothing more. I tried it because I love Udi's bread, and wanted to try their granola, but it's nothing special. It's no better than the gluten free generic granola I buy in bulk at my local grocery store for a fraction of the price. In fact the generic gf granola has more goodies in it. I guess I was expecting something better but it didn't do it for me.

review/text: I just LOVE this stuff.  I eat for breakfast almost every day.  I have a gluten allergy and I've never had a problem with digesting this granola.  I'm not usually a big granola lover.  Often granola will be too heavy and have too many seeds in it, but this granola is nothing like that.  Great stuff.

review/text: This granola is so delicious. In a market where gluten free often means it tastes horrible, Udi's delivers again. Just like their breads and bagels, this granola makes it easy to believe gluten free living can be just as tasty as a gluten filled diet. No matter what product you're eating, you can't go wrong with Udi's products! I eat this granola for breakfast everyday. So good!

review/text: This is really tasty granola -- nice and crisp and fresh-tasting.  My only criticism (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that it doesn't have any clusters, which would give it a bit more crunch.  But overall, I'm thrilled to have a high quality, gluten-free granola.

review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac in May 2011.  There were few things I minded giving up but one was granola in my breakfast yogurt!  I found GF UDI's granola at a grocery store and it was $8 a bag, which is a lot when I eat it every morning!  So I was thrilled to find it at Amazon and at such a great price.  Worth ever penny - all flavors are great!  Vanilla is my favorite.  Thanks UDI's for making GF easy....

review/summary: Wonderful Rooibos---The "Miracle Tea"!
review/text: *****<br /><br />Red Mellow Bush is a premium Numi tea. This herbal tea (caffeine-free) is certified organic and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Grown in the high desert regions of the Cederberg Mountains, the shoots of Rooibos have been hand gathered by South Africans for generations. It is prepared like a traditional tea, undergoing meticulous drying (oxidation) and cutting. Organic Red Mellow Bush has an earthy vanilla taste and pleasing orange color with hints of autumn straw. With an anti-oxidant level comparable to green tea, Rooibos has no caffeine, is rich in minerals, very low in tannin, and is relaxing to the nerves. No wonder they call it the miracle tea. Discover the wonders of Rooibos!" What an invitation!<br /><br />It is my husband's favorite tea, and is pure premium rooibos. If you haven't tasted rooibos before, it is a pleasant, earthy, herbal flavor that most people like.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love rooibos, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: hint of orange flavor
review/text: I have been using orange oil for several years now.  A small amount mixed in a recipe gives the after-taste of orange, much the same as grated orange peel.  Too much will leave a bitter after-taste, but about a scant cap full will add great flavor.  The orange oil keeps indefinitely in the refrigerator.  I've used it with fish, sweet potatoes, cakes and pies, orange flavored beef.  The sky's the limit

review/summary: NOT JUST FOR FOOD - USE FOR CLEANING ALSO
review/text: The other reviewers have already told you about the wondrous ways to use it in food but I specifically buy it for cleaning. I add about a tablespoon of it to a sink full of water to mop my hardwood floors. Also, it take sticky icky glue residue from stickers, tape etc right off (orange oil is the main ingredient in "Goo Gone" a glue off cleaning product). I recently used it to remove tape from hardwood floors. If you use it straight it will dull the shine so mix it with another type of cooking oil and do a test in a hidden area. After removing tape residue with the oil mixture you MUST clean it with soap and water to remove any orange oil residue. Also, to keep it fresh you have to keep it in the refrigerator. Be sure to wipe the bottom of the bottle before placing it in the fridge because it will eat through the plastic cubby bins. I have many eaten/burned through circular marks from the glass container on my new french door refrigerator cubbys because I forgot to wipe the drip off the bottom.

review/summary: Often better than zest
review/text: I've all but given up using citrus zest due to the benefits the oils.  While both have great flavor, orange oil is definately stronger (and goes further) than zest.  As it is a liquid, it does not add unwanted texture to your dish, either.  I use orange and lemon oils in my NY cheesecake and have always had terrific results.  The scent given to foods is stronger than with zest, too.  I love the stuff.  I just wish the bottles came with drop applicators.  (I've tried other lids with droppers inside, but the bottle opening doesn't fit them....  at least for the small 1 oz bottle.)

review/summary: This tea makes me sad
review/text: Let me start by stating that I absolutely LOVE Genmai Cha teas, so after reading a couple positive reviews I was extremely excited to order this tea in bulk.  I waited excitedly for my package to arrive, and now I wish for a return to this positive place of hope and excitement.  This tea has been nothing short of disappointing.<br /><br />I've had this tea for over a month now, and have tried adjusting my brewing in many ways, the best I have managed to achieve for flavor is underwhelming.  I love genmai cha for it's smooth baked flavor and scent.  I suppose I've just been lucky in the past to have bought quality teas.  Placing roasted rice in a sub par green tea seems to just produce a tea that goes straight from flavorless to bitter with no happy place in between.<br /><br />If you love green teas, this is one I'd avoid.

The tea is a combination of a very nice, vibrant Japanese green tea, whole leaf, and perfectly roasted short grain brown rice. In Japan, I gather it is often a morning drink. I like it anytime, especially in cold weather months. The flavor is smooth, flavorful, well balanced and nutty. It is just a superb buy and I recommend it completely.

It will become bitter after steeping for more than 3 minutes.  I like the price and if the price is what you are after, go ahead and buy it.  But, if you have had some very good organic Gen mai cha, you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Davidson's Genmaicha
review/text: From wikipedia -<br /><br />Genmaicha ('''?, "brown rice tea") is the Japanese name for green tea combined with roasted brown rice. It is sometimes referred to colloquially as "popcorn tea" because a few grains of the rice pop during the roasting process and resemble popcorn. This type of tea was originally drunk by poor Japanese, as the rice served as a filler and reduced the price of the tea; which is why it is also known as the "people's tea". Today it is consumed by all segments of society.<br /><br />After reading the reviews and doing some research I went for it.  I am happy with quantity of tea for the price.  Visual inspection of the tea confirms it is indeed twiggy and not a premium green tea.  After reading the wikipedia entry on genmaicha (quoted above), this seems ok.  Compared to other genmaicha I've had, this has much more toasted rice.  While most of the rice was popped, I did not detect any popcorn as mentioned in an other review.  The dry tea had a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />I made a pot and steeped it for 3 minutes.  It has a nice color and fragrance and is overall a pleasant cup of tea.  It is twiggy, so don't let it stand too long lest it become bitter.  I don't know that I will buy this again as I have another genmaicha that I like better, but I'm ok with my purchase and will have no problem finishing it.  I may add it bit more green tea from my private stash to make it stronger.<br /><br />pros - great price, organic<br /><br />cons - green tea is twiggy with many broken leaves<br /><br />Photo at [...]

review/summary: Not good.
review/text: If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why.

She begged for one every time we went to the gym, but of course they were crazy expensive there.  So I hopped on amazon and found the box of 12 at half the price of the gym.  They arrived right away, we will keep ordering them here.

review/summary: The best popcorn I've ever eaten!
review/text: Yoder popcorn is the best popcorn I have ever eaten! I first had it while visiting a relative in Indiana. It has made a great gift for several people I know because the Amish folk that cultivate these popcorn kernels provide a much higher quality product than any other that I have found thus far.<br /><br />The Tiny Tender in particular is a favorite of mine and many of my family members. The kernels themselves actually pop and result in a piece of popcorn that is roughly half the size of normal popcorn. The popcorn is also unique in that the hull is almost nonexistent. This not only makes for a great tasting item but when you reach the bottom of the bowl there are less of those disgusting half popped kernels. The taste of the popcorn is somewhat more delicate than others and is tasty by itself or with some of the custom flavorings.<br /><br />We normally use cheap popcorn oil that we get at the local grocery store but Yoder also sells various kinds of popping oils as well as special toppings to sprinkle on top. We really like the white cheddar topping but they also have some interesting ones like ranch, yellow cheddar, BBQ, sour cream and chives, nacho, jalapeno, salt and vinegar, bacon and cheese, pizza, honey mustard, creamy dill, and butter flavored. I've only tasted the first three toppings but I but those three were all pretty yummy.<br /><br />Be sure to visit the Yoder store if you're ever near Topeka, Indiana...they give out free samples of popcorn as you shop! :)
