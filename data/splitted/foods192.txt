review/summary: quali TEA
review/text: When my supermarket discontinued Newman's Own Organic Black Tea (Royal Tea) I started ordering it from Amazon. I order it a case at a time and it arrives promptly.<br />The tea itself is one of the only organic black teas that come in boxes of 100.<br />Royal Tea is a full bodied black tea. It is a smooth tasting tea. Strong brewed is never bitter.<br />The more you drink, the more money is donated to charity. What a bonus!

review/summary: British seal of approval
review/text: I'm English and very fussy about my tea. Not too keen on Tetley (though they do make a decent decaf that my wife drinks in the evening). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AXZ7Q8">Tetley British Blend Naturally Decaffeinated Premium Black Tea, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>. I used to drink PG Tips but nowadays I find it to be too strong, particularly if you're making a cup at a time (versus making a pot). I've been drinking the Newman's Own Organics for about a year now and my wife and I both love it. It's consistently good, box to box. I use one tea bag per cup, brewed for exactly 4 minutes. I always add milk, but that's just how Brits drink their tea. I use this as my tea timer. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R4BP34">Polder TMR-540 Opus Digital Triple Timer with Clock, Stainless Steel and Black</a>. It has a pleasant bird chirp for the alarm instead of an annoying beep. It has three timers. I preset one for 4 minutes, and just need to hit a single button when I brew the tea.

review/summary: Always hits my tea spot right on!
review/text: Love this tea, and have ordered it multiple times. You could just say I'm hooked on it. Typically very deep flavors and very fresh. We take ours and keep it in a closed lid sealed container while we work thru the whole 100 bags of a box. The remaining boxes we keep factory sealed until we need to open. Also keep the sealed boxes out of direct light and in a cool food pantry. Hot water out of our Bunn coffee maker (it keeps hot water ready and can make a new pot of water or coffee within a minute or so) works very well & is the method I use the most often, but it can add some extra flavor to use water heated right to boil on the stove top, but takes a bit longer. We have other teas, but I always seem to drift back to this one. The volume pricing on Amazon makes it well worth ordering on-line -- we cannot find the same prices if we get it in the local stores, even if I factor in the shipping.

review/text: I try to only consume organic products which led me to this tea. I drink tea daily so I needed it in bulk to save money.  This fits the bill perfectly and tastes great.  I usually use two bags instead of one to get it as strong as I like it, but for this price I don't mind.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Not quite there
review/text: Someone here mentioned that this tea is "more pleasing to the palate than your average bagged tea". Actually this is the exact reason why I don't like it. It's too mild for my taste. Tea should have a distinct flavor, but sadly this black tea doesn't. I wonder if any of the delighted reviewers of this product ever had a cup of really good black tea. Probably not, because this product essentially makes a cup of slightly tea-flavored boiled water.

When compared to st dalfour organic tea... this tastes like Lipton caffeine free tea from Costco! I HAVE always gone with reviews before buying anything online, but this particular tea is no good, At ALL. And Costco returns is better than amazon for so much of something so bad!

review/summary: Nothing to it
review/text: I was overjoyed to find an organic black tea at a low price, and I assumed since it had the "Newman's Own" brand name on it, that it would be a great tea. I was disappointed. It was mild and rather tasteless. I understand that organic teas tend to be less brisk than non-organic, but I've ordered a favorite organic Assam from another well-known tea purveyor, and it was heads above this Newman blend. I got what I paid for with the Newman, but at least I'm not out a whole lot of money.

review/summary: T E A......F I T......F O R.....A.....K I N G....{  : )
review/text: As a "royal-watcher" since childhood, I did a double-take and stopped short, walking back to where I had been, when I saw this in my periferal vision, several years ago, in the supermarket.  It was that CROWN and that ROBE that Mr. Newman was wearing that got my eye.<br /><br />"Royal Tea" from Paul Newman's enterprises!  Why not?  I mean -- who deserved to name his tea "Royal Tea" than this superstar whose charitable heart was as good as his acting skills, and as wonderful as his ever-handsome looks?  The maverick in me has always liked the slightly-cocky half-smile Mr. Newman gave so often on the screen.  It was as if he had a touch -- just a touch, mind you -- of anger at our "esteemed" leadership, and at authority in general....just as I have?  Probably....<br /><br />Anyway, I bought the tea, and found it's flavour really good.  Tasty tea -- thy name is NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, 100 INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED TEA BAGS, 7.05-OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 6).  It has a light, but very bold flavour.  And a very good flavour, too!<br /><br />I have recently found I must cut down on my favourite sweetener, SPLENDA. (TOO much of anything isn't good -- and too much SPLENDA, at least in my case, was beginning to affect my liver!)  I've partially solved this problem by putting TWO tea-bags in a slightly larger cup, (actually a 22-ounce glass), and this allows me to cut down on my Splenda packets.  It also gives the tea a more robust taste.<br /><br />The message on the back of the box, from Mr. Newman's daughter, Nell, (who appears with him in Royal roobes on the front), is funny, and a priceless view into the mind and heart of the sadly late Mr. Newman.  Who knows, but that he, (and Nell), may very well have had royal ancestors?  He was certainly handsome enough, (and Nell quite beautiful enough), to have this actually be true.  The message is delightful, and I am so glad it has been continued on the box.  (One note to Nell, thoough: a "perilous" person is one who is usually a villain(ess).  I take it that you are NOT "perilous", but "imperilled", (someone who IN danger.)  Please check<br />with the dictionary to be sure I am right on this!<br /><br />I've been fortunate enough to be able to sample the English FORTUM & MASON's "Royal Blend Tea".  It is very tasty, too -- but also imported, and thus,<br />very expensive.  NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, is really tasty, less expensive, and truly an AMERICAN tea.  It proves, in a totally American way, that one need not be a king or queen, to enjoy the very best!  If Mr. Newman's ancestors WERE royal, he was continuing in the BEST of royal traditions, by sharing his bounty, (at a very reasonable cost), with those of us who admire all he did.  If his ancestors weren't royal....well, this truly delicious tea proves that ANYONE, no matter what their ancestry --  with enough heart, backing, and expertise -- can produce an exceptional-tasting tea at reasonable cost.<br /><br />"King Paul" remains in our hearts, and in our happiest memories.  "Queen Nell" has our respect, our love, and our admiration.  This black tea -- the black tea that so many of us grew up on -- is our traditional tea, upgraded to a "royal" standard by being organic.  Mr. Newman's company also produces organic green tea, which has its own great taste and health benefits.  But for we traditionalists....black tea is it.  And organic black tea that is SO tasty, truly makes anyone who drinks it,<br />feel quite royal, indeed!

review/summary: I think its low quality tea
review/text: This tea has a completely different taste than ALL the other black teas out there....  It is reddish/orange in color, which is odd too....as most black teas are uniformly "dark".  It has, what I characterize, as a "burnt tea" flavor, even though I only steep it for 5 minutes max.<br /><br />I once bought an off brand Chinese tea and it too was "red" in color and had the same "burnt" taste.<br /><br />I think everyone here is confused.  Black tea should be black, not red.  This tea was also quite cheap at Whole Foods, only $3.99 for organic tea.  I have paid twice that for better tasting, BLACK, organic black tea.<br /><br />I'm pissed at the burnt flavor and red color.  I can barely stand it iced.  Will likely have to buy something else.

The quality of the texture of this chorizo is really good and so is the flavor. The service from the company that actually sell it, was outstanding. All in all, it is a great product and one that I had kept going back to buy, along with the serrano ham.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I love Earl Grey. I love Zhena's Earl Green. I do not love Zhena's Earl "Greater" Grey: it is not greater. There's very little bergamot flavor, at least in the batch I got. In fact if I didn't know it's supposed to be Earl Grey I'd say it's only a fairly good black tea with no bergamot at all. Even just opening the tin, I got no whiff of bergamot, and certainly there's none in the finished tea, even using double tea bags. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but although it's passable tea, it's very bad Earl Grey.<br /><br />For real Earl Grey, I strongly recommend The Republic of Tea's "Earl Greyer." It is by far the most delicious Earl Grey I have tried. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't (yet?) carry the tea bags, but it is worth the trouble of a loose tea, to have actual Earl Grey (bergamot) flavor in your Earl Grey tea.

review/text: I just had a bowl of split pea soup for a part of my lunch. It was Amy's Organic Split Pea Soup and it was quite good. It says that it is low fat, but the ingredient list has no fat at all on it so it must be very low. The sodium, on the other hand is a bit higher than I like, but the fiber content is good. The taste is somewhat bland, but I'm not complaining. I get tastes out of the other foods I eat with it. It's a vegan product and has no added MSG or preservatives and is gluten free. A product like this should have great appeal to those who are on restricted diets, for whatever reason. Relatively pure foods are hard to find.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I've found the holy grail of gluten-free cookies!! This shortbread is simply PERFECT: wonderfully light, crispy, and buttery; flavored just right; not too sweet--and I can eat it despite my numerous dietary restrictions! In fact, it's easy to forget that these wonders are gluten-, egg-, dairy-, corn- and transfat-free, because they just taste like a really well-made cookie (which they are) and not like some substitute-laden excuse for a cookie (which I'm sure you've endured if you have these dietary restrictions). I've also tried Sun Flour Baking Co.'s lemon shortbread (also sold here), and it is equally as satisfying. Maybe the "lots of love" listed in the ingredients is what is doing the culinary trick here, but whatever SFBC is doing, I hope they keep it up for a very long time! I am hooked!

review/summary: Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!
review/text: This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.

review/summary: Amazing For Finicky Eaters and Stomach Issues
review/text: If you have a dog that turns his or her nose up to all dry and wet foods from premium names such as Wellness CORE, Merrick, Blue Buffalo, Evo, Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried Patties, Dr. Harvey's etc. then you have to give this a try. My dog is a 40lb Sheltie/Collie mix so having a large highly active dog that wouldn't eat was very stressful I hear many people with toy breeds having the problem but I never thought I would happen with a high energy dog. I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not. When I read that it was jerky like pieces it sparked an interest because she loves those types of treats. The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much. The smell and texture is incredible I never saw her eat so fast and she is so much more energetic and happy this food is amazing and not that expensive considering the smaller portion. I could not be more happy this product has everything I need.

review/summary: One of the best dog food out there.
review/text: I have a very picky puppy that would often rather starve himself, than to eat something he doesn't like. Because of that, he was becoming underweight and I decided to switch him away from dry kibble to have him gain some weight first before worrying bout his picky taste.<br />However when I give him ziwipeak, he would finish it up right away!<br /><br />This brand is expensive, but based upon the amounts you feed, it isn't really that much expensive if you have a small dog. I have a 2 pound puppy that is expected to mature at about 4-5 pounds, and the costs is about 25cents extra a day. If you have a big dog that's gonna gobble up 1/3 of a bag or more a day, then that will be a lot more expensive for you.<br /><br />But......<br />The quality of food and the fact that it is in a jerky meat form makes it a lot better than eating hard dry kibble all day long.<br />Anyone would be bored of eating biscuits everyday for his entire life :/<br /><br />The quality of this food is unsurpassed.<br />There have been no problems at all with this food at all as well either. No recalls, all made in New Zealand as well.<br /><br />Something that I tell a lot of people.<br />Spend more on food daily, and not risk the possibility of having a sick dog due to some pet food recall. Vet bills are going to cost you a few thousand dollars.<br />Expensive dog food will probably add up to the same cost as most over the duration of your dog's life, unless you have a really big dog.<br />So instead of having to go through the grief of having a puppy in pain, and you undergoing mental and emotional stress, why not just give it a food that is good and safe and something that the dog enjoys, and spare yourself from all that unnecessary trouble?<br /><br />Yes times are hard and most people are having difficulty putting dinner on the table for themselves or their kids. So there are situations where foods like this are just too much to afford.<br />So unless if your budget really is a problem, I would recommend this food to anyone!

review/summary: Yes, it's expensive but...
review/text: SO WORTH IT.  And when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is a lot of food packed into those tiny squares.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.

review/summary: Looks gross, smells gross, my dog loves it!!!
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this because it costs a fortune and venison and fish sounded pretty unappetizing.  But I was desperate, because I have a 16 year old dog who's always been a picky eater but had now lost a dangerous amount of weight because of a heart condition.  The pet store said this was the tastiest thing they had in stock and they couldn't keep it on their shelves, so despite its $4/can price tag, I decided to try it.<br /><br />The food looks gross.  It has strange-looking pieces in it (tripe? some exotic part of the venison or blue mussel?), and it doesn't smell like something I would want to eat, either.  But my dog cannot get enough of it. She gobbles it up and begs for more.  She's gained back the weight she lost, and feeding her is no longer an excruciating, hour long process of coaxing and pleading.  Unlike some cheaper canned foods I've tried, it does not give her digestive problems.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater and you've tried everything, try Ziwipeak.  Maybe your dog just has a sophisticated palette :-)

review/summary: Great Product - Too Expensive!
review/text: I've tried raw, canned and dry.  Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.  It is absent the corn and wheat products that you should avoid.  It is not a totally dry food but comes in a bag and is more dry than wet.  I suggest you also store in the refrigerator.  The four rating is because it is also one of the most expensive products - so much so that I may have to keep searching for a less expensive alternative.  I am also concerned at recent reports that the concentration of too much animal protein in a dog's diet may create organ problems.  If you use this food check for portion size which is less than your usual kibble.  And don't forget to give your four legged friend a sprout of brocolli, chip of sweet potatoe and some other vegetables now and then.  Do your research as there are some foods that should not be fed to your dogs includeing cooked bones which can cause havoc for them.

review/summary: raw fed travel made easier  *BUT*....
review/text: I have a small breed service dog and his raw food diet can be a challenge when we travel. I bought this food based on the fact that it's the closest ingredient-wise to what I'd feed him at home. He loves this food and literally spins in circles when he hears me open the container I store it in, something he has NOT done for other foods in the past.<br /><br />My issue with this food is that when I received the bag I noticed through the window on the back of the package that the lower third of the bag seemed to be mostly crumbs; in transferring the upper portion of the bag to a smaller storage container I found that most of the bottom of the bag was almost "dust". The "dust" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.<br /><br />Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.<br /><br />Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the brand - at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and break, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping. Either way, this product makes traveling so much easier and my pup just loves having it at home as a treat so I've ordered a second bag today and will see if the crumb issue repeats itself or not.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/16/12: The second bag (Lamb) was received in perfect condition this time.<br /><br />Would purchase again and recommend.

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: I finally upgraded to the 11 lb bag after purchasing several 2.2 1b bags. I have two small dogs at home, both are 10 pounds each. I was trying out the raw food diet after doing research online, and while the dogs loved it, I was definitely not a fan of the raw meat and having to wipe everywhere when they were done eating.<br /><br />Along comes Ziwipeak, and I tested out the different flavors in the smaller portions, ALL of which the two dogs loved.<br /><br />Here are the marked differences since switching over (previously they were on Merrick dry food, before that was Halo).<br /><br />Fresh breath, no more doggy odor!<br />Stools do not smell (or very very faint)<br />One of the dogs - a Maltese - her tearstains have completely disappeared!!<br />Glossier coats<br />More energetic<br /><br />Etc etc.<br /><br />So even though this is expensive, in terms of the visible differences you can see in the dogs, I believe it's worth it!

review/text: I have tried all types of raw dog food for my yorkie. He used to like the Paw Naturaw Grassfed Bison meals, but the last two bags i received had to be mixed with fresh raw meat in order for him to eat it. I tried Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Raw meals and ended up having to do the same with that food. This morning i put out a small portion of "ZiwiPeak Real Meat Grain Free Air Dried Raw Dog Food, Venison & Fish" from a 2.2 lb bag and my yorkie gobbled it up. Shipping was quick too. I order on Monday and received it on Tuesday. I am very pleased with the product and the shipment.<br /><br />I am sold on this product and will definitely order this again.

review/summary: What a great product!
review/text: My dog started to become finicky with her Wellness Core dog food.  She must stay on it for allergy purposes so I really have no option but to encourage her to eat it.  I never in a million years thought I would spend 26 dollars on 2 pounds of dog food but I did.  I do not feed this to my dog by itself.  I crumble up the pieces and mix it in with my dog's food.  Man....does she gobble up her food now.....it is terrific not having to sit with her to get her to eat.  Even the cat picks some of the Ziwi out of her bowl.  : )  I certainly could not afford to feed my dog this food by itself but for those of us that want to give our dogs a treat or that need a supplement to encourage our pets to eat, I would strongly recommend this dog food.  It is quality through and through.  : )

review/summary: greatest dog food ever, but the price jump the worst
review/text: I can't say enough about ZiwiPeak, hands down the best dog food on the market, both dry (11 lbs) and canned food. I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service. Unfortunately, with the New Zealand manufacturer's new canning supplier and packaging, within two weeks Whole Health Pet started charging freight and their prices jumped up to $2.00 more average PER CAN (plus shipping), and $40 more PER BAG (plus shipping)!! I am not changing ZiwiPeak for my dogs, but I am buying elsewhere which has slightly lower price overall but with faster shipping. I feel I need to talk about the price, because while ZiwiPeak could be the best dog food ever, so many more dogs cannot have them because the price is simply beyond their owners' reach, not good.<br /><br />I hope Amazon Prime will pick up this line soon!!!

Each 11lb bag lasts us about 1.5 months.<br /><br />Yes - it is not a lot of weight, but its also not full of filler.  A lot of dogs eat 3x + what they need to because their food is so lacking in nutrients.  This is pure meat (which as a vegetarian is odd to write).  Our dogs love apples, bananas, and oranges - but love their lamb.<br /><br />Warning - we just moved and couldn't find Ziwipeak.  They wouldn't touch anything else we bought!  Seriously.  They are hooked. They love it.<br /><br />So we are huge fans!

review/summary: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the product AND the company behind it!
review/text: I wrote a REALLY long review regarding a different brand freeze dried dog food and now I'm wishing I hadn't because it probably makes this product seem not as good in comparison and nothing could be further from the truth!<br /><br />When I originally read all of the reviews about this product I was a bit skeptical but VERY hopeful (despite the cost)since so many reviewers said that this was the one food that their totally-picky dog would actually eat.<br /><br />When I first tried giving her a nibble while out on a walk she turned her nose up at it like she does with all new things. I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.<br /><br />(I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn't seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!<br /><br />She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it's literally the FIRST and only food I've been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.<br /><br />She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.<br /><br />It's understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw-only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren't that big to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can't say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their "trial size" is a good size bag!) It wasn't until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8-$10!<br /><br />Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn't able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.<br /><br />Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip-lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don't make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn't stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)<br /><br />To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!<br /><br />It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.<br /><br />Can't say enough good things about this food - if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn't be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn't the case.

review/text: My golden|yellow lab mix was adopted from the shelter with a number of health issues including severe malnutrition, a pretty bad skin condition, and chronic  inflammation of the feet and face.  We placed him on an elimination diet and found that he was allergic to chicken, turkey and beef.  I use the ZiwiPeak, fish and pork as the main sources of protein for his diet. He loves the venison over the other flavors and has put on 40 healthy pounds and his skin and allergy issues have pretty much been cleared-up.<br /><br />The food is not the hard dried fare, but small moist squares.  It offered a good option for a balanced meal and you cannot beat the convenience of the pouch.  I would recommend refrigeration after opening.

review/summary: Great substitute for raw diet, but expensive!
review/text: We have a 13 month old, 100+ pound Rottweiler who loves his Ziwipeak.  We started him on the raw diet a few months ago, and use ZiwiPeak for training treats and for regular meals.  It combines the benefits of a raw diet with the convenience of kibble.  Notable good points: great 'output' for a dog with a sensitive stomach, gleaming coat with significantly less dander, fresh breath, easy to feed, and good for times when feeding frozen raw is difficult (traveling, boarding, you've forgotten to defrost the raw...).<br /><br />I took away one star for the high cost.  HOWEVER, a portion of Ziwipeak goes a longer way than the same amount of kibble, and the cost is on par - or slightly less if you look around - than most frozen raw foods.

review/summary: Best thing on the market (without the mess)!
review/text: My puppy has been on way too many dog foods: Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and now ZiwiPeak. Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!

review/text: i've never met a dog who didn't devour this food with tail-wagging, tunnel-visioned gusto. it looks like tiny pieces of beef jerky and if you have a picky eater they'll probably be delighted with this food.  it's grain free and super expensive but worth it -- it has helped curb the awful gas of our 13 lb chihuahua/min-pin. as a bonus, his coat is shinier too. (now if we could just make his breath & body odor better).... the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price.

review/summary: every dog should eat this!
review/text: This dog food is absolutely wonderful.  If I could afford to, I would feed my dog only this.  My 2 year old Vizsla is the pickiest dog I've ever met (won't even eat most treats) and she can't get enough of this food.  Not only does she actually get excited about her meals, it has had marvelous effects on her digestion, even though she only gets this food about half the time.  Her stools are noticeably smaller and more solid (always a problem with her) and her usually bad flatulence is almost non-existent.  If you have a dog with any food sensitivities and have tried many different foods this will be the last food you will need to try.  My dog has never looked and acted healthier than she has on this food (and I have tried about 20 different brands).  You won't be disappointed, it is worth every penny!

review/summary: Venison Very High Quality Dry & Raw - No Grains
review/text: Have a miniature poodle and he is a very picky eater.  When we eat rib eye, leg of lamb etc that is what he wants too.  Well we love our dog but we were looking for a compromise that would not cost an arm and a leg. He just would not eat other dry dog foods and we were told feeding him canned food should be the exception and not the rule.<br /><br />This seems to be it. He likes this one the best.  But we are going to have to rotate it with other varieties. Because he just wont eat the same thing for any length of time.<br /><br />Definitely, he likes this one a whole lot. And we can feel good about the quality.  Also this supposedly keeps the amount of poo down to.

review/summary: Our Mini Schnauzer loves this!
review/text: If you had a lot of lamb in your life you'd be impressed with how "lammy" this dog food smells. Our little dog absolutely loves it too. Why wouldn't he?<br /><br />A hidden advantage of using this food is that you don't have to pick up much poo at all. Because this food is nearly twice as concentrated as kibble you'd only be picking up about half as much poo, which is a good benefit. Also, it takes up half as much space in your storage.<br /><br />An all around winner which more than makes up for the small premium in price.

review/summary: My Westie loves it!
review/text: I have a 6 year old westie that had the worst food allergies, her coat was very brittle, and she had low energy.  One walk and she'd be passed out.  As many of you on here, I take pride in my dog and pride that I want to take care of it the best that I am able to. I've tried blue buffalo and other high rated foods, but she would not eat them unless I "spiced" it up with something. It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.<br /><br />What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)<br /><br />For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet. For my dog she requires about 0.75 ounces or 3/4 of a scoop and that goes a long way for a 2.2 lb. bag.  So its not like I am buying this dog food every week.<br /><br />The only small negative is the dog food has a slight smell to it.  Nothing that will make you vomit but its not something I am used to smelling when giving her dog food.  For those wondering what the dog food looks like?  It's like small shredded pieces of dark jerky.<br /><br />Recommendation?  BUY

review/summary: The best food... EVER
review/text: I have three puppy mill rescue Pekingese and I have tried about every other high end dog food that I could think to try.  This is by far the best dog food that I have found to date.  One of my dogs has terrible food allergies and can't eat ANY other foods without getting a bad reaction.  Another one of my dogs previously had very bad tear staining, but when I asked around I heard various reasons why (I was told hard water- switched to deer park with no results) and after eating ziwipeak my dog's tear stains are GONE.  It's unreal.  Most importantly... they LOVE it!  Even when I walk past the bag, they go nuts.  Worth EVERY PENNY.

review/summary: ZiwiPeak Addict
review/text: My dog loves his ZP. He's primarily a ZP venison kind of guy due to allergies, but with trying to introduce new protein sources to him I've turned to the other varieties of ZP including the Venison and Fish and Lamb. Both were gobbled down without hesitation. Clearly he doesn't know that the food is good for him, or I suspect that he would be requiring it to be doused with canned food! But that is the wonderful thing about ZP - it is super high quality with no grains or fillers AND dogs love it. And my boy Titan looks better than he ever has; he's always been a strong dog, but on ZP he looks like he lifts weights. He's been on an exclusive ZP diet for about 4 or 5 months and his coat is shiny and velvety like a champion racehorse.<br /><br />Something to attest to the supreme flavor of this food: recently I was running low on ZP and so I had to supplement with some raw venison. I put down a bowl of raw venison for him while I was rationing out the ZP. He pushed the raw venison chunks around and then looked at me and gave me that familiar nod as if to say "you gonna give me some of that?" No raw venison for him. Titan wanted his ZP and nothing more.

review/summary: Excellent food for allergic pets
review/text: My dog, Lucy, suffers from a host of allergies.  Of the higher quality dog foods on the market, Ziwi Peak is the only one without carrots or barley (two foods she cannot have).  Lucy loves this food and her allergies are much better--there are no grains, fillers, colors, preservatives or vegetables (I can give her those separately from home).  Without Ziwi peak I would be making stuff at home.  This is convenient and well worth the price--I only wish I could find a local retailer so I wouldn't have to order online...

review/text: All three of my very picky eaters LOVED it! Being a vegetarian, I got tired of dealing with raw meat and mixing a bunch of stuff in it to make their meals balanced. With Ziwipeak, all the work has been done. Just scoop it out of the bag and into the dish and voila! A perfect and healthy meal. Happy dogs and happy me :-) I only wish it wasn't so expensive.

My dog is under six pounds of she doesn't require a lot of food.  I suspect this would be a very pricey food to give a large dog though!

review/summary: Tuffy Likes It!!!
review/text: Tuffy, my 7 lb Pomeranian, has been the pickiest eater these 12 years and I have spent many hours searching for organic/natural products for him. It's been very difficult to find food he likes, but he went right to the venison and I am elated!<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with air-dried products and was surprised how dense the pieces are. He's eating a little more than recommended, but that's okay with me, it's good stuff.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, not only because Tuffy likes it, but it is also a great value.

review/text: I agree that the price on this is a bit high, but our dog loves it and still goes crazy whenever it's meal time.  She didn't do well with many of the so-called organic products because they still contain a lot of low quality grains/starches.  Even better, there's less dog waste to clean up too because the product doesn't have useless fillers.

It is real meat, not the garbage meat and garbage meat by-products you get in most dog food that have to be processed for days on end to make them safe.<br />This stuff is the real deal and my dog LOVES it.

review/summary: Great raw food that dogs love...and grain free!!
review/text: We have loved ZiwiPeak for a few years now, when it was introduced to us by our local pet boutique.  (which is now out of business, unfortunately) It is available in venison, venison-fish, beef...and our dog loves all three, but due to past health issues we tend to stay with one of the 'venison' ones.  There is no odor, they look like little dried out beef jerky, but are not that hard.  They also have great treats.  It is a complete diet and it IS concentrated so feed only about 1/3 of what you would normally feed.  I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Pugs love ZiwiPeak!!!
review/text: A must have if you are looking for an alternative to a raw food diet.  Both of my pugs LOVE IT!  It is a little pricey, but you only use a tiny scoop for each portion for a small dog. WORD OF CAUTION: after using ZiwiPeak for several months, I noticed my dogs were gaining A LOT of weight.  You really have to stick to the manufacturers directions.  This is dehydrated food and a little goes a long way. I love too that they use ranch raised animals with no hormones or antibiotics or fresh fish not from farms.<br /><br />From the Raw Food Diet to ZiwiPeak:<br />After much research and debate with both my husband and my veterinarian, I decided to try a raw food diet.  Well, the raw meat was just nasty and my pug would go for several days without eating.  Proponents of the raw food diet say this is normal because the raw meat/bones took longer to digest, but truly, my dog just seemed ravenous.  Normally she was very polite when we ate, now she was begging and even jumping up trying to get food off of the table.  I just couldn't take any more.  Yes, her teeth were gorgeous and her digestion seemed better, but the poor dog seemed very unhappy with her food.  We tried to the frozen food that you thaw out and that worked okay for a while, a nice treat now and then...but then we found ZiwiPeak!

review/summary: Air Dried Venison Formula-Dogs Like It
review/text: I have been a raw feeder now for about a month. I've tried various high quality frozen and Freeze/Air-Dried dog food. I love ZiwiPeak's philosophy re quality and the ingredients seems to be top of the line. This is a nice idea for traveling with dogs who normally eat frozen raw (hard to go camping or car-tripping with frozen raw dog food). My Chow Chow first sniffed the food, walked away, then came back and ate it. My shih tzu walked away and left it (though she doesn't like dark meat generally - normally she eats fowl or rabbit - sometimes lamb). I am currently dog sitting for a poodle who will eat anything and he gobbled it right up. I may not purchase this product again simply because my dogs are really picky. But, I would purchase it if I had a dog like the poodle I am sitting for; as mentioned above, I feel this brand's ingredients are top of the line.
