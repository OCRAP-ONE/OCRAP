review/text: I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I didn't really drink tea, until about six months ago. I was drinking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HFA3XY">Honest Tea Half Tea & Half Lemonade 12 pack 16.9 oz. plastic bottles</a>  - I quickly grew tired of the cost, and disposing of so many plastic bottles.<br /><br />Making the switch to tea bags, I picked this tea at random from the local grocery store, expecting it would be one of many brands and types I would need to try before finding a favorite.  After trying a few others, this is definitely the one!<br /><br />If anyone has information on the quality of ingredients, EGCG levels, etc., please reply to this review.

review/summary: Green/white Stash tea
review/text: Every year, my grandmother would receive packages of tea from her relatives in Japan - she would pass a package or two to my mother - I loved the smell and taste when my mother would make a pot of tea with the tea - when my grandmother passed away, the tea packages stopped coming - so when I saw this Stash Premium green/white tea bags, I was excited - I decided to order it through the Subscribe & Save program and am happy I did - I'm cutting back on coffee and find this tea fills the need for a hot beverage in the morning

review/summary: This green tea is for me....
review/text: I would, by no means, consider myself a green tea expert, but, I definitely appreciate its place in my life, and as part of my morning breakfast ritual. I find that I feel the antioxidants percolate in my head. What's more, I actually am one of those weird people who like how bitter it tastes, when you've brewed it to its full potential. Stash Premium Green Tea does not fail to disappoint, in the antioxidant factor. What's more, there is a wonderful smoky quality, too. Stash has always produced a high quality line of teas, and this is another wonderful addition to their family of flavors and adventures in hot water......

review/summary: Just What I Wanted!
review/text: I was recently turned on to the health benefits of white tea, so I decided to try it out. Apparently, white tea doesn't have much flavor on it's own, which are why there are so many flavored whites. As a daily green tea drinker, I immediately thought this would be a good combo for me when I saw it. Stash is a very high-quality brand and you can tell by the taste of the tea. It has kind of a fresh, grassy (in a good way!) taste that is really distinct of high-quality teas. And now I can get the benefit of both green & white in the same cup. Yeah!

review/summary: On second thought...
review/text: One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I "brew" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~

review/summary: Delightfully healthy!
review/text: This tea is just so so so so so so so goooddddd!!! Can't have enough of it. Bought it last evening and had a cup of it and was raving all through the entire cup. Today, I had two cups and I felt like I wanted to have more. This tea has no sugar (read up its nutritional info on net). I am a mint lover and I love mint in everything. But here, the mint is not overpowering (as other reviewers say) but it has been given a good balance. I add half a tsp of Natural 'Sugar in the Raw' (it has only 2g of sugar) to give a lil' more sweetness to this tea, and its OUTSTANDING!!!!! Highly recommended. I am going to order the 6-pack version from Amazon soon after my current box empties itself.

review/summary: The fragrance is lovely, but it is too fermented to be good green tea.
review/text: The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.  I didn't like it at first, because it lacks the gentle subtlety of the blend of green and jasmine.  It's almost like an afternoon tea with jasmine added.  Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green.  However, when I want that delicate flavored, I look for something else, even the Bigelow (and I'm not a great Bigelow fan).

It is neither bitter or grassy tasting like a lot of other green teas that I've tried. I balked at buying a 6 pack, but now I'm glad I did since I'm down to the the last box and have not seen this blend at my grocery with the other Stash teas.

If you enjoy green tea, this is a must have.

I make it in an iced tea maker using a little less ice/water than the markings on the carafe, and I use 6 tea bags which produces just slightly less than 2 quarts.  When it is done brewing, pour it over ice and be sure to squeeze in a little lemon which rounds out the flavors - it makes it the perfect beverage.  The fact that it is healthy is just a bonus!!  (If you don't have an iced tea maker, it's a really worthwhile, inexpensive investment if you drink a lot of tea)

review/text: I've had to cut back on coffee, and my doctor suggested I try green tea.  I've tried many versions of green tea, and Stash Mangosteen is the most palatable I've found.  I know...it's not coffee, but it smells wonderful and tastes pleasant.

review/summary: Good tea blend. Not 'the best there is' but it's more than decent
review/text: The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this line of teas, you are just a tiny little bit above the average 'value' curve. The Stash Premium teas are not my 'number one' white teas but they are a solid 'number two'. The kind I drink almost like I drink water, several cups a day.<br /><br />I drink the Green-White (this one) and the 'all-white' versions alternatively for a little variation. They are both good and this combination reminds me that I used to be an all-green tea drinker until some 2-3 years ago when I switched to all-white. Now... I'm in a more moderate mood :)<br /><br />Oh, I subscribed for one box delivered every other month. This takes another 15% of the price and you get free shipping even when you are under the $25 limit. And you can cancel any time.

review/summary: Best Tea Ever!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this tea.  I am a huge iced tea drinker (more than a quart a day).  I have tried lots of different brands over the years and gradually gotten into lighter and lighter tasting teas.  For many years my tea of choice was darjeeling, which is the cadillac of teas; very light and refreshing.  Then one day I sampled this green and white combination and WOW.  It is light, refreshing, and since it is green, also good for me!  I've been hooked every since.  I even bought special mugs (16 ounces) so I can drink a decent amount and not have to refill so often.  Occasionally I see it in the grocery store but they can't keep it in stock (so the word must be out how wonderful this tea is!).  I now get my fix through Amazon's service where they send 6 boxes every other month.  I don't have to worry about 'when' the grocery is going to get their next shipment anymore.  So if you enjoy a light tea give this one a try.  I am sure you will be very, very pleased at the refreshing taste.

review/text: I recently dropped coffee for tea. I bought some Moroccan mint to compliment my Stash double bergamot. The Moroccan mint wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It tastes almost exactly like spearmint. It isn't very strong either. I guess I like super strong teas (being a black coffee drinker). Either way, it is a great tea. Definitely recommend it.

review/text: I really wanted to like this tea because it is full of antioxidants. I was hoping for a fruity flavor, but instead it tastes just like cough syrup. I do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child, so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine, I can not drink it. I tried to drink it anyways, thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti-oxidants outweigh the flavor, but I just couldn't do it! Well, that is just my 2 cents. If anyone else has tried this and agrees with me, let me know!

I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time, then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried.

review/summary: Stash Premium Green - The Best Of The Best
review/text: After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!

review/text: I've been hooked on NOW's spearmint tea for awhile, and when that was unavailable for a time, I found this. I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6.

review/text: Both my best friend and I LOVE this tea.  Embarrassingly, we are quasi-tea snobs each in our own way.  We have tried all forms, brands, etc including the very pricey varieties, and we agreed that for a white/green blend this is perfect.  It is not too mild or smooth, nor is it too astringent or bitter.  It is a nice golden color with a tempting, soothing aroma.  It has good mouth feel - light but not too light.  It is very good plain or with some honey.<br />It contains white, green blend (Chinese, Japanese, Darjeeling and Assam from India, and organic green from Sri Lanka).  It is really a very nice tea.  Please note that of the teas that are blended into each sachet, only one is organic.

I immediately knew that I would soon regret doing so when I opened the first tea packet-the smell! Like a stagnant swamp! To make matters worse, it taste like what I would imagine swamp water would taste like. Honey doesn't do much to improve upon the flavor, either. Perhaps this is what people mean when they describe a green tea as "grassy"? At any rate, I won't be revisiting this one.

review/summary: Excellent flavor...the best I have tried
review/text: Since I drink between eight and ten cups of green tea a day, I am very fussy about the taste.  It must be pure green tea, I don't care for added flavors.  I LOVE this tea. Recently, I ordered green tea in a restaurant and was served Bigelow, which is a good brand.  I put the Bigelow tea bag in the cup of hot water and then took a Stash green tea bag out of my purse and put it into the glass decanter of hot water.  This was a good comparison...the Bigelow tea was brownish in color, the Stash tea a beautiful, clear GREEN.  My husband commented, "that is why it is called green tea!"

review/summary: My favorite Green Tea
review/text: I used to drive to an out of the way grocery store for Stash Moroccan Mint.  When they stopped carrying it I  was so upset!  It did a hard core internet search and finally found out I could order from Amazon in bulk.  Yay! I drink green tea for the health benefits, and have been drinking various kinds for about ten years now.  Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha! One more thing, I replaced green tea with coffee and it was not a difficult switch.  If I can do it, you can too!

review/summary: Stash fails splendidly this time.
review/text: The flavors you immediately notice after the first sip of this tea, are hisbiscus flowers and chamoile. The Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors and the green tea are all buried and very faint! If you are looking for a tea to wind down your hectic life, this is not a bad tea at all. If you are looking for an excellent blend of Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors in green tea, you maybe be very disappointed like I do.

review/summary: Still a cinnamon tea, but not as overpowering as in Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea
review/text: This is a very pleasant green tea. The cinnamon is fairly dominant but counterbalanced quite well by the green tea flavor, even though Stash did use cinnamon oil.<br /><br />I was a little scared about the cinnamon after my unpleasant experience with Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea, which was ruined by too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />After I use up these six boxes I do not know if I will purchase anymore Stash tea.<br /><br />Stash needs to hold off on using the spice oils (especially the cinnamon), even though it isn't so offensive in this particular tea, they could still tone it down a bit more.

Will last me a year or more while I continue to try out loose blends.

Because it is green tea, it does not stain your teeth as regular black tea does.  I drink this nearly every morning sweetened with honey and it is wonderful.

review/summary: Very nice green tea blend, fine flavor, great value
review/text: ****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its caffeine effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas.  White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the bulk packaging of six tea boxes, for an incredible Amazon price break!<br /><br />****

review/summary: Very good for what it is
review/text: We've been "product testing" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama "Sushi Bar" tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea "taste" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. "Sushi Bar"-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.<br /><br />As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However, it's idiot-proof and, like the title alludes to, this is teabag tea and for that, the Stash is very good stuff.

review/summary: overpowering lemon grass
review/text: This tea sounded great. I lived in the middle east and love the real moroccan mint tea. The real tea includes spearmint and green tea only. Honey is typically added. In this case all you can taste is lemon grass and the only hint of mint is peppermint, not spearmint. I really regret buying a whole case of this stuff. I would highly recommend buying Twinnings green tea with mint. It doesn't have "Moroccan mint" as a title, but it is a lot closer to the original namesake. Stash has a little bit of false advertising going on here. It should really be called lemon grass green tea with a picture of lemon grass on the box. It is anything but Moroccan.

review/summary: Soft, Lovely Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea has a fragrant bouquet, and an unusual taste that comes from the blend of red tea and white tea. The red tea taste is more dominant, the white tea taste subtle. I have to say that I like the red and white blend more than the red alone. I still probably prefer white tea more, but this blend is lovely, and lower in caffeine (the red tea has no caffeine, the white tea a bit). This tea contains only South African rooibos (another word for red tea) and white tea.<br /><br />The package says that it contains a hint of sweetness, and I'd agree, although the taste is very hard to describe (if you've had red tea before then you understand). The package also says that this tea is full of "potent antioxidants", which of course is very healthy.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea unless you do not care for rooibos or white tea; otherwise you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Very tasty - Could it also help me lose weight?
review/text: I got this after reading about a study that said four cups of white tea a day - and no other changes to diet or exercise - could result in 4 to 8 lbs of weight loss in a year, and would actually reduce the number of fat cells in a person's body!  The study suggested that green tea was also good for weight loss, but not as good as white.  (http://www.naturalnews.com/026220.html is one article about the study, but Google it and you'll find lots."<br /><br />So?  I split the difference and got both.<br /><br />For those that think that four cups of tea is a lot?  You're right.  But this tea is mild enough, and tasty enough, that I've been doing it for over a week and haven't gotten sick of it yet.  We'll see if that keeps up!

review/text: The trouble with many mint teas is that the minty flavoring overpowers the underlying tea leaves. Too often, mint is used to make inferior tea taste palatable. Stash's Mint Green Tea is different. It has a rich and well-rounded flavor, which I prefer to that of their flowery plain green tea. And the price is quite reasonable for such a refreshing beverage, especially if you use Amazon's Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />As the weather warms up, this versatile tea is well-suited to both hot and iced brewing. I would recommend it over any other bagged tea.

review/summary: Wonderful mix of green tea and chai flavor
review/text: I like drinking green tea for the health benefits, but I find that many are either boring-tasting or bitter, especially without the addition of added sugar.  Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.  Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!
