review/summary: Works well for certain things...
review/text: This flour works fine for certain things, depending on your taste preferences. It has a very strong aftertaste (kind of bitter/sour) because of the bean flour. Thus it is pretty strong in plain breads and rolls. If you don't mind that, then good for you! (My husband is pretty sensitive and can't tolerate the bean flour or taste very well.) I found it works better in cookies, chocolate or spice cakes, brownies, banana bread, and pizza dough. Because these baked goods are made with other strong flavors, they help mellow out the bean taste which can be pretty overpowering if you don't have something with which to temper it. I like the consistency of this flour better than the rice flour blend I've also been using but again, consider your taste preferences and what you'll be baking/cooking with it.

review/summary: Good for gluten-free pizza
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KEPBCS">Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour, 44-Ounce Units (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />This flour finally restored the basic right to eat pizza in my gluten-free household.  Whisk together one cup of warm water (90-100 degrees F), 1 teaspoon of yeast, 1 1/2 cups of this flour and a dollop of olive oil.  Turn your oven on for a few minutes, pour the batter into an oiled skillet and let it rise in the warmed oven for an hour.  Bake just the crust at 375 for 10 minutes.  Then spread the cheese or other toppings on the crust and return to the oven until the cheese is bubbly and browning.  Serve the pizza and pass the tomato sauce!  (Don't bake the pizza with tomato sauce - the crust can't keep liquid from penetrating - that's gluten's job.

review/summary: Great Substitute
review/text: I love this flour. I love to bake, so being on a gluten-free diet is not easy. But I use this flour for all of my baking. If the recipe has under 2 cups of flour, I usually use this flour as a straight substitution- and no one knows the difference. This has helped me make everything...cheesecakes, tortes, pies, even for breading chicken. So happy baking!

review/summary: Bizarre Aftertaste
review/text: Tried the gluten-free mix in apple muffins sweetened with applesauce and agave nectar.  Awful. Had to throw them out, but I figured it might have been the baking powder that lent this strange, bitter/sour aftertaste.  Then I tried it to make a roux for a chicken-broth-based cream sauce - and I had to throw that out too.  The aftertaste is highly unpleasant and I don't see how anyone gets past it.  I'm very happy with Bob's Gluten-Free Pancake Mix, so this was a surprise.

review/summary: THE BEST mix out there
review/text: This mix is a life saver.  I know a few people have not given it good reviews. but you owe it to yourself to try it.  When making light tasting cookies like sugar cookies, I mix it half and half with tapioca flour or some other light mix, because it can over power super light recipes, but It makes even great pancakes, bread, cake...you name it.  You can substitute it cup for cup with almost any recipe.  Just add a heaping teaspooon of xantham gum and go for it.  I'm telling you...It's awesome.

review/summary: Too much bean flour
review/text: I have only been recently diagnosed gluten intolerant (about six months).  I have learned very quickly that opinion on taste is extremely subjective when it comes to gluten free items.  What one person raves about another person will discard rather than eat.<br /><br />I tried this because others have given it good reviews.  In my opinion and my daughter's it is too grainy and has too much bean flour in it.  The bean flavor is too strong.  I am using the left over product to mix in with other flours.  I much prefer Pamela's product.

review/summary: Good nutritious sub for wheat flour
review/text: I really like this product since I do alot of gluten-free baking for myself and my daughter and this replaces pretty much cup-for cup with wheat flour without too much finetuning.  I've had success with most recipes I've tried although I do make sure to add extra egg replacer or xantham gum to help with the "stretchiness" important in many baking endeavors.  The only down-side to this product ironically enough, is the bean flour in the mix, while it adds much of the good protein and fiber that are lost with many GF flours, it also adds a slightly weird flavor that is hard to describe to whatever it is you are baking.  It is easy to get used to and we have adjusted.

review/summary: Caution: Strong Garbanzo Bean Flavor!
review/text: If you like garbanzo beans, you will like the flour. If not, try to find a flour without this ingredient. It tends to overpower some baked foods. For example, cookie dough made with this tastes awful; when you bake the cookies, they are almost tolerable. Sorry, since I love the other products by this company, but this one isnt on my reorder list.

review/summary: Life just got easier
review/text: I've been Gluten Free for over a year now.<br />At first, I worried about the prices of all the gluten free foods out there, then I realized that I could eat healthy and Gluten Free without buying *any* expensive, weird tasting, difficult to find GF foods.<br /><br />But I have to admit, after a while you get tired of potatoes, rice , and cornmeal and long for a nice satisfying biscuit !<br /><br />Well, I tried a few 'tried and true' recipes on web sites that called for several different GF 'flours' to be blended together , and never quite managed something that tasted right.<br />Then a friend surpised me by baking GF lemon bars using this flour.<br />They were FABULOUS! Guests at the party could not tell the difference bewteen these and her regular recipe.<br /><br />I said what the heck, and bought some myself, and the first thing I made was biscuits. They're great! Even my husband liked them, and he's very picky.<br />I was worried when I read all the comments about an after taste , but I have a couple of suggestions.<br /><br />First, be very sure that your Xanthan Gum and baking soda/ powders are fresh.<br />Any of these can and will add a very bitter taste if they've gone slightly off.<br />Second - I used the biscuit recipe from the Bob's Red Mill site.<br /><br />All I can say is don't be discouraged by the negative comments - this is great stuff!

review/text: I agree with the reviewers that this flour gives baked goods a bizarre, unpleasant beany aftertaste. I thought that I had accidentally used an old package, but the exp date is not until next year. I was looking forward to trying a new g-f cookie recipe, and it is very irritating to have to throw these away and to waste the time, energy and ingredients. I tossed the rest of the package. I would advise that you experiment before investing in a 4-pack of this flour mix.

review/text: I enjoyed this product.  I am trying to use more gluten-free products when ever I can.  I had made this with Gluten-free flour, water, italian seasoning, salt.  Which I then dropped onto a greased cookie sheet - I spread the drops out (thinned them out) cooked them at 425^ for approx 10 or so min, flipped them, cooked them a few min longer - it made like a cracker.  My husband even enjoyed them.<br />From the other reviews - I did notice the "flavor" that was mentioned, but if you add spices or seasonings then it is not noticeable.

review/summary: My go to pre mixed flour...
review/text: I used this flour regularly these days.. When my son was diagnosed with Celiac and myself with lifelong Gluten Intolerance I learned to mix flours pretty quickly. But mixing flours and keeping them fresh is a difficult task with a 5 1/2 year child under the autism umbrella. Initially, the bean flavor of the flour was not my favorite.. But, I have learned to use it under so many applications it is hardly noticeable... I have written down some of my recipes using Bob's All Purpose Gluten Free Flour mix here.. [...] I use Bob's for my Pumpkin and Morning Muffins as well as Vegan Bread..<br />My son and I are Gluten/Wheat, Dairy, Casein, Soy, Corn and Egg free at this point. So, It is very nice to have a mix that is nutritious and readily available with all the from scratch cooking I have to do..

review/text: With so many friends either allergic to or giving up wheat, I had a hard time finding all purpose wheat-free flour that tasted like flour (or simply not 'wrong').  On a whim I bought Bob's Red Mill and was really pleasantly surprised. It's good in muffin recipes and for breading, but I haven't baked anything sweet, like cake, with it yet.<br /><br />You need to be prepared for the volume, though - 4 bags! Makes great surprise gifts to your stay-away-from-wheat friends.

review/summary: Works well, good value
review/text: I always like to have a bunch of this stuff on hand as it is a good substitute for regular flour in most recipes.  I've used this flour for oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies, as well as pies and many other dishes where you don't even notice the flavor at all.  Where is isn't so great is for cookies such as shortbread where the flavor of the cookies rely heavily on the flavor of the flour.  This product in general seems to get a lot of complaints but if you are unable to eat gluten this product is a fantastic option for a gluten free all purpose flour.  I have tried making many of my own flour mixes (I have a pantry shelf dedicated to different gluten free flours) and haven't found one that works as consistently as this one as a flour substitute.  This product is packaged very well (it comes in a Bob's Red Mill box inside of an Amazon box) and arrived quickly.  With subscribe and save it is a great value as compared to buying it in most stores!

review/text: I've tried a few other wheat flour replacements but this one is the best so far. It's a little on the crumbly side for buscuits but when mixed half and half with quinoa flour it has better texture. Still somewhat crumbly though. Don't forget to add Xanthum Gum to this flour, I've tried the mixes that have XG in it but found them too salty tasting. I'm still experimenting to make them hold together better, there are so many other wheat flour alternatives out there to try...

review/summary: Made tasty banana bread even hubby liked!
review/text: I used this for the first time, the other day, to make banana bread.  I had a favorite recipe and just substituted this Bob's GF flour.  The recipe called for 2 cups of flour, so I used 1 3/4 cups of this product and 1/4 cup of Hazelnut flour(ground hazelnut).  As I was mixing it, I did notice it smelled a little odd--a smell I didn't care for.  From reading some other reviews, I'm guessing it's the bean flour.  But I stuck to the recipe, adding sour cream, cinnamon, natural vanilla extract, etc.  Baked it.  When it was cool, I was a little nervous, but when I tasted it, I thought it tasted great.  My mom thought it was delicious and wanted to take some home, even my fast-food loving husband said it was really good and "doesn't taste gluten free."  Not that he's really had any gluten free baked goods.<br /><br />The texture was good.  It didn't rise as much as regular flour, so no spilling in the oven.  Baking time took longer than my original recipe.  Small muffins took about 30 minutes and the glass loaf pan took over an hour.  But on both the texture was good, moist(though a bit more crumbly) and no odd taste or smell in the finished product(despite the smell noticed when I was mixing the batter).  I think I prefer the muffins because they were done sooner and, thus, less brown on top.  Then I just pop them into the toaster oven the next day and they're like fresh baked.<br /><br />I really liked the result for sweets with this product!

review/text: The bottom shelf of my refrigerator is full of different flours.  Sometimes when I think about baking something, I don't because it is a hassle to pull out so many different flours.  Bob's Red Mill gluten-free flour makes it easier because it is pre-mixed.  I have used it in my regular pancake recipe--just added a little xanthan gum.  I have been satisfied with it in other recipes I have tried.  However, because it has bean flour, I would avoid eating the raw dough.

review/summary: The best thing in the world for my son!
review/text: My son is allergic to wheat, corn, oats and rice. It is soooo hard to find anything that is Gluten Free and does not contain rice. So I was ecstatic to find this and immediately went home and made peanut butter cookies. They turned out great. I admit they have a bit of an aftertaste but it did not deter me from eating four cookies. My son loved them, and he is very picky. Even my daughter loved them and she can have regular grains. The recipes on the [...] website were very helpful too.

review/summary: barf... very nasty "bean-y" aftertaste!!!!
review/text: This is very gross tasting! I made cookies with this as the only substitute in my normal recipe (trying to make them more healthy), and they looked perfect, and the texture wasn't too bad (a little crumbly, maybe I should have added an extra egg or added a little more xantham gum), BUT the aftertaste made them just about inedible to me. My boyfriend thought they were ok (not great, but ok), but I think he was just being nice. I baked a small test batch and threw the rest of the dough out, they were that nasty.<br /><br />Some people seem to love it, based on these reviews here. I'm trying to go all gluten-free for health reasons, but I'll keep searching for a good all-purpose flour mix that's gluten-free and doesn't taste like beans for when we want the occasional baked treat. I think Pamela's is made without the beans. This particular mix is not a winner in my opinion.

review/summary: It's all about the beans...
review/text: I used it in my 'regular recipes and it has the best texture in the finished product by far. Neither did we find the flavor to be obnoxious as some people have written about. However, I have discovered an  allergy to the garbanzo bean flour which is the first ingredient listed. If you have a soy allergy you may want to consider this when you try since soy beans are related to garbanzo beans. I have abdominal issues, head aches and joint pain and swelling when I use this product.

review/summary: Do you like Beans?
review/text: Bob's flour is one of the first mixed GF flours that I tried.  The only problem is that everything I put it into, ended up tasting like beans or lentils.  I tried to thicken soups, tasted like beans...tried to make cake, tasted like beans.  I seriously thought I had some sort of taste bud problem.  I always cut the bag open and poured it into a container, so I couldn't check the ingredient label.  In desperation, I went to the supermarket and looked at the bag.  Sure enough, Bob mixes "GARBANZO BEAN FLOUR" into this mix.  So caution, if you like bean-tasting food, then this is the best flour for you!!  Instead, I'd highly recommend Gluten-Free Pantry's Beth's Flour mix.  It's amazing in both texture and taste, and works as a substitute for any recipe that calls for flour.

review/summary: How to improve upon the flavour:
review/text: (BRM = Bob's Red Mill)<br /><br />The noxious chemical aftertaste of this flour is due to the inclusion of BRM tapioca flour. I'm not sure why BRM tapioca has that difficult-to-accept flavour, but I cannot bring myself to consume it.<br /><br />BRM tapioca is terrible. I have found very good tapioca flour imported from Asian countries, usually packaged in white/green paper packets and available in the import sections of most large stores such as Overwaitea and Superstore. The cost is also less than 25% of that of BRM tapioca.<br /><br />However, BRM potato starch is excellent, and indispensable in gluten-free baking.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VLVCGU">Bob's Red Mill Potato Starch, 24-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />As an alternative to this flour mix, I make the following excellent gluten/corn-free baking flour mix. I make a big jar and use it for nearly everything I bake. We are also egg, bean and soy-free, and this mix works well with the foods we bake:<br /><br />1/2 brown or white rice flour<br />1/4 Asian tapioca starch/flour<br />1/4 Bob's Red Mill potato starch<br /><br />*As a kindness to BRM, I should point out that they also produce a delicious "sweet white sorghum flour" with a great recipe for scones on the back. This is absolutely worth purchasing, just for the excellent scones. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VLVM88">Bob's Red Mill Gf Sweet White Sorghum Flour, 22-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Excellent All-purpose flour!
review/text: I love this mix and I've created many of my own flour mixes. Except for some instances where a different flour mix would be more suitable (gluten free recipes involving flour can be very particular for what works and what doesn't), I have found this to out perform any other mix. I use it mostly for my pancakes (which are excellent and I feed them to gluten eaters and they have no idea), ordinary baking, cookies (chocolate chip and other sturdy cookies...lighter and finer tasting cookies would likely require a starchier mix and I would recommend reading Living Without magazine for flour mix ideas), sauces like stroganoff, and soups. I am also dairy and meat free so I am an old hand at substitutions and replacements.

review/summary: Still Searching
review/text: I am new to gluten-free and tried this mix out of convenience.  I've only made biscuits with it and I wasn't that impressed.  I had been using another one of Bob's gluten-free biscuit mixes and after a few months became disenchanted with the taste (and after-taste).  I was hoping this baking mix would taste different, but it was the same.  Still, a hot biscuit out of the oven with enough butter and honey to cover the garbanzo bean taste was sure nice after being off all gluten products!  It's worth a try as everyone's pallet is different, but this mix definitely has a distinct flavor.  I'm still searching for a good mix or might attempt to come up with my own.  It's definitely a process.

review/summary: nasty aftertaste; don't buy it
review/text: This is the first gluten free flour I tried, and I foolishly bought flour, and some different muffin and cookie mixes of the same brand. I ended up thowing most of it in the trash. Its aftertaste is extremely off-putting.  I've heard theories about what causes the nasty taste in this flour, but am not interested in any explanations, since I have no intention of rationalizing the bad taste and forcing myself to eat it anyway.<br /><br />Since then, I've tried some gluten free products that are not bad and taste fine, so I don't see any reason to ever buy Bob's baking mixes of any kind.  They should do something about their blend if they want to stay competitively in the business.  I would give it fewer than one stars if that were an option.

review/text: Recently started a gluten free diet.  Have to say, I was hoping for a lot more from something that claimed "all-purpose" .  First use was in pancakes.  Now, I like garbanzo beans, but the garbanzo/fava bean flour in here was overpowering in it's taste.  Sorghum or rice flour w white/bean flour is much closer to what I'd consider as "all-purpose" to get a good protein content.

review/summary: Gluten Free Flour from Bob's Red Mill
review/text: As other reviewers have said, this works well for certain things, but not everything.  I think in quickbreads and some cookies, it's fine, but if there aren't a lot of other flavors going on in whatever you are baking, you are going to taste the bean flour.  I guess you have to work at it quite a bit.  The banana bread recipe on the back of the bag is very good, though I used spectrum shortening instead of oil (I recommend that).  As long as you aren't expecting this to just "replace" flour in your favorite recipes, you're fine.  One disappointment ; no xanthan gum added, so you always have to keep that in mind and add to each recipe you make.

review/summary: Tastes too "Beany"
review/text: I am fairly  new to gluten-free baking. Since mixing a good gluten-free flour mix is still hit and miss for me, I decided to give this all-purpose mix a try. Even though it bakes quite well, the taste is way too strong, and nothing that I associate with cookie or cake taste. It leaves a bitter, "beany" aftertaste that neither me nor my son could get over. We used the flour to make christmas cookies, and unfortunately, the whole batch ended up in the trash because nobody liked them.<br /><br />I'm probably going to try to use the rest of the flour in a savory pastry in the hope that the bean flavor will not be so distracting and actually blend in. Otherwise, I will continue my own mixes, and will continue to look for a good-tasting pre-blend.

review/summary: These Sardines are delicious!
review/text: I have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack.  I know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but I've never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea. And they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with Omega 3's too so it's as good for you as are the sardines.  However, I am not so sure about their actual mercury levels.  Buying them from Amazon with their $10. off sale on $49. purchases is a great price.  I've even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as Costco and BJ's NO longer carry this product.  Or their price has skyrocketed.  It's great to be able to stock pile them from Amazon.  If you like sardines, you'll love these! And they are just so nutritious for us all.

review/summary: Same as TJs
review/text: My husband eats these sardines, usually a can a day.  He had wanted better Omega 3s to help his blood pressure, but had generally found sardines to be "fishy".  He wanted something he could tolerate eating regularly and did a lot of research online.  He found that Trader Joe's Moroccon sardines got rave reviews.  So we started to buy out our local TJs of their stock every couple of weeks.  He commented once that he thinks his mind is clearer these days.  Don't know if it's helping with his blood pressure though.  I did taste them, and the taste reminds me of tuna.  My 2 year old daughter loves helping her daddy eat these.  I looked here on Amazon and found this listing, and read the reviews.  They were similar to the reviews for TJs.  I ordered a box, because we seem to run out of TJs before we can get more.  Hubby tried them and says there seems to be no difference in taste.  These are slightly more expensive than TJs if you just order just one box, but the price is better than TJs if you do the subscription.<br /><br />Update 9/29/10:  My husband just went in for his bloodwork, and everything looks good - triglycerides, cholesterol, etc.  He's even no longer pre-diabetic.  Not sure how much of this is from eating a can of these a day, but I'm sure it's helping.  He even says his mind works better since he started eating these.

review/text: I was never into Sardines but lately I've been trying to eat healthier food options and get tired of eating Tuna in a can.  I thought I'd try Sardines.  Well I tried the cheaper ones first unknowingly. The brand was Beach Cliff.  They were not very good, small sardines with skin and other parts and tasted like salty, stinky, fishy - fish.  LOL.  I did research and found out about Crown Prince.  I saw that Wal-Mart had them from the reviews cheaper--so I went to Wally World and got some.  Yes.  They are cheaper.  I paid $1.73 a can.  At any rate.  The flavor is great.  They are big meaty sardines that are in a great flavored olive oil.  The sardines had a great fish taste similar to canned tuna but gives you a nice change.  Goes great with crackers, bread or even just by themselves.  I highly recommend them to anyone.  Even if you don't like Sardines you will LOVE these!

review/text: In a city like San Francisco, you'd think these would be easy to obtain.  I used to buy these at Trader Joe's but they've stopped selling them. After going through a panicky search through all the stores I normally frequent, I was glad to find it on Amazon. I prefer Crown Prince skinless boneless sardines in olive oil to the Reese brand because the Reese sardines are drier, although Reese's are prettier in the can with 6 small sardines packed as if they were swimming in a school. The Crown Prince sardines are larger (3 to a can). For me, sardines are a comfort food -- my favorite way to eat them is after removing the lid and pouring off some of the olive oil, filling the void with soy sauce and heating (can and all) on the stove. Because sardines are not large predator fish, they are not known to contain harmful levels of mercury.

review/summary: Impressed and surprised, herring sized, not sardines
review/text: I've had a fair amount of sardines from around the world and knowing these were not petite two layer Bristling, I was cautious but at the bargain price of about $1.78 a can at Walmart I had to give these a try.  Crown Prince is a reasonably good processor and have been happy with their small Bristling tins packed with about 20 delectable fishies with tails, skin, soft bones and all.  Those are true sardines from Scandinavian waters.  Problem is they are spendy as heck and RICH RICH in flavor.  I can eat about 5 of them at a sitting as they are so rich, some may call this fishy flavor/smell...<br /><br />These Morocco caught fish are much larger and filleted with no skin/scale or tail. Approximately 3 large fillets per tin in a light olive oil. To call them sardines is really a stretch as these are simply small herring.  To be called sardines they need to be small enough to be PACKED IN tight like sardines (at least 10 fish per can) 3 pilchard herring fillets does not make a tin of sardines.  Regardless of the naming error these are FANTASTIC herring!<br /><br />Wonderful taste, mild, perfectly cooked and firm texture. Not smoked like many sardines. As some have mentioned these are dryer in tongue feel than other brands, very similar to tuna.  I can easily eat a whole can in one sitting and while packed in oil they seem much lighter to the palette than typical bone in small sardines.  Remember Walmart has these for less than $2 a tin and well worth it.

review/summary: excellent sardines
review/text: Crown Prince, Natural Sea and one other brand which seems to be no longer available are far and above the best skinless/boneless sardines available at a reasonable price. I have not tried any of the brands that are horrendously expensive.<br /><br />These sardines in olive oil are delicious eaten right out of the can with a little freshly squeezed lemon juice and salt.  They also make a fantastic pate when mashed (oil and all) - and combined with goat cheese (or cow cream cheese), lemon juice, a few drops of liquid smoke, some finely chopped sweet onion and finely chopped roasted red peppers.<br /><br />Try them.  I think you'll agree that they are excellent.

review/summary: So Good
review/text: These sardines make eating sardines enjoyable as well getting all the omega-3s you could ever need or want and it is noticebly different than the cheaper brands that have less appealing consistency and taste a lot more 'fishy' - a part of this is because the skinless and boneless product is much easier to eat if you don't love over fishy smells and tastes.

review/summary: Best Sardines Ever
review/text: These sardines are absolutely delicious, and being skinless and boneless makes them convenient.  No skin to remove and no need to remove the bones or put up with that disconcerting crunch of sardine bones.<br /><br />Another nice aspect of these sardines is that they are moist. You would think that all sardines packed in olive oil would be moist, but not so.  Some have a dry texture, but not these.  They are just fabulous.

review/summary: try, try, again....
review/text: I ordered a case of sardines through Amazon Grocery last month and they didn't travel well, the box arrived soaked in oil. 4 cans had popped open and seeped fishy oil all over the rest of my order. Upon inspection I could see that the design of the seals on the cans and the way that they were packed in their box made it a simple matter to pop the seals, and any bump in transit could do it. Sardines are not returnable items. Imagine the mess of shipping them back? Amazon handled my complaint in excellent fashion regardless.<br /><br />So, I thought that I had better try it again. I ordered a totally different kind-same brand. These sardines are not quite as tasty as the others but they are quite acceptable. My cats like them and most essential: they arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />That being said, if you don't have Amazon Prime shipping you might consider getting it. It pays for itself quite quickly and it is SO darned convenient. I live in the country and I work at home. It's a pain to go to town to shop for groceries, books, music, whatever. Amazon provides so many products I need. Amazon Prime gets them to me quickly and usually, painlessly (those leaky sardines were my only problem among dozens of shipments).<br /><br />Amazon does a tremendous job! I'm one happy customer.

The flavor and fragrance are mild and almost sweet. I find them heavenly. It certainly does not taste like water; perhaps the reviewer who said that is a coffee drinker (I am not).<br /><br />I tend to try out a lot of Darjeelings, I would say this one is fairly similar to a Twinings, but slightly milder and sweeter. In any case, if you're someone who enjoys trying out different teas, it's worth a go.

review/text: First off, I usually don't write reviews on amazon but given that I feel so strongly I need to warn others. I'm an avid tea drinker and am always looking for new varieties/brands to try. I picked up this one at a local store as it was on sale and looked appetizing. It's advertised as "Organic" and "Premium" in a cute, presentable packaging. To put it bluntly, this is one of the worst teas I've tried in a long time. It's tasteless no matter how long you brew it. There's no aroma to it and it tastes like water. I've checked the expiration and it's got a good 2 years to go so it's not due to prolonged storage. Whatever it is, this tea is worthless and it might be organic but it sure isn't quality.

review/summary: Worth the slight trial to gobble these down...  ;)
review/text: Purchased through a subscription, since I'm a seafood fanatic and I believe the Roland brand to be rather reliable and consistent in its variety, quality, and price points for comparison.  The package arrived in two days; excellent!  There were two orders of 3 cans in this box (total of 6 cans), which was correct.<br /><br />However, three cans were in their original packaging: a flimsy but sealed plastic bag with a lot of room inside; the other three were loose and obviously slid around quite a lot.  Why were those three taken out of their bag?  Furthermore, I'm not prone to exaggeration, and take the blunt approach: every single can was horribly dented and scraped up, rendering the product inside untrustworthy (we know it's not entirely safe to eat food from a bashed-up can, right?!).  Why?  There was zero cushioning and a ton of room inside.  It should go without saying that loose metal cans containing food will bang hard into each other in transit, so some padding would be necessary... but it didn't exist here.  This was my first problem with anything ordered via Amazon.com, and thankfully it was handled expeditiously with a replacement order since I cannot return it to show how poor a packaging job was done ("Thank you" to a rep named Joy; a sweet individual who was more than accomodating when I quietly explained what happened and asked what can be done; kudos and positive feedback was written about her in Amazon's survey after she handled the order replacement and sent a confirmation email).<br /><br />Nonetheless, I will not allow this to tarnish my use of Amazon.com in the future, and will consider it a one-off.  Perhaps I will write an actual review of the product itself once I receive the next batch.<br /><br />Update, 9/11/10: Second (replacement) shipment arrived. Packaging was apparently from a different location and done better: cans were arranged in a more fitting box so there was less "wiggle room," and a plastic cushion bag was laid across them.  Cans were hardly dented.  About the product itself: the 15-oz. weight is INCLUDING the water in which the mussels are packed; otherwise, it's around the 9-oz. the label states.  The mussels are little ones, and already cooked.  They're soft and fairly firm, not very chewy at all, lightly salted, have a light odor (less so once the water is dumped and the mussels washed), good light green color, and taste appropriately.  While I wouldn't eat many of these as an appetizer (which the label suggests), I've already prepared a seafood soup using them and a curried rice dish... both with excellent results.  Because they're already basically prepared, cooking time was nicely reduced.  I highly recommend these as a trustworthy ingredient!<br /><br />Update, 1/29/11: Second order placed for this product under a subscription and using an extra 15% Roland product discount (nice incentive!).  Same issue as the first.  Can't fault the product, but I'm confused because shipping these cans requires additional packaging to prevent them from crashing together.  While I hate to knock Amazon in general, I must say that I'm disappointed that I have to trouble them with another phone call because the shipping facility couldn't figure out that adding more than just one deflated and flimsy plastic bag will prevent collisions in transit (odd, since the wonderfully packaged replacement shipment I've cited above -I think- came from the same place in Fernley, NV?!).

So, when I moved to this new area, and had no Indian restaurants around, I got desperate and started looking online for something.  I found these prepackaged Indian meals, and took a chance on them.<br /><br />They are awesome!  The Shai paneer is restaurant quality.  Seriously.  I eat it on it's own sometimes, but my favorite is to buy nann bread from the store, and dip it into it.  It is also great over rice.<br /><br />But, if you like Indian food, or like shai paneer, buy this and you won't be disappointed.  also, they are very cheap compared to the real thing!!

review/text: Never open any can of this type with a can opener!  The reason for this and why it is stated on the can is very IMPORTANT! You can get metal slivers onto and into the meat if you use a can opener to open the can. NEVER use a can opener!!!!<br /><br />You may have ingested or inhaled a sliver when you had that choking / breathing problem. A sliver of metal could have gotten into your esophagus or larynx causing the problem.  I highly doubt it was the meat.<br /><br />If the pull tab breaks? Just heat the can in some hot water, then take a curved knife and break the seal, then pry and roll the lid back.  If you can't pull the tab yourself?  Get someone else to do it for you! NEVER USE A CAN OPENER ON THIS TYPE OF CAN! This is why it is stated on the can...<br /><br />Any can with a pull top like the soups has the potential to cause metal slivers in the food when using a can opener.  They should revert back to the NON-Pull top cans to avoid this problem.  What happens is that the can opener cuts a slightly different path from the original scored seam, hence the slivers shear off and fall all over getting into the contents.

review/text: Yes, ARMOUUR TREET LITE LUNCHEON LOAF, 12-OUNCE CANS, (PACK OF 12), is quite tasty.  Yes, it is easy prepare, (just open and enjoy...if you're lazy like me...or put into receipes.)<br /><br />It is supposed to be easy to open -- but somehow, I don't have the energy to pull back the strip, as is recommended.  And it actually says on the can, DO NOT OPEN WITH CAN OPENER -- but it does not say why.  There is no handy 800 number to ask customer questions, either -- only an address is listed.  In the meantime, I HAVE to use a can-opener, as I can't open the can any other way.  It's easy to do if you open it with a can-opener from the TOP of the can, but just about impossible trying to use a can-opener at the bottom of the can.  MAYBE that's what "do not openwith a can opener" meant....<br /><br />Yes, this stuff tastes good.  But, after eating just one can, I found it a bit difficult to breathe!  It wasn't too bad -- and within ten minutes or so of deep-breathing excercise, I was OK.  (As recommended by DR. KEN DYCHTWALD:  1) Breathe in normally 2) Hold breath a few seconds  3 )  Let out breath slowly....  4) REPEAT.  This is a good excercise to do anyway -- because if done for a half-hour or more, it totally relaxes, and makes one feel good.  It also can be a life-saver for people with asthma and other ailments that make breathing difficult -- because most of these ailments give the sufferer difficultyin breathing OUT, not in breathing in.  By HOLDING one's breath a few seconds, one makes the body WANT to breathe out....and so oen does!)<br /><br />But any food that makes a person short of breath when eating it, however slightly, should be eaten VERY slowly, and TOTALLY WITH CAUTION.  In addition, luncheon meats, such as salami, bologna -- and Armour Treet -- are on the "bad food list" of the book 'BEATING CANCER WITH NUTRITION", by Patrick Quillan.  A food to be eaten with caution by everyone.  But a nice occasional "treet", I guess.<br /><br />...............................................................................<br /><br />P.S.:  Buy this food first in the supermarket.  On Amazon, it is NOT returnable, even in an unopened package!

review/summary: was confused opening the package
review/text: my husband ordered this thinking it was the big cans so i told him i went back over the order and it said the oz, but it could be somewhat false advertisement showing a picture of the big can instead of the actual small bag product... and its way too overpriced.  i just ordered 3 of the big cans for $48 total ($16 a can) from another seller on amazon.  but i cannot complain about the actual coffee - tim horton's is our favorite coffee and the taste was just as good as we're used to.  (main thing was that we were confused opening the package thinking we paid good price for 3 big cans and opened to 3 small bags; thats all)

review/summary: Great Coffee -- Great Everything
review/text: If you ever visit Canada you cannot miss the Ubiquitous Tim Horton's franchises, it seems as if they are on every corner (and small wonder: everything they sell is excellent, reasonably priced, and served with typical Canadian efficiency and politeness.) The quality of Tim Horton's coffee is pretty remarkable -- it is very, very good -- and the price is not outrageous (I picked up a 39 ounce can in a Canadian Walmart for about $16.50 in American dollars toward the end of november, 2010, which was about the same price they were selling for in the Tim Horton's stores.) Note: Their decaf is every bit as good, but I haven't been able to find it in cans larger than 13 ounces.

review/summary: 500 mile Chai
review/text: This is the best Chai tea for the long run. Some Chai's are to spicy with little of the tea flavor. Others are to bland with no spice. This one falls in the middle and is my favorite for those reasons. Have used this  tea for years. Have bought direct from Tao of Tea but Amazon had a great 3 can purchase price. This was reviewed years ago when Chai tea was coming into its own and was a listed favorite at the time and is why I purchased it the first time. Have tried a lot of the others but always come back to this special blend for the cold fall/winter mornings. By the way I don't drink coffee so my tastes may be a little different than a coffee drinker who would try this. This is a great product.

review/summary: garam chai
review/text: I have not found a pre-made chai tea that brings me back to my time in India, but this comes closest... maybe it's the difference in the milk as well. It takes a lot to make a chai from scratch, especially if all you want is one cup. This tea makes it easy and tastes great. It has a long shelf life too, I don't know if it is recommended but I have had mine for over a year and it still tastes great.

review/summary: Good stuff, great price
review/text: My wife and I drink a lot of tea.  We usually get our black teas from upton, as they usually have an edge on quality in the area of black teas.  I like this chai every bit as much as theirs (good balance, without an disproportionate amount of cinnamon (lots of chai tea makers lean much too heavily on the cinnamon)), and the price of this chai is much more affordable.  Looking forward to getting the bag version which is an even better deal.  Also, the tins are great!

review/summary: Try this tea!
review/text: This is my favorite chai tea ever! I am new to making loose leaf teas, but it is pretty simple. I've never seen any directions on the tin, so this is what I do:<br /><br />Boil 1 1/4 cups water then add 2 tsp. of tea and simmer for 5 minutes. Then I turn off the heat and add 2tsp. of sugar (heaping) and 3/4 cup warmed milk. This makes enough for one tall mug. You'll of course need a strainer as you pour the goodness into your cup.<br /><br />This product came in a timely manner, and I'm really glad I bought the 3 pack :)

review/summary: Best hangover tea ever.
review/text: This tea is the best wake up and hang over tea ever created.  It was not intended as a hang over remedy but one cup of this and even the worst headache is taken care of for hours.  I like it on REALLY cold mornings to wake up and get warm.  Follow the directions for the Chaiwallah on the side and you will love it too.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: We have 5 totally indoor cats.  We had been told by their vet to buy the expensive dry food which he happened to carry.  The cats were not handling it very well, and the expense got to be too much.  After reading the ingredients list here at amazon.com, we decided to try it.<br />The cats had had some problems with throwing up their dry food.  Since we have changed to the Blue Buffalo, we have seen a marked decrease in these incidents.<br />The other plus is that the Blue Buffalo is delivered right to our door!!!  No more lugging that heavy bag of dry food from the vet into the car and then into the house.<br />We have tried both the Chicken and Brown Rice, and the Salmon and Rice, and have found that our cats tolerate the Chicken better.

review/summary: A great option for cats with urinary tract issues
review/text: We recently went from a single cat household, to a multi-cat one. In my quest for a cat food all three could eat I discovered Blue Buffalo. Our oldest kitty has suffered from Urinary Tract Disease for years, so it was important that the food be friendly to his sensitive needs. He has spent most of his life eating Purina One, but after getting a nibble of our new kitty's food, he wouldn't touch it. So the research began, and I found Blue Buffalo contains cranberries that help with acidity in the urine. I rushed out and bought a bag. Guess what! All three of my cats love it! We're are on our 4th bag and haven't had a single UTD flare up. Their coats are gorgeous too! This food is great!
