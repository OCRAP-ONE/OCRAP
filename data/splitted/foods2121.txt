review/summary: Change in size
review/text: I would always have rated this product a 5 star one.  Now, it's only a 3. Why have you gone from nice small pieces, easy to sprinkle on cereal or with nuts, to these awful large chunks which have to be individually cut in order to use?! Large chunks take up more room in a bag, so, maybe you are not putting as much fruit in to fill the bag?  Are we being bamboozled?  I'd really like to see the small pieces come back.  I may begin looking for a different product.  What a terrible disappointment!  Shame on Sun Maid.

review/summary: Mostly pineapple!
review/text: This product deserves more than 1 star, but I am pissed off that the bag contains mostly pineapple and only a couple tiny pieces of mango. Rip off! I also don't like how SUGARY everything is. I wish the pieces were smaller too, you can't exactly put these huge chunks in yogurt or anything good. The mango is incredibly good, too bad there was literally no mango pieces inside.

review/text: The grocery store where I shop discontinued this particular Sun Maid dried fruit mix. My husband loves to have this particular mix on his oatmeal in the morning.SO happy to find on line AND at a better than grocery store price.  My only complaint with the Sun Maid company is the fact that they went with larger pieces of fruit. We liked it even better when it was the small bite sizes.

review/summary: tastee fruitee bits (EDITED from 5 stars down to 1 star)
review/text: In all seriousness, these are really wonderful and are a nice change of pace from raisins when adding to oatmeal. Some people may consider these a bit on the sweet side by themselves, but for those people adding them to oatmeal, you can almost go without adding brown sugar if you add the right amount of these. As of this writing, these are considerably cheaper on amazon after you factor in super saver shipping compared to local groceries!<br /><br />Edited 10/21/10: As one other reviewer has mentioned, Sunmaid has changed these and not for the better. Although they haven't bothered to change the picture of the fruit pieces on the front of the packaging, they're making the pieces MUCH larger. If I wanted large pieces, other manufacturers already do that. What I liked about these were that they were small bits good for putting in smoothies, on oatmeal, as something to put in my trail mix. If I have to chop this stuff up, I'm on the verge of just buying a food dryer and doing it right.<br /><br />I wrote in to SM and got a very canned response. They said it was due to the small pieces "sugaring", whatever that is. One intelligible thing they WERE able to tell me that this change wasn't an error in just one batch. It's a permanent change. It's too bad because the small pieces were the one differentiator of this product from every other dried fruit on the market.

review/text: I absolutely love dried pineapple. OK, as others have noted, that's a lot of sugar, but at least there's something in pineapple (bioflavinoids) that's good for you, which can't be said about candy bars. The papaya pieces are great also, but I'm not as big a fan of the mango. It's a bit too dried out, and tastes more like fruit jerky. Still, there's something in these packages for everyone, and I don't see how you can go wrong.

review/summary: Wonderful product gone wrong!
review/text: I agree completely with the reviewer before me! W/O even changing the labeling, Sun Maid has changed the way they prepare the fruit in the Tropical Trio. Where the pieces were small enough to use in a granola, in cookies or oatmeal, on cereal or yogurt, they are now huge chunks that do not blend well into anything! I wrote to Sun Maid, hoping I had purchased defective bags, the response was<br />"Thank you for your inquiry regarding your package of Sun-Maid Tropical Trio.  We have changed this product due to the fact that the larger pieces have more flavor and they do not 'sugar' as quickly as the smaller pieces."<br />I am not sure what they mean by "sugar" but I always found the small pieces to be quite flavorful. I have tried cutting them up on my own, but the results were not good, too sticky on the inside to cut well.<br />I am switching to Welch's Tropical Sensation, since they are the only other brand I have found with the smaller cuts of fruit. What a shame. I hope we can find those here on Amazon soon! They can be difficult to find at our local grocery stores.

review/summary: Sensational! Buy this AT ONCE!!!!
review/text: I saw a bottle of this on sale at the local market and tried it, hoping it wasn't going to be insipid and lifeless, tried it on a turkey sandwich in place of mustard -- WOW!!! It's fantastic! I cannot wait to try this one fish. I made some veal-lamb burgers last night and it was awesome on those! Not too hot, but not inert, either! If you like mustard (and who doesn't like mustard?!) you will LOVE this wasabi sauce!!! I recognize Silver Springs as the makers of my favorite regular Western horseradish so I was excited to see a new product from them. This stuff is AWESOME!!! 100% RECOMMENDED!!!<br />---<br />This stuff is so good that you can just FOREGO the bread and just dip leftover chicken in it for lunch. And I bet this will be awesome inside an omelette or on top of scrambled eggs. Possibly even melted into some butter and put on top of popcorn, though my daughter would not approve of that notion. This stuff is FANTASTIC!!!

At 100 calories per bar, they make a great calorie controlled snack. The flavor was delicious, very similar to the regular rice krispie bar. The case I got was fresh. The bars were krispy and chewy like they should be. I would recommend these to anyone.

review/summary: Healthy and no gelatin, but smell and taste bad
review/text: I gave this two stars vs one, because relatively speaking, it's healthy.....provided you can stand the odor and flavor enough to eat it.<br />I was so excited to find this product, because it didn't contain gelatin, had brown rice in it, and generally seemed much healthier than the standard "rice crispy"-type product.  I do eat A LOT of "health food" as a vegetarian of many years, and I realize that most healthy foods are inherently going to taste different than the typical processed junk most people eat these days.  I also don't eat a ton of sugar, and I feel I've grown more than accustomed to the taste of alternative ingredients.  This is why I'm so confused by why this particular product smelled and tasted terrible to me.  Every single ingredient in this product I'm positive I've had in other foods before.<br />I can only describe the odor as very similar to Play Dough....not the homemade stuff either, but the stuff in the colorful containers I played with as a kid.<br />The taste was ok at first, but then the "other" flavors emerged...and I had to spit it out and throw it away.  Maybe it was connected with the odor, I don't know.  I know that odor and taste are linked senses.  I thought maybe I got a bad batch, so several months later I bought some more (at a different store), and I experience the same unpleasant odor and taste.

review/summary: Fish Taco Seasoning Mix
review/text: I've given this product one star for the simple reason that the picture of the packet and the title Casa Mexicana (CM) Fish Tacos (they also have CM chicken and beef tacos, by the way) made me entertain the notion that the bag contains tacos - perhaps frozen.  So, I read the ingredients for each product, and there's no fish, chicken, or beef, just spices and an anti-caking agent.  The one positive omission for people like me, who are too lazy to make their own fresh ingredients at home, is that these mixes have no MSG.  After you buy the CM spice mix, you still have to provide your own taco shells, vegetable oil, lime, avocado, tomatoes, lettuce, mayonaisse, and, of course, the meaty ingredients.  Now really, if I have to go through all that trouble, I may as well dice my own onions, garlic, peppers, and anything else that I'd like to toss into the mix, and it will all be fresh.

review/summary: Ceylon cinnamon powder
review/text: Scientifically speaking, there is only one true cinnamon, which is most commonly called "Ceylon cinnamon," and comes from the plant Cinnamomum zeylanicum. The other type of cinnamon which you find mostly in the grocery stores is called cassia cinnamon. If the label just says cinnamon, it is most probably cassia cinnamon. Why is this important?<br /><br />The term "cassia" never refers to Ceylon cinnamon but rather to other species of cinnamon, including Cinnamomum cassia (alternatively called Cinnamomum aromaticaum) and Cinnamomum burmannii. While most simply referred to as "cassia," you'll often find Cinnamomum aromaticaum being referred to as "Chinese cinnamon" or "Saigon cinnamon," and you'll find Cinnamomum burmannii being called "Java cinnamon" or "Padang cassia."<br /><br />Ceylon cinnamon is typically more expensive than any of the cassia versions, and it is also the cinnamon more closely associated with potential health benefits involving blood sugar regulation. To me, cassia cinnamon is stronger tasting while Ceylon cinnamon is more delicate.<br /><br />What true cinnamon and cassia do not have in common is their coumarin content. Coumarins are naturally occurring plant components that can have strong anticoagulant properties. Because our blood needs to maintain its ability to coagulate in times of injury, excessive intake of coumarins over a prolonged period of time can pose health risks. While the level of naturally occurring coumarins in Ceylon cinnamon appears to be very small and lower than the amount that could cause health risks, the level of naturally occurring coumarins in the cassia cinnamons appears to be much higher and may pose a risk to some individuals if consumed in substantial amounts on a regular basis. For this reason, organizations like the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, Germany have recommended that large amounts of the cassia cinnamons be avoided.<br /><br />Since it is harder to find Ceylon cinnamon in the grocery store, you might find it at places like Trader Joes or whole foods. I do not have either of those stores within an hour drive, so I get mine at places like Amazon.com which has it in bulk at very good prices. This particular brand is a good price on Amazon.com and I just re-fill an old shaker I have on hand from the bulk bag. This is good cinnamon and a regular in my kitchen.

review/summary: living up to expectations
review/text: I am a type 2 diabetic and it is under excellent control.  Nevertheless, I'm always looking for ways to give me a hand with it.  I read that Ceylon cinnamon was the 'real' thing so I purchased a pound of it last summer and have been using it.  I did not change anything else in my diet.  Two weeks ago I had my six-month check-up and my 3-month levels were WAY down.  We were all quite surprised and although I do get outside and do more work in the summer, which might help a bit, it has not helped to that degree in years past.  I'm thinking it was the cinnamon, which I use quite a bit in cooking and in the breads I make (I make all our own).  Yes, it's got a great taste, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a gourmet when it comes to cinnamon -- I like it in whatever form it comes in!  I am thinking, though, that there really is something to the claims being made for this stuff in terms of blood sugar control.  I'm ordering more now.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: As I am about to order my second product from this company, I realized that I forgot to write a review for this (which I ordered 3-6 months ago).  This is delightful cinnamon, much more subtle than the store bought 'cassia' type.  And this cinnamon is far healthier if you eat a lot of it, (be assured, 1 pound goes a long way)!

review/text: This seasoning is so flavorful and versatile.  I recently made rice using chicken broth and added approx 1 tsp of the Vegeta seasoning and some sauteed finely chopped veggies.  Confetti rice.  So good! Has a lot of salt so always start off with a little at a time otherwise it could get too salty. I've used it on roasted potatoes and green beans. I have also used this in soup. A favorite, necessary ingredient (in my household) that keeps guests guessing what the secret ingredient is.  It's Vegeta!

review/summary: FULL OF FREE GLUTATMATES
review/text: Unfortunately, this product has a couple of ingredients that are really just monosodium glutamate.  I always wondered why my dog chewed on it for awhile and then abandoned the bone...and went crazy wanting another.  His skin turned pink after chewing on them and he was agitated.  He's "addicted" as are humans to glutamates, yet they are excitotoxins, and scientific literature shows that the tons of free glutamates being added to our food supply (a website called "truthinlabeling" gives you the many names manufacturers hide the poison behind) are contributing to or even causing loss of vision, taste, hearing and more (neurons are needed to see, hear, touch, taste, etc. and that's what free glutamates "overexictes" and destroys).  Of course neurons are even more plentiful in the brain and muscles, and free glutamates destroy neurons there as well.  Many years ago a dog was injected with glutamates and it convulsed wildly and then died.  If I eat even a "molecule" of free glutamates I get a migraine, so I fully understand its nasty power. So, I'm sorry to say, I'll never purchase these again.  I thought they really did "taste good" to my little guy because of the "tender juicy middle"...but no such luck.

review/summary: Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor
review/text: My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT
review/text: I have a VERY picky 9.5 yr old German Shepherd that leaves anything but a milkbone on the floor to collect dust.  She LOVED this bone!!!  I was amazed to see her crunch it up the large bone so quickly!  She's always been very well disciplined until these bones arrived at least.  She went into my pantry and tore the bag open and ate 7 bones!!!  She had such a low hung head when I approached her about the issue all I could do was laugh!!!  Luckily, my 4 month old shephard got one before her sister ate the batch!)  I save about $5 ordering the bones on Amazon.

review/summary: Ithing and chewing on paws
review/text: I first purchased a pack of Nutri Dent puppy chews for my Welsh Terrier when he was just a few months old. He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these.

review/summary: Picture is wrong, but tastes great.
review/text: The duck was excellent, and in a way I am glad that the picture does not reflect the product. I may not have bought it if the picture looked like what you really get. However, because of the picture, I am writing a review. I expected the duck breast to be similar to what is shown in the picture. Instead, the product was more in line with the images you get when you google "whole duck breast", only the google images look better. The taste is similar to cow liver and bacon. I have only eaten duck when ordering at a restaurant, so I have no idea what it is supposed to taste like smoked, or even if the product I received was the correct thing. The packaging said eight ounce smoked magret duck breast, so I went with it. So, if you buy this product do not be put-off by what you see. Slice it, sear the sides, and enjoy.

review/summary: Excellent Quality Chocoalate for Baking!
review/text: I've used many types of chocolate for baking. From Chuao(southern california chocolaterie made from Venezuelan cocoa beans), El Rey ( also Venezuelan ) to Valhrona(french) which is really expensive. Callebaut has the quality of these other three that I love without it costing quite as much. YOU can never go wrong with going quality in your baking items. Once you taste this you'll never go back to Ghirardelli's or Hershey's ever again. I almost don't even consider those brand's actual chocolate anymore.<br /><br />I've gotten the large blocks, but find that they are hard to store properly. I prefer them in the air tight bags in large dollop morsels. Always store them in a cool/dry place when purchasing in bulk.

review/text: Although the large block is somewhat of a pain to break up for use, the taste and texture are worth it.  This chocolate is very smooth and velvety, with a rich creamy taste, no "nutty" overtones, no bitterness, just rich chocolate flavor.<br />I've used it in brownies, ganache, and truffles, and it worked well for all three.  It also makes a lovely medium thickness enrobing.

review/summary: The REAL dark chocolate
review/text: We eat an ounce ( maybe more!) a day.  This is by far the best dark chocolate.  We have tried many, but no others taste as rich and it does not have a waxy texture.  I break mine up while still in the package by dropping it on my counter top a few times.  I get large chunks when I do that.  Then I put the chunks in several food saver bags and vac seal with the food saver.  I place them in the freezer until the day before I need them then it goes in the fridge.  To break that up in smaller pieces I leave it in the vac bags, use a butcher knife ( not the blade side) and hit it until it breaks into the smaller sizes I want.  So if your hesitation to purchase was due to storage, there is your solution. I really have not tasted any better quality chocolate then this and will continue to purchase.

review/text: I enjoy Harney and Sons teas.  The tea that comes in bags is real, loose tea, not the powdered sludge and it is in the ease of a tea bag.  Each bag can brew two cups of tea.  DO NOT overbrew your green tea if you are a novice, you will get a bitter cup.  The Chinese Flower has become my favorite green tea, the flower is soft and subtle, and there's a refreshing hint of lemon.  This is a delicate soft green tea.  I hope you like it.  If you do you may also want to try the Bangok by Harney and Sons it has a subtle coconut flavor with lemongrass.

review/summary: Best ones thus far!
review/text: I've tried multiple varieties of gluten free pancake mixes and this is by far the best. When you bite into them you can see airholes. If I didn't know better, I'd think they were traditional pancakes. The taste is pretty standard pancake-y. They're not too sweet, either, which I appreciated. They would be easy to alter with buttermilk, blueberries, chocolate chips, whatever you can think of. Most GF pancake mixes I've had have required the addition of blueberries because they're so blah and texturally weird by themselves. This one is great, as is. I have no idea what the other review is referring to, but he states he has not tried this product. Anyway, delicious--expensive--but worth it!

review/summary: Lovely oil--will definitely continue to use.
review/text: I first read about this oil in Cooks Illustrated magazine.  Here's what I love:<br />1) highest smoke point--I see cooking shows all the time heating up olive oil in a saute pan--DON"T!<br />2) VERY neutral flavor--whether baking, pan frying, marinating, etc. the oil flavor is in the background<br />3) doesn't solidify in the fridge (in salad dressings, marinades, etc.) like olive oil<br />4) best oil out there for good fat composition<br /><br />Everyone touts olive oil as so good for you, and it does have its place, as does grapeseed oil.  But if you only want to buy ONE healthy oil for many cooking uses, buy this--you won't be sorry.<br /><br />*Note:  when my bottles arrives they each had a little bit of oil leakage around the top.  Even though the bottles are sealed on top in plastic wrapper they are NOT sealed underneath the cap.  I contact the manufacturer and alerted them to this--maybe they'll make a change.<br /><br />I originally bought a gallon bottle directly from California Rice Bran Oil Company but decided I'd rather have smaller bottles opened (for freshness) since it takes me a while to use it up.  Amazon was cheaper for a 3-pack with free super saver shipping.

review/text: I took some cooking classes from a local restaurant Annapurna Ayurvedic Cuisine.  The owner recommended rice bran oil when you need to cook at high temperatures. Rice bran oil was difficult to find in local stores, so I found it on Amazon. Many health books believe you should NOT use olive oil at high or even medium temperatures. Thanks Amazon. Yes, the rice bran oil worked very well and the taste was neutral enough for my satisfaction.  It makes a great alternative.
