review/summary: Read ingredients carefully.
review/text: I bought the pack of 6 box.  When it arrived and I inspected the nutrition label I saw that it has sugar in it.  This is the reason why I gave this product such a low rating.<br /><br />The other organic cereal I use does not, and I would like to return this.<br />As this is a grocery item, I am not able to.  I wish amazon gave nutrition information on the products they are selling so I didn't have to be stuck with this!  (My fault really, could have gone on another website and checked it out).

review/summary: Rice and Oatmeal Cereals - Toxic Hexane
review/text: The can of oatmeal clearly says they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek). If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae. Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane. Will never reccommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid. I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead.

review/summary: Rancid Batch
review/text: We have loved this product until the last few days.  As I was playing w/my daughter who is 20 months, she said "mommy tummy hurts" and I heard it gurgling.  Her dad heard and said:  "...well I opened a new can of Oatmeal yesterday, and it smelled horrible, looks very different than past cans".  Sure enough, I opened it and it was horrible smelling and looked bad  (as noted in other reviews, dark grey flakes mixed in, much darker than normal).  There MUST be something wrong - I plan to contact the company tomorrow and would NOT recommend right now.

review/summary: Spoiled Case!
review/text: We used this cereal when my daughter was a baby 2 years ago and it was great. I ordered a case recently for my 8 month old son and it was spoiled! Amazon was great and refunded my money, but I am so disappointed with HAPPYBELLIES. There are obviously some major quality control issues that need to be addressed. I will be ordering baby cereal from a different company as I just can't bring myself to trust HAPPYBELLIES anymore.

review/summary: Had been wonderful until September 2010 - now bad color/smell
review/text: My son (now 9 months old) has been eating HAPPYBELLIES organic oatmeal cereal twice a day since he was 6 months old, and loves it. So I love it too - until recently. The last container I bought had a different color and smell. All our cereal until now had been a cream-ish color, soft and flaky in texture and smelled like, well, oats. Not anymore. The recent batch had cereal that had black/gray-ish flakes mixed with the regular-looking oat flakes, and it smelled horrible, almost like mold or really, really rancid oil. I had bought that batch from [...] and they promptly issued a refund. Now I'm a fix as to what to feed my baby! I don't want to experiment with an unfamiliar brand given how much he loves this one, but again I don't want him to eat what clearly doesn't look or smell like food.<br /><br />Can someone, from either Amazon or HAPPYBELLIES, please repond to this and other similar concerns and put them to rest?

review/summary: Baby developed yeast diaper rash after trying this cereal
review/text: I have been giving my 8 month old happy bellies for the last month and noticed that after a process of elimination, this cereal has caused my baby to have a yeast diaper rash. She loved eating it so I gave it to her daily. I've done everything to take care of her diaper rash but it persisted even after I started applying nystatin which her pediatrician prescribed. I then decided to eliminate foods and monitor what happened to the rash and identified the happy bellies as the culprit. It's too bad because I thought that the probiotics would do her good but instead she's developed an annoying yeast diaper rash. Has anyone else's baby had any allergic reactions to this cereal?

review/text: My son loves this cereal.  After trying multiple brands, this is the cereal he loves the best.  It makes a perfect puree with no lumps, which is his general probelm with other brands.  I feel good giving it to him as a mom because it does not contain soy, dairy, wheat or gluten.  It is also made without many of the fancy preservatives that are found in other more conventional brands.  We can't wait to try the other varieties!

Ever since I gave my 6 month old this organic oatmeal cereal (which she seemed to like with my breast milk) she has been constipated. Day no 4 and I am still waiting for her "full diaper"! I can see how much she is suffering trying to poop, I tried prunes and this product is still sitting in her little tummy. Waste of money! Disappointed in whole foods that they would sell such a bad product!

This stuff is amazing, it really does help a babies immune system. He doesn't get sick at all and he is growing rapidly every day. I highly recommend this for sickly babies and toddlers. I just mix it with his formula or milk and he enjoys it. It is certified organic. It is a must if you have babies and if you are a first time mother.

review/summary: musty smell, baby could not stand it
review/text: This was my baby's first food (or at least I tried it) at 6 months. When I opened the can, a musty smell welcomed me. It had not gone bad from what I could see and it was well before the expiration date, it was just not terribly appetizing. Several times I went through the hassle of expressing breastmilk and mixing it with this stuff. There is no way I could get my baby to take this cereal, regardless of the milk to cereal ratio. I threw the stuff out and we went straight to real solids (non-pureed or mashed) after a few weeks. My baby has some preferences for which I do not want to rate this product poorly, however the musty smell was a turnoff for me too.

Now I can get it online for much less than the cost of a plane ticket!  I bought a six-pack and gave them at Christmas to my cooking friends!  My 10 year old niece, a very picky eater, said the chicken I made with this seasoning was the best she ever ate!  I love garlic, so I add some extra garlic to whatever it is I am using it with.  I use it on salads, on vegetables, meat and chicken dishes, you can even use it in omelets.  If you like a mideastern/greek flair to your dishes, you should like this one.  I will buy it again!

review/text: This order reached me quickly.<br /><br />I opened up the box to see two packages of the box in the same package. In hindsight, knowing that the seller had the same facility in my state, I shouldn't have bothered to get it delivered overnight.<br /><br />Onto the tea... they were simply thrown into the box as mentioned by someone else. I should've taken this as a warning not to purchase it, as it was not well packaged much like other teabags delivered to me. After I tried the tea, I found the taste to be weak, and the contents of the teabag often coming out of the teabags themselves even though they were not torn either way.<br /><br />Leads me to think that the QA on this isn't very good. Again, in hindsight, I shouldn't have gotten a 100-count box. Ah well. I don't think I'll purchase this particular product again, and I'll more than likely give the second tea box away to someone else.

review/text: My husband loves green tea and will only drink Stash. I got really annoyed by all the packaging, so I was extremely happy when I saw this 100-count box.<br /><br />That's ALL you get: one small box filled with 100 individually wrapped tea bags. The box doesn't come in a box, how awesome is that?! Also, no more fighting with the plastic wrap and filling your recycling bin with hundreds of flimsy little Stash boxes.<br /><br />The tea itself is delicious. Very earthy, clean and slightly grassy. It reminds me of the green tea you get in real Japanese restaurants, but a bit less grassy (which I like).<br /><br />Decaf is perfect if you want hot tea during the evening.

review/summary: A Sweet Reminder of Fall...
review/text: I am absolutely thrilled with this tea.  I love Autumn and the scent and flavor of this tea reminds me so much of everything I love about Autumn.  The spices are perfect to give an excellent aroma and flavor...In my opinion, this is the perfect beverage to have as you curl up with a good book on a cool afternoon, or to enjoy as a delicious dinnertime tea.  I like to drink it with raw, unprocesed cane sugar.  I feel the cane sugar gives this tea even more the taste of a special chilly-weather treat.  I plan to drink this tea as my after dinner drink each evening, and will definitely be purchasing it again and again.  Kudos to you, Stash...and kudos to Amazon for having such a great price.

True to other reviews that they were all just kind of stuffed in the box in an unorganized way, but that doesn't effect the tea at all.  Would buy more in the future, if I need to make more favors.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This tea is one of my favorites.  It has a clean, subtle, delicious flavor very similar to the Stash White Decaf Lemon, but unlike the lemon it's lemongrass free, which can be important for people with grass allergies.<br /><br />Three warnings for this tea:<br /><br />1.  If you like strong tea, you're in the wrong place.  This is a subtle white.  I find it delicious, but many of my friends want a stronger flavor.  I think this is comparable to flavored water in the intensity of the flavor, though it would be unfair to compare this to the fake chemical flavor of a propel water bottle!<br /><br />2.  It's a white tea.  It steeps FAST.  If you'd like more flavor, choose another tea or put in 2-3 teabags.  This tea will not always forgive a long steep and can become very bitter if left too long.<br /><br />3.  It's not a very good iced tea.  It tastes like it would be lovely, but the flavor oil leaves a film on the top that I find unappetizing.<br /><br />Enjoy your tea!

review/summary: Great tea, just a touch too light
review/text: I purchased this because I wanted a decaf white tea that had some flavor to it.  I normally don't enjoy fruit flavored teas.  This one is a great flavor, but I have noticed it needs to steep longer to get enough flavor out of it.  The raspberry is a little too subtle.<br /><br />The outer package is the pictured cardboard box, but the tea bags are individually wrapped in air tight packets (the small white packet shown with the box) which are pretty enough for display or gift baskets. If you aren't sure about buying 100 at a time, look for a sample package on Amazon or elsewhere (though the Amazon prices are impressive compared to other ones I've seen).<br /><br />If you are interested in a full-flavor tea, I highly recommend Stash's White Christmas Tea.

review/text: I tell everyone I know to buy this tea.  It's the ONLY chocolate tea I've found that actually tastes like chocolate!  It's not overwhelming and although I'm not normally a fan of hazelnut, it really only serves to act as a flavor enhancer to the chocolate.  It's just awesome, hands down, not weak either, although it is decaf.  The price here is a bit high - you can get this in the store that begins and ends with a t here in the States for about two dollars and a quarter for the 18 bag size.  Great, incredible stuff, I'm almost out again!  Highly, highly recommend!

So, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and even be able to automatically order it. Keep carrying it, Amazon!

Furthermore; it has lots of other ingredients although the title leads you to believe otherwise.<br /><br />It has raspberry leaf, hibiscus, strawberry FLAVOR, licorice powder... a very complex blend in my opinion; considering they lead you to believe it is: GOJI BERRY, MATCHA and GREEN TEA.<br /><br />Goji berries are full of nutrients and antioxidants. WHAT THE HECK IS "GOJI FLAVOR" and why does the heading on the front of the teabag state it is goji berry when it is not?<br /><br />WAY TOO SWEET in addition. A true mislead and disappointment. Shame on them.<br /><br />How can they have the audacity to call the teabag 100% Natural Ingredients? What is goji flavor and strawberry flavor? Tastes terrible.

review/summary: Wonderul tea!
review/text: I originally bought a small box of this at the grocery store to see if it could replace my nightly cup (sometimes 3) of hot chocolate during our cold Maine falls and winters! I LOVED it! I guess if you like your tea with a splash of milk or cream it'll taste even more like mint hot chocolate but I only drink tea plain but that's what friends of mine have done when they come over.  This box is also an AMAZING price considering the local stores (that IF they carry this flavor, which 99% don't,) sell it for at least $3.50 a box. Great deal for a great tea! On ward to health and warmth! ;)

review/summary: tea is good, arrival less so
review/text: I've been looking for a really good peachy flavored black tea. This is probably the best I've found, though still tastes more fruity than peachy, if that makes any sense. It came in a box with all the tea loose inside, so you'll need something to keep it in, or leave it in the cardboard box. I'm using a lock and lock container.

review/text: It how takes three to four tea bags and steeping for at least half hour for me to get a large mug of licorice spice tea.  This was always my favorite tea, however I have noticed a decline in the strength over the last year or two.  However, the price is right.

review/summary: Delicious! *****
review/text: This blend of Earl Grey from Stash Tea is delicious. It is the most fragrant Earl Grey we have ever enjoyed. The blend has a floral quality to it; not overpoweringly sweet but quite distinctive. Not herbal.<br /><br />The taste is similarly floral with no harsh black tea flavor. It must be low in caffeine as I experience no "spikes", either.<br /><br />A very distinctive blend for which Stash should be pleased.

review/text: I love earl grey tea, but am very picky & find that the flavor quality varies from each supplier, & some are not so good.  Stash is always consistantly good, and the flavor is just right. I ordered decaff since want to drink as much as I want before bed.  It's much cheaper to buy in bulk without all the fancy packaging & I would recommed this to anyone who loves earl grey tea.

review/summary: no orange taste and not spicy
review/text: I was very disappointed by this tea as it has no orange flavour and also is not spicy at all. It tastes like a rather boring, cheap black tea. Only the tea bacgs themselves seem to be dirty with an orange colour, so probably there are some colorants in this tea. As the box is so big it is a pain to finish them... I would recommend not to buy it. A good orange spicy tea is the one from Harney & Sons.

review/text: The packaging does not match what is show on the website.  The teabags came in a box suited to hold metal screws not teabags.  The teabags were tossed in there like screws as well.  So, unless you plan to store your teabags in your garage at your workbench, do not order these.  I ordered these as a subscription which I am now cancelling.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I've come to trust the Stash brand, among only a few others due to its consistently excellent product line and variety.  I was initially a fan of English Breakfast tea, but was introduced to Irish Breakfast tea some time back.  A slightly thicker liquor produced than does English Breakfast, it mixes well with a variety of items (sugar and milk are recommended, but certain alcoholic bases or mixers sit quite nicely if you want to switch up the classic Hot Toddy concept or use Kahlua instead of sugar), and has an even stronger aroma and flavor than your regular black tea.<br /><br />If you're a fan of weaker brews where one or two dunks is good enough, this is not for you.  I tend to steep this for a long while (tea experts would call me nuts for doing this as it could scald and alter the flavor of the leaves), but I love the strength of the brew afterwards.  This is great to have on-the-go, too, and hearty to drink if you're ill and require a lot of liquids.

review/text: This is one of my favorite winter teas! The ginger-peach flavor is absolutely wonderful, especially when I have a cold or flu. Next time, I won't order this specific packaging. I expected the tea bags to be arranged in rows in a box, but STASH appears to have dumped and squashed 100 tea bags into too small of a box. The individual packs are crumpled, folded and mangled. If you prefer more pristine tea bags, order the multi-pack box.
