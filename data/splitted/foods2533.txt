review/summary: Glad I only bought one can.
review/text: I was at Whole Paycheck today and saw this cola. I almost bought a case, but decided to try a single can first. I'm glad I did, because I hated it. I don't expect any diet cola to be as good as "The Real Thing", but it should taste like cola and not be bitter. This stuff is very bitter, and I would not have known it was a "cola" if it was not labeled as such. I think the makers need to do some taste tests and fix their formula.

review/summary: Zevia is awful!
review/text: I love Truvia sub sugar which is made from the Stevia plant, so I thought Zevia, the drink made with Stevia, would be good. But on the contrary _ I opened one can and could barely finish it. It's grossly  and sickeningly sweet with a horrible after taste and next to "no carbonation" in the can. GOD AWFUL..whoever let this on the market should be fired..

review/summary: Tastes like black pepper!
review/text: I've just recently started using liquid stevia (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3JY">SweetLeaf SteviaClear Liquid Stevia, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)</a>) to sweeten iced teas, lemonades and other juices that I make at home, and while it is not sugar, it still has a pleasing taste once you learn how much a beverage needs.<br /><br />I saw these on the shelf at my local supermarket the other night and decided to take the plunge. What a waste of $4.99: This stuff is awful! The cola is sweet, yes, but it has a horrible aftertaste, not anything like the liquid stevia that I am used to using, and tastes a lot like drinking black pepper.<br /><br />Just for the record: I don't mind diet cola, and will drink lots of it if it is on hand. I find regular cola a bit sweet for my tastes, but I am a fan of the cane sugar colas that have gotten popular recently. This stuff is expensive, and doesn't even taste much like cola, even if you were to disregard the aftertaste. I might give one of the other flavors a try, but imo it's not worth the expense.<br /><br />I'd say save your money.

review/summary: I couldn't even finish one can
review/text: I have always been a huge Diet Pepsi fan, but I have recently decided to give up aspartame.  So I searched online and found this product.  So you've heard the saying "If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is."  Well that is definitely the case with Zevia Cola.<br /><br />I honestly had a hard time getting it down.  I can't believe people are giving it 4 and 5 stars.  They must work for the company or something because it is nasty.  There is an awful after taste.  Luckily, I only bought a six pack at the grocery store and so I only have 5 left over cans instead of 23.  I would honestly be embarassed to offer them to guests (even my little nephews).  However, I did read one review that said it was okay mixed with rum.<br /><br />I also tried the ginger root beer and it was delicious.  However, it doesn't have any caffeine so it's not really a substitute for Diet Pepsi.  I'm going to try the Dr. Zevia and the Mountain Zevia since they are the only two other Zevias that contain caffeine.  Then I'll give up and go back to my Diet Pepsi.  Maybe I'll just cut back on the number of cans I go through.

review/text: I will be honest. I have never tried Zevia and am hesitant to do so because if I do indeed like it I will not be able to AFFORD IT!!!! My husband drinks soda like water and I am trying to steer him in a more healthy direction; hence my wanting to try Zevia. Why is it that everything that is better for your health is so expensive?! I mean $24.00 for a case of soda is astronomical when you can buy a case of the popular brands for no more than $8.00. With the economy the way it is I will just have to wait until I land a better job so that I can afford to be more healthy!

review/summary: I can finally have soda again!
review/text: I'd been hearing about Zevia and finally got to try some of each flavor.  Due to an inability to process sugar (can't "cheat" because I get instantly sick), and headache problems from aspartame and sucralose, I've been unable to drink soda for several years.  I figured I'd rather be healthy, feel good, and drink water or tea than have a drink of pop and feel awful, so I abstained.<br /><br />So I was excited to find Zevia.  Zevia is nothing short of wonderful.  When I could still drink pop, I'd tried all kinds of artisan types like Jones, Virgil's etc. so it doesn't bother me a bit that it's not a Coke clone (but it's not far off either).  It's still got a wonderful, true cola flavor--a fantasia flavor of vanilla, citrus, and cinnamon, like all true colas.  Plenty of fizz that lasts the whole can.<br /><br />As far as aftertaste goes, I've never tasted a soda that didn't have some kind--and that I couldn't get used to.  This probably has less aftertaste than anything I've tasted, other than straight cane-sugar.  If anything it's a sweet, rather than the usual acidic, aftertaste.<br /><br />The opinions of the others in my family are similar.  My husband, who is very picky when it comes to diet cola, loved it and claimed my second can of it.  He's been trying to get away from his diet Coke addiction for a couple of years.  My kids loved all the flavors they tried. They're not normally allowed to drink soda at all, and are thrilled there is finally something out there I'll allow them to have once in awhile.<br /><br />It's selling for about $1 a can, which is less than the other "stevia-supplemented" soda out there (Virgil's is around $2 a bottle).  I imagine that as this takes off, that price will come down.  And it should take off.  It's just as good as the not-so-good-for-you sodas.

review/summary: Zevia Cola - My second experience with stevia sweetened soda
review/text: Zevia Ginger Ale was my first experience with a soda sweetened with the natural sweetner Stevia. As a result of my good experience, I bought a six-pack of Zevia Cola from my local natural foods store.  The associate told me they sell out very quickly. I will be purchasing other flavors to try as well.<br /><br />Taste: 3 stars<br />- I used to be a huge fan of Diet Coke. There is a definite after-taste created by Stevia, and it will take a little getting used to. However, this is the case for any diet drink.  Someone that is not used to diet sodas might not immediately enjoy them.  After continuing to drink Zevia, the after taste becomes less noticeable. This soda seems a tad bit sweeter than a regular Coke and not quite a sweet as a Diet Coke.  The cola flavor could definitely be stronger.<br /><br />Calories: 5 stars<br />- No calories! Can't argue with that.<br /><br />Ingredients: 5 stars<br />- It's all natural. If you aren't familiar with Stevia, look it up on your favorite search engine.  The sweetner has no calories and is natural, unlike the Aspartame found in a Diet Coke.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 4 stars<br />- When it comes to no calories and natural ingredients, I'm willing to accept a slight decrease in taste. That's why I'm giving Zevia Cola 4 stars. Unfortunately in this case, the cola taste is not quite as strong as it should be, and the Stevia seems to overpower the cola flavor.<br /><br />The only way to know if you'll like it is to give it a try. Amazon sells these for a better price than you will find in stores, but if you want to try it first, you can probably purchase these in smaller quantity at a natural foods store.

review/summary: Great Flavor and Not too Sweet!
review/text: I usually hate diet soda - ones with natural sweeteners, ones with artificial - anything diet.  This is the first soda with 0 calories that I have tried and loved!  Their root beer flavor is fantastic as well!  Don't expect this to taste like Coke or Pepsi though - it is definitely more in line with a cola flavor you would get from Big Sky, Knudsen's or another natural brand.  I also like that it has a clean sweet sort of flavor - not a sickly sweet or with any sort of metallic aftertaste you get with other kinds of diet drinks.<br /><br />The only con I would say is that it is very carbonated - unless you really really like carbonation, I would recommend not drinking this straight from the can - pour it over ice.  The positive to this though is that if you don't finish a whole can, you can put it into the fridge and come back later and it is still fizzy.  I have left an open one in the fridge with no lid or covering only to come back the next day and find that it was still drinkable and not totally flat.<br /><br />Great product!  Glad Amazon has finally started carrying at least one flavor!

review/summary: Thank You Zevia!!!
review/text: I am so grateful to Zevia for this product.  I couldn't drink anything but water.  As a diabetic, no sugar and I have an allergy to 'man-made substitute sugar', probably a very good thing.  Coffee and Tea upset my stomach (I'm getting up there in years).  And then I stumbled upon the Zevia site.  YES!!!<br /><br />I was already using Stevia (the natural sugar that is actually so harmless it is GOOD for diabetics!!  And here was a drink I could actually have and pop!  I hadn't had a pop in years!!  How absolutely delightful!<br /><br />I purchased some to try, hoping I would like it, as it turned out I love the taste of it.  I cannot do a comparison by taste since I haven't had regular soda's in forever but Zevia Rootbeer is way, way too sweet for me (considering I haven't been able to have granulated sugar).  I worried at first that I couldn't have the rootbeer flavor  because it like all 'rootbeers' may have licorice root which raises blood pressure...HA!  Zevia rootbeer is made with ginger root and tastes exactly as I remembered rootbeer.  I have some but keep it for times when I have an upset stomach or dizziness.<br /><br />I drink the cola and Twist all the time and as yet haven't had a chance to try the Orange, but I'm looking forward to it.  Diabetics with a sweet tooth can drink this and it will cut down their craving for sugar.<br /><br />I drive quite a ways to get it because the shipping is bit steep on the Net but I manage to keep plenty in my pantry.  I've become a very big fan of Zevia!!!<br /><br />I really hope more and more people learn of Zevia and will begin to drink it, because once your health is damaged there may be no return to good health.  Life becomes "What if" and "If only".  So if you get a chance to try Zevia go for it.  To your good health!

review/summary: Zevia, Natural Cola with ERYTHRITOL
review/text: I recently purchased a case of Zevia.  I was anxious to try out this product.  It arrived today, much to my delight.  After drinking just a half of a can, I came down with a terrible headache.  I couldn't believe it.  The culprit...ERYTHRITOL, a sugar alcohol, the second ingredient in the product; not STEVIA, the fifth ingredient. Also, the product is purported to have -0- calories.  Erythritol contains 2.6 calories per gram.  There are 12 grams of erythritol in each can.  Most erythritol is made from fermenting GMO corn.  How healthy is that? This beverage is VERY expensive and would be well worth it if it were truly an all natural<br />drink, sweetened only with stevia, which is what I thought I purchased.

review/text: Faithful customer here!  :)  I am so happy Zevia exists.  I gave up all soda years ago, but honestly... I missed it.  Two year ago I learned about Zevia, and have been purchasing it ever since.<br /><br />Zevia comes in an assortment of flavors that are all quite tasty... natural cola, natural orange, natural ginger-ale, natural root beer, natural black cherry, and natural twist. My favorites are the black cherry, orange, and root beer.<br /><br />I have never tasted an aftertaste with Zevia. All the flavors are delicious. My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and don't contain any harmful chemicals.  Also, I love the fact that there are no calories in it.  Truly guilt-free!<br /><br />The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola.  All the others are caffeine-free.<br /><br />I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost.<br /><br />I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly. I trust this brand.<br /><br />I hope you give Zevia a try. I think you will be pleased!

review/summary: Not what it's made out to be, unfortunately
review/text: I purchased this soda from my local health food store, thinking that because it came from a health food store and claimed to be 'natural', that it didn't use GMO ingredients (yes, I know, I was naive, lol) . After reading some of the comments here, especially the one about the ingredients not being as advertised by the company, I decided to do some research. I ended up emailing the company and asking them why they used erythritol and where their erythritol source came from. The response that I received appears below. I don't appreciate marketing that is designed to mislead consumers by throwing the word 'natural' around like this product does. I have enough labels to sift through to try to remove GMO from my diet. Figured I'd pass the info on.<br /><br />Hi Joanna,<br /><br />Erythritol is 100% natural. It occurs naturally in grapes, melons, pears, corn to name a few sources. It is made through a fermentation process like yeast. Erythritol has no calories and no effect on blood sugar levels. The reason we blend stevia (hundreds of time sweeter than sugar) with erythritol (only 70% the sweetness of sugar) is because the combination yields a natural sweetness that tastes like sugar. Using either sweetener alone would not please the palate like Zevia does.<br />------------------<br />Hi Joanna,<br /><br />Zevia is always considering ingredients that are safe for personal safety and health and that of our environments. Our erythritol is not certified Organic by the USDA and is not certified GMO-Free and is made from corn.  Zevia does seek out suppliers of GMO-free ingredients when they are available in the market and when it is a viable alternative, but we cannot make the claim that all of our ingredients are GMO-free. We promise that we will continue to explore ingredient alternatives when available and will always choose to do right by our customer and the environment.

review/text: I'm a big fan of stevia -- in its un-messed-with form, that is.  I use the liquid type from my local health food store.  I try to avoid the other types that have been mixed with various powders and crystals and so on.  Stevia in liquid form is so sweet it only takes two drops to sweeten a glass of iced tea and leaves no aftertaste.<br /><br />I tried several cans of Zevia on different occasions, really trying to like it.  But it has an awful aftertaste, no matter how cold it is.<br /><br />It's over-priced and bad tasting.  That it gets so many good reviews may be more because people are so desperate to find an alternative to HFCS-laden drinks they'll like anything.  But to each their own.<br /><br />I won't buy any more Zevia or recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Not All Natural, Not that Tasty - Contains Sugar Alcohol
review/text: Disappointed in this drink.  I chose Zevia because I wanted to get away from my diet coke consumption and I love carbonation.  Well, no.  This isn't the answer.<br /><br />First off the taste -<br /><br />I've tried Zevia, Dr. Zevia and the gingerale.  All of them have this artificial sweetness that can't be overriden by the different varieties.  It's nothing like Diet Coke or Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, etc.  I thought I could get used to it but after a couple of weeks, it's just nauseatingly sweet.  The other varieties don't change that.<br /><br />Second, the ingredients -<br /><br />This is the listed ingredient list.  I have a sensitivity to sugar alcohol (zylitor, splenda (sucralose), etc) so I use stevia in my coffee.  No problem.  With this drink, I started having gastrointestinal issues common to sugar alcohols.  I didn't know what was causing it so I changed some things in my diet to no avail.  Then I looked at this ingredient list.  Stevia is NOT the primary sweetener.  Ingredients are listed by the most prevalent first - erythritol is a sugar alcohol.  It's the same chemical family as splenda.  Um.. no thanks.  I wanted a NATURALLY sweetened drink - not another chemical one.<br /><br />I feel this company is being dishonest in its product.  I've discontinued use of this line of beverages while my system settles down from the sugar alcohol and will not be drinking them again.  The taste is inferior and artificial and the ingredients cause me to have problems.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />CARBONATED WATER, **ERYTHRITOL**, CARAMEL COLOR, TARTARIC ACID, REB A (STEVIA EXTRACT), FUMARIC ACID, CAFFEINE, LIME OIL, LEMON OIL, NATURAL FLAVORS, CASSIA OIL, NUTMEG OIL.

review/summary: After the second can, you'll never go back!
review/text: I cannot say enough good things about this soda.  It is expensive, but worth every penny.  I tried to lose weight by drinking diet soda made with those horrible chemical sweeteners like Nutrasweet.  They left me dry-mouthed and cranky, and hungrier than when I started!<br /><br />Zevia is sweetened with Stevia, an all-natural sweetener.  Drink two cans and you'll never go back. I say drink two cans because Stevia does taste a little different, and it is intensely sweet like the high-fructose corn syrup sodas are.  After the second can, you'll be used to the taste and you'll also be amazed how much better you feel.<br /><br />This soda actually curbs my appetite.  My system doesn't rebel against it, like it does with those "frankensweetener" diet sodas.  I also don't feel bloated and sugar-crashy, like I do when I drink the corn-syrup sodas.  I suspect the non-chemical sweetness of this drink tricks my body into thinking that I drank a regular soda. Zevia finally enabled me to stop drinking regular soda entirely!<br /><br />You've gotta try this stuff!

review/text: I HAD to stop drinking Big Red (if you're from Texas, you'll know where I'm coming from ...it's practically pure sugar with a fairly good kick). But I'm terrified of Aspertame and the other dangerous sugar substitutes in diet sodas.<br /><br />Can't say I had a Eureka! moment when I tasted Zevia cola, but each can of the first six-pack tasted better and better (especially when it was ice cold). That was several months and many six-packs ago. These days I even get a craving for the stuff.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: I thought all hope was lost, when I bought a 24-pack of Virgil's Diet Cola (for $48!), which is sweetened with Stevia.  The stuff was AWFUL!  I ended up throwing out about 9 of the bottles.  I just couldn't take the taste.  I tried Zevia, reluctantly.  I was expecting another abysmal tasting Stevia-based Cola but I was pleasantly surprised!  Zevia is great!<br /><br />The taste reminds me of Diet Soda from the 1980's a little bit.  A little bit medicinal tasting, but very drinkable, and refreshing.  All I was asking for, was a Diet Soda that's reasonably drinkable.  Well, I found it!  I refuse to put Aspartame or Sucralose in my body, so this is a glorious treat.<br /><br />I suppose the taste could be improved upon slightly, but I'm still very happy with it overall.  And the price is great!  I paid $2 a piece for that Virgil's garbage.  Zevia is $1 a can, about what you'd pay for a Coke out of a vending machine.  Not bad at all!

review/summary: Excellent Product with a bit of a high price
review/text: As a lifetime diet cola drinker I eagerly waited for someone to roll out a soda with Stevia.  At first I was a bit concerned when a non "name" brand soda came out, especially with a premium price.  However I am incredibly pleased with the Zevia cola soda.  It tastes far closer to regular Pepsi than any diet soda.  I find no after taste, rather a sweet and refreshing flavor.  The only reason that I gave it four stars was because of the elevated price.  I would highly recommend this product.

The can ingredients show different ingredients now. I wish they had left it as is. It's too expensive to order something that is just mediocre. Will look for another natural brand.

review/text: As this is the only "diet" soda currently available in my area that I can feel comfortable with, I had to give it a try. Naturally, if you're used to the flavor of your favorite soda, switching can be difficult, but it was worth it for me--no more Aspartame! In a very short time, I have grown to absolutely love this soda. It is very fizzy and this one is my favorite of all their flavors. When I first tried it, I put a little cherry flavoring in it, and gradually did not want the cherry anymore. I am enjoying a Zevia right now!

review/text: I just tried the cola Zevia today, to impressive results.  I was expecting a bitter aftertaste since pure stevia is sweet at the beginning, then turns bitter towards the end, but this stuff was not like that at all!  Now, it certainly doesn't taste exactly like Coca-Cola, so if that's what you're looking for, this isn't it.  It has great cola flavor though, and is more palatable than artificial sweeteners, both on your tongue and for your health-mindedness.

review/summary: Good flavor, not too bitter
review/text: Often times a diet soda has a terrible bitterness because of the artificial sweeteners used. This is actually quite acceptable. Be aware though that Zevia contains Erythritol as well as Stevia, so it's not just Stevia that is sweetening the flavor.<br /><br />I'll be honest, the flavor is nothing drastically superior to standard diet colas, but it is more the natural method of sweetening that got me to buy this soda as opposed to its flavor. The flavor is subtle, but it's still good. I am going to try their Root Beer flavor next since Root Beer is by far my favorite beverage.

review/summary: Zero Calorie, All Natural Cola That Tastes Great? Yes!!!
review/text: I am a cola junkie. I can't get enough Pepsi, Coke, or even RC Cola. The problem is all the extra calories. I cannot tolerate aspartame or sucralose (poisons!) because they both make me extremely naseated. Now I can drink "diet" soda. It's guilt-free bliss!<br /><br />As a non-diet soda drinker, I really don't mind the slight aftertaste of Zevia cola at all. It's sweet and lingering for the first few sips, but it's barely noticeable after that. From what I remember of Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi, they left a very chemical-tasting coating in my mouth. Not only did they make me physically ill, they tasted awful! Zevia actually tastes good to me, someone who doesn't normally drink diet sodas.<br /><br />If this miracle beverage was a little cheaper, I think everyone, diet and non-diet soda lovers alike, would be enjoying it. I can't wait for the price to drop. That's really the only complaint I have about the product.

review/text: Zevia has a sweet after taste like honey rather than a chemical after taste like regular diet drinks.  I was hooked on diet soda until I found Zevia.  I feel so much better about drinking Zevia.  I do like Zevia best when it is ice cold straight from the can rather than chilled with ice, but I also prefer other sodas that way.  I wanted to change what I was drinking and had an open mind when I tried it.  I wasn't expecting it to taste like diet, so I think this prepared me for its sweeter taste.  I prefer it to diet soda now and will continue to buy this as long as its offered!

review/text: I love Zevia Cola, I really do. It doesn't taste exactly like regular cola, but it tastes better than diet (and doesn't have sweeteners that give me migraines). However, I had to stop drinking it because of the BPA in the can liners (which I guess all sodas have). The amount is very small according to the company but I must be sensitive to it because it affected my hormones. So I can't drink it which is a bummer, especially in this heat!

So, we started making our own root beer.  Yummy, and with organic sugar.<br /><br />However, today I was at our local grocers and noticed Zevia in the natural foods aisle.  I picked up several different cans to try.  My first one was the grape.  I noticed it wasn't colored purple.  I liked the taste.  I can't wait to try their cola, 'dew', lemon/lime, ginger ale and grapefruit citrus.  I am used to Stevia so if there is any aftertaste (I wasn't aware of any) I am used to it by now.<br /><br />I intend to buy more of this product - love it!

review/summary: Thrilled to have cola again - what a treat!
review/text: I have been using a stevia sweetened drink powder mix and it occured to me that there must be a soda out on the market by now.  Sure enough, I found Zevia at the local Whole Foods.  I started off with the Cola and have been absolutely thrilled by the great taste.  I haven't detected any after taste like some of the other reviewers and I'm usually pretty senstive to that.  The Black Cherry flavor is just incredible.  A very strong cherry flavor that is balanced well with the level of sweetness.  The Ginger Root Beer is quite pleasant, though it doesn't have a "creamy" taste like some sugar sweetened Root Beers.  The Lemon-Lime is fantastic.  I had to give up soda a number of years ago because Aspartame tends to give me heart palpitations and GI upset so Zevia is a real treat for me.

review/text: I've tried and failed many times to get off of Diet Coke. Only recently, when I switched to Zevia, was I finally able to break the habit. I used Zevia as a substitute until I could get used to drinking teas and water instead, and still have one on occasion if I have the urge for something bubbly. If you're used to Diet Coke, the taste difference is an adjustment, but over time I preferred the Zevia. We've also tried the orange and ginger root beer flavors, and my family enjoys them.<br /><br />I did have one bad shipping experience, where a case was damaged, but this is rare.

Phosphoric acid, which is in most colas is on the Barrett's forbidden list (ever notice how well it works for gitting rust of chrome?).  Anyway, before I started drinking Zevia cola, I did some research on fumaric acid, which is what is in Zevia instead of phosphoric acid.  I was very surprised to see that fumaric acid might have some anti-cancer properties, and has been examined in a number of cancer models including esophageal cancer with a surprising amount of success.  How could I resist Zevia cola.  Now I can really claim I'm drinking it for my health.

review/text: Zevia soft drinks are the best! I knew I had to stop drinking Diet Coke and other diet colas because of all the added chemicals: phosphoric acid! and aspartame, which causes cancer!!  Get off the chemical sodas and switch to Zevia.  I will never go back to drinking popular soft drinks again.  If you love your body, drink Zevia instead.  My favorite is the regular cola version, the lemon-lime is better than sprite, and the black cherry is pretty good also.  Trying Dr. Zevia this time.  My 21 year old son got me so paranoid about the dangers of aspartame, I knew I had to get off the added-chemical roller coaster (not only with sodas but other foods as well.  READ YOUR LABELS)  The only Zevia I don't care for is Root Beer, but I've never been a root beer fan.  If you like root beer, you will like the Zevia version, I'm sure.  Zevia is absolutely fantasic and all natural.  WOW!<br /><br />Amazon has the absolute best prices with no shipping/no tax/and a 15% discount with auto ship.  No more lugging all those heavy sodas from the health food store (which is where I was buyng them @ about 25-30% higher price).  These are delivered directly to my front door.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon!  Love the great customer service. and thank you ZEVIA!

I'd been trying to cut out diet pop from my diet for a while because of dangers I'd read about artificial sweeteners, but missed the fizzy goodness and caffeine fix too much to be successful. Since I discovered this, I've been able to make the switch happily. Zevia doesn't taste quite like diet pop, it's a *little* sweeter, but not nearly as sickeningly sweet as regular cola, in my opinion. A few people I know didn't care for the "stevia aftertaste", but I don't taste it at all with this cola. I watch for local food co-ops and Whole Foods to have sales on it (usually around $4.50/6-pk) and then I really stock up. Otherwise it runs about $6.50/6-pk normally.

I love that it has caffeine, they didn't get rid of that, like they do in other natural sodas. Overall it was great, and I will continue to buy it, I am tired of artificial sweeteners and the health risks that they may or may not post, like they would tell you.....right. I also hear that the major soda makers are coming out with similar formulas with stevia, so maybe that will bring down the price via competition.

review/text: A coke or pepsi fan would probably disagree since they are addicted to the heavy sugar or artificial sweeteners, and I never was a big cola fan, but this was really, really good.  Sweet but light; no mistaking the authentic cola flavor though.  Now if they would just make a grape soda I would be in heaven!<br /><br />I've been using stevia in my tea, smoothies, and hot cereal for years and hoping that it would start being used in food/beverage products like this so I hope this is just the beginning.  The FDA and an "unnamed" corporation have been trying to keep this all natural herb from American consumers as a sweetener.  It just kills me that we are the fattest, unhealthiest western nation in the world, mostly due to our addiction on sugar and artificial, processed food additives, and yet, something that is not only non-glycemic but actually healthy is being conspired from it's use.

review/summary: Wonderful soda alternative
review/text: All non sugar soda is going to have some kind of aftertaste.  So, in getting this, I was prepared for something "off".  I hated coke zero when I first had it, but after a couple sodas, I came to like it.  But now, I get horrible headaches from aspartame and had to stop.  Zevia cola is amazing!  The first one I had - same reaction... didn't like it.  But after halfway through a trial 6pk, I liked it.  At the end of it, LOVE them!  Now I've gotten used to the "stevia" flavor and really enjoy it.  It is a great find for those who cannot have sugar for whatever reasons, and also trying to stay away from aspartame!

review/summary: Guilt Free Cola
review/text: I can't remember a time in my 61 years of life that I have not been surrounded by either Coke or Pepsi, and I also remember when I was 14 years old sitting down to have 14 cavities filled due to their rotting away my enamel.<br />Then in the mid 60's came Tab. It was our society's first attempt at mass marketing a drink that should have been dropped over North Vietnam rather than consumed here.It was terrible.<br />I finally settled for the Diet Cokes and other products with Aspartame, but we all know the horror stories of it turning into horrible chemicals while sitting in hot warehouses (Probably in what was formally North Vietnam) not to mention what kind of damage that Phenylalanine can do to an unborn child or one who is as old as I am getting.<br />Then I found and started using Stevia in my coffee and thought it would be a great idea if someone would come out with a soft drink with this, natural sweetener with no known side effects.<br />I have tried some colas from my health food store with Stevia in them, but the taste took getting used to. I was about ready to write if off when my first order of Zevia came from Amazon. Wow! This stuff really tasted great, and had absolutely no "after taste". Just a great Cola that is easy on the enamel and the body. I highly recommend it and will gladly drink it from now on.

review/summary: The taste certainly lacks & it gave me gas and bloating...
review/text: I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the "big two" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard "bad things" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.<br /><br />But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.<br /><br />Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called "erythritol" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol "shouldn't" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it "supposedly" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.<br /><br />If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the "bad" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.

review/summary: Diet!?  But its good, tasting and for you...
review/text: Zevia is great.  I dont ever drink soda, but when I do, I definitely prefer the natural cane sugar GUUD stuff, like the mexican cola.  but then i saw this, and I have been using stevia for 2 years now, and I thought...hell, why not.  And the stuff is GREAT.  Dont let anyone fool you, it doesnt taste like a good mexican cola, or coca cola, it tastes like diet coke, but its better than water, and for someone like me who only has one every couple of days, its quite a treat...especially bc I know that it has no calories and isnt going to crystallize my baby-makers like aspartame does.<br /><br />Buy it...if you really can't stand the flavor, then don't buy diet soda, get the real stuff.  But I can assure you that this is a good choice.<br /><br />Ya, its kinda pricey, over a dollar a can, but soda shouldnt be drinken like water anyways...its suppose to be a treat, so a 24pack should last u a while.  I cant wait to try the orange and rootbeer flavors.

review/summary: "Not Yer Grand-dad's Cola"
review/text: This cola drink will "git 'er done" if you're wicked thirsty, otherwise, seek out that Diet Coke [TM] that you were really hankerin' for. The cola flavor was a trifle wishy-washy, with a slightly sourish aftertaste. I think that the herbal sweetener, stevia, is the culprit there. The carbonation was adequate, which helped to offset the taste factor. Beverages sweetened with stevia may be an acquired taste; we've got 23 more chances to test that theory!

review/summary: Give it a Chance, it Takes a Few Cans
review/text: I was addicted to diet coke but began experiencing ill effects from the aspartame. I gave up all artificial sweeteners and was thrilled when I found a soda sweetened with stevia. I was so excited to receive the shipment, however when I took that first sip of Zevia I thought it tasted terrible and my husband wasn't very pleased with it either. Not wanting to pour $18 down the drain we decided to finish it off but had no intention of purchasing any more. Well obviously Zevia is something your taste buds need to adjust to over time. Yesterday I opened my fifth can and wow! It actually tasted really good. I wondered whether the good taste was just a fluke possibly related to the flavor of the grilled chicken salad I was eating. Well, I opened my sixth can a few minutes ago and was wowed again. It tastes even better today. My husband had the same reaction and actually said he thinks it tastes better than diet coke now. I just ordered two more cases. If you are trying Zevia for the first time and don't like the taste, don't throw it out. Give yourself a few days to adjust to the flavor, you just might grow to love it. This review is for the cola flavor.

review/text: I was really exited to try this and very disappointed when I did. If you're looking for a substitute for Coke you won't find it here with this sickeningly sweet concoction. It might be a halfway decent replacement for Diet Coke or Pepsi as both of those are sweeter than Coke. On the other hand, the watered down nature of the "cola" flavor and the speed at which it loses carbonation probably eliminate it from contention for those as well. Very glad I only bought a 6 pack.

review/summary: Great Product Company Makes a Good (Not Great) Cola
review/text: Stevia sweetened cola has finally come of age and finally there is a no aspartame and no splenda alternative to sugar cola.  Well it's strange how this has a lot of the odd aftertaste of Diet Coke.  Now if you are saying "what odd aftertaste?" then trust me if you stopped drinking it and regular Coke for about 60 days and went back you'd say the same thing.  Definitely an aftertaste with this one but since it won't cause you the harm that sugar, aspartame, and splenda can then my vote is a thumbs up!  Not bad and I recommend it as a healthy alternative to the slow death (literally) the others have in store for you.

review/summary: Zevia is the healthy alternative
review/text: Zevia Cola, a non-caloric soda sweetened with stevia, is a healthy alternative to sugared sodas and diet sodas that use artificial sweeteners.  If, like me, you believe diet sodas are unhealthy, but you don't like sucking down all that sugar (especially high fructose corn syrup) try Zevia.  The flavor isn't as strong as a Coke, which is why it only gets four stars, but it tastes good. For those like me who like a stronger cola flavor, I like to mix a little bit of Coca Cola with it, say 1/4 can, or a bit of cola syrup, to give it a richer cola taste, without adding a lot of calories.  I haven't tried the other flavors yet, but I'm satisfied that Zevia is a good value, especially if you take a subscription.  Also, you can order extra, or delay delivery without losing the subscription price.  It's a little over a dollar a can at the subscription rate (shipping is free), which is well worth the price if you drink it for the same reasons I do.

review/summary: Awful aftertaste! Not all natural either
review/text: I bought this soda thinking that I drink too much Diet Pepsi or Pepsi Max, so this might be a better alternative.  Wrong.  This "all natural soda" has a terrible aftertaste and tastes nothing like cola unless you count the carbonation.  I wouldn't describe it as a "peppery" aftertaste as some have described, I would just say it's off-putting.  Look elsewhere, especially at $19 a 24-pack...no thank you.  Received two stars because it's carbonated and no sugar or calories...and look at the letters to another reviewer before me about the "all natural" claim being false.

review/summary: lacks carbonation and needs a little something extra
review/text: I picked up a six pack of this at my local co-op.  I get terrible migraines and after lots of food logging I have found that beverages with aspartame are a migraine trigger.  I hate coffee and it is not uncommon for me to be swigging a caffeinated beverage at 9 a.m.  So, I wanted to try an alternative to an aspartame laden diet beverage.<br /><br />I have consumed my six cans and the diet cola needs more carbonation and an added ingredient, perhaps vanilla, to round out the flavor profile.  Each of my cans tasted flat.  There was no fizz and no crispness that one would typically associate with a diet Coke or Pepsi.  The flavor was just lacking and I wanted more of a kick on the end.<br /><br />Would I drink it again?  I'm not giving up on Zevia.  I will likely try one of the diet flavored beverages.  I experienced no headaches after drinking this beverage and that is a plus.  Additionally, for a beverage that uses stevia, I didn't experience an awful aftertaste.  Stevia is a sweetener that needs to be applied in specific amounts to avoid a strange aftertaste.  I think it is just a matter of finding the right flavor of Zevia.

review/summary: A Flat Diet Soda
review/text: Zevia Cola reminds me of a Diet Pepsi, only flatter and with a weird-sweetener aftertaste. Frankly, I've come to expect disappointment when trying alternative (ie, non Coca-Cola Classic) colas, but this has the added negative of tasting like a Diet soda. I've never had stevia before, so I wasn't expecting the aspartame like aftertaste.<br />As far as organic colas go, Hansen and Blue Sky were quite a bit better than this. Rockstar did a pretty good job with their take on the flavor, but that's apparently been discontinued.

review/text: Are you tired of drinking diet drinks with artificial flavors and sweeteners? Then Zevia cola might be a good choice. This drink still contains caffeine which I indulge in occasionally when I feel tired or need a little energy boost. This drink seems sweeter than Coke or Pepsi but doesn't have an addictive flavor so you are less likely to over indulge. What is strange about this cola is that it contains nutmeg oil although the flavor is barely discernible. The great thing about this soda is that you don't feel guilty drinking it. You get sweetness without sabotaging your weight-loss efforts.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: This has totally replaced Coke in my life....I love Coke with Pizzas, Mexican Food & Chinese food especially.  Zevia is the best replacement ever.  I love it icy cold and it has NOTHING artificial.  If you look up the after affects of a lot of artificial sweeteners, it is scarey the problems they can cause.  The sugar in (1) regular Coca-Cola is more than your body can process in one entire day.  I have converted many diet Coke drinkers to Zevia.  A friend let me try one due to the fact I did not want to pay $8+ for a 6pack at Whole Foods, aka Whole Paycheck.  I'm so glad she did! I have this on repeat delivery which is also wonderful. I get free shipping and never run out! Wonderful product!

review/summary: Not bad for a soda
review/text: I just bought the cola flavor from Amazon and it tastes pretty good. It is different from regular coke, but not so different that I won't drink it again.  What I like about this is I get a healthier option for soda without the bad aftertaste of diet soda.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because nothing will ever beat regular Coca-Cola when it comes to cola flavored soda. But I don't like all the sugar that's in Coke.<br />The only downside right now is the price.  You are paying roughly $1.13 a can, but if you don't guzzle the stuff then it won't matter.  I do plan to buy some of the other flavors.

review/text: I'm just trying my first can of this soda, so it's a bit premature to review the product very well, but I'm just *so* excited that Amazon is offering stevia-sweetened sodas!<br /><br />Aspartame gives me a dull headache so I stay clear of it. And I've continued to drink sugary Pepsi in spite of the dental bills and groans from my bathroom scale. So I (and my dentist and scale) are really hoping this diet soda works out well for me.<br /><br />As for this drink, it does taste different from the regular Pepsi I usually drink. So far I like it better with a couple drops of real vanilla flavoring in it. (- I recently bought assorted flavorings and dropper bottles from Amazon.) I've always weathered variations in cola flavor with Dr. Pepper type drinks mixed in, so if my body okays stevia, I'll likely buy that flavor to try. But this cola with the vanilla added seems fine so far.<br /><br />I'm an Amazon Prime customer, which helps with the price and convenience.

I was SO happy to find Zevia at a local market- tried the cola & lemon/lime and had to have more! My local store only sold individual cans( not even 6 packs....go figure) and I let them know straight away that they were the only store in town selling Zevia and they were making a BIG mistake! So I bought TWO cases here(the 1st case arrived damaged, cans busted and a few empties)but since then they have arrived in perfect condition with much better packing. Very happy and a lifer, for sure!

review/summary: Did not like the taste
review/text: I bought these in hopes of finding a healthy alternative to other sodas.  I bought The Cola, Dr., Orange, and Root Beer.  I haven't tried the Root Beer yet.  But they all taste like diet soda.  After reading the can again, that is what they are: diet soda.  So if you are looking for something to replace your diet soda to get away from artificial sweetners, you might like this.  Don't look for this to replace your full-sugar sodas.  It tastes COMPLETELY diet. Don't look for it to taste like the brand names out there, though.  The Dr. tastes like a cherry soda.  Personally I do not plan to buy these again.  Since I only drink a full-sugar soda maybe twice/week, I think I will stick with that for now.<br /><br />Edit: I brought this up a star since my brother likes it. I was giving it a low ranking due to the "The rich cola flavor has no aftertaste." And it does have that diet aftertaste for me.

review/text: This is one of the most awesome pieces of japanese everyday cooking you can find. A thick, sweet curry sauce that's great with white rice. Always keep in mind the best way to prepare the meat for this kind of curry is in a slow-cooking pot the night before. This way you'll enjoy the melting taste of soft meat along with the exquisite curry sauce, and maybe you'd like to add a cup of water to the meat in the slow-cooker so you can use the broth later to replace part of the water needed for the sauce. This will increase the taste. Also, choose your meat carefully! Very soft pieces will literally melt in the slow cooker, while harder pieces will become tastier and just as soft as we want them to be.<br /><br />That aside, the rest is to follow the instructions in the box. Enjoy!

review/summary: Love Vermont curry
review/text: We've loved Vermont curry for many, many years. The only place we could buy it was from oriental stores that we would have to travel to. So this is soooo convenient now being able to just buy it and have it shipped to our door.<br />Vermont curry is different from the "Indian curry", though it did originate there. We fell in love with it in Japan. It is much more mild and has a very smooth taste. It is great! We use either chicken or shrimp and carrots, onions, potatoes,yams and celery. Sometimes I've even used beans and whatever vegetable I had. We then serve it over rice. Delicious!

review/summary: Loved it and felt extremely full.
review/text: After having bought a curry Roux pack from Walmart which was purely horrible my wife and I were hesitant to try again, but we eventually gave in and tried this Roux. It was simply awesome! Were did ours with Stewing Beef and poured it over short grain Asian rice (I used sushi rice actually because I have a personal love of it) and I couldn't eat enough. Even my pregnant wife ate half of her serving (Which is a lot for her at this point). We intend to have it again with chicken and one pack makes enough for dinner the next night ala leftovers.

review/text: My mom introduced me to this brand... she started using this recently instead of the Golden brand we grew up with.  It's a little hard to find this brand in Colorado, so I was excited when I saw an Amazon coupon and signed up for this via Subscribe and Save.  You get a lot of boxes, but it's such a bargain!<br /><br />I love my slow cooker, so I just throw in some cut up onions, celery, carrots, potato, mushrooms & meat, a whole box of the curry and fill with water.  Suuuuper easy!  I work with some vegetarians, so I left out the meat and brought the whole pot with some rice on the side and they LOVED it - NO LEFTOVERS!  They asked for the recipie and so I admitted it was a box mix and brought in a couple boxes to share since I had so much of it.  My co-worker made it for her husband this weekend with Elk meat and she said he LOVED it.  I was really surprised since he's a very "American, meat & potatoes, I hunt for my own food" kind of guy.  I've been told I'm making this for lunch again... :0)<br /><br />I like spicy foods, and mild usually doesn't have very much flavor, but since I have to cook for a toddler, I purchased the mild flavor and it has no shortage of flavor.  Didn't have to add salt at all, despite it slow cooking with potatoes all day (which usually suck up all the salt).<br /><br />Highly recommend... one thing to take into consideration is that the expiration date of all the boxes is in about 10 months.  Not sure if this is an isolated event, but something to take into consideration that I don't have much time to get through all 10 boxes.

review/summary: A MUCH better deal than what Safeway in SF offers!
review/text: I recently moved to Downtown SF and was disappointed to find that the nearest supermarket didn't have this particular brand. Heck, it was at least a year before that same Safeway on Market Street started selling tofu! (Yes, this is the same SF that has a high per capita of Asian immigrants and Asian Americans!).  While Safeway does sell Sunbird Curry mix, it's $1.43 per ounce compared to Vermont Curry here on Amazon, which is usually priced at roughly $0.43/oz with subscribe and save! The $5.50 clippable coupon that also seems to come up every so often makes this an even better deal.<br /><br />I'm an intermittent curry eater. Back when I used to live next to a Korean supermarket, I would stock up on Vermont Curry in mass quantities and prepare curry at home with chopped beef bits and veggies. It's very easy to make and hard to mess up even for an average joe like me. Just make sure to watch how much water you use. A quick tip for the beginners is it's better to underestimate how much water you need than it is to overestimate as you can end up with a really watery curry batch if you go overboard. If you live with roommates, always make sure to vent out the area by opening the windows or at least turning on the stove fan. The smell does carry far!

review/summary: Really good BUT...
review/text: This cereal is very yummy, however, for those prone to cavities or have deep groves in your teeth, beware. This easily sticks to your teeth and requires spending time with floss and toothpicks to remove. Simply brushing does not do. It also has a lot of artificial dyes and flavoring. The dyes will make your bowel movements green for several days (no kidding, this happened to me and my husband). With that said, I till keep eating this cereal at a minimum. I've also been having some stomach problems, not sure if it's related to this.

review/summary: Sukhi's Spice Mix Packets
review/text: I tried a couple of the Sukhi's spice mix packets. They had good flavor but are way over-priced for the amount of spice you get. The Gobi Aloo mix had 0.4 oz of spice which was barely enough to flavor the 2 cups of vegetables called for which is supposed to be 4 servings. One half cup of vegetables for a serving is pretty small in my opinion. If there was a decent amount of spice in the packet I would rate it higher. I got it on sale at $2 a packet and even at that price it felt like a rip-off.

review/text: Who decided that this could have the word cheddar included on the packaging? It bears absolutely no resemblance to cheese/cheddar or anything else that one might wish to consume in place of a cheese product. I purchased this for my 3 year old child who is being tested for a milk allergy. He loves mac and cheese, and I was hoping to get something that would provide a reasonably close substitution for it. Not even close. I tried doctoring it up with some dairy free margarine and milk substitute, still no go. We're better off just melting a slice of soy cheese over his noodles than wasting our time with this stuff. Oh, and for those looking to do the wheat free/dairy free diet for autism, be warned, this is a wheat-based product.

review/summary: Do Not Buy
review/text: I have a 33 pound 8 month old puppy who loves to chew (50% Pomeranian, 50% Australian Shepard). I sure caught the name "everlasting" in this product. I got her one and gave it to her the other day. She ripped it open and ate the treat (which is big) in 12 min, and then started to rip the rubber/plastic. This thing is garbage, any dog will rip right through it. Not only is it not "everlasting", it was about the worst lasting chew she has ever had. My advice is do not buy this product, your dog will eat right through it and end up ingesting plastic.

review/summary: Dog loved this toy, but my pocket book didn't.
review/text: The toy is a great concept.  My dog loved to roll it around and knaw on it.  Totally kept him occupied.  The unfortnate thing is this "everlasting" treat ball is far from everlasting.  My dog had both sides chewed down within one day.  After it was chewed down flat he wanted to have nothing to do with it.  The ball it's self is around 17 dollars and only came with one treat.  The ball fits 2 treats so you instantly have to buy the refill pack which costs about 8 dollars.  Cant afford 8 dollars a day in treats.

review/text: I thought it would be a good product for my rottie and bullmastiff, not so much, I was super mad that I spent so much money on something that didn't work. These are not cheap, and the refills are not cheap.<br />Pros:<br />Keeps them entertained<br />gives them a yummy treat<br />Cons:<br />keeps them entertained for about 5 minutes until they separate the treat from the ball. On the large size it is super hard to get the treat in the ball for the first time, but after the first round of play it becomes easier- there's a reason- the seal isn't any good anymore, so it's super easy for the dog to hold down on one side of the ball, and lift out the treat.<br />expensive<br />super messy, slobber and treat goo get all over this thing and on your floor<br />hard to wash and get dirt out of center folds

review/text: I bought one of these (the small size) from a pet store for my 15 lb Jack Russel mix. I was hoping for a toy that would hold together like a kong but was harder to get the treat out of. The first day we had it, it took a while for him to get the treat out but once he got it there was no problem and the plastic started to weaken. This wasn't a big deal because you can stuff the inside with more treats but after a while the plastic started to come apart in little chucks and the toy went from a possible kennel toy to have to be supervised...

review/text: Within the first day of giving this to my dog ( a large breed puppy), he chewed off several chunks of the ball on the side that holds the small treats and ate most of the "everlasting" big treat, but it kept him busy.  He chased it and chewed it, and even when I thought the treat was too gone for him to lick any more, he still was able to get more out of it.  While it's not as durable as it claims, it's durable enough and my dog does love it.  Also, it's dishwasher safe!

review/text: My two dogs love this treat/toy.  With the first dog, a pointer, it can last for days and she loves going back to it.  Unfortunately, the second dog I brought home from the shelter can get the large treat out in no time.  He then uses those strong jaws to break it up and swallows pieces too large for him to digest.  So I've had to stop giving them to him.<br /><br />If I still had just the pointer, I would have given this 5 stars.  So  you might want to try it to see if your dog will find it "everlasting"

review/summary: PitBull's best friend
review/text: I have a little pitty that chews through everything! No toy other then the black "extreme chew" Kong has stood the test of my dog Marley. I bought this on a whim after I had got fed up with wasting money on toys marketed as "super durable" and for "power chewers" that she would demolish in minutes and would ultimately end up garbage in a day. I figured the treat would keep her busy for while and the rubber felt fairly strong. Boy was I impressed! First though I have to mention that my dog has some unpleasant behavior with certain treat items (rawhides, beef bones, pigs ears) in that she has a drive to bury these things in what ever she can cover it with, which often tends to be bedding or under rugs. SO once I put the treat in the ball she was bound and determined to "bury" it in our apartment. The treat got nixed and I gave her just the ball. It has been her favorite toy for years! In fact she once lost it playing in her grandmas muddy yard on a rainy day, looked all over for it and gave up. She was devastated, kept searching for it at home, I was really surprised because she's never gotten attached to a toy like that before. I went out and hunted down a new one for her. Well about a year later while at her grandmas house I let her in from the yard and she's got TWO of these in her mouth the old one and the new one! Leave it to her to find it after all this time. I purchased the first one when she was 2yrs, it spent almost a year outside in Wisconsin's elements and yet it is still in perfect on condition going on 3 years old! Will post photo. Love this toy!

review/summary: Great for teeth, tough on the hands
review/text: I have a 50lb GSD mix who is, like many of the other dogs mentioned here, a ball of fur and teeth. We initially did not crate him (mostly because members of my family have a phobia of cages) and as a result are out four pairs of shoes, two pairs of prescription glasses, a desk, a leather chair, a leather couch, two desk chairs, and portions of our walls and several door jambs. Needless to say, we crate him now, but while that saved our furniture (what was left of it), it didn't solve our dog's need for mental stimulation. We saw this at Petsmart (for about 10$ more than it is listed here) and figured we had nothing to lose. (As a side note, he does now go to daycare 3 days a week, which helps with his energy levels substantially.)<br /><br />Our dog loves it! Where soft, squeaky, or any other kind of toy lasts only a matter of minutes (though he never did like Kongs) almost 7 months in, and the dog has yet to destroy the blue rubber ball. We have gone through at least a dozen packages of the "everlasting treats" made by the same company, which last on average about two days each for him. When we're out of those, we find we can put moderately sized training treats or bits of his kibble in the middle area and he has a grand time rolling it around and bouncing it off walls to get them out. In the summer we also like to smear peanut butter on the inside and freeze it for ten or fifteen minutes before giving it to him.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great investment for us. So much so that we ended up purchasing a second one that we fill with alternate flavors of treats or keep in reserve.<br /><br />My only complaints are these: One of the balls is very easy to get the everlasting disks into (consequently, it's also relatively easy for my dog to get them out again), while the other is so stiff it takes a very long time to get a disk into at all. After all that effort, I feel like my hands are completely worn out. (Edit: I hadn't seen a few other users trick of getting the edges of the treat wet to make it easier to slide into the ball. I will have to try that next time around). Also, the ball is expensive upfront, but lasts long enough to be worth it. The treat disks are also expensive, though, so that's something I've had to work into my budget.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a great toy for those dogs that need a toy that can stand up to them. Definitely recommended!
