review/summary: Coffee K cups, assorted flavors.
review/text: Coffee was delivered in a very timely fashion, the product selection within was very good. I do have one very large complaint about the shipment. There were at least 6 K-cups that had broken top seals and there was loose product all over the box, causing a loss of coffee obtained for the money.  I may not select this again in the future, even tho what was usable was good.

review/text: There are so many unique flavors, it's hard to choose which one to try next. We've had southern pecan, chocolate donut, pumpkin spice, and not a bad coffee in the bunch! This was a great idea for a 1st time keurig owner; now we know what we want to order in bulk.

review/text: My wife and myself enjoyed all the different flavors included in the box. Each type of coffee included about 4-5 duplicates. Overall price the was a bit much compared to COSTCO and some the other locations. However,the different premium selections made it a nice treat ( Gloria Jeans, Kahlua Coffee Cafe, Wolfgang Puck, Green Mountain, The Donut Shop). I will probably pick up another box at Amazon.

review/text: I bought this item reading the reviews and hoping that the seller had addressed the assortment issue.<br />I received the coffee today and can report that they were packaged well in a sturdy box. None of the kcups were damaged and I didn't expect them to be since they are rather durable. Majority of the flavors seem to trend on different brands of hazelnut and vanilla but it'll be nice to see how each varies. I thought the assortment was great. I only received 9 doubles out of a box of 35. Highly recommended. I just ordered another one! After all, variety is the spice of life!<br /><br />I received:<br /><br />[Grove Square]<br />Spiced Apple Cider<br />Caramel Apple Cider<br />French vanilla cappuccino<br />Caramel cappuccino<br />Hazelnut cappuccino<br /><br />[Gloria Jeans]<br />French Vanilla Supreme<br />Hazelnut x2<br /><br />[Timothy's]<br />Kahlua original<br /><br />[Green mountain coffee]<br />Caramel vanilla cream x2<br />Golden french toast x2<br />French vanilla iced coffee<br />Mocha nut fudge x2<br />French vanilla<br />Wild mountain blueberry<br />Gingerbread<br />Spicy eggnog x2<br />Southern Pecan<br />Hazulnut<br /><br />[Donut house]<br />Cinnamon roll x2<br />Choconut glazed donut x2<br /><br />[Wolfgang Puck]<br />Jamaica me crazy x2<br />Hawaiian Hazulnut x2<br />Vanilla Francaise<br />Creme caramel<br /><br />[Van houtte]<br />Hazelnut

If, however, you like your coffee a bit bold, it's not.  Most were very mild roasts, and adding a tiny bit of cream overpowered the brew.  One purchase was enough.

review/text: I was excited to get this varitey pack for our keurig, it seemed to have the best varitey I have seen for the best price. However when we got it it was 87% Green Mountain Brewing company and several of the same flavor, and not all that are shown above are in the assortment we recieve, which is a bummer because I wanted to try butter toffee and the donuthouse brand.. I suppose if you bought it again you would get different flavors but then you run the risk of getting a bunch you already tried and didnt like.. :/ But honestly this still is a good deal and all the flavors we have tried thus far have been very good..

review/text: I bought this sample pack for my daughter's 16th birthday to go with a Keurig coffee maker. The description indicates 3 different cappuccinos and an iced coffee flavor. I realize flavors could be substitiuted, but there was only one flavor of cappuccino and NO iced coffee flavors. The only reason I selected this sampler pack was because it included coffees, cappuccinos, and iced coffees. (The iced and cappuccino flavors are her favorite and she got 1 of those the rest was coffee.) This was not what I expected!

review/text: First order came in a brown paper bag.  One of the K-cups was crushed.<br /><br />I was happy enough with the selection to place a second order in February of 2012.<br /><br />This time, the K-cups came in a cardboard box; they were loose, but none were crushed.<br />I received the following flavors to give you an idea of what you may receive:<br /><br />Hazelnut noisette x2<br />Vanilla francaise x2<br />French vanilla cappacino x2<br />Hazelnut cappuccino<br />Hazelnut<br />French vanilla supreme<br />Golden french toast x2<br />Creme carmel x2<br />Cinnamon roll x2<br />Chocolate glazed donut x2<br />Hawaiian hazelnut aloha noisette x2<br />Kahlua original x2<br />Jamaica me crazy<br />Souther pecan<br />Mocha nut fudge<br />Butter toffee<br />Gingerbread x2<br />Spicy eggnog x2<br />Wild mountain blueberry x2<br />Camel vanilla creme x2<br />Hazelnut decaf<br />French vanilla decaf<br />French vanilla<br /><br />Not sure why they added the decaf cups - those were disappointing.  And there were 7 Vanilla/French vanilla variants and 7 Hazelnut variants.  It would be better if they limited these to two each.<br /><br />I probably will order again, but I would order from someone else if they guaranteed that there were no decaf and very limited French Vanilla & Hazelnut additions.

review/summary: VERY little selection
review/text: I was very disappointed with the selection in this assortment. The description listed 25 flavors....I received 5 flavors which mostly consisted of Pumpkin Spice and Eggnog with just one or two of the other flavors (french vanilla, hazelnut, mocha nut fudge)thrown in. This is not at all what was advertised; I understand that the description stated that "flavors may be substituted without notice" but there is a HUGE difference between 25 and 5 flavors. I really feel like they took their leftover holiday flavors that didn't sell and just threw them in a bag. The quality of the coffee itself was very nice I just wish that the product was what was advertised.

review/summary: A one-time thing.
review/text: Although I'm glad I gave these a try, and it was exciting to try new flavors each time, most of the flavors were not to my liking.  The ones I thought I would like for sure turned out to be the worst (Kahlua, Mudslide, Chocolate Donuts, Eggnog).  They sounded delicious, but were not.  On the plus side, most of them smelled very good when brewed.  But the flavors or type of roast used were not to my liking.<br /><br />The best of the bunch was Southern Pecan.  Good, mellow, nice flavor.  I will order more of these.<br /><br />Also you should note these are all just flavored coffee - meaning there is no sugar or creamer added, and they are not cappuccino.  I was expecting some of them might be given their names (made them sound sweet, or creamy).  But they are all just plain coffee with flavors added, but no sugar or creamer.  So if you are worried about Hydrogenated Oils like I was, don't worry, none is included in these :).

I received just 11 different varieties and as many as 6 of 3 kinds..Not really much variety at all and none of many of the flavors shown in the purchase advertisement. I realize it said in the description that substitutions might be made without prior notice, but only 11 different varieties in an ad claiming 25 different varieties is a far cry from a few substitutions.  I'll look elsewhere next time for the variety packs.

review/summary: Seasonal overstock?
review/text: It was clearly a hodgepodge of seasonal overstock thrown in a brown paper bag. The packaging was sloppy, and most of the flavors were holiday ones that I'm guessing they were trying to get rid of (Eggnog, gingerbread, pumpkin spice, etc). None were broken, and it is nice to try new flavors, I just wish it wasn't so blatantly a way to flush out seasonal product! I got these as a gift for someone with a new machine so he could try a variety of flavors, but now I'm afraid the gift will look cheap since it appears to be a post-holiday special. A plus is that none of them were broken and all were accounted for.

review/text: I was really excited to get my package in the mail. The description of the different flavors sounded sooooooooo yummy and I couldn't wait!! However, like most of the other reviews on here, I was very disappointed. I only got three or four different flavors, two of which had a hole in them. They were just randomly thrown in the box, no effort was made to protect them during shipping. The flavors that I really wanted to try, NONE of them were in there. I got a lot of de caf french vanilla, some gingerbread (which is out of season and I'm a little uneasy to try), and a lot of Jamaican me Crazy. I must say, my excitement level to try this coffee has shot way down and I will not purchase from this seller again.

review/text: We ordered this package of 35 because it had the three cappucinno k-cups. And when we got the package (a shipping box with a bunch of k-cups thrown inside like other reviewers stated) there were NO cappucinno k-cups! Why include them in the image for sale if they aren't going to be in the sampler?!? Will not be ordering from them again.

review/summary: I Suspect I Got Lucky
review/text: I got a very nice assortment, but I suppose that may attributable to luck considering all the other negative reviews.  I purchased two variety packs the other being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HGAVDI">Crazy Cups Travel The World Sampler, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 35)</a> and the variety of that one was awful, providing more evidence your selection will come down to luck. I will say that three of the K-cups didn't seem to have the seal pressure of the others, leading me to believe that the may have been punctured.  This is concerning in itself and certainly could affect the freshness.  All in all, I would suggest that if you are picking this sampler because of specific coffees listed, don't; you'll likely be disappointed. If you just want to try some different K-cups go for it.

review/text: I ordered this product even after reading several negative reviews and hoped for the best. I was not disappointed. I did receive the product in a brown paper bag. However, I didn't see anything wrong with the packaging. There were 35 K cups in the bag and all were in good condition.  I received 11 differet brands/flavors. The most of any flavor was the French Vanilla at 9 and the least was the Chocolate Glazed Donut at 1. Some of these I have tried and they are excellent. Others I look forward to trying and would definitely buy this product again.

Can't wait to try more Crazy Cups Assortments!  They do arrive loose in a box, but no damage was noted to any of my K-cups.  I will just be throwing them in my desk drawer anyway, so packaging doesn't matter to me!

review/summary: Poor selection, terrible customer service
review/text: The verbage on the ad read "try 25 different flavors without buying 25 boxes!" My bag (Yes, it was just a paper grocery sack with a bunch of k-cups tossed in) only had 10 different flavors. And of the 35 k-cups I received, 25 were 1 of 3 flavors (Green Mountain french vanilla, Mocha Nut Fudge, and Caramel Vanilla Creme). Then there were 1 or 2 of a few other flavors thrown in.<br />I contacted Amazon Customer service, who was very helpful and directed me to the seller directly since Deals for You is a 3rd party seller. They emailed me back and said that they had just changed the ad, that when I ordered (a week prior) the ad didn't specify 25 different flavors (it did, I specifically checked that and ordered because of that promise). They then blamed the issue on Amazon, saying Amazon puts these orders together and they can't control it. So they lied to me, called me a liar, misrepresented their product, and then refused to do anything to make the situation right when it was called to their attention.<br /><br />I have never left a negative review on this site, but after the service I received here, I have left negative reviews for both the seller and product.

The biggest thing though, is they did not send me what the picture showed.  The majority of them were from the Holiday collection - spiced eggnog, gingerbread and french toast, and I don't think those are even in the picture!  It's like they put in there whatever is on sale at the stores - I just bought the Holiday variety box at Bed, Bath & Beyond for half off, so I was very disappointed that the majority of the 35 were from that collection.  I won't buy them like this anymore.

review/text: I too am disappointed in my "variety pack."  I too think the description and pictures are misleading! Shame on you Amazon! I thought I was getting the assortment pictured with two surprise flavors.  I spent a lot of time looking at the pictures of different listings to figure out which assortment I wanted. I received the shipment, no real complaints there, but was disappointed that 40% was French Vanilla from two different companies. Out of 35 cups that's 40% of total. I also had 6 flavors I didn't like at ALL (Holiday leftover flavors like Pumpkin Spice and Gingerbread, Spicy Eggnog).  Take 6 I don't like and didn't think I was getting (thought it was TWO random) and I really didn't save any money from buying in a store in town. I think the deception comes in the picture of k cups with two pictures of "surprise" flavors. I did go back and read the actual listing and to the sellers defense it says AT LEAST two random flavors.  First time Shame on ME, Second Time Shame on You AMAZON! The product SHOULDN'T be listed as a Variety Pack with specific pictures but rather listed as a GRAB BAG of random flavors from a variety of companies.  I will NOT purchase again as I am throwing away the six terrible flavors. Next time I will get with friends and have a swapping of flavors so I know what I am getting and not pay shipping!!

review/text: My 35 pack just arrived and I had opened it worried because some of the reviews had been so negative. Well I don't know if something has changed since then, but this was such a great deal. Exactly what I had been hoping for. They came in a STURDY box and NO DAMAGE was done to any of the K-Cups. It's random for sure, so results may vary from mine but I got:<br /><br />21 DIFFERENT varieties.<br />No more than TWO of the same flavor.<br />GMC: 2 Pumpkin Spice, 2 Southern Pecan, 2 Spicy Eggnog, 2 Blue Mountain Blueberry, 2 Mocha Nut Fudge, 1 Gingerbread, 1 Hazelnut, 2 French Vanilla Decaf (this is my only gripe, I was under the impression there would be no decaf)<br />Gloria Jeans: 2 French Vanilla Supreme, 2 Mudslide, 1 Hazelnut<br />Timothy's: 2 Kahlua, 1 Cinnamon Pastry, 1 Mocha Java, 1 Decaf Hazelnut<br />Wolf Gang Puck: 2 Creme Caramel, 2 Hawaiian Hazelnut, 2 Jamaica Me Crazy, 1 Vanilla,<br />Donut House, 2 Chocolate Glazed Donut, 2 Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />All in all, brilliant! Like I said, my ONLY issue and the reason I was gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the decaf thrown in. It won't get drank at my house. The 24 pack says caffeinated only, the 35 pack doesn't specify but it surely implied it would be the same type of assortment. It looks like a lot of the 35 boxes have a few decaf thrown in, so watch out for that if you mind it.

review/summary: Poor presentation...
review/text: Not much to say here. Literally a cardboard "shipping" box filled with k-cups. Looked like somebody just grabbed a handful and just threw them in a box and sent them off. This may not bother some but to me this is poor presentation. I would have expected something similar to what you find in stores. An individual "manufacturer's" type boxing sent in a shipping box. Frankly, I worried about the integrity of the product. How would I know who or where this product came from. For all I know someone picked them from a "refused" batch and simply threw them in a box and called it good. Additionally, upon further inspection the k-cups looked a little dirty. It appeared that they had collected dust. Not sure if this was due to the packaging or simply bad product. I guess that's about it. I can't really speak to the actual coffee itself since I didn't try it.<br /><br />I should be fair and say, upon calling amazon with my concern they were happy to refund me entirely and asked that I dispose of the product since it's a non-returnable item. I will be tossing this.

review/text: I purchased this thinking I would get an assortment of several K-cups to try. I had 7 varieties, but with the name "sampler" pack I assumed there would only be 2-3 of each kind so I could sample several kinds to decide what I like, not just test the same flavor 5-6 times each.  Packaging was a brown paper bag taped shut and placed in a box with bubble wrap--some of the cups are a little dented. Not impressed overall. If I could return it I would and I will not order from this company again.

However, the listing - which reads "ships in its own packaging" - isn't truly descriptive:  it's just 35 K-cups tossed into a mailing box and sent loose.  Perfect for enjoying yourself, but if you plan on gifting them, be prepared for a lot of tedious wrapping.

She liked the variety of flavors. But the review, as I understand it, is about the product.  The cups fit the maker, the coffee tastes great (I guess since I do not drink coffee).  The product is a bit pricy but worth it.  Come on Amazon.  Get a grip.  I realize now that if I did not have 300 words to describe my opinion, I should not have left one.  However, I liked the efficiency of the vendor and the quality of the product.  I give them 5 stars.

There was only one of each flavor, but no bad reviews from the gang as they enjoyed each one of the k-cups in this sampler!  I would order it again!

review/text: This is a lovely assortment of terrific flavors!  I definitely found many that I would purchase separately!  I had a wonderful time sampling each one and only found one that I would not think of trying again.  Not bad!  I definitely recommend this collection.  However....the artwork that comes with this is not necessary and quite cheaply produced.  It went out with the shipping box.  All in all, I would order this assortment again.  It's nice to have so many flavors to choose from, especially when expecting dinner guests.  RECOMMENDED!!!

review/summary: Great Variety - Functional Packaging
review/text: The variety in this Sampler pack is just what we had hoped for; several brands, several flavors within each brand, something for everybody!<br /><br />The packaging for this sampler box is as described by other reviewers - functional for shipping. It did not appear to be a "gift pack." The coffee arrived quickly, intact, and as described.  The poster was included in a tube.<br /><br />We bought this coffee to enjoy on a daily basis in our own home, not for a gift.  The box was recycled 2 minutes after it arrived and the coffee placed in our carousel for ease of selection and enjoyment.  It is terrific to have a selection of brands and flavors without having to order or buy box after box.<br /><br />I can't wait until this product is available again.  We will order another as soon as it is.

review/summary: Great variety, but glad"Gift Pack" was not actually a gift
review/text: I'm very happy with the variety of coffee in this pack and all of the cups arrived intact without damage, but like several other reviewers I was surprised to find that the actual "gift pack" presentation did not resemble the picture at all - product was loose in a smaller cardboard shipping box inside of a larger cardboard shipping box.  Not a big deal since I bought this package for myself, but I would've been disappointed if I was planning to give it as a gift.<br /><br />I did recieve the print in a cardboard tube, but the edges of the print were completely wrinkled and even torn in spots from where the tube was bent shut at the ends.  I didn't buy this product for the print so I don't really care, but thought it was worth mentioning in case anyone wants to collect the prints that come with this coffee.

review/text: The coffee was great.  It's a wonderful variety of flavored coffees. If you're looking for regular coffee, you'll need to order that separate.  On another note, I'm giving this just 4 stars because there is no limited edition print.  Additionally, the K-Cups come loose.  They are just in a box that's in another box.  If you want to give this as a gift, you'll need to figure something out more presentable.

review/text: I understand that you may not get the coffee you expect and it's a grab bag. However, when I order flavored COFFEE, I expect to get COFFEE not apple cider. I feel like that's not actually being too specific (on my part). If it's a full on grab bag, call it grab bag. So, in short, YOU WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE GETTING WHEN YOU ORDER THIS.

These were clearly purposely placed in the order so that they could sell otherwise unsalable merchandise.<br />The packaging was fine.  These crushed K-Cups were in the middle of the bag, surrounded by undamaged K-cups.<br />Also, there were 8 of the same K-Cup, and then 6 of another.<br />There was NO Mudslide, Caramel Vanilla Cream, French Vanilla, Mocha Nut Fudge, Hawaiian Hazelnut, Jamaica Me Crazy, Vanilla Francaise, or Butter Toffee K-Cups.  8 of the advertised flavors were not present.<br />There were 9 K-Cup flavors that are not on the list of included K-Cups.  These included unpopular flavors.<br />This was pretty much a complete rip-off.

review/text: SO GLAD I didn't listen to the negative reviews. If you read carefully the product owner said in Dec 2011 they changed the way they were selecting the types of coffee and doing so more carefully. This came today in a box (no paper bag like others have said) I counted them out and there were 35 like I ordered and there were very few repeats. The only one not there shown in the pic is the Iced coffee, but there were 2 flavors that were NOT pictured that more than made up for that. All expiration dates are for this coming summer and the box is labeled as expiring 4/19 (so im sure this is to make sure they dont sell any boxes with even 1 expired k cup). DO NOT pay attention to reviews that are dated after Dec 2011 because since they have changed the way they are doing things I think they gave me what I paid for, I paid about 20 dollars for 35 k cups of all varieties  I got what I wanted and saved a ton of money. Very happy, just hoping others arent scared away of a good deal because of OLD reviews. Thanks!

It looks like this company is responding to complaints that others have had, because the box was labeled with an expiration date (although as others have said, the pods were just thrown into the box).

review/text: I ordered this 35 cup assortment hoping for a wide variety of different brands and flavors to try new ones out with out having to buy a whole pack of the same one and not ending up liking it. First off, the package did come on time. But when i opened it, the cups were in a brown paper doggy bag, and a couple had broken and made a mess all over the bag. They weren't shipping carefully, no bubble wrap or anything. Just thrown in a paper bag. Than when i took them all out, out of all 35 cups, i got mainly Green Mountain Coffee. I got 3 Caramel Vanilla Cream, 7 Hazelnut, 2 Ginger bread, 3 Pumpkin Spice, 3 Mocha Nut Fudge, 2 Southern Pecan, 8 French Vanilla. (Thats 28 Green Mountain Coffee k-cups out of 35!) and than one random brand called Jet fuel, and one random Donut House, 2 Newmans Own, and 2 french vanilla Timothy's. Overall, only order from these people if you like Green Mountain coffee....and French Vanilla.

I thought by the description and picture that I was going to get a couple of each variety, so I could try each one to see which one I would like best.

This is not what I call a 'coffee' assortment but rather a bunch of awful flavored instant drink mixes. Add to that the fact that the expiration dates are only 2 months away and it is one bad deal.

review/summary: Awful purchase - not as described or pictured - DO NOT BUY
review/text: This assortment was AWFUL.  I received 10 of the same flavor of holiday flavors (I ordered after the holidays) as well of 5-6 of other flavors.  This picture shows 35 different varieties, but I only received a few different flavors.  Also, these were shipped in a brown paper bag which caused many of the cups to be damaged.  I am very very disappointed with this order.  I will never purchase anything from Deals on Call LLC through Amazon.  It's a shame Amazon doesn't monitor its vendors more closely.

review/summary: Very, very poor sampler pack.
review/text: Ok, maybe it's me, but when I see that this is a sampler, with TONS of different flavors listed, I assume that I am going to get just that - tons of different flavors. Or atleast give me a similar number of each flavor. This order was a joke from the beginning. It arrived in a punctured box but perhaps that happened in delivery. I open the box and find a paper bag, stapled shut. I open the paper bag & find a bunch of tossed in k-cups. Then when I pull them out, I counted that I had like 9 of one flavor, and 1 of some and 2 or 3 of others... This really is incredibly unorganized. I will not buy from this vendor again.

review/summary: What assortment?
review/text: When I ordered this item, I decided to be optimistic despite all of the comments about the "variety" received.  However, I  should have listened.  When I received the "package" it was 35 k-cups just thrown into a paper bag and they have a dusty/grimy feeling to all of the cups as if they have been sitting around on a dirty shelf.  As for the "variety" of k-cups I received 6 spicy eggnog, 6 gingerbread, 6 butter toffee, 6 supreme french vanilla, 6 southern pecan, 3 chocolate glazed donut, 1 golden french toast, and 1 mocha nut fudge!  To say the least I felt like they were just trying to get rid of the winter flavors (both of which I do not care for but now stuck with).  I will take my business elsewhere next time I want a true variety pack.

review/summary: Photo of selection is VERY misleading
review/text: Maybe we're the only ones that actually enlarged the photo of the 35 K Cups before we placed our order.  We wanted to make sure that the variety was indeed something that we felt we would enjoy.  Obviously "variety" is just that, various flavors.  However we did expect to at least receive ONE of each flavor shown on the photo, and we did NOT expect to receive SEVEN pumpkin spice, FIVE eggnog, and FIVE Gingerbread (none of which are in the display photo) when placing our very first order with Amazon in January!  Of the 35 K Cups, 17 (almost half) were holiday flavors - I mean, come on at least be honest enough to promote the product as "nearing experation holiday coffee samplers that we can't get rid of...here's hoping you won't notice".  Seriously, give a little credit to the intelligience of your customers, or in our case "first and only orders".
