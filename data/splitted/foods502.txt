review/summary: A Special Treat.
review/text: We have a couple cats as a part of our household. They always seem to be hungry and underfoot when we're in the kitchen. We feed them twice a day and mostly with dry prepared cat food. One of them requires a prescription dry cat food because of a urinary problem. In any case, I'd think the little dears would get awfully tired of that dry crunchy stuff so every once in a while we give them some special treats. My wife bought a variety of Fancy Feast Appetizers for them and every now and then we split a flat between the cats in addition to the dry crunchy granules. Do they like the appetizers? Oh, yeah! But then, they're not really fussy and will eat almost any type of cat food. I guess, the treats mainly relieve our guilt feelings.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Great Tasting Coffee!
review/text: Great Tasting Coffee!  I only knew Green Mountain Coffee in small K-cups, and never thought about the company and/or quality until I received a sample for review from Bzz Agent.  I now know that this is a great coffee and good company.  I received two bags - Pumpkin Spice and House Blend for review.  Both are equally wonderful.  Both are Fair Trade Certified, and Made in the USA - two great things, - support our planet, and support US economy.  Both House Blend and Seasonal Pumpkin Spice are Kosher, carrying  symbol.  Very nice packaging, and I love the one way valve that let's you smell the coffee.  Great feature if you have someone over and want to let them smell the coffee before you brew it.<br /><br />House Blend is USDA organic, which is great.  Coffee tastes just as it says - Medium Roast, with very nice full body and is not overly acidic.  Regular grind is nice size grind and not small powder that you get with some other brands.  Coffee keeps its taste both hot and cold.<br /><br />Seasonal Pumpkin Spice surprised me by the fact that it is not overly spiced.  I generally do not like spiced coffee as most of the spiced varieties completely overpower the taste of coffee, but it is not the case here.  Wonderful blend where spices are just right - giving you nice taste of coffee with just a hint of spices bringing you in touch with the season.  Seasonal Pumpkin Spice is lighter than House Blend, but very unique and first Pumpkin Spice Coffee that I was able to truly enjoy.  Probably worth mentioning that Pumpkin spice does have both natural and artificial flavors, and artificial flavors are a minus in my opinion, but it absolutely does not impact the overall outstanding quality.  Just as the house blend, nice grind and keeps all the flavors when cold<br /><br />I am now a fan of Green Mountain Coffee and would definitely recommend it as high quality, great tasting, not overly acidic, premium coffee, that can be enjoyed both hot and cold!!! Great Job Green Mountain Coffee!!!

review/summary: Colorful treat
review/text: The Wilton Christmas Confetti arrived quickly and I was pleased to see it true to the photo in color and shape.  These tasty decorations really "pop" on our treats. They made them stand out. (We've gotten other brands and similar products that arrived as crushed and broken circles.  Likewise, in the past we've also had some that were very dull and even discolored.) These looked great.  Bright white, brilliant red and crisp green!  The price was great and the product wonderful.  We plan to order more before the holiday baking take off at our house.<br />Pros:<br />Colorful<br />True to shape and size<br />Cons:<br />Wish they had larger container sizes online!

review/summary: What happened???
review/text: This is a great product, however, I do not understand why this juice had DOUBLED in price over the last few months. It is also no longer eligible for Prime shipping, adding even more to the price tag. Nearly $60 for 12 small bottles of juice is absurd! Especially when I first began buying them for a mere $23 with free shipping.<br /><br />Also, as much as I love that the bottle is spill proof as many reviewers say, it is not "leak proof". If you shake the bottle for a minute (such as to work in probiotic powder) juice will get all over your hands. Not a huge deal as you can just wipe it off and go, but it does continue to drip out a few more drops while being consumed.<br /><br />*stars are for the lack of availability and price gauging, not the actual quality of the product!

review/summary: Organic and makes strong tea
review/text: A lot of tea, excellent bulk, strong and fresh, good for making summer iced tea pitchers or any quantity drinking.  Hot with stevia and lemongrass oil drops is wonderful. I have tried other brands but the bagged lemongrass teas have too little tea in the bag per what I wanted. This is a lot of tea! There is some fine powder but it dissolves quickly, and it's mostly lemongrass leaves/stems. At first sight it seemed a little dry=, but the quality is good. One scoop makes a strong cup.  And it's one of the only organic lemongrass teas. Also the package is now sealable, keeps it fresh. air-tight seal-able. Lemongrass is also available in essential oils, a drop or two enhances tea (or Thai coconut soup). Repeat order!

review/summary: More like Lemongrass Powder than Tea
review/text: I rarely review anything but this may save someone from making a mistake.<br /><br />I tried lemongrass tea from another source (adigo tea) and really liked it so I looked for a cheaper bulk source on amazon.  I figured all lemongrass tea must at least be similar.  Boy was I wrong.  This tea has the consistency of finely ground sawdust. There are no real leaves from the lemongrass plant.  What's worse, is that the taste is very weak and somewhat weird.  I tried several different steeping temps and times with no luck.  This whole bag is now going in the garbage as I've ordered new stuff from my original source.

review/summary: Ehhh, not so much....
review/text: Being at the point of my life when going out for dancing and cocktails with my husband is never going to happen again and going out for dinner is getting closer and closer to the time when we used to go out for lunch, I needed a new stimulating activity and chose trying new coffees to fill that need.<br /><br />Sooooooo, after reading all the 5 star kudos about Jacobs Meister Rostung coffee (ground) and judging that the price was right I hit the "add to cart" button.<br />The coffee arrived yesterday and all 4 packs were tightly vacuum sealed so they're fresh. Good.<br />Opened a pack and the first thing I noticed was that the coffee looks quite dry.<br />Brewed a pot after dinner for myself and a dinner guest so I had someone to share the "fun" with. He drinks his coffee with sugar only and for me it's just cream.<br />We sipped, tasted, considered, mulled over and sniffed our cups of coffee.<br />Here's the conclusion: It has a very earthy taste, not terrible but my taste buds weren't cheering at all. It is also a bit acidic for my taste even with cream or in my guest's case, sugar added. Over all the flavor reminded me very much of the Costa Rican blend coffee that famous $4.00 a cup place sells and I don't like that one very much either.<br />Also, for the first time in eons my stomach felt very acidic after finishing my cup of coffee...can't blame that entirely on the coffee - it might have been from my cooking.<br /><br />Overall this coffee was dry, has a very earthy taste, seemed acidic and will not be on my 'will buy again' list.

review/summary: Good Quality Rose Congou Type Tea - Light Easy-Drinking
review/text: The first thing you notice when you open up the tin is the aromatic floral scent of rose but it's not overpowering.  Once brewed, the tea is a deep red color and rosy tasting.  It makes for a mellow cup of tea and is easy drinking and light in caffeine.  You can enjoy a whole pot full here and this makes it great company with a long novel.  Definitely not a bracing breakfast style tea if that's what you're looking for but if you like subtle aromatic teas, this is a sure bet.  Doesn't get bitter even with oversteeping.  A real pleasure.  If you like this, try lychee congou if you can track it down.  Very aromatic and mellow as well.

review/summary: A fantastic addition to my tea assortment!
review/text: I should start by mentioning that, although I have enjoyed a wide variety of teas over the last ten years or so, I am not the most refined tea drinker here so you should probably check out some of the other reviews as well.<br /><br />I discovered Taylors of Harrogate probably 5 years ago and I have loved their breakfast teas very much. I had not come across their China Rose Petal until a few months ago when a British import shop opened in a nearby town (Haddonfield, NJ). I bought it because I loved the jasmine petal teas that I bought when I was in China and I love a certain rose incense, so I figured that I would love rose petal tea as well.<br /><br />When I tried it I was slightly disappointed because it wasn't very strong, by my standards, though I admit that most tea drinkers probably appreciate delicate teas as much as they do strong teas, though perhaps in different situations. I like my tea to look like coffee once I've added milk and this wasn't strong enough for me so I had to try again, this time blending the rose petal tea with a stronger unflavored black tea. It was in this way that I settled on an absolutely fantastic afternoon tea - one cup of water, one teaspoon of China Rose Petal, and a bag of P.G. Tips.<br /><br />Rose Petal Leaf Tea has made an excellent addition to my assortment of tea and I enjoy it in my own way all through the winter. If you aren't as hung up on strong tea as I am you will likely appreciate subtleties that I miss doing it my way. Either way, if you are interested enough in rose petal tea to read reviews on Amazon then I can only imagine that you will get your money's worth from Taylors of Harrogate China Rose Petal.

From Yorkshire Gold, ideal for cold winter afternoons, to the classic Earl Grey, Tayors' teas are top of the line.  China Rose Petal tea is perfect blend of a black tea with a light addition of a few rose petals.  The bouquet is sublime. The taste terrific.  Strongly recommend.

review/text: Black tea not only tastes and smells good, but has a multitude of health properties.  Black tea has been credited with regulating blood sugar; may prevent stroke; promotes heart health; boosts energy and has a fraction fo the caffein found in coffee.  It's also a good stress buster.  Black tea also helps to maintain healthy cardiovascular and circulatory systems.<br /><br />This tea has a rich, pleasant aromaof rose petals.  The tea itself takes on a rosy color when you brew it.  The tea itself has a soothing, pleasant flavor and you can actually polish off a pot of this tea.  For those who like a gentle, subtle flavor and a gentle, subtle drink, then you want this tea.  This tea is a good companion with some soothing George Harrison and a good read.  I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: The smell of the leaves themselves are extremely fragrant, yet the tea itself has a light rosy flavor and is very soothing. It also comes at a great price! You get a lot of tea leaves with this order. I drink this fairly often and I plan on buying more once I run out, but that won't be for a very long time.

review/summary: My favorite Rose Petal leaf tea
review/text: I have compared this with the Tao of Tea Rose petal black, and it's far superior. Not only do you get more quantity, the quality is higher as well. This tea has larger, tastier leaves, larger and more abundant rose petals, and doesn't contain any "rose essence" to make up for lack of flavor as the aforementioned brand does (check the ingredients).<br /><br />This is great iced as well! Also, try it with a bit of raw organic honey. I can't keep enough tins of this in stock I love it so much.

review/summary: Decent and zippy, good value
review/text: I eat mine mashed on buttered toast with fresh black pepper. These are medium fish, running 5 per tin, in good condition, tender but not quite mushy. These are my first hot-sauce sardines. The spicy hot sauce almost overwhelms the taste of the fish, so I'd say this is more of a protein/hot-sauce experience than a sardine snack. Luckily, they're not too salty. The sauce is very spicy for a mass consumer product, but for dedicated heat/pain folks, I'm sure these fishies will be almost mild. Frankly, I was surprised by how decent these fish were for the price compared to some of the other cut-rate sardines I've tried. When I need a change from my usual sardines in tomato sauce, I'll reach for these guys. Heck, I had a positive enough experience that I'm looking forward to trying other brands of hot-sauce fish.

review/summary: Brings me back...
review/text: My mother used to cook this all the time. I decided to make one myself. The directions weren't hard at all and I was able to replicate hers. I soaked the potatoes in water overnight. This allows the potato to become soft. I highly suggest you do this. You can use half of one box of curry to make less. I made a crock full with one box and I think I'll be eating this for 2-3 more days. Luckily, I have two other roommates. So use half if you're only eating for yourself. This claims to be 4 out 5 hotness but I don't think it's that hot. I had to add two tablespoons of red crushed peppers to spice it up but it was still not hot enough for me. It doesn't affect my rating because I know my tolerance for spicy food is crazy high.<br /><br />My roommates loved it. They never had it before and I think Kokumaro curry is a great introduction to the world of curry.

You have to dilute it (obnoxious hassle) but even with ice sitting in the drink for a long time or cutting it with seltzer, an Iguana Bloody Mary is still syrupy and unpleasant.  I poured the remainder of the bottle down the drain.  You're better off making your own Bloody Mary from scratch or for mixers, Mr. and Mrs. T's is still the best and most reliable.

review/summary: Tasty But Not As Good As They Used To Be
review/text: When this product came out a few years ago, the box included the dry mix, as well as a separate pouch of moist raisins.  These muffins were a big hit every time I made them, even for our tweener nieces, who usually look at anything bran as "ew gross."  Unfortunately, the manufacturer changed the recipe, and now dry raisins are simply incorporated into the dry mixture.  I noticed a distinct negative change in the moistness of the muffins.  And is it just me, or did the fat content increase?  At any rate, still a tasty and relatively healthy option for breakfast.  And very easy--and fast--to make.

review/summary: The best bran muffins I have ever eaten....period!
review/text: While I have written lots of reviews on amazon.com I very rarely review grocery items.  But when I find a product that I can enthusiastically endorse I enjoy passing on the information to my fellow Amazon members.  Such is the case with Krusteaz Honey Raisin Bran Muffin Mix.  This product was formerly marketed under the Sun-Maid brand and has been around for about ten years now. My wife and I count ourselves very big fans.<br /><br />Prior to the introduction of Krusteaz Honey Raisin Bran Muffin Mix I had never really seen a bran muffin mix at the grocery store.  You could either make them from scratch using the recipe on a box of Kellogg's All-Bran or buy them at a bakery on donut shop.  Since we never had the All-Bran on hand we always opted for the latter option.  Happily, Krusteaz solved that problem with the introduction of this fantastic mix.  You can whip a batch of these muffins in just a few short minutes and within an hour you will have hot tasty bran muffins emerging from your oven.<br /><br />With Krusteaz Honey Raisin Bran Muffin Mix you get tasty bran muffins that are crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  Best of all they are packed with juicy and delicious Sun-Maid baking raisins.  Bran muffins just don't get any better than this.  I would take these muffins over any other bran muffins I have ever had.  They are that good!  We generally find that we can make 6 good size muffins from this 18.25 oz package.  Krusteaz Honey Raisin Bran Muffin Mix generally sells for about $3.00 per box and is rarely on sale.  Also, I have found that not all supermarket chains carry this item.  Just to be sure we don't get caught short we generally keep 4 or 5 boxes on hand. I was pleased to discover that this product is now available through Amazon. If you love bran muffins like I do and have never tried this product I urge you to do so.  Very highly recommended!

review/summary: SunMaid Honey Raisen Bran Muffin Mix.....Great muffins.
review/text: These are the best bran muffins I've ever eaten!  When my local grocery store no longer stocked the item, I liked them so well I ordered 12 boxes from Amazon!  To make them even better, I mix in 8 oz of pecan bits. Twelve boxes seems like a lot, but since my niece and her family introduced them to me, we divide the twelve boxes and they go fast!

review/text: ***** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SUNMAID HONEY RAISIN BRAN MUFFINS NOT Krusteaz.  It appears that Amazon has switched products.  Just wanted to make sure that anyone reading this would know that this review was written specifically for the SUNMAID product. ****<br /><br />I was SO thankful to find these muffins on Amazon!  I fell in love with them back when they were on my grocery store's shelves and was extremely disappointed when they disappeared.  Although I love the fact that I can purchase them on-line, it would be fabulous to have them in the stores again someday.  Even if you think you don't like bran muffins, you need to try these.  They are surprisingly sweet and absolutely delicious.  I would recommend making 9 muffins per box (rather than 12).  They're a great size and very filling.

review/summary: Moist & Delicious Bran Muffins
review/text: Honey Raisin Bran Muffin Mix by Sun-Maid makes very moist muffins.  I bake the whole batch at one time and freeze half of them ( they do not lose their flavor).  My local stores stopped carrying this mix and I'm thrilled to be able to buy the mix through Amazon.  I highly recommend this mix to anyone who wants a moist Bran Muffin. Just add water, oil & egg and stir.  No mixer needed.  They are part of my daily diet.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: After reading several recipes for homemade brownies, I decided to play it lazy and go with a box. I used to make Betty Crocker like it was my job, but my husband came home with these instead.<br /><br />Ingredients: sugar, enriched bleached flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), bittersweet chocolate chips (chocolate liquor, sugar, cocoa butter, milk fat, soy lecithin, vanilla). cocoa (processed with alkali). canola or soybean oil, salt, artificial flavor, sodium bicarbonate.<br /><br />So, the ingredients aren't the healthiest thing ever, but they're brownies, not organic kale chips.<br /><br />I followed the directions (1/4 cups water, 1/2 cup veg. oil, 1 egg). I added some vegan chocolate mini-chips that I had in the fridge. I poured the mixture into an 8-by-8 square pan that I greased with glorious butter.  I cooked at 325 for about 42 minutes.<br /><br />I could not allow them to cool before eating half the pan. I was guilt-ridden but it didn't stop me from having one for breakfast the next day. They have chocolate chips, for goodness sake! And they are so, so, dreamily chocolatey and rich. Perrrfect. I don't like bleached flour as an ingredient, I just don't get it, but they tasted good, which is ultimately the point of brownies if you ask me. If you're looking for a healthier option, don't stop here.

review/summary: Fine brownies
review/text: This is a pretty good product.  The brownies came out a little more crumbly than I am used to.  Flavor wise, I thought it was good, especially when paired with ice cream (I used chocolate cinnamon). I loved the bits of chocolate chips throughout, but, it never hurts to add more.  I think I will substitute the oil for something else - maybe yogurt or black beans to reduce overall calories.  The cooking time was spot on.  At the end of the day, I think Betty Crocker Fudge brownies are a bit better than these, but I would still make the Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate brownies if I were in a dark chocolate mood.  I purchased my box at Big Lots for two dollars.  I've seen the product in grocery stores as well for about the same price.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br />Serving Size 2" brownie<br />Servings per container: 16<br /><br />Amount Per Serving<br />Calories 210<br /><br />Total Fat 3.5g<br />Saturated Fat 1.5g<br />Trans Fat 0 mg<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 130mg<br />Total Carbohydrate 27g<br />Dietary Fiber 1g<br />Sugars 18g<br />Protein 1g<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Sugar, enriched bleached flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), bittersweet chocolate chips (chocolate liquor, sugar, cocoa butter, milk fat, soy lecithin [emulsifier], vanilla), cocoa (processed with alkali), canola or soybean oil, salt, artificial flavor, sodium bicarbonate.<br /><br />Contains:<br />Wheat, milk and soy.

review/summary: I made chocolatey, scrumptious semi-healthy CUPCAKES from this mix!
review/text: Ghirardelli chocolate is absolutely the best. (It's even a valid reason for going to San Francisco for a weekend -- especially to their Pier 39 shop. But I digress.)<br />- I am a very healthy, conscientious eater who happens to luuvvve good dark chocolate -- which is, after all, from a natural plant, full of antioxidants, and it keeps your hair silky & shiny, not to mention the theobromine and phenethylamine releasing the feel-good seratonin from your brain...you with me? - So, in order to satisfy both sides of my Gemini nature I decided to alter the suggested additions to this Ghirardelli Brownie Mix as follows: instead of l/2 cup oil, I used 1/4 cup of organic virgin coconut oil, slightly nuked just to melt it (you can read about why it's the best oil for you), and an additional 1/4 cup of water to balance the scoop of chocolate whey isolate protein powder I add to the batter, to establish a better protein/carbohydrate balance, which slows down the 'sugar rush' to your bloodstream.  I then decided to make cupcakes, because they bake faster and I wanted a warm one ASAP.  I greased the cupcake tins with butter and preheated the oven to 350 deg., baking them for 20-25 minutes (use the toothpick test). It made ten VERY delicious cupcakes, which at about $2.50 per box is only a quarter for a gourmet chocolate cupcake -- such a deal, yes?  Enjoy! ~

review/summary: Exceptional Chocolate for a Chocolate Lover
review/text: I initally ordered this product from my niece for a school sale. The first time the nanny used the brownie mix, they were yummy, yummy, yummy! Subsequently, my brother also made some brownies, but his were too thick and were actually too chocolately for me, not sure of what he did wrong or different. So fastforward a few months and when we returned from vacation, the nanny had made  white and black cupcake brownies, one of the recipes on the box. Now these things were scrumptious!!! I could not get enough. So that I would not eat them, I brought them to work to share with my co-workers. They too were hooked!!!! Now everytime we have an event for which we all must bring something, I always have to bring the black and white cupcake brownies!!! The brownies alone were good but that black and white cupcake brownies are to die for!!! I was thrilled to find them on Amazon and to have them ship them to me at my APO box.

review/summary: The BEST boxed mix ever!
review/text: I have used several types of brownie mixes over the years, this is the BEST that I have ever used, and the largest boxed mix.  My only issue is that I live alone so making the full box is a bit much for me.  So I break it in 1/3s and as well as the cut the added amounts in 1/3s, water and oil, except for the eggs.  (I use a 1 small egg with each 1/3 of the mixture, as I mix and bake.)  I works well for me, so that I can enjoy a fresh warm batch of brownies when I desired. (I could and would love to each a FULL batch, but I believe it would not be wise for me to do so.  But that doesn't mean that I don't want to, or even long to do so.)<br /><br />This is a moist chewy chocolate brownie mix that taste like scratch made.  The price is also GOOD.  I would and gladly do, suggest that others try this brand.  ENJOY!

Of course, like any brownies, you need to check them and not rely on your oven to be at the right temp.  We have found that to cook them on the timeline provided, that we need to bump the temp up 25 degrees.  That's just us, maybe your oven works better than ours.  :-)

review/text: While this product is pretty good with chocolate pieces included, the amount of mix seems less than competitors, leading to thin brownies. IF one puts an extra egg in the recipe, it comes out too cake like. I'm returning to the standards of Duncan Hines or Betty Crocker,  adding in some chocolate chips,  which surprisingly to my tastes provides a more satisfying brownie than this more fancy brand. Also, the test for the brownies being ready isn't as straightforward as they can only be cooked by time, leaving less room for error. Better products are available.

review/text: I used to buy the big bags of these and eat them constantly, then I looked at the back of the bag and saw they used MSG in the cheddar kind, but not in most of the others. I ate chex mix as a healthy alternative to chips and other junk food so them using something like this basically had me switch over to another snack. You can have your own opinions about MSG, but I think it's lazy personally when they don't even have to use it but they do anyways.<br /><br />They did taste great, though. Maybe if more people complain about them using MSG they'll release a new formula without it. And no, I don't mean take mono sodium glutamate off the label and replace it with yeast extract, or autolyzed yeast extract when it's basically just a different name for MSG. I'd buy them again if we got a no MSG formula.

I paid $14.50 for the candies which is a pretty good value for the amount you get.  However, I was charged a Shipping and Handling rate of $8.50 which made this a rather expensive purchase.  I do understand that postage has gone up all over the country and that candy weighs more than some items, however the site lists a Standard S&H rate of $6.00 within the U.S. so that my grand total was a bit steep.  Not sure I can afford to be a regular customer even if the variety of merchandise is good!  I will enjoy the precious Fruit Gems!

review/text: These snack cakes were like a revival of the long-lost Strawberry Twinkies that I used to eat way back in college. They had the same shapes as Twinkies and came two to a package like Twinkies, but in this case, each cake was individually wrapped. They tasted good, with a good moistness to the cake and a mild strawberry flavor in the filling. It didn't seem as creamy or as sweet as I remember from Twinkies, and I seem to remember the Twinkies filling being a mix of cream and strawberry jelly, rather than a uniform color combining both ... but that was a long time ago.<br />Ditto to whoever said that.

review/summary: too sweet
review/text: What do they add?  Is it the marshmallow root?  (There's no stevia.)  This tea has a sickening sweetness all its own.  If you accidentally bought it, like me, here's a tip:  try adding lemon juice to your cup just so you can use up the box without throwing it away.

review/summary: A great discovery
review/text: My voice is my job. In the last months I felt a bit tired. My voice was a bit veiled. In some specialized Linkedin forums someone sayd this product is a sort of cure-all. So I bought it, but I was a bit skeptical. I was amazed by the positive effects on my voice. And now Throat coat tea is one of the most important working tools.

review/summary: Amazing tea
review/text: My throat feels so much less mucousy halfway through a set with the band if I'm drinking this instead of diet soda or beer!  Which means I sing cleaner and clearer!
