review/summary: Great cookies, great price, and they're delicious!!!
review/text: Going gluten free is overwhelming, especially when you have trouble finding food that tastes good. All of my experienced friends told me not to eat any prepackaged gluten free stuff until I had been off gluten for at least a week or two. I saw these cookies on sale right before I started, so I bought them planning to wait a week or so, then eat them. Well, I couldn't wait! I was too curious. I tried one, and it was delicious!<br /><br />They are about the same size, and very similar in taste to Famous Amos, only better. They are not as dry. The texture is great, not exactly crunchy, but not quite chewy. They have an initial crunch, a good chew, and sort of melt in your mouth, and are perfect for dunking in milk (taste fantastic with almond milk). There's no funny textures or aftertastes like with some gluten free sweets. I know a lot of people say they can eat a whole bag in one sitting, and I probably could, but I find them to be satisfying enough to just eat the serving size of 4 when I have a sweet craving.<br /><br />The price here is better than in the store, if you get free shipping. At my health food store, they are $3.69/bag. I paid about $16.50 with tax for 6 bags here, and they arrived in 2 days!!! At that price, they don't cost any more than mainstream packaged cookies, which not common with gluten free stuff.<br /><br />The kids love them, the husband (who is not gluten free) loves them, and I love them. What more could you ask for!

review/text: Thanks Amazon and Pamela's! My 15 yr old son eats gluten free and loves these cookies.  He can eat an entire bag when he gets home from school and it was driving us in to the poor house buying them at the local grocery store.  Thanks to Amazon and the auto ship program I am saving almost $2 a bag by ordering them this way!  They are great tasting cookies....they taste like chocolate chip cookies should taste...with or without gluten!

review/text: Very flavorful and gives amazing taste to salads and food in general. Just a pinch make a huge difference in the way your food tastes like.  This is the only type of salt I am using since I discovered it. I put it on meat, fish, veggies, salads, soups,etc. Everything tastes better with this salt. I wish they would offer it in bigger sizes. I usually order 4 at a time so they last for a while since the size is small. You will not be sorry for ordering this salt.

review/summary: Five Stars at the Price I Paid
review/text: First off, I ordered this product last week and the price for a set of 6 phones was somewhere in the $7-$8 range, not the $18 price I see today.  My review is based on the lower price.  I was very happy with the product.  You should be aware that each set of 6 comes in a combination of colors.  In my package there were 2 pink phones, 2 blue phones, and 2 silver phones.  As I was giving these away at a child's spy birthday party with both boys and girls in attendance that worked for me.  I was quite surprised that for the price these phones were a decent size, opened and had working keys that actually played different sounds like beeps and music (depending on which key pressed).  All of the phones were in working condition.  The candy is small multi-colored balls that are a bit like hard sweet tarts.  The kids were thrilled to receive them and I was happy with the item.  I didn't have any problems with non-working phones and I had ordered 24 of them.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like diet food to me
review/text: Regarding my recent purchase of the Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars in Raspberry and Chocolate flavored (2.2-Ounce Bars for a pack of 12), I must say this sure does NOT taste like diet food to me. The chocolate rasberry blended together and made a delightful flavor. Even though flax seeds are mixed into this combo, the seeds are ground up enough not to cause any concerns and I really liked the chewy texture. I recommend keeping them in the fridge for a cool treat.

review/text: I try not to eat too many processed foods, but sometimes, like when you are traveling or backpacking, you need a convenient, pre-packaged food product. These bars are very tasty and they don't have any additives or strange ingredients. They are suitable for people with the common food allergies. For me, the clincher was that there is no added sugar except for agave nectar, which has a low glycemic index.

These bars are definitely an acquired taste but they aren't any worse than the "traditional energy bars" and I still do like that they have wholesome ingredients instead of all the funky stuff. I do like that these don't leave me with a bloated heavy feeling but they are satisfying. I will be using these as a meal replacement instead of the energy bars that need not be named.

review/summary: Yummy Organic Raw Bars
review/text: These are among the best raw bars I've tried yet. I promptly ordered two cases after trying the Raspberry Chocolate and the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough (seriously--it really tastes like it to me). Next on my list are the Coconut Agave and the Spirulina. These are great to have in your bag for those moments when you're out longer than you thought and need some fuel, or just when you're craving something sweet and yummy but want to stay health conscious. They'd also be great for those on a gluten free diet and just anyone wanting to eat clean.<br /><br />My four year old considers them candy bars, so they have to be kept out of reach or he will eat as many as he can before I discover him in his little trail of wrappers (twice now). I don't know how he can even finish one, I never can. They are super filling and satisfying and the perfect blend of everything.

I've been snacking on them for a month, and there's still half a box left! They're especially good at quelling those pre-menstrual chocolate binges, and are better for you.

review/text: I like these bars. I think they taste great, and feel good about eating them. They make a handy gluten-free snack that is also healthy. My children also like them. My husband, however, doesn't care for the texture of them, so he will only eat them as a last resort.

review/text: You can really taste the Raspberry.  This is my favorite of the Raw Revolution Bars.  However I like all three I have tried.  I take one to work every day, it is the perfect work/anytime/convenient snack or occasionally meal replacement bar.  I feel deprived without my daily bar.  It helps to keep the cravings for sweets away!!  Love IT!!

But, they're really quite tasty for something so healthy.  If you're expecting Godiva chocolates, you're going to be dissapointed.  If you're looking for something that tastes good, fills you up, and is still pretty healthy, then give these a try.

review/text: Trying to find non-GMO masa harina for homemade tortillas and chips is really hard.  Organic corn ships and taco shells are expensive and usually stale tasting.  Red Bobs tastes great and we have made some awesome tacos and chips since we bought Red Bobs masa harina and a cast iron tortilla press off of Amazon.  The price beats my local Krogers by a little bit and we are using it up as fast I I can re-order it.  If you haven't yet, read up on GMO foods.  Its scary and I don't want my kids eating foods that are basically a chemical experiment. With Red Bob's masa harina, you have a non-GMO product that is really getting us to experiement with Mexican good again.

review/summary: A great masa for homemade tortillas and arepas...
review/text: After seeing a great segment on making your own tortillas on THE VICTORY GARDEN, I got incredibly inspired and went on a search for Masa Harina (Corn Flower) at the grocery store. I found a reasonably priced bag at my local health food store. The only three ingredients you need for excellent tortillas or arepas (South American version of a thicker tortilla) is masa harina, water and salt. You knead the water and salt into the dough, allow it to "rest" for one hour, then make small 2 inch balls of the dough, flatten them either between sheets of wax paper or your hands, and place them on a pre-heated skillet. No oil or butter is required to cook them up. They come out tasting fresh and delicious, and you can also rest assured that the flour is not made with GMOs (or genetically modified corn). The tortillas go excellently with either a smidgen of salsa, a dollop of sour cream or fresh veggies. They are also a great side for soups.

review/summary: MY DOGS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS GOODY!
review/text: Several of my dogs suffer from allergies.  My veterinarian instructed me to cease giving them biscuit treats as they can contain dust mites (as also does the dry food at the bottom of bags where it becomes powdery - throw out at that point).  It doesn't matter if the dust mites are alive or dead, they are not good for a dog with allergies.<br /><br />So I, at my veterinarian's suggestion, switched to this natural beef jerkey dog treat and voila! they just love it.  Of course, I limit the intake or they would be partaking of it non-stop.  Can't have that!<br /><br />A good alternative to dry dog bones or treats!

review/summary: Childhood Sardine Memories...
review/text: These brought back fond childhood memories of my Mom's Sardine Spaghetti Sauce (Pasta con Sarde) served with whatever pasta struck her fancy :) Back in those days you HAD to eat fish every Friday AND a few other Holy Days throughout the year. When I look back I see my Mom's immigrant background intertwined BOTH nourishment of the body and spirit. Sardines in tomato sauce, olive oil or mustard found their way to our table and NO ONE was overweight inspite of the pasta at many meals. I joke with my son and tell him this was our go-to meal like Tuna Noodle Casseroles for others ;)<br /><br />These are pretty good. They are whole and are great on crackers too. For the uninitiated/squeamish, you may want to debone the sardines first, but you are removing one of the best natural sources of calcium when you do. Check out the web for recipes for Spaghetti with Sardines, a can or two with garlic, olive oil and a little more pasta/tomato sauce and a pound of pasta and you're ready to roll...healthy and cheap!<br /><br />These little fellows found their way into homemade salad dressings, although not nearly as good as the anchovies in a fantastic Ceaser's Salad but yummy too. I've deboned them, mashed and mixed them into Salsa for Salsa and Chips. This on Manager's Special was thirty three bucks comes out to 2.35 per pound of protein with NO unhealthy fat...but watch your sodium.

review/summary: I had to stop giving this to my dogs
review/text: My dogs love the Smokehouse Porky Pizzle.  When I took out the bag they were excited and they chewed it for a  long time. However, I have stopped giving this product to my dogs because it has become a chocking hazard . I have small dogs and found they have been chewing the pizzles and trying to swallow them in one long piece. I have had to stick my fingers down my dog's throat to get the pizzles out and clear their airway.  Perhaps the pizzles are better suited for larger dogs. My dogs won't be getting this product again. They do love other SmokeHouse products such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CPUPMA">Smokehouse 100-Percent Natural Chicken Breast Strips Dog Treats, 16-Ounce</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YD8JC">Smokehouse Chicken Skewers Dog Treats 4oz</a> . They have been having these other products for over a year and there has been no chocking issue with them at all.

review/summary: Possible Anaphylactic Shock
review/text: There should be a warning label on this product making people aware of potential allergic reactions. I tried this for the first ( and last ) time a few days ago. I had to go to the Emergency Room as my eyes were swelling shut, my sinuses & ears were rapidly closing up & my throat was feeling tight. I had hives & a red rash all over my body plus my hands were completely red .  I have never had anaphylactic shock before & have eaten celery without incident.

review/text: I really like these bread crumbs.  Whole grain bread crumbs are hard to find where I live, so I was glad I tried these.  I took off one star because I think they are too expensive.  I am not cheap at all, especially when it comes to quality food items, but I think these are a little overpriced.

After 2 weeks of putting of these little treats in with her dry cat food each day, her teeth are practically completely clean!  One note though:  She didn't like them at first and pushed them aside, but she now eats them right along with her dry food!  I will buy more!

review/summary: Dogs love them but sticky on bad teeth
review/text: They smell like most dog treats do but with a little bit more of an earthy twist. They're colorful and most of them are about four inches long. My 10 month old West Highland White Terrier loves them but my nine year old Westie, who has bad and missing teeth, keeps getting them stuck in her jaw even when I break them in half for her. They seem to stick more to her teeth than actually in the jaw. I would definitely recommend it as a healthy treat for medium-sized pups.

review/text: I liked this tea - added it to my subscription list so I get it regularly now.  I'm one of those people that keeps 3 or 4 different iced teas in my fridge (a recovering high-fructose corn syrup beverage addict) and am always looking for new tastes.  This one was more like a blast from the past, its just your plain old fresh minty tea.<br /><br />Some tips:  a little goes a long way, don't brew too long, and its really great iced (I live in Phoenix so, fresh cool tea is a survival necessity during the summer).  We have a few citrus teas out back and I've found the juice mixes really well with this tea when cooled, particularly lemons and tangerines.

review/text: I'm not really into spearmint, so this was purchased for the wife.  It is easy to make too strong, so be careful.  But when properly made, with just a touch of honey, it tastes quite good (per the wife).  She likes this tea, and so, I'm happy I purchased it.  We shall try some other lemon blends later and get back to how this one stacks up.

review/text: The instructions on the bag for the Lemon Spearmint tea says to use 2 heaping teaspoons and let it brew 5-7 minutes. For me and my SO, this was too much and way too long of a steeping time. Now, I use about a teaspoon or so of the tea, and let it steep for 2-4 minutes, and it's much better. I found it tasted bad when using the recommended times. However, like any tea, you have to steep to your tastes, and now that I've found my "sweet spot" with this tea, I'm much happier.

review/text: This is simply spearmint with very little lemon peel, I have not seen any Rosehips, Hibiscus, and Lemon Myrtle. The color and aroma are fantastic - poor spearmint again. However the tea is too fine - there is so much dust and flying around when you are trying to scoop some tea out. And even if you are using a strainer or a tea ball, there are going to be some tea particles in your cup.

review/summary: Mentos gum
review/text: the gum wasn't the right flavor I was looking for. Mentos makes a very strong minty flavored gum that has not been marketed in the US or at least in FL where I live.  I learned about it in the island of Barbados and thought it was the new flavor.  When I purchased it through Amazon, it looked exactly like the dark blue container I purchased in Barbados which was the stronger minty flavor.  This color container isn't anywhere here in FL and it was very misleading to me when I saw it online I thought for sure that it was the new flavor. Thank you.

review/text: You get more than enough cough drops for a very low price per cough drop.  However, I ended up throwing away many because the paper wrapping around the cough drop sticks to the slightly melted cough drop (perhaps during shipment) and you can't take off he wrapper completely.  So, unless you want to eat paper along with the cough drop, don't buy.
