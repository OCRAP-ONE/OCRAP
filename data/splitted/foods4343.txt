review/summary: Interesting!!!!
review/text: I love almonds and I read other reviews and thought I'd try it.. It takes getting use to it has a thicker texture than peanut butter.. I love peanut butter but I sometimes get heartburn after eating it, I haven't had this problem with the Barney butter! I'm thinking of using it as cake frosting. Its fun watching peoples reactions to the taste test like mine different and good.. Worth trying!!

review/summary: Not great, just OK
review/text: This is one time I seem to be in the minority, all the other reviewers seem to love this almond butter, I'm sorry I really don't. I just got mine today and while I've heard about almond butter for years I've never tried it until now. I figured since I like almonds and almond extract (flavoring) I'd like almond butter too but I guess I was wrong. I wasn't sure what to expect but I'm kind of disappointed with it. It's like peanut butter only blander so the taste is so-so. I made an almond butter and jam sandwich with it and what I really don't like are the texture and consistency. Yes it's smooth but it's drier than peanut butter (maybe because it's got less oil I don't know). So with the texture I think it's a bit harder to spread than peanut butter too, and it was just I don't know, I guess "gunky" would be the word for it. It seems like it's got thicker globs throughout and it's not as creamy as peanut butter either. I just don't care for the texture, I think it's probably just a case of personal preference though. While I'd say the taste is good the overall texture and consistency don't appeal to me. And then there seems to be a problem with the packaging. The 3 jars came in a bag which was then inside a box. I opened the box and then the bag and the inside of the plastic bag and the outside of the jars was oily, I had to wash my hands off afterwards. I'm assuming it's almond oil, but the jars are all sealed so I'm not sure how any oil leaked out of them but it seems to have done that and I'm not thrilled about that either. But I will say I think they charge a fair price for the 3 jars. I'm not sure I'd by this or any other brand of almond butter again. But like I said maybe it's just me. If you like almond butter in general go ahead and try this brand. But I think I'll stick with peanut butter thank you very much.

review/summary: Best tasting Almond Butter
review/text: I was very hesitant to try another brand of almond butter since I've been buying MaraNatha religiously for years. MaraNatha has a grainy taste and tends to clump in the jar, and also has to be refrigerated after opening. But, once I find a product that is good I stick with it. However, I started to make homemade granola bars, and the MaraNatha almond butter was somehow missing from store shelves in my town. Enter Barney Butter on Amazon. I am so glad that I chose to buy a case. I cannot say enough good things about this almond butter! It is incredibly smooth, the consistency is even better than peanut butter. The grainy taste, tendency to clump, and ubiquitous oil at the top of the jar are nonexistent in the jars of Barney Butter I received! I love it, my kids love it, you will love it!

review/summary: We Love Barney Butter!
review/text: We have a peanut allergy in our household, which otherwise loves peanut butter!  After many attempts to find a substitute, even making our own almond butter, we found and settled on Barney Butter.  Actually we really like our homemade almond butter but the only almonds we found and could afford that were not processed with peanuts later had a statement appear on the package that said "processed in a plant with peanuts".  So though this may not be quite as"healthy" as our own, it is fantastic and totally peanut-free!  I don't think you could get any closer to the taste, consistancy, color of peanut butter.  It works in all of our baking in which we used to use pb.  I think it is so close that it would be important to train a little one with a peanut allergy that while they may eat Barney Butter, there is something almost exactly like it (peanut butter) that they can not eat.  Sorry to offend any health-interested people out there, this review is simply based on someone looking for a substitute for pb and finding the absolute best one.  BTW, comparing the nutrition info of this to pb, it seems to be healthier than peanut butter.)

review/summary: Unbelievably good, worth the price
review/text: After developing a peanut allergy two years ago, I despaired of my ever eating anything as delicious ever again. I tried to substitute almond butter but failed--I bought a bottle of expensive crap that sat in the back of my fridge for a year before I tossed it. The other day I decided to try Barney Butter when I saw it at Whole Foods and I couldn't believe it. I kept checking the outside of the jar, wondering how it could possibly NOT be peanut butter. I'm about to buy my first three-pack, and I can't believe I can enjoy my favorite snacks again (apples and Barney Buter, now!) without worrying about my allergy.<br /><br />This stuff is crack for the peanut-loving who have a peanut allergy. HOORAY!

review/text: My daughter is allergic to peanuts, so of course we don't keep any peanut butter around.  Barney butter was given to us to try since it is made in a peanut free facility.  I have to say it is delicious and worked great in an almond butter and jelly sandwich and on a banana so far.  I have now ordered the individual portions for us to take when we travel.  My daughter hasn't tried it yet (she's 3), but she is a little picky and usually has to warm up to something before she tries it.  Will definitely keep ordering!

review/summary: Makes Peanut Butter Unnecessary
review/text: I'll assume most people looking to buy almond butter on Amazon already know how much healthier it is than peanut butter. If not, Google can tell you in five seconds. (Remember, almonds are nuts, peanuts are not.) But for those of you still picking peanut butter because it tastes better, stop here. Barney Butter tastes as good as peanut butter and, in my opinion, tastes even better. Buy this butter and be healthier. That is all.<br /><br />P.S. Most every almond butter I've tried always has oil at the top of the jar. Yucky. You have to stir it until you break your hand to get it mixed back in with the butter. And then the next time you get into the jar you have to do it all over again. Not so with Barney Butter. No oil. No yucky. Just good eating.

review/summary: Allergic to Peanuts?  This is the trick.
review/text: My daughter and my nephew are both terribly allergic to peanuts, but they can eat almonds.  Kids have loved PB&J sandwiches as long as I can remember - heck, I still love them!  This is a great alternative for those who cannot eat peanut butter.  It's not as sweet as the conventional peanut butters, which is probably a good thing considering all the corn syrup in them, but it tastes great!<br /><br />We keep a couple of jars in the house, and I just sent a few to my nephew, who loves it too.  You do have to stir it a bit, but that's an okay trade off in my opinion.<br /><br />Great job Barney Butter!

This is the BEST for texture and flavor substitute.  My two kids ate over half a jar the day this arrived!  That was at 3pm and it was gone before bed time!  That is just with spoons dipped right in.<br />I am unable to tell the difference when having a BBJ.  My husband is thrilled, since we both loved PB but have not had it in over 3 years.<br />I am back today to order more since it is on sale now to stock my pantry!  Thanks be to Barney for making this in a almond only facility.  That is awesome!

My husband brings the whole jar to work and has it on toast for breakfast!  Barney Butter is the perfect consistency and taste and I love that it is made in a peanut-free facility (this can be hard to find with almond butter).  I highly recommend it!!!

review/summary: one star for NONEXISTENT customer service
review/text: so my family was looking for something similar to peanut butter but w/o the peanuts.  we were also looking for something that did not use roasted nuts b/c roasting is not as healthy compared to raw nuts.  after looking on amazon i came across this brand.  i wanted to find out more about how it was prepared so i wrote to their customer service on their website. after you submit you question a friendly message pops up basically saying "we'll reply within 24-48 hours" etc.<br /><br />days passed.  no reply.  so i try another time.  more days pass. again no reply.<br /><br />since we wanted to order some soon i go ahead and buy some based on the picture they posted on amazon.  i trusted that their picture listed an accurate portrayal of their item they were selling.  the picture did not show anything about roasted nuts.  well we get the item in and open it up.  what do i see?  their packaging changed.  on the front of the label lists roasted and blanched nuts.<br /><br />as far as taste? nothing exceptional. tastes just like all the other stuff we've bought before.  needless to say we wont be buying this product again.<br /><br />ps. we bought this item on july 3rd and have yet to get a reply from this company.  i would have to say that their "customer support" is truly pathetic.

Almond butter, due to its monounsaturated fats and ldl cholesterol, can and should be a very nutritious substitute for peanut butter and even butter. That's why people buy it (aside from its amazing flavor)!  What are these people thinking?  So disappointing (and gross).  I don't know if I can give this stuff away.

But, it does not save me money to get 2 good jars and one damaged jar that I cannot return, which is what happened when I ordered here through Amazon.  It is just too risky for me to purchase it here, because I don't know if I'm going to get three good jars or 2...or 1...or none!  And then there is nothing I can do about it.  Grocery items are not returnable and there is no way to contact anyone about it.  As far as the Almond butter, it is perfect!  We eat it on everything, toast, english muffins, waffles, graham crackers, apples, pretzels, tortillas .  It's smooth and easy to spread without being drippy.  It's not too sweet or bitter.  I'm just thankful there were 2 good jars!!  But, that made them $12 a piece...yikes!

review/text: This product was recommended.  I usually make my own almond butter in a food processor with quality almonds.  That is not always convenient.  Barney's product was on another website with fibre products I purchase.  It was very hard to determine what the ingredients were - reading the label when there is sugar I want to know the source... I got curious - no ingredient list means MORE research because they are hiding something.  This has other ingredients, palm oil it appears and cane sugar... That's probably why it tastes good.  Advice:  Read the labels if you want to know what you are putting into your body.

Barney Butter is an almond butter and not as sweet.  But if you're used to a healthy nut butter, you'll probably love this.  When I put it on toast or a rice cake/kamut cake, I have to add banana or jam or agave to sweeten it a little more.  But I'm simply used to Peter Pan and Jif. Otherwise, the texture is great.  It's slightly oily, but not icky messy.  And you don't have to keep it refrigerated.

review/text: I ordered two bags of Yummy Chummies and they arrived promptly.  However they should have been shipped with a hammer enclosed to break them.  We have purchased these before from Costco and they were moist, the ones we purchased online were hard as rocks.  I believe they may have been a very old product and I was very unsatisfied with them even though the dogs ate them.  I have no idea how you can verify a fresh product when ordered online.

review/summary: Grain Free Treats
review/text: Our dog, a 13-pound Italian Greyhuahua, loves these treats.  We like them because they are grain free.  I usually break them in half for our dog because she is so small and doesn't need the extra calories.

review/summary: High-quality treats, but not my dog's favorite
review/text: What I like about these treats is that they are super healthy. They don't contain any grain, sugar, or similar additives (unlike so many dog treats on the market). However, like a lot of health foods they smell kinda funny (like seaweed) and I get the sense that my dog doesn't care much for them. When offered one of these treats along with her kibble or "jerky" treats, she forgoes these every time in favor of the other.

review/summary: Salmon Treats Rock
review/text: My dog loves these treats.  She is older and I believe this  grain free product is good for her digestion and contains glucosamine & chrondrotin.  Yes, they smells fishy but one would expect a product that is 95% salmon to do so.  The fact my dog loves these healthy treats is enough for me.<br />If your dog likes like fish or salmon oil then I recommend you purchase this 2 1/2 pound bag.

review/text: These treats are really smelly and I could live with that if my dog actually liked them.  She will rarely eat them.  Most of the time she won't even take it when it's offered but if she does, I usually find it sitting around on her bed.  I'm still looking for a replacement for the chicken jerky that she loves but I can't feed her because it comes from China and has made too many dogs sick.  I'll keep trying to find a treat she likes.  This one definitely wasn't it.

They are super yummy, per the dog, and they are nice and smelly which is good for nose-work and training sessions!  They are easily broken up into smaller pieces so one large bag last a good while.

Second, I like that I can easily cut them into smaller bites or break them up to make them last.  All 4 of my dogs love them and I'm able to use them as a high level treat for harder commands.  Also - my puppy who is 15 weeks old had no problems digesting them.<br />All in all a 5 star product in my opinion.

review/text: I tried this tea for the first time months ago, for medicinal purposes, and I didn't really like the taste.  It isn't very ginger-y, and initially I didn't sweeten it, as I normally don't sweeten tea or coffee.  Then I began using raw honey in it, and drink it with breakfast every morning - 1 cup, steeped about 4 minutes.  I really like it now, and haven't found anything else that I would want to have with breakfast to enhance my health.  I don't give it 5 stars because on its own, without the honey, it is not impressive.

review/text: Straight out of the package the aroma was a halting sweet and spicy with fruity undertones made even more potent when brewed. It's too bad that the taste couldn't live up to that exciting fragrance. From the name (Green Ginger) I expected to taste a bit more ginger and a lot less pear. To be clear, the tea was all right, but rather underwhelming for this ginger lover.

I looked at some Atkins peanut butter cups I'd just bought, and they're a higher percentage of saturated fat than these cookies.  I worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat, unless it's made with soybean oil or lists trans fat.  I list this as one of my "healthy snacks."  And since I'm over 40, size 4, with no health problems - I must be on the right track of what "healthy" is. :)<br /><br />One customer said hers were "greasy."  Maybe hers were in the heat, and the butter got hot?  I'm now placing my third order for these. They're worth it!

There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.

review/text: I am assuming that most people would buy this tin for the wedding picture of William and Kate on it. However, the teabags inside are surprisingly decent, producing a nice, flavorful black tea, nothing like the flat-tasting bland stuff that is usually packed with tins like this.<br /><br />I admit that I bought it for fun at a national discount store (which shall remain unnamed) and at a much lower price than offered here. Since I am not a fan per se of the British Royals, I would not have purchased this at the almost $15 price set by this vendor. But if you are a "Royalist" and enjoy a good cup of black tea, this might be a nice thing to get and display.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/10/12: The price has dropped by almost 2/3rds - at this new price, I will snap up a few more tins to give as gifts...

review/summary: Good Salt But Pricey
review/text: Odd that the less processed the salt the more expensive it is.  I'm sure there must be a logical reason.  This is a damp, slightly coarse product.  You will need to use it from a salt cellar because it won't pour through the holes in a shaker.  I drink distilled water exclusively and there are some health advisers out there who say that trace minerals should be taken to make up for the lack of them in distilled water.  Some even claim that the water can actually remove trace minerals from your system and that is one big reason I use a quality sea salt, to hopefully replace trace minerals if indeed they are being depleted by drinking distilled water.  This salt is very tasty but it is not very much salt for the price.  Still, I plan to buy another bag.

review/summary: Less Sodium and More Flavor, Plus Minerals!
review/text: I have been using this salt for nearly three years. My husband has to have a low-sodium diet, but those potassium chloride substitutes taste awful. This salt is full of all sorts of healthy minerals and tastes amazing. We get all the flavor with less actual sodium due to all the minerals taking up space in the salt. Most table salt has 480 mg of sodium per 1/4 teaspoon, and some sea salts go as high as 530 mg per 1/4 teaspoon. Celtic Sea Salt has only 330 mg per 1/4 teaspoon. That my not sound like much of a difference, but 1/4 teaspoon is really small, so the difference gets pretty large when you look at a whole day's worth of meals. Not to mention that all those minerals are great for is heart (and mine)!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: Absolute best and easiest seasoning out their. Works great with ground beef/venison, or whole muscle meat! Can't ask for a better product. One hint though, the ingredients in the "Wild Goose" seasoning and the other kind for beef or venison are exactly the same, so don't pay any extra for the goose kind, because its the same thing!

review/text: This Hi-Mountain product adds just the right flavor to both hamburger strip jerky and snack sticks.  Makes 15 lbs. of muscle meat and about 7 lbs. of hamburger strips or snack sticks. Definitely my favorite seasoning mix.  Has less Sodium Nitrite than other seasonings. Let cure for 24 hrs. for best taste.

review/summary: Great jerky mix
review/text: I've used this to make both beef and venison jerky in a smoker with great results.  I like the cracked pepper and garlic flavor so much I don't even feel like trying other flavors or products.  Everybody has their own opinion of what the perfect jerky style/flavor is and this hits pretty close to my ideal, YMMV.  I've only used it with sliced meat but don't see any reason why it wouldn't work great with ground meat.<br /><br />The kit comes with a shaker, instructions, and two resealable bags - one of cure and one of seasoning.  Keep the instructions, they tell you the ratio of cure and seasoning for how much meat you have.  Make sure you use the right amount of cure. I like my jerky with a little more seasoning than what they call for.<br /><br />Just mix the correct ratio of cure and seasoning in the shaker and apply it evenly over all the surface of your sliced meat.  You want the cure to contact all of the meat's surface evenly.  Put the meat in a ziplock bag in the fridge for a day or two to cure(mix it around once in awhile to insure even distribution of the cure) and then it's ready to go to the smoker or dehydrator.  Very easy and it gets rave reviews.

review/summary: Best Honey EVER...
review/text: I had been dying to try some New Zealand honey since hearing someone rave about pairing it with almond butter. So, I took an English Muffin, spread some almond butter on one side and a Tbsp of New Zealand Clover Creamed Honey on the other. It was pretty close to heaven. Note: A Tbsp is a LOT of honey. Next time, I'm going to try 1/2 Tbsp. ;-) Also, I just ordered this honey on Sunday, and it shipped Monday, with me receiving it Thursday. Not bad. I was expecting it to take a week or more, but the seller was super fast! (seller: RussianShoppe) As for this particular honey, it is probably the closest to what you would buy in the grocery store, as far as flavoring. Some of the others might taste stronger, like Manuka or Tahari... I'm not sure, since I haven't tried those. But this stuff smells and tastes awesome. My only problem with it is that I KNOW it will not last me more than a week! I could eat it straight out of the jar! ;-)<br /><br />Some info that is on the label and not in the item description, but I thought you might be interested in:<br /><br />"Clover- Clover honey is everybody's favourite. Here in a creamed form, it is light in colour with a smooth creamy texture and delicate flavour that is typical of the best clover honey produced in our South Island pastoral country. New Zealand produces the very best quality Clover honey in the world." (yes, they do!)<br /><br />Also, it says to keep the honey cool (20-22C), dry and avoid sunlight. There is an iron-clad guarantee, no questions asked. If you do not like the product (as if that would be possible), you can return it for a replacement.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: Serving Size 1 Tbsp (21g), 24 servings per container. Calories: 60 Carb: 17 (16g from sugar)<br /><br />Like I said, the only complaint I would have is that the jar is not bigger. It is 500g, about the size of a coffee mug. If you can find this in a store where you don't have to pay shipping, awesome. If you have to pay shipping, well, maybe we can talk them into making a jar about 3 times this size. No joke! Buy it now! :)

review/text: This product is only worth three stars because of its taste. It's definitely not "Movie Theater" butter. It tastes nowhere near what the products at the movie theater taste like. That being said, it doesn't taste bad. It seems like a taste that will appeal to some people but not appeal to most. If you're looking for a butter substitute for your popcorn maybe try it, but if you're looking for that great movie theater butter taste you should look somewhere else.

review/summary: I really really REALLY wanted to like this stuff.
review/text: I picked this up for $3.99 at my local grocers in this flavor and  in orange cranberry.  I love quinoa and as a gluten and oat intolerant person, I was psyched to give this a try.  I was so psyched that I had about 6 pouches in my arm at the supermarket because I missed having a hearty hot cereal in the morning that wasn't rice based.  Luckily, I only bought two of the pouches after seeing the high price (which I think is understandable since it is made out of whole foods and the packaging is convenient).  Little did I know that only buying two packs would save me a trip to the return desk.<br /><br />I could not bring myself to swallow this stuff.  I guess after packaging and sitting on a shelf, the quinoa became very mushy.  The fruity flavors didn't mesh well with the grain either, which is odd because fresh quinoa and fruit is normally delicious. Its possible that the culprit for the odd texture and taste was the coconut milk (or was it cream?). Maybe it should be replaced with a milder plant-based milk like Almond milk and a smaller portion of coconut.  Further, I think instead of being served ready to eat, it should be dehydrated so that way the unappetizing mushy-ness would never be a factor.<br /><br />Overall the taste wasn't atrocious, but the odd texture was a deal breaker.  I would try this product again if they change the recipe/packaging because I think it's a sound concept.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious - but pricey!
review/text: I got two packages each of the Banana Cinnamon and Wild Blueberry flavors from a daily deal site for vegans (Spencer's Market). I wanted something shelf stable to keep in my desk for a quick meal or snack that is all-natural, not too high in calories and with a good amount of protein. This absolutely fits the bill - it is easy to heat (Or you can eat it cold, but heated definitely tastes better).  The ingredients are all -natural, and thanks to the quinoa, has some good protein in there as well without a ton of sugar. (Although 14 grams of sugar might be too high to eat this on a regular basis.)<br /><br />My one quibble with it is the price - at $4 a serving it is definitely cheaper to just make your own quinoa at home and then you can control the amount of sugar you add. Still, as a convenience item for when healthier choices aren't available, it's great.

However, now I can't wait to finish these up and go back to Bob's oats. We CAN'T stand the mushiness, as if they're over-processed or something. I'll be making batches of oatmeal cookies to get rid of these packs. Besides Bob's taste much fresher. You get what you pay for.

review/summary: excellent canned soup
review/text: Buying groceries from Amazon has 2 potential benefits: lower prices and access to items not locally available. This product excells in both areas.<br />It took me forever to track down manhattan clam chowder locally. The only product I found was Progresso ready-to-eat. You only got 19 ounces for $3. Since the Chincoteague is condensed you get far more soup per $.<br />As to taste, I compared the soups side by side. The Progresso had a bit more depth of flavor, but it wasn't coming from clams. Even though both soups were only heated until a simmer appeared at the edge of the pots, the clam meat in the Progressor was very chewy and not very abundant. The Chincoteague had plenty of clam meat which had very  good consistency. The broth was well flavored with hints of the ocean.<br />In my opinion, this is as good as canned clam chowder can get.
