review/summary: Great Food!  Great Service!
review/text: My Golden-Doodle was diagnosed with food intolerance and I had to find a unique, different protein source, such as venison.  I started her on a different brand of limited ingredient venison dog food, but wasn't happy because it was relatively high in carbs and she really didn't like it.<br /><br />I found this and tried a 4 lb bag.  When she loved it and showed no intolerance, I gradually moved her to Viva la Venison.  This is the first food I have given her that she readily eats as soon as I put it down.  I even use it as a treat when we walk (along with the venison jerky from Real Meats).<br /><br />The service from Whole Healthy Pets is wonderful!  I received the food within 2 business days of ordering.  While I am spending more because of shipping, their price for this product is comparable to other premium dog food.  And a happy, healthy companion is well worth it!<br /><br />I highly recommend both Viva la Venison and Whole Healthy Pet.

review/summary: A healthy way to spoil yourself!
review/text: I love love love these! They are great as an afternoon pick-me-up when I want something sweet tasting but have eaten healthy all day, and don't want to spoil that. I'm not diabetic but I do think it's important to eat as if I were, who needs all the sugar found in regular everyday snacks and drinks. These are so full of flavor--coffee/espresso combined with chocolate is always a winner; sweetness comes from the use of Agave, a low glycemic choice. The other flavor I go for is the Cranberry-Orange Spice. All the choices are great because they have the healthy basis, all the healthy ingredients, so I don't have to scrutinize each box/flavor like with some brands. I even brought a box of each flavor to share at a family gathering because half the group is active and the other half is not, and these are good for both!

review/text: I first tried the podmerchant stout as part of a large sampler pack. It was by far one of the boldest and most robust of all the others - yet still smooth. Great morning wake-up and the coffee flavor won't get lost in lattes and cappucinos. Additionally, the 150 count offering is one of the best pod buys I've seen out there at about 42 cents each. For those less frequent caffeinators, there's a 20 pack too at around 50 cents.

review/summary: A Decent Mix
review/text: Talking about - Pod Merchant brand ESE espresso pods, the "Stout" box. PMS Pods hereinafter.<br /><br />I use these pods in a Baby Gaggia machine on my desk at work. My criteria for choosing the machine and the pods was 1) Neatness and 2) Neatness.<br /><br />Since the machine is on my desk, and since I work in a cube farm, I could not use a machine and coffee that required much cleanup. ESE pods were the perfect solution to my problem.<br /><br />ESE pods are _all_ a compromise between neatness and flavor/quality.<br /><br />In my experience, having tasted all the pods in the Sampler Pack, as well as offerings from Starbucks, Lavazza, and Lucaffe, I can say that no ESE pod tastes as good as a nice, fresh high-quality roast.<br /><br />That said, the PMS pods are as good as almost any other blend of robusta and arabica beans. Robusta beans, many from Vietnam, are the beans normally used for red/blue tin-can coffee that you see used in church and government offices in the huge urn that looks like you could bathe a baby in it, and often tastes as if the baby had been cleaning out horse stalls before being washed off in the coffee water. So you should beware of any blends that use Robusta beans. They are cheaper and they taste like it.<br /><br />I have found that most ESE pods are packed too tightly for my Gaggia, and that the machine chokes on them, only dribbling the coffee out. If I want a "full" single shot, it can take way over the approximately 20-25 seconds you should allow to brew an espresso shot, often taking double that time to get a full single shot out. My workaround is to loosen up the pods before use by flexing them in my hands and puffing them up from their puck shape into something more pillow like. This loosens up the pack, allows a more rapid extraction, but it dilutes the coffee as well, making something that started out a bit weak even weaker. If you are just getting into pod espresso, and have not chosen a machine, I recommend buying one with a strong pump so you can properly extract a pod without having to loosen it up first.<br /><br />PMS pods are dark and on the bitter side. I have found them to seem to be high in caffeinne, although your brewing method will have more to do with how much "bite" a pod gives as than the particulars of the pod itself, so YMMV.<br /><br />I do not get much in the way of crema from any pods, and the PMS pods are middle of the road in this category. The Lucaffe pods seems to give more crema.<br /><br />PMS pods are very drinkable within the context of the desk machine setup I described.<br /><br />If you are making a latte or cappuccino, PMS pods are fine, and are an economical way to go. Note: there is a wide variation in the pod/$ ratio of ESE pods. Do the math.<br /><br />PMS pods are generally in good shape when they arrive, as some others are not. Lavazza seems to have a problem with pods being broken open when I receive them. PMS pods do not have this problem. The packages are solid, and the pods themselves are solid. No leakers.<br /><br />PM ships promtly. No worries there.<br /><br />Next order - PMA pods - Arabica only. Review to follow.

review/summary: The best choice of dry food
review/text: I have been using this dry food recipe for five years on five different cats and they are in excellent health.<br />First and foremost, they all love it. That is an important point because the best of food will not be of much use if the cats will not eat it. In addition, as a former veterinary scientist, I study the composition, not the advertising prose. In my opinion, the lamb is the best because of the nigher meat to fat ratio. [the chicken version is mostly offal with an unhealthy fat content, not to mention other ingredients].<br />My cats are mostly indoor dwellers and this lamb recipe provides both leaner meat and dietary fibers. I occasionally mix a little "Indoor cat" dry food to boost up the fiber content and all is well.<br />I love to see lean and happy lively cats with a shiny coat and no health problem whatsoever, that tells me that I have found the right balanced food, that and three empty bowls - of course.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/summary: Bad taste, but helps you fall asleep
review/text: I bought this to help me fall asleep and it works although it tastes and smell really bad. Make sure to put this in some sort of a glass jar to prevent your kitchen from stinking. I found that if i added cream to this tea it would help the taste but its still pretty bad.

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

review/text: This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried. The bags have no string and tag. The bags are the limpest and often fall apart while squeezing. The only brand of tea I have ever had do this. I drink 4 to six cups of tea a day of various types and this is a very lame tea.

review/text: This tea has a strong pungent smell that my husband hates (he says stinky socks) but call me weird I really like it.  I like parmasean cheese too though and that stinks.

review/text: This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia<br />so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

This tea should be taken carefully. It is used as an immune system booster. I think drinking it four times a week is good enough.<br /><br />I really enjoy the warming up effect it has. Although it is suggested to drink with a meal.

review/text: My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.

review/summary: Menopause Relief
review/text: I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.

review/summary: Mild sweet tea
review/text: I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.

I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks

review/summary: Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!
review/text: I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas.

review/text: I started drinking this tea after a Doctor of alternative medicine recommended it to cure a Yeast Infection. It worked! I did not had to do to a GYN to cure my yeast infection. Also, it helped me in other way. After I started drinking the tea I stopped craving sugar. Needless to say, I lost like 15 pounds while drinking it. Is amazing and very medicinal. It also helps me with menstrual cramps. I love it! You can find it here online or in any natural health food store near you.

review/summary: IT WORKS  FOR ME
review/text: I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck

review/summary: No more breast milk!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.

review/text: I heard about drinking sage tea on the Dr. Oz show. Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again.

review/summary: Great for colicky acid reflux babies
review/text: We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.

review/summary: Recommended by herbalist--love it.
review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

review/text: I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

review/summary: Birthing Miracle Tea
review/text: I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.
