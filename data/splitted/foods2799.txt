review/text: These are given to my 2 rescue dogs at the end of the day.  They know when it is time to go out for the last time at night and sit and wait for their Greenie.  All we have to say is "do you want to brush your teeth" and they go nuts.  They love them and their teeth are in great shape...

review/text: So far so good. My dog seems to love this things. They do stink when you open the box so beware. I don't know how well they preventing the plaque from building up on his teeth only time will tell. 4stars based on potential good it will do for my dog and the fact that he loves them. You do get alot to last you for 96 days b/c it only says to give one a day so I think that will be adequate time to fully evaluate. I'll update when that time comes but for now it's worth giving it a shot.

review/summary: Our Dogs LOVE These and We Do Too!
review/text: I have been feeding our dogs Greenie bones since they first came out and we have NEVER had a problem.  I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a "garbage belly" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the "green" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where "E. Antic" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are "deadly", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up "NYLABONES"?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie "Smart Biscuits" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.  Always supervise your dogs when giving treats - after all, they are the animals and we are supposed to be the 'smart' ones.....don't be afraid, do your homework, it always pays!

review/summary: my lil' beast is crazy for greenies!!
review/text: i still worry about the rumored threat to dogs from these treats, but they have changed the formula so i am assuming all is well with them.  and i am assuming since they are front and center in most pet places that they are safe.  and my italian greyhound is obsessed with them.  they make her (usually hideous) breath smell fresh and clean and have really made a difference in the cleanliness of her teeth.  i always make sure to watch her while she's eating it, not only for her safety, but because it is freaking adorable to watch her chew on it.  just a tip, these are cheaper from entirelypets from amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Greenies-Dental-Chews-ounce-Teenie/dp/B001CWEC2W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1266273814&sr=8-1

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite- and Amazon's the Place to Get Them!
review/text: My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them.

review/summary: Greenies - Catnip for dogs
review/text: I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as "well earned" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them.

review/summary: such great treats!
review/text: I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up.

review/text: My dogs, the 1st day I tried these, didn't really seem to like them. Now they practically climb up me to get to them. My older dog was having trouble with tarter and bad breathe.  After 2 weeks of using the treats, her teeth looked a lot better and the nasty odor was gone.  The reason for the 4 stars is because of the expense, which for me is times 2.

review/summary: It's like crack for dogs...
review/text: First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs...

review/summary: Addictive to dogs
review/text: It's got something in there that is like crack for dogs. I buy the largest size I can find. I like them better than rawhide, for what they do. Rawhide strips or bones, when the dog gets down to that last part are slimy unswallowable messes that I've had to reach in and remove from the dog's throat. Nylabones edibles gave the dog the runs. Pressed rawhide chunks did the same. Greenies don't affect his digestion at all, and he's crazy about them. He has destroyed a Kong or two in his time.<br /><br />I don't know how much is due to his genes or to the greenies, but my 12 year old dog has better teeth than many 5 year olds.<br /><br />Like any other edible chew treat, however, don't leave your dog unattended until he's finished it.

But there was NO smell! Zilch. Zip. Nada.

review/summary: Just Okay, nothing else
review/text: Updates: One Day, One Week, Two Weeks, One Month, Three Months, Six Months<br /><br />One Day<br />-------<br />Ordered these yesterday and they came in today, even with Prime two-day shipping - Thanks Amazon!  I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a "U" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less "heavy".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product.

review/summary: Buy the sample size first!
review/text: My pekingese loves these!She is known to be quite a picky eater,so I ordered the sample size( called a 'mini-treat pak' of the Greenies first to see if she'd like them.( I believe the sample size =22 of the 'Teenie' size). She ended up loving them,so I kept the small zip-lock pouch the sample size came in. I just take about 20 of the Greenies at a time from the large 96 chews container and refill the zip-lock pouch.*It also is a great way to bring some Greenies along with you when you are traveling with your dog!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQCJIG">Greenies Treats for Dogs (5-15 lbs/2-7 kg)Mini Treat-Pak-Teenie 6 oz</a>

review/summary: Love 'em!
review/text: I buy these directly from amazon because they're always cheaper than I can find them at local pet stores. My dog goes absolutely crazy for the Greenies Lite. I'd originally started him off on the normal greenies but switched to the Lite about a year ago and he loves these just as much. I recently had to get the normal greenies because they were out of Lite and my dog wouldn't go near them; thank goodness I purchased the normal ones at a place where they took returns.<br /><br />I give my guy a few throughout the day as treats so I just bend and twist them in half; otherwise my dachshund/pekingese mix will demand more and at roughly $30 a box, I'd go broke if I gave him as many as he could eat. As long as the box is fresh, the greenies will be nice and bendable... I have purchased a box on a few occasions where the greenies were rock hard.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price. I just wish they were a tad lower. Even still, I will keep buying these as they're my dog's fave treats.

review/text: Greenies are one of my English Bulldog's favorite treats.  They are a bit on the expensive side, but if you get them on Amazon instead of one of the large Pet stroe chains, you get a better deal.  I tried the Costco brand of dental chews (they were about half the price) and they disagreed with my dog's stomach so I came back to Greenies.  I usually break them in half and put it in is kong toy so it's like a puzzle for him to get it out.  If I just give it to him he eats it really quickly.  Overall, Greenies are a great product.

review/summary: Greenies for a picky eater
review/text: I had to pay a fortune to have our dog's teeth cleaned. Plus it was a difficult thing for her...she got very upset and was in pain for a few days. So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the "peanut butter pills."

He grew to love it more and more. So don't give up and give it to someone else if your puppy is not crazy about them from the first day.

review/summary: Great Deal!!
review/text: Our dogs adore these and they are usually fairly pricey for the amount you get. However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs. However I would not use Greenies solely to keep a dogs breath in check, I recommend getting some other product for that.

review/summary: Greenies are awesome!!
review/text: My dogs go crazy for these!! I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.  They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the "risk" with Greenies. Amazon price for these, even with shipping costs, are still the lowest. And my dogs get to bark at the FedEx guy!!

review/summary: Squeaky clean!!
review/text: I have a one year old Pomeranian whom has been on greenies since she was about 3mos. Let me tell you, I've gone to the vet several times during her first year for different reasons. The first time her vet was happy to see that she had a healthy "smile" and hoped it continued, she was still a puppy. Since then, we moved to another city and she now has a different vet. This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word "greenies" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her. Because of a previous review i read about storing them in the container it comes in for a while caused maggots, i got really grossed out(has NEVER happened to me) so JUST IN CASE, i dump them in a snap seal, clear, plastic container.

review/text: I have a bichon beagle hybrid mix (called a glechon).  He just loves greenies. We just had him into his vet for his checkup and the vet told us that his teeth were beautiful. He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them. They are a little costly but I feel they're well worth the extra cost.

review/summary: Doggie Must
review/text: It's reassuring that the treats I give my precious Yorkie are of the best quality and of course I appreciate the cost effectiveness of dealing with a reputable company.  Amazon has provided swift service and a product that would cost much more from a local pet shop.  Greenies are good for my dog's dental health and are not dangerous as are rawhides or toys with squeeking mechanisms which can choke a dog.  Just the sight of the Greenie box, and she knows it's nap time or time for a treat.

review/text: My puppy loves this product.  The moment he has a Greenie in his mouth, he'll begin to munch.  I actually got this product not only to keep my pup's teeth clean, but am using it to help my puppy teeth.  The product is just hard enough so that my puppy can keep gnawing on it, but it is simultaneously soft enough for him to sink his teeth into (providing assistance for teeth development).  I definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Very Effective
review/text: My veterinarian recommended these.  My dog is a German Shepherd, Pit Bull, Jack Russel mix.  His top part is huge but his legs- not so much.  Basically he needs his weight managed all the time because we don't want knee problems to develop.  At his last trip Dr. Kragness said he had a bit of a tartar problem (organic food related) and to try a greenie a day.  Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.  I thought the price was a bit steep but tried them on the word of the vet and for the obvious results we're getting I guess you get what you pay for here.

review/summary: A teethsaver!
review/text: About two years ago I adopted a little toy poodle from my local humane society.  She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts "dancing" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!  Thank you Amazon for offering them at an affordable price with free shipping!

review/text: We bought these for our 65 lb golden retriever. He is not a powerful chewer since he has a retriever's mouth, but he is a diligent chewer. He'll chew and keep chewing once he gets going. The size of the large-sized Greenies seems right for him.<br /><br />Our dog's breath was getting stinky and we were noticing some buildup of plaque, so we got the Greenies Dental Treats. He simply loves these. But he eats them a little to fast. They only last a few minutes. I wish he would chew more and swallow less!<br /><br />But our dogs breath does seem better. We don't use them every day, more like every other day to make them last, but they still seem to do some decent teeth cleaning. I would use these in combination with other teeth/gum health products like the Nylabones and raw hides.

review/summary: Sticky, but delicious.
review/text: My Pug puppies absolutely love these bones.  The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing "digestive upset" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case.

I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them!

review/summary: For sparkling doggy teeth
review/text: Of all the dog teeth treats, I bought this one because it was highly recommended by doggie dentists. If your dog doesn't take to it right away, have some patience. My own dog took it in strides at first--she would chew on it but not swallow it. And now she looks forward to it more than any other little treat. I don't know what it does for her breath (which is never very minty fresh), but her teeth are sparkling white. Giving her one a day doesn't make her stomach hurt in any way.
