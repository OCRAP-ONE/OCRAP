review/summary: Great for GF Oatmeal Muffins
review/text: Since I have to be gluten free, arrowroot starch is excellent for gluten free oatmeal muffins! I can't eat chicken eggs either, so this works really well for holding the muffins together. It works better than tapioca flour in this particular recipe because the muffins turn out moist instead of dry. Arrowroot is also good in other recipes. Can't beat Bob's Red Mill gluten free products!

review/summary: High Quality Gluten Free Thickener
review/text: This stuff is great.  It claims that it is tasteless, but this stuff makes whatever I am adding it to taste better.  Perhaps this "tasteless" thickener allows the true flavors of the dish shine, where other thickeners have a flavor of their own which actually changes the flavor.<br /><br />No need to make a slurry or fuss with this stuff.  Just sprinkle on towards the end of your cooking and stir it up.  It thickens quickly and easily.

review/summary: Would you believe???
review/text: Would you believe that I needed some Arrowroot Starch Flour (or powder...same item) to add to a recipe and foolishly purchased two jars (70 g in each, located in the spice aisle) for about the same as the 80 ounces I received ordering this pack? Well...desperate times called for desperate measures. I'm happy that I've found this bulk source from BRM as I have a neighbor who has corn (as well as wheat) allergies, and Arrowroot subs beautifully for corn starch in every recipe I've tried!

review/text: If you are a gluten free/paleo cook, then you know arrowroot is a staple in many of your baked goods.  I usually buy out all of it at my local Sprout's market so I decided to order it online instead.  Not only did I get a better value, but I don't have to worry about running out for months.  I'm stoked!

review/text: This a great price for the quantity you get.  Arrowroot powder is so expensive if you buy it in the spice section of the supermarket.  Buying online is MUCH cheaper.  It's a great thickening agent.  Has same consistency as corn flour.  I use this to make primal/paleo bread (made from almond flour).

review/text: I had been feeding my cats IAMS for years. When IAMS switched from a pet store brand only to a grocery brand, I decided to switch foods. Getting a bad bag of IAMS that nearly killed two of my cats clinched it. My vet recommended Science Diet and I've used it ever since. My cats have never been healthier! Their coats are shiny, their weight is healthy, they have energy, good muscle tone and are very happy and strong. It's amazing the good a fine product can to for your cat!

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/text: Blue Diamond are masters of flavor with almonds. These almonds, specifically, taste like salt & vinegar chips. At first bite, you get that "ahh, why would anyone eat these?!" face squinching reaction. But somehow, you soon find that you can't stop eating them. It's that addiction only salt & vinegar can bring you.<br /><br />Great for low-carb dieters or just someone wanting a tasty snack.

review/summary: Delicious cookies, but not single serving packs
review/text: Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these.

They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.

Most of the animal crackers/cookies that I've purchased for my family have become dismembered sometime before my children get them out of the package, these are mostly whole and you can really tell what the critter is before you pop it in your mouth ... Extra fun snack time for the little ones.  All in all, the box of cookies is well worth the price and I feel good about packing healthier snacks in my children's backpacks for school.

They are crisp, fresh, and have an even amount of chocolate vs cookie flavor. They are not animal crackers by any means.<br /><br />The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have them delivered to some place cool (not to your door step on a hot July day!) as one batch came out a little not-so-crisp, and I'm pretty sure it was because of that.<br /><br />These cookies are almost twice as expensive in the stores where I live if I buy them by the bag. Forget that! I'm sticking with them here on Amazon!<br />Thanks, Amazon!

review/text: I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local "healthy supermarket," and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.

However, I didn't check the ingredients before purchasing and assumed that - like the Vanilla, Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal - these would be vegan. They're not - they have whey and milk powder in them. For a non-vegan, these taste great and are a more healthy choice than your standard cookie.<br /><br />For the calorie counters: these have almost 50% more calories per serving than the other Snackimals flavors. Most of the other flavors are 110 calories per 10 cookie serving, and the Peanut Butter are 150 calories per 10 cookie serving.

review/summary: Bland, Snickerdoodle, Tastes like flour
review/text: I found these to be flavor-free.  They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon.  True disappointment, my kids will not eat them and I bought a whole box. Tastes like sweet, baked flour and water.<br /><br />However the chocolate chip ones are good.

review/summary: So good!...........
review/text: One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.  I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!

review/text: These are actually quite delicious. They are dry so make sure you have plenty of milk or something else to drink. Also, I did not detect as much of a peanut buttery taste as I would have liked, but they are still good, and I would recommend them.

review/text: Just got these oatmeal animal cookies and we love them!  These are not like a typical animal cracker - they are more like tiny crunchy granola bars!  They remind me of the oats and honey crunchy granola bars from Nature Valley.  Also love the price - the only place I can buy these is Whole Foods and they are .99/package there.  Subscribe and save is definitely a winner on this one!

review/summary: The Boy Loves Them!
review/text: All kids like animal crackers, don't they? Well our three-year-old boy certainly does. So my wife picked up a 7.5-ounce bag of Barbara's Shackimals Chocolate Chip animal crackers. I'm leery of having snacks around and I'm not too fond of having the kid eat a lot of snacks, but my wife assures me that these are relatively healthy snacks. Hmmmmm. I suspect that these are just as much for her as for the boy. Well, what can you do? We already have them and the bag is open. I might as well try one just to see what they're all about. Mmmmmm. Somewhat dry and crunchy. Nice chocolatey taste, but not too heavy. Sweet, but only lightly sweet. Nice snack or treat! Of course, the boy loves them! I'm going to have problems staying away from these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: These cookies taste great, my kids love them! I feel good about giving them a healthier snack. The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star is becuase each bag comes with 2 servings in it. This makes them a little less convenient to use while traveling, but with an extra bowl or baggie that problem is easily solved. Will definitely buy again!

review/summary: 5 Stars for Choc. Chip Flavor ONLY, Oatmeal deserves 2 stars...
review/text: Choc. Chip review: I wish I found these before the kids got out of school for the summer because they are a great school lunch item.  I like the ingredients and packs are big enough to share with another person.  I bought based on good reviews and found them to be crispy and delicious.  They taste like those little animal crackers you find in the small, red, zoo-like boxes with the string handles I had as a child but these are crispier and better ingredients.  I didn't sense the chocolate chip in the flavor but they are good. Recommend! :)<br /><br />EDIT:  Tried the Oatmeal flavor and was sadly disappointed..2 stars from me. The taste was bland and nothing exceptional for the over-the-top cost.  PLUS...Amazon only lets you review ONE FLAVOR even if you try others.  Obnoxious and deceptive...makes all flavors look 5 star when they are NOT.

review/text: My husband and I enjoy a crunchy snack every now and then, and want it to be not only good tasting, but nutritious as well. I ordered a box of each flavor Snackimals, and we have not been disappointed. I just dump a small bag of each of the four flavors in a small cookie jar. We reach in for a few whenever we want, not worrying about getting one we don't like, since they all taste great. (But I must admit, we're both a little partial to the oatmeal.) Go ahead--what are you waiting for? Buy these!

review/summary: GREAT COOKIES
review/text: My son has a ton of allergies and there are so few things he can have that are not homeade.  These cookies however have made the list for snack food he can eat being that they are free of peanuts, wheat, soy, treenuts and more.  I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens.  usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too. It is so great to find a snack food for a small child with allergies that he can take to school and be like every one else.

I will definitely buy these again.

review/text: I'm not sure if there was a bad batch of these sent out in 2011 or something, but the bag I bought for my son on 5/27/12 was really quite good. If you're familiar with the Nature Valley Oat and Honey granola bars, the oatmeal Barbara's Snackimals taste almost exactly like those, only they're much neater to eat and easier to chew since they're thinner and smaller. Yes, the cookies have a tendency to break, but they taste *great*. My son (2 1/2) loved them, and even his two cousins (6 and 2 1/2), who get more sugary treats than he did, helped to demolish the bag. All the adults were a bit jealous, I think--the Snackimals were much tastier than our potato chips . . .

So relatively satisfying portion if eating as intended, 1 bag at a time.<br /><br />Delicious oaty flavor, tasting of molasses and vanilla, 2 of their few ingredients, these cookies are crispy.  Yet they chew down to goo just like the old-fangled animal crackers with the carnival packaging.<br /><br />I feel good about buying them, relatively snacking, and I feel good about consuming them, again, relatively speaking.<br />Recommended in all ways, no drawbacks that I have discovered yet.

review/text: Being a natural, somewhat healthy cookie, I expected a carob-y cardboard flavor.  Not so!  While you can see very small specks of chocolate, I think most of the chocolate flavor comes from the pale brown swirls throughout the cookie.  The chocolate is far more flavorful than you would imagine.  They are simply wonderful, cute little cookies.

review/summary: My kids love these
review/text: These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the "snack-size" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes. You'd expect it to be the other way around.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Good quality product, but the flavor is not what I had hoped
review/text: First, this is a good quality product: they use quality ingredients and the crackers have a nice "animal cracker" crunchy texture. Flavor is such a subjective thing that I hate to down-rate a high quality product too much just on that basis. But I won't be ordering any more of these.<br /><br />My oldest son says they don't have enough cinnamon to achieve a strong cinnamon flavor, but too much to achieve just a hint of cinnamon flavor. I think they actually have the right amount of cinnamon, but aren't quite sweet enough, especially on the exterior. They just come across a little bit bland. I know a lot of people say that is just because people are used to over-sweetened foods, but I think the chocolate chip flavor Snackimals have just the right amount of sweetness. In any case, my kids don't like them - but they do like the chocolate chip flavor.

Please note that I have not tried the cookies since they are not gluten free; therefore my rating is not indicative of the taste or quality of this product  - the site would not let me post this without giving a rating so I just chose the middle of the scale rating.

They're extremely tasty and way better for you than most other cookies.  You would never know it was a healthier choice.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not replacing your veggies for the day or anything but it's definitely a smart snack choice when you're craving sweet... and the kind of snack you get hooked on!  It's also a great option for kids and even comes in snack packs for their lunches!

Ingredients are quite good and per bag price is very reasonable--even more so on auto-delivery.  Large 2+ ounce single servings are quite satisfying when you want something slightly sweet and crunchy with only 120 calories and modest fat content. The only change we have made to our auto-delivery schedule is to have them shipped more frequently.

review/summary: Flavor Not What I Was Expecting
review/text: I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.

These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.

review/summary: Fruitcake!!
review/text: I know most people don't like fruitcake, it's a huge joke. And that's fine, I'm cool with that. Nobody said you _have_ to eat fruitcake. I wasn't a fruitcake lover myself until I was an adult.<br />My grandmother always made fruitcake and I wouldn't touch it. My brother had told me that the candied fruit was plastic. Of course, he still ate it. So eventually I tried my grandmother's fruitcake and it was delicious. And I married a man who likes fruitcake, so that began my fruitcake experimentation.<br />Homemade fruitcake is completely different from store bought fruitcake. Store bought fruitcake is dry and has only a smattering of fruit. Obviously, the commercial bakeries do _not_ use the Pennant Fruitcake Mix.<br />This is a great fruitcake mix because it actually has a variety of candied fruit, not just a few pieces of citron or "mystery fruit" the "other" in the ingredients. The package it is sold in (16 ounces) makes it easy to use with your fruitcake recipe because of what most recipes require. The fruit is tasty, chopped well and believe it or not, inexpensive for this type of thing. Go check the grocery stores if you don't believe me, you'll see what I mean.<br />So if you're planning on making a fruitcake for somebody who deserves it and will appreciate it, I strongly recommend you use the Pennant Fruitcake Mix. Or for that matter, any other recipe that requires candied fruit. This mix will make your baked items delicious and easy to put together.<br />See how much better a fruitcake can be when you make it yourself.

review/summary: Not Just for Fruit Cake! Try it in Stollen...
review/text: During the Holiday Season I normally make a Stollen which is a traditional German yeast bread that may be wrapped in cellophane with a pretty wire bow and presented as a thoughtful and festive holiday gift. The recipe normally requires a glace mix but I have tried it with Fruit Cake Mix in the past few years which is made up of orange and lemon peels, cherries, pineapple, citron, corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup. Since I'm only using 1/2 a cup I don't worry about the corn syrup. Here is my recipe using this mix:<br /><br />Stollen<br /><br />Fruit Mixture<br /><br />1/4 cup butter<br />1/2 cup raisins<br />1/2 cup glac&eacute; fruit mix or Fruit Cake Mix<br />1/4 cup water<br /><br />Yeast Mixture<br /><br />1 cup fat-free milk<br />1/4 cup dark brown sugar<br />2 large eggs<br />2 packages active dry yeast (4 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast)<br />1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br />1/2 teaspoon Fiori di Sicilia (I get mine from King Arthur Flour but it is also sold here at amazon.<br />It is a delicately scented flavoring that reminds me of orange and vanilla)<br /><br />Flour Mixture<br /><br />2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br />1/2 teaspoon salt<br />1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br />1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom<br />1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br />1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger<br />1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br /><br />Confectioners' Icing<br /><br />2 cups confectioners' sugar<br />2 teaspoons dried egg whites<br />1/2 teaspoon lemon juice<br />3 tablespoons fat-free milk<br />2 tablespoons sliced almonds<br /><br />1. Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan. Stir in the raisins, fruit<br />mixture and water and simmer for a minute. Remove from heat<br />and let this mixture sit for 10 minutes to allow the fruit to soften.<br /><br />2. Stir in the milk, sugar, eggs, yeast, 1 1/2 cups flour and Fiori di Sicilia.<br /><br />3. In an extra large bowl, sift the 2 1/2 cups flour, salt, cloves,<br />cardamom, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Stir in the yeast/fruit<br />mixture to form a soft dough.<br /><br />4. Flour a large breadboard and knead the dough for 2 minutes.<br />Set the dough in an oiled bowl and turn once to coat with oil.<br />Cover with a damp kitchen towel.<br /><br />5. Turn the oven on to 200'. When you can feel the heat on your<br />hand, turn the oven off. Set the dough in the oven to rise for<br />1 1/2 hours.<br /><br />6. Punch the dough down and divide in half. Roll each piece into<br />a flattened oblong shape, which is about 12-inches long by<br />6-inches wide.<br /><br />7. Set each piece on a baking sheet and fold one third of the<br />longest side of the dough up over itself. Let the loaves<br />rise for 1 hour.<br /><br />8. Bake in a 350' oven for 20 minutes. Once you have removed<br />the bread, you can toast the almonds for 2-3 minutes.<br /><br />9. Make a decorative icing by mixing the confectioner's sugar,<br />dried egg whites, lemon juice and milk. Spread over loaves<br />and sprinkle with toasted almonds.<br /><br />To Serve: Slice bread and toast in a toaster. Serve with butter<br />and a sprinkling of confectioners' sugar.<br /><br />Makes 2 large loaves<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: used to be great unless they changed it
review/text: I used to buy this product at my local natural food store and it was ANYTHING but tasteless. The previous review is a bit odd unless they reformulated it, which would be very very sad because it used to be a truly delicious product (the last time I had it was in the early 2000s), and SO easy. Much easier than heating up the oven to roast a head of garlic and then I never use it all before it goes bad. This made things so much easier to have the spray on hand. Was it exactly the same as fresh roasted garlic... no, that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. But the convenience made it worthwhile for all of the times when I wasn't going to use a whole head of roasted garlic. I definitely preferred the roasted to the regular garlic spray, however. Anyway, I hope it still is as good as it used to be.

But this tea really has very little flavor, and I've tried steeping it with various water temps - from 190 degrees to boiling, and nothing helps.  It also seemed like it was probably old (past its prime) because it leaves a powdery residue around the edge of the pot. I will not buy this brand again.

Clearly far better than chicken of the sea, but I didn't think it was so amazing that it was clearly worth the premium price.  To me, Albacore is more bland and has a drier texture than yellowfin.  While this is fine for making tuna salads, I expected to be able to enjoy a tuna this expensive straight out of the jar.<br /><br />For a truly amazing jar tuna, try tonnino yellowfin ventresca.  It's from the belly (mmm, fatty), has a luscious melt-in-your mouth texture, and a fresh tuna flavor.  I opened a jar for a taste, and 10 minutes later had an empty jar.  Oops!

It's too bad because I've been a big fan of this tuna for the past two years and have always told friends and family about it. Maybe they have just grown too large or can no longer keep up with the demand without comprimising the quality.
