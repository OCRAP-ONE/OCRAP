review/summary: Cat Loves Them and Hopefully They Help
review/text: No problem at all getting the cat to partake!!  In fact, she pretty much insists on her nightly "treat".  I know brushing her teeth would be better, but, since she doesn't always cooperate in that effort, I hope these help at least a little bit to keep her teeth clean.

review/summary: My cats love these!
review/text: We have to keep these chews in a cupboard, or else the cats would eat them all at once. We give them as a treat once a day. The size is a a bit daunting, but at least for my cats, it keeps them busy for a while. Each cat is too busy with their own treat to try to steal another cat's.<br />The price here is better than what I found locally, too, so this is a good purchase for me.

review/summary: Cat Loves Them - Hope They Work
review/text: I have a domesticated formerly feral cat. The vet found two cavities and gingavitis on his last exam.  He is mostly very affectionate but I made ONE attempt to brush his teeth and am never going to try that again.  I got clawed up trying the oral rinse the vet sold me as an alternative.  Dental chews are a last resort.  The cat was indifferent to the treats sold by the vet.  I searched for alternatives through the internet and thought I would give these a try due to the mostly positive reviews.<br /><br />He loves them.  Like other reviewers I thought they were rather large, so the first time I unwrapped the cellophane-like covering and broke it into pieces.  Those were gone in about a second.  So I tried giving him a whole one.  Took about two seconds.  Now when I toss him one (once a day or so) he tries to snatch it out of the air.  I'm not sure whether it helps his teeth or not as he gobbles it in a second or two but he sure does love them.

review/summary: Great taste, too big
review/text: I ordered the 30 count pack of these chews for my three cats (Siblings that are 2 years old).  I had to go to the vet earlier this week because one of the cats (Daisy) looked like she had gingivitis, which she did, and found that the other two cats had some serious tartar.  I feed them a can of wet food once a day that they share and leave dry food out for nibbling.  The vet recommended these chews for all three cats, so I bought them.  I had read on earlier reviews that they were pretty big, and like the reviews saying that they were like wine corks, they're completely correct.  They're about the size of a wine cork with a softer texture and it smelled like fish food (I got the fish flavor).  All three of my cats are pretty small (ranging from 8-11 pounds), so I had trouble getting them to eat a full one.  I wound up cutting them into quarters to get Daisy to try them, and once she did, she went CRAZY for them.  She literally stands on the back or arm of my chair, swatting her paw out to get a piece when I'm cutting them!  She'll even throw little tantrums when I try to hold her back from stealing them from the other cats!  The other two cats didn't warm up to them as quickly or easily until I started cutting the quarter pieces into half.  I could definitely tell that they liked the taste, but it was just bigger than any other treats or food that they've eaten in the past, so they weren't used to it.<br /><br />I'm not sure if cutting the chews into little pieces will affect their effectiveness, but if I just gave them a whole piece, I'm sure the only cat who would try to eat it would be Daisy (which I suppose is good because she's the one with the gingivitis).  If this review was based on taste alone, I would have given it a 5/5 star rating; however, I wish they could make them more compact.<br /><br />Just a tip if you're cutting them, the chews have a papery coating on the outside.  My cats still ate the papery covering, but I'm not sure what it's made out of, exactly.  The chews stay intact for the most part, but do get a little crumbly when you start to cut them into smaller pieces.  I'm definitely going to try and "wean" them into eating larger and larger pieces.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I slowly started giving my cats larger pieces and now they happily eat the whole treat by themselves! Just make sure to watch your cats because my cats try to steal the treats from the others!

review/summary: Cat loves them, Unsure how effective.
review/text: My cat absolutely loves his "fish corks".  We have to keep them locked in a cabinet or he chews through the bag and eats all of them.  They are about the size of a wine cork.  Foam like texture with tough outer covering.  In theory, biting through the outer covering and squishing into the inner foam is supposed to help keep teeth clean.  Hard to tell if they are effective but I'm too lazy to brush his teeth and figure this is better than nothing.  He is fed Wellness wet food only.  I strongly believe kibble is bad for animal teeth since it doesn't clean their teeth while chewing and all the carbs simply make a nice paste on teeth providing an excellent environment for plaque forming bacteria.  Seriously, would you replace your tooth brush with hard cookies?  Consider the residue from Oreos?  I've seen kibble fed teeth and they aren't pretty.  We've been using this product for a few years.  Our cat is nine years old and finally needed his first professional teeth cleaning earlier this year.  The dental chews have a strong odor and oily residue that sticks to your fingers but easily washes off with simple water and friction.  He attacks and bats them around the floor for a second then devours them quickly.  I usually give him one each day.

review/summary: Little Fish Corks!
review/text: I was really hoping my cat would like these.  I buy the dog variety and my dogs love them.  My cat sniffed the chew and walked away.  I tied a string to it and attempted to get kitty to chase and chew the fishy smelling little item.  It was a no go.  Finally,  I sliced the chew into 4 pieces with a serrated knife.  I think he ate them unless my dogs found them before I did.<br />I don't know if the cut up pieces will work as well because he doesn't really have to chew them for very long.<br />Anyway, my rescue kitty is scheduled for a cleaning and hopefully the vet will have some ideas for keeping him free of plaque and periodontal disease.  Kitty is only 3 years old but the vet tells me he is needing a cleaning.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P3NU4O">C.E.T.

review/summary: All three cats love them.
review/text: Cats being who they are, there is of course no guarantee that your cats will find these treats appealing - but all three of mine devoured them.<br /><br />It took my tiny (6 lb) cat a little while to get the hang of eating them - they're pretty thick.  But once she got the hang of getting at them from the end she did just fine, and in a way it seems she has to take the most bites and gets the most benefit.<br /><br />Sadly, the cat with the worst teeth is allergic to them.  He's allergic to most dry foods as well, and my bet is that it's some sort of preservative triggering the reaction.<br /><br />As a result, I can't report on what they'll do for a cat with real dental issues - but they do polish away minor tartar build up and they eliminate stinky cat food breath when given as an after dinner treat.

review/summary: Enzyme Oral Hygiene Chews
review/text: I cannot attest to the results purported yet by this product but my cats love them. Our younger male cat, 3 years, especially loves them and will gnaw on a whole one of these 'treats'. He even got into the bag when we were gone and ate 5! The other cats did not seem interested because they are ridiculously large almost 2" x 0.5". The are wrapped in a wafer paper like material with a flaky, wafery, crumbly, stuff inside. To feed the other cats, I applied pressure to the wafer and rolled it back and forth between my fingers to break it out of the 'shell'. I do this and add it to their food or put it separately on their plate like an side dish in addition to their wet meal and they love it, go nuts for it. I associate it with/like brushing our teeth after we eat. They eat their main course, have dried bonito flakes on the side, and then have a side of these flaky chews (not really chews at all, like a crepe rolled up tight). I have only recently made this purchased and started using this product so cannot provide evidence for, or against, the claims of the product regarding pet hygiene and dental health but will post an update later in time. Is it weird I kinda like the smell of them...?

review/text: I got these and my female cat which weighs 8 pounds would eat the whole bag in one sitting, the male who weighs 10 likes one and walks away. Cats, go figure. I found that the male loves the Greenies though so I've got both covered. The only thing I can say is buy a pack and see if your cat will like them, no other way to know. I put in the cats weights as this crops up in other reviews. I got the exact same results with the Petrodex.

review/summary: Too big for a cat's mouth
review/text: As MANY reviewers have stated before me, this product seems like it should be a dog treat. They are slightly smaller than a wine cork (about the same length, but the diameter is skinnier). Considering cats chew "with their mouths open" as we would call it, putting something like this in it is just asking for a mess on your floor. I tried cutting it into FIFTHS (1/5) and it was still too big a piece for my cat. He would try, but it kept falling out of his mouth until it was just a soggy mess on the floor. When I did try to give him the whole one, he just batted it around. That's another thing... what genius made these round? As if a cat wouldn't have enough trouble eating it because of the size, now you're making him want to play with it AND when he goes to eat it, he'll end up rolling it down the floor (or rolling around the bowl) anyway.<br /><br />You can have the best ingredients ever, but if the delivery vessel is garbage, it's completely useless.

review/text: I actually feel bad when I think how much I paid for these at the vets!  The mark-up there was ridiculous, but these were a great treat for cleaning the cats treats that has proven some results (very little tartar build up) that the cats absolutely ADORE.  One of the cats act as if this is a kitty drug or something when I break out these treats, she loves them so much.  It's never a problem to get them to eat these treats, and now it's not a problem to give them once a day to help keep their teeth clean when the price is much more reasonable than what you'll find at the vets. If your cats are not a fan of brushing, definitely look into these - even if you can brush their teeth, these will help with their dental care and are a decent snack as well.

review/summary: Great idea, awesome treats!
review/text: Our last cat spent his last few years with hardly any teeth (although he was 21) and thus could only eat wet canned food. So, when we adopted a new one we decided to take better care of his teeth from the start.  We feed him feline greenies daily as a treat and give him one of these chews a few times a week.  I suppose we could also brush his teeth but to me that seems like overkill (he is a cat after all).  Anyway, he absolutely loves these chews. He bats them around all the while biting them and after a short while the chew breaks apart and he wolfs it down with delight.  I cannot give this product 5 stars only because I cannot say what long term effect it is having on his teeth because he's only 2 so has good health all around.  I wasn't sure if he would like these treats as the common complaint in the other reviews seems to be that some cats just wont touch them.  However, since the treat is pretty similar to a wine cork I would suggest you see first if your cat will play with one (our cat loves batting corks all over the house).  I have a strong feeling if your cat likes to play (with corks especially) he or she will love these chews

review/summary: Improvements after a few days!
review/text: My poor kitty had lost a front tooth a few years ago.  I didn't think much of it because at the time he was a part time out door kitty.  We moved to an apartment and his out side privileges went away (we are on third floor.) He gained a lot of weight and I noticed that his breath became very stinky, to the point where sitting next to him on the couch, he would yawn and you could smell it! Terrible. Then a few weeks ago I noticed that his gums were very inflamed.  After doing a lot of research, I found there were several things that could be wrong. And before taking him to the vet (who I suspect would have to either put him under for a teeth cleaning or take out additional teeth) I found great reviews for this product.  So, based on some other comments about other cats not liking the treats, bought a small bag of these to try. Skeptical but hoping for good results we gave one to our kitty and he loves them! Of course, our cat has been known to really enjoy odd things like green beans, but he realy really enjoys these treats.  He tried to eat through the bag I accidentally left on the counter.  Not only does he seem to enjoy the flavor, I think he likes the different texture AND Most Importantly, we have already seen (and smelt!) a difference in his breath and gums.  I am so happy about what these have done for our cat.  He seems happier, like he's less uncomfortable now too, all he wants to do is snuggle.<br /><br />We still need to schedule a time to bring him to our vet but I was so worried he'd have to have his teeth out or worse!<br /><br />As long as your kitteh has a good appetite and likes trying new things you should be okay. Definitely worth a try!

review/summary: My Cats Love These - The Large Size Is A Plus
review/text: When I introduced these treats to my cats, I had to hold them out for them. At first, they thought they were toys. After they licked it, though, they realized they were yummy treats. It took a couple of days for them to learn the best way to eat them, but now they're pros. I just plop them on the floor and they chow down immediately. Unfortunately, it leaves a lot of crumbs, which a lot of people will probably hate, but, lucky for me, my cats are very clean and thorough so it hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Now, I know that other people are saying that the large size is a negative feature of these treats, but, really, it's not. If they were smaller, they may just be swallowed whole instead. That's what one my cats does with her food and other treats. Because of the size of these treats, though, she's forced to chew them, which is good since these are dental treats. They have to be chewed to be effective.<br /><br />The flavor of these treats must be really good too. My cats are usually very open to sharing food and treats with one another, but when it comes to these treats, they growl if the other tries to even sneak a crumb.<br /><br />Before I bought these, I thought about buying the ones by Petrodex. After I compared the ingredients, though, I realized these were the way to go. Petrodex has two additional ingredients. The first one I googled turns out to be poisonous to cats. It may not be harmful in small quantities, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

review/summary: Cat Addiction
review/text: My cat is addicted to this dental treats.  It started out about 6 months ago my cat's vet metioned that she was developing a little bit of tartar on her teeth.  The vet gave me a couple of these treats to try on her to see if it wouldn't be something that might help her.  My cat is pretty finicky at what she eats but it was love at first sight with these treats.  She litterally begs for these.  She knows which cupboard they are kept in so she will jump on top of our microwave that is directly under this particular cupboard and she will meow pretty intensly everytime you walk by her when she is sitting in that spot.  She was getting one treat a day but because of the cost of these treats, we have cut her down to one every other day. When my husband and I are employed again maybe we will go back to one a day.  Everytime she gets one of these treats she acts like she has died and gone to cat heaven! She recommends them very highly!

The first few days she sort of turned her nose up at them (and she goes crazy for the Temptations and other dental food I have given her in the past), but not so much for these. If I break them up and put them in her food bowl, she will eat them, though, so she must sort of like them anyway ;). I have only been using these treats for a few days and my cat is young so I am using them as preventative care for her teeth. Anyway, I thought the amount was good for the price!

review/summary: Cats Go Crazy For Them
review/text: These were recommended to us at the veterinary hospital to keep our cats' teeth cleaner in between cleanings. As we've only been using them a few months, don't know if they've helped in that regard, although one of our cats has been back and the doctor said her teeth "look good". She had a dental three months ago, so who knows if treats had anything to do with that.<br /><br />But we do know that the "kids" love them. They go absolutely, hysterically crazy for them. I've never seen such a response to any treat. Our 2-year-old bats his around like a hockey puck, terrorizing it, stalking it, and finally devouring it. Our middle-aged mellow boy carefully contemplates his and eats it slowly, like he wants to savor every bit of it as long as possible. Our senior queen kitty picks hers up and carries it to a private place where she can dine by herself. Our kids are large and the size of these is no problem. At first I cut them into smaller pieces, but that turned out to not be necessary.<br /><br />I only wish they weren't so darned expensive. Amazon has the best price, but with multiple cats getting 1-2 per day, every day, we need to buy them frequently.

review/summary: Cat Dental Chews - Outstanding Product
review/text: I bought this product because every cat I've owned has always had tartar problems. Dental cleanings are expensive and painful for cats. When I first gave her a chew, I had to cut it in half for her to eat it, and I put the bag away in the pantry on a high shelf. I left for the day and when I came home, I found that somehow she'd leapt to the shelf, knocked the bag down and eaten about half of the chews. The shelf is the same location where I keep Temptations treats and she'd never tried to get on the shelf before!  This is a great product - I'd give it 6 stars if possible!

review/summary: Fantastic product
review/text: My vet recommended these for my half-Siamese, very particular, cat because she kept having tarter buildup (and, as a result, bad breath). I was skeptical because my cat is VERY picky about food. She LOVES them. It is her "treat" each day. Well, my vet stopped carrying them, so I came to Amazon and now I never have to worry about quick delivery, tarter buildup, bad breath or an unhappy kitty! Life is great with CET Enzematic cat chews!

review/summary: Took awhile, but now he loves them.
review/text: FIRST FEW DAYS:  Not only does the cat refuse to eat these, but he won't even eat the food that it touched after I broke one up and mixed it in his dry food, so he's gone hungry all day.  Putting it in his mouth --- so he chewed it a bit with his back molars --- made him slightly interested after he was on his own, so he licked it and then batted at it.  But then he "buried" it, and now he won't spend time in the same room with it.  It's only been 24 hours, but I doubt that he will eat it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  For the first few days, I had to force feed part of it to him, and now he really really likes them.  I am not sure whether it's helping his teeth, though.

review/summary: The ultimate cat treat  & DIY pill pocket
review/text: I can't say whether or not this is helping my cats' dental health b/c I don't feed it regularly enough; it's pretty expensive. I will say that it is, however, a very powerful treat for my critters -- they go CRAZY for these, leaping and crying. Other treats don't have this effect. I discovered recently these make good DIY "pill pockets". One cat is on a short course of antibiotic and steroid pills and he's impossible to pill by any normal method, so I've been taking a paring knife and boring tiny holes into these treats and stuffing in 1 pill per hole. Pill problem solved! I'm actually buying more in case I need to pill them in the future.

review/summary: One cat doesn't eat it & the other throws up after eating it
review/text: This was recommended to me by my vet so I'm sure that you can probably get a sample to see if your cats will eat it or whether they'll just play with it.<br /><br />The Chews are surrounded by this plastic "wrapper-like" outer coat which I assume is to make it harder for the cats to chew through and thus help brush away the tartar. However, my cats wouldn't eat it unless I broke it up into little pieces and took away the outside "wrapper," which I think defeats the purpose of giving them the chews in the first place. If I didn't break them up, they would just play with it and bat it around like a toy and it would just end up under my fridge.<br /><br />My cat who did eat it has thrown up every single time from it. I don't know why - maybe it doesn't sit well with her.<br /><br />Wish I hadn't bought the 96 count...probably will donate it to an animal shelter, maybe they'll have better luck.

review/summary: Cat hated it!
review/text: I bought this product on recommendation from my mother-in-law who claims it worked wonders in cleaning her cat's teeth and that her cat loved these things.  Well I have a 5 year old cat who has pretty serious dental disease, so I purchased these hoping they would help.  Unfortunately, my cat really dislikes these treats.  She won't even eat them when she's starving and that's saying a lot.  I thought at first that it was because the treats were too big (wine cork size), so I cut them up into thirds and she still won't touch them.  They smell fishy to me, so I'm not sure why she doesn't like them.  She did eat a few bits of it when I first gave them to her, but since then has decided this isn't for her.<br /><br />I don't care how good a product is at removing tartar/plaque, if the cats don't like it, they don't eat it and then it's useless to me.  I don't know if I should have tried the poultry flavor, but I doubt that she'd like that flavor either.<br /><br />If you're considering getting these, I suggest you get the small quantity just in case your cat is like mine and hates these.

review/summary: Wasted My Money!
review/text: I bought these for my 2 cats at the same time I bought the C.E.T HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews (with Chlorhexidine) for Large Dogs (26-50 Pounds) for my Dal. The cats absolutely hate their cat chews! The first time I tried to give them each one, they sniffed at it, and one cat actually bit into it, but promptly spit it back out. The other cat wouldn't even try that. I tried a couple more times, but both cats will not eat them. Now when I give my Dal her chew the cats try to steal that away from her. So I wish these cat chews were more like the dog chews. I can not recommend this product for cats. (But to be honest, my Dal will eat them!)

I don't like the oily taste of the liquid non-dairy creamers, so these packets are perfect.  I am glad Amazon carries them because they are difficult to find, particularly at a reasonable price.

review/summary: DISAPPOINTED FOR MANY REASONS!  HORRIBLE CANDY..
review/text: If I could rate this transaction ZERO STARS I would, I was disappointed for many reasons.<br /><br />SHIPPING TIME and HIDDEN INFO. and OVER CHARGED for SHIPPING:<br />I ordered this item for a party with plenty of time for shipping, even with standard shipping, but just to be sure I emailed the seller (Bayside Candy) 1 hour after I ordered, to make sure they knew I needed the item before the weekend (it was Tuesday and they are located about an hour from me!)  I finally received an answer and they said the following: "Amazon states that it could take up to two weeks to receive any orders. The shipping service that I provide is 5-8 business days" and that they "do not guarantee that USPS will deliver it by this weekend".  TWO WEEKS delivery time to travel ONE hour away????  I went back to this item page and BURIED far down is a link that gets you to their shipping rates.....saying it could take up to TWENTY ONE DAYS for an item to be delivered. Read further, to their "disclaimer" and it says the item might not even be as the website describes!  VERY interesting how they don't feel the need to put all this shipping information up front in the DESCRIPTION section, and they can basically send you ANY ingredients they want, saying it is a substitution?  Also check their web page and it states they ship in 2 days after you place order and it takes 4 to 14 days or as long as 21 days...so which is it?  NEXT they state: "We will send your order within 2-3 business days using USPS priority mail flat rate service." Well they use the flat rate envelope alright, should cost $4.95 so why was I charged $6.99 for shipping?<br /><br />BAD WRAPPING/PACKING and SHIPPING and TASTE!<br />Well when the item finally did arrive it was FIVE pounds of gummy frogs SQUASHED in a skinny paper Priority ENVELOPE!!!  you know, those flat ones meant for a few paper documents! ...only this one was bulging at the seams in my mailbox in hot summer weather! So much for their temperature control "stored in a climate controlled room" claim (I guess once it leaves their facility they no longer care about that).  NO wrapping or padding whatsoever, just the plastic bag of FIVE pounds of candy stuffed into a too-small envelope!  This product SHOULD have at LEAST been shipped in a small cardboard box with bubble wrap or SOME insulated padding.  Upon opening the envelope the gummy frogs were all stuck together, and tasted quite rubbery (and I LIKE, and am familiar with, textures of other gummy candy)... but this was like trying to eat rubber!) The taste was faint and not very apple-like. In fact it was quite awful.<br /><br />VERY BAD TRANSACTION AND AWFUL WRAPPING/PACKING/SHIPPING AND HORRIBLE PRODUCT!

It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.

review/summary: Smarties - Not Just British Nostalgia
review/text: I used to buy the occasional packet of Smarties at a British import shop, just for nostalgia's sake, but recently I've become completely hooked on them to the point where I hoard them so I won't run out! The ingredients are far higher quality than M&Ms, the colors are all natural dyes (plant extracts, like spirolina for the green ones), and the orange ones even have orange extract in the chocolate itself. There is no substitute for Smarties! They are worth a bit extra for the quality.

review/summary: Another fantastic ZiwiPeak product!
review/text: It should have been no surprise to me that the ZiwiPeak canned venison is a hit with my dog as he already enjoys the ZiwiPeak Air Dried Venison Dog Food...but I was indeed surprised at HOW MUCH he loves the ZP canned.  I've been feeding my dog, Titan, another brand of canned dog food so that I could hide his different medications and get him to eat them without having to wrestle his powferful jaws like the late beloved Crocodile Hunter.  While he enjoyed this other brand of 100% venison canned food, he was on to me with the whole pill hiding thing and would root around his bowl and eat around the pills.  Titan is a food motivated dog (you'd think he was a lab rather than a pittie) and usually I could count on telling him to sit, give me paw and then literally drop the ball of wet food with the pills hidden inside into his mouth and he would gulp them down.  Well, a couple of weeks ago, he wouldn't eat the wet in his dish, and when I tried the old 'drop in his mouth' trick, he let the ball of wet food hit him in the snout and didn't even lick it off; he just watched me pick up the mess and waited for me to wipe off his face.<br /><br />Enter ZP canned.  First, this stuff doesn't look like normal canned food.  It has such a fresh quality to it.  Titan loved it instantly.  In fact, I don't even have to hide the pills anymore.  I feed him just like an 80+ baby, spoon feeding him right from the can, except that I place a pill on the spoon as it goes in his mouth.  No getting my hands all messy with shaping the canned food around a pill to conceal it from him.  Titan knows the pill is in there, and as long as he gets a mouthful of the ZP canned, he doesn't care.<br /><br />Oh, and he won't even touch the old stuff with or without pills.  He knows he's moved on up in the quality of food  and there's no turning back!

review/summary: Clams...
review/text: Clams in a can are as tasteless as sweet peas in a can. I have tried many different brands but unfortunately all clams in cans are  tasteless. These clams are/(suppose to be) from US not from the Orient like other brands. Although 6.5 oz, you only get 3 oz which is less than a cup and still more expensive than 10oz cans.  I do not consume these for taste. Instead of buying supplements I consume these clams since it's ready to go without any hard labour for B12, iron and protein. I rinse to get rid of 500 mg sodium and sand which regardless after rinse there is still sand in these clams. For real clam taste I buy fresh clams from Costco and boil it myself for three minutes.

review/text: This is a nice tea. However, it does not really taste like a peach or an apricot. I've bought a few different teas from this company, and although  most of them have a nice flavor, the company has some serious mix up about tea names. They taste nothing like the name. Please read description, before you buy. Description says: Organic Black Tea, Organic Lemon Myrtle, Natural Flavor and Organic Orange Calendula. I can see Calendula petals in there and I can for sure taste lemony-lime taste of  Lemon Myrtle. That's it. it tastes like lime. This tea will be very nice iced. But not so much hot.

Keep in mind that the peach and apricot only provide a hint of flavor.  If you are looking for a strong fruit flavor, this is not your tea.  I have been pleased with all of the Davidson teas that I have tried but this one is really my favorite.  This is not a $50/lb tea but an excellent tea at this price.

review/text: I have used loose tea for over a dozen years.  Peach being my favorite. But though the price on this pound of loose peach, apricot tea is very good, don't waste your money.  This is the bitterest tasting tea I have ever bought.  I gave 1 star because the tea's color was good.  There was however, no aroma at all as the tea brewed. None what so ever. That should have my first clue.

review/summary: Surprisingly different peach tea
review/text: When I first received this tea, I was disappoined upon reading the ingredient label.  I wanted peach/apricot tea which is my most favorite tea flavor.  The label listed lemon myrtle and orange calendula, two flavors not shown in the description prior to purchasing it, along with black tea and natural flavor (which I assumed were the peach and apricot flavors).  Lemon myrtle has the strongest lemon flavor of all the plants and usually overwhelms other flavors.  However, since all ingredients were certified to be organic, I decided to try it.  I was pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />  Peach/apricot is not the primary flavor nor is it lemony. The tea is mild with the flavors all blending quite nicely to a different taste than I have ever experienced before.  It does NOT taste like peach/apricot but a flavor all it's own and has quickly become my new favorite.<br /><br />  Not a day goes by now without enjoying some of this tea.  It also makes wonderful iced tea and I make it by the gallon and keep it in the frig.  Even my husband, normally a coffee drinker, enjoys it iced and often takes it to work to have with his lunch.  We, both, like it so well, we now have a standing order for it to be shipped at regular intervals and are very glad Amazon offers this service now, too.<br /><br />  I served it iced at a meeting recently.  All 6 people there couldn't guess what flavor it was but they loved it and wanted to know where I got it so they could purchase it for themselves.<br /><br />  So if you are looking for peach/apricot tea, this isn't it! (which is the only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5)<br />However, if you're looking for a great new taste in tea, this one is a winner in my opinion!! (if we could give two scores, I'd give this a 5+ for what it really tastes like)

review/text: This tea has a nice taste for making ice tea, but it does not taste like apricot or peach. The lemon myrtle over powers everything else in this tea. It has a good price point, the tea leafs are of fair quality, and the taste is good, if used for iced tea.  It reminds me of lemon zinger tea but with out the hit of chicory at the end.

review/summary: Why Why Why??
review/text: I used to get this dressing at Wally World (a.k.a. Wal-Mart). It was always available. When I started noticing that the dressing was only there "sometimes", I would buy all of the bottles of it--partly because I was afraid they were going to quit stocking it, and partly because I wanted Wally to see that this stuff is profitable for them to stock.<br /><br />No matter. It's gone, for good.  It has a terrific, tangy flavor without having too strong a bite. It was hard to keep around this house. Now I can't even get it to bring to the house.<br /><br />I am going to hold my breath and order it online, and just hope that what has happened to others (wrong dressing, way past expiration, etc.) won't happen to me.  If it's close to the expiration date, I'll keep it anyway, because we really use it up, especially during gardening season.  The stuff tastes just fine a couple months past the expiration date, too, if it hasn't been opened.  I think the reason for the date is that the quality supposedly starts to deteriorate, not because it's "rotten".  Though, I've never noticed any deterioration in quality.<br /><br />I sure wish I could duplicate this recipe at home.<br /><br />Update:  The bottles of this dressing that I ordered from Amazon weren't anywhere close to the expiration date, and is good as always.

review/text: BEWARE! All the previous reviews about how great this product is - are all right on. One reviewer noted that his shipment had a short expiration date. We noted it but went ahead and ordered 2 cases to qualify for the free shipping. When we received them, they all had an expiration date 7 months from receipt. 12 bottles of 16oz Red Wine - gulp! They will probably be OK some past that date but you should know about the expiration date. I called Kraft and found that they 'fresh' date Red Wine ** 8 months ** from the bottling date; so if you can't use what you're ordering in that time - take care.

E.g. toss with raw potatoe chunks and roast until tender.  Yum.<br />This stuff is so good I think I could almost drink it straight from the bottle!

review/summary: Why is this not available anywhere except online?
review/text: I recieved this dressing in a gift box at Christmas many years ago and didnt even know who I had gotten it from.  I am not one to usually try new things, so it sat in my pantry for a really long time.  When I finally tried it, I loved it.  It was not being sold in our area though.  So, by calling Kraft, I was able to find out the closest it was available was in Colorado.  I live in Washington.  The next summer we went to visit family and I found it in a Walmart in Colorado, and bought them out.  Since then, a year ago I seen it once here in a discount grocery store who sells expired goods.  I again bought them out.  Now I have been out for a couple months.  I called kraft to find it.  They were terribly rude.  I called back 4 times.  I do not understand why they can not sell their product over the phone or tell me a city where it is being sold.  I have friends and family all over the US and was sure I would have someone close to get it.  They did tell me it is being sold in only 4% of the USA now.  They recommended that I ask my local grocery stores to carry it, which I have done at 3 (Safeway, Walmart, and a local) and they are not able to order from kraft either.  If I didn't love this dressing so much, I would have boycotted Kraft for not making the product available.  I am so happy to find it online.

Unfortunately, when I moved from east coast to west coast I found that Kraft seven seas red wine vinaigrette isn't sold anywhere in California.  So, I have to order cases of this stuff.  I go through one bottle/month for 1 adult.<br /><br />The bright red color has always somewhat perturbed me when I think about how they got that color, but it has also always drawn me in.  I have tried dozens of other red wine vinaigrettes and even tried to recreate the recipe myself from scratch and nothing comes close to this version.  I eat a salad with it almost everyday.  I highly recommend this salad dressing.

review/summary: Salad dressing is a family favorite
review/text: My family has been consuming this salad dressing and using it as a marinade for 20 years. The name and bottle change but the recipe does not. I usually make my own salad dressing but this one is great right out of the bottle. When we have company they always comment on the salad dressing and ask for the recipe.

review/summary: We all LOVE it  but it's so hard to find !
review/text: I am buying this by the cases as it has become very hard to find ! I wish our local grocery stores and our Super Wal*Mart would carry this again...we have tried many other similar salad dressings but nothing else compares to this...it is by far the best vinaigrette out there! Come on Kraft...you have a great product but it's too hard to find...listen to your consumers and make this easier to purchase!<br />  My whole family loves this and you will too!

review/summary: My Dressing
review/text: I call this product "my dressing."  I have loved it since I was very little.  I think it is good on everything except lettuce.  It is really good on cooked vegetables like string beans and broccoli as well as raw veggies like carrots and tomatoes.  I even put it on rice pilaf, and it makes chickpeas into a delicious snack.  But it must be noted that this dressing seems to have been created for avocados.  Avocados taste amazing with this!  Try this: place your finger over the hole.  Tip the bottle upside down and let all the good stuff settle.  Then shake onto your food.  That's how I always use it.  The oil is actually unnecessary.  I'm so scared because it's getting harder to find.  Buy lots so they keep making it!

review/summary: Did they stop production?
review/text: This has been my favorite for quite a while. I usually bought 2 bottles at a time, and now I can't find it anywhere.<br />DITD (Down in the dumps!)<br /><br />Update - Jan 8, 2009<br />PLEASE BE CAREFUL - I ordered this item and they sent me the fat-free variety. If I had wanted the fat-free variety I would have ordered it.<br />Amazon made it right though. They sent me the correct item.

review/summary: best vinaigrette we have found.
review/text: Very happy to have found this product. It is slightly different than the original(which is no longer available in markets). This product is more flavorful with less acidity and better suited to dress light green salads.

review/summary: Not nearly as good as the original Seven Seas brand
review/text: We have used Seven Seas brand Red Wine Vinaigrette dressing forever, just cut up a garden fresh cucumber and pour some of the dressing over it...yum! Now that Kraft has taken it over, and has added a LOT more oil (must be a cheaper way of making it, less real ingredients, more oil) it's not nearly as good. I read in one review to let it settle out, pour off most of the oil, and it tastes pretty much like the Seven Seas, so I'll try that, but even if it works, that means half the dressing for the price. I hate to see the big companies cheapen a product just to make more profit, but ces't la vie in this day and age.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I cannot find this product in any local grocery or market. I find a "lite" variety which is a very poor tasting product. Often those few suppliers who do carry this product are out. It is the dressing for my marinated chicken. It is the dressing for my salads, both green and pasta. It just happens to suit me and I rarely use any other.

review/summary: Another great product off the local grocery shelves
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HUMQ">Kraft Light Red Wine Vinaigrette with Vegetable Oil Reduced Fat Dressing, 16-Ounce Plastic Bottles (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Why do large companies buy a product line and then decimate it?  Kraft Seven Seas line is one that has been all but abandoned by its producer.  The Kraft Seven Seas Red Wine Vinaigrette Dressing and Marinade is still the tangiest, most delicious red wine vinaigrette out there.  I have "kissed a lot of toads" trying to find anything comparable.  Either the red wine aspect or the tangy/tart aspect is completely off in other brands.  Most feel there must be mustard in it, or that it must be sweet.  Reading the other reviews here, I am not alone in being an ardent fan of this dressing - so what's the problem with the fulfillment department at Kraft.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a really good substitute, Kroger brand has a great one in their Red Wine Vinaigrette.  It's the closest possible although I find the Seven Seas to be just a tad sweeter.  Considering the fact that I cannot find the Seven Seas in any grocery store, I know my local Kroger store, which is Fry's here in Arizona, will have this wonderful concoction right there on their shelves.<br /><br />Thank heavens for Amazon making the Seven Seas dressing available to us - and at a good price.  But, you know eventually that will end, too.  Crazy decisions by the maker who is probably basing their decision to discontinue the dressing on the fact sales are down (maybe the lack of it in stores is the culprit - duh).

review/summary: Don't worry...it's fresh!
review/text: Received ours today (April 18, 2011) and the expiration date isn't until October 2011, so don't worry about getting old stock right now.  When this was Seven Seas, you could buy it everywhere here in NE PA.  Then Kraft took over and it disappeared.  Reappeared in the 8-ounce size recently in 2 grocery stores, but it's always wiped out.  I've asked the grocery managers to up their order base on it, but was met with...basically..."Duh".  So we've resorted to ordering it here on Amazon.  It's a great price for the 16-oz. bottles.  I have to wonder why Kraft keeps coming out with more and more new dressing flavors (there's about 10 varieties of Italian) yet they can't just simply stock a style that, obviously, is in demand.  There isn't even any competition that I know of...I have yet to see in local stores another company that makes a red wine vinaigrette.  Go figure!

review/summary: Too much oil!
review/text: Bought the Seven Seas Vinaigrette Dressing for my mother,it' her favorite.  Had not been able to find it in the stores around here for about 3 years.  When we received it I noticed it had a lot more oil than it used to.  I poured off most of the oil (approximatly half the bottle) and my mother now enjoys it.  Needs more of the vinaigrette and less of the oil.

review/summary: My favorite salad dressing!
review/text: I love this salad dressing. I can usually find it at my local Albertson's.  I usually have heartburn after using most salad dressings but not with this Seven Seas! I always keep an exta bottle in my pantry so I don't ever run out.<br /><br />I plan on ordering this multi pack.
