review/summary: This is Columbian?
review/text: This coffee does not taste like Colombian to me. It is rather bland and does not taste too much different than any grocery store canned coffee. I was quite disappointed. The cost was quite a bit less than others available which is why I tried it but I will pay more next time to have better quality. The beans look rather dry with little evidence of oil on them and it seems to be a medium roast. I brew my coffee using a Melitta type cone and make each cup as needed. Sorry but I just cant recommend this one.

review/summary: bacon... Bacon... BACON!!!!!!
review/text: O.k. I was a little nervous ordering the half slab here on Amazon for a few reasons: Not Prime, not direct from Amazon, shipping.  Have to say that my purchase was super smooth and that the bacon is (was) excellent!!!  I posted some pictures so check them out if you want the nutrition information from the label or a look at the package.<br /><br />I ordered on a Tuesday and the bacon arrived Thursday afternoon.  Was sent a tracking number right away, and it shipped UPS 2 Day which was included in the price.  As I live in California it was tax free also.  The package was left on my door step in the sun when I arrived home in the afternoon.  It was very warm to the touch and I was worried and dreading what would be inside.  However, when the box was opened the bacon was cold to the touch - though  not frozen.  Just like you would get it from the store.  The outside of the box was wrapped in a heavy shrink wrap, the box was a thick cardboard and sealed with tape well, and inside the box was an inner styrofoam cooler, with a strofoam lid, that fit the dimension of the box perfectly.  Inside the styrofoam cooler were two ice packs and the bacon.  The bacon is shrink wrapped also.  It arrived in perfect condition.  My half slab weighed in at 5.12 lbs.<br /><br />So I have never "cut" my own bacon from a slab before.  I used a shaprp Henckel butcher knife and cut slices about 1/4" thick.  The slicing is a bit of a chore and a bit of a mess as compared to the pre-sliced.  Still the bacon cut easy with the sharp knife and I just used my shrink wrapper to re-package the bacon into 3 smaller packages to put into the freezer.<br /><br />It cooked delicious!  Crisp and slightly crunchy and moist and a bit meaty inside.  Even before cooking the aroma was delicious.  A slight smokey aroma.  Upon cooking over a low heat the smell just ROCKED!!!  Again flavor was great too.  Better then store bought bacon?  Yes!  Worth 4x the cost?  Well that's up to you.  I think so.  Mail order bacon can only be described as a luxury item anyway.<br /><br />I will order from Burgers' Smokehouse again.  Next purchase will be a ham.  Or more bacon.

review/summary: Look somehere else
review/text: The product arrived in a timely manner, thanks for that. Otherwise, I am quite disappointed. It sure looks nice on the product description page, but don't be fooled. I expected some sort of slab bacon similar in texture to a store bought bacon package looking like the photo. Not so, 99.9% pure fat, barely hints of "meat". I was planning on using this bacon as seasoning for pea, lentil and bean soups, but it's completely unusable and ended up in the garbage. Not worth it.

review/text: I just ordered my second full slab, and can't wait until it gets here. It freezes up very well, and the last portions are just as good as the first. I cut it into almost 1/2 inch thick slices, and it's like eating a delicious ham steak. Wonderful taste! I just can't eat regular bacon anymore. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I may never have to!<br /><br />If I could give it 6 stars, I would!

The bacon was edible and was a good component for dishes,but so salty I couldn't eat more than 1 piece at a sitting. I will not order this brand again.

review/summary: My cats love it and there is almost no by-products
review/text: I thought that all the Market Select cat foods were devoid of the heinous by-products but I did see tuna by-products listed for one of the flavors.  Still that's way better than the other store brands that have every conceivable by-product as the first or second ingredient on the list.  I feed my cats Pet Promise dry food but they don't like the Pet Promise canned food.  It seems like all the higher quality canned foods are the same dense sticky consistency that my herd just will not eat.  They love the gravy-laden types so I'm happy to find this one, Market Select, the cosistency the cats love, and almost no by-products.  I also really like the peel off lid and sturdy plastic cups.  It's so easy to open as compared to cans or the pouches which to me are awkward and messy.  I wash stuff like cat food containers so they don't stink up the place waiting for trash day and washing the peel off lids and the plastic cups is a breeze.  No cuts from metal lids.  I have to buy this cat food by the case from Amazon because my local store does not carry it.  But I don't mind since it's efficient and affordable to buy in bulk.  I just hope Amazon does not drop it from it's offerings like they have done with so many other food items.

Reminds me of puri aloo (without the bread) from railway platforms or from street vendors across India, but higher quality and very hygienic. Convenient foil package. Heat & serve. Great with tortillas, pitas, puris, on toast, or over rice.

You can buy them direct from Tasty Bite for much less than that.  In fact, you can buy them from your local supermarket for less than you can from both of them.

review/text: I initially hesitated to buy any ready-to-eat product fearing that they might taste bad or how they could be preserved without preservatives.  But when shopping last week, I found it in the Indian cuisine aisle and decided to give it a try.  I just heated it and found it to be better tasting.  But you add lemon juice (enough to give it the sour tangy taste) and chopped cilantro.  I also added quarter teaspoon of chilli powder, rasam powder and salt accordingly to give it a fresh taste.  Try the above directions for a real good taste.

review/summary: Nice spicy potatoes and chickpeas.
review/text: Tasty Bite has become my least favorite brand of shelf-stable retort-packaged Indian meals. The Bombay Potatoes are a pleasant surprise after some of the other meals such as the syrupy Thai entrees.  (The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5DKLM">Tasty Bite Entree, Punjab Eggplant, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> is another one I like.)<br /><br />The potatoes and chickpeas have retained a sufficient amount of texture.  The sauce is thin but has a pleasant spiciness and there is plenty of it, which I don't mind because it is pretty good, especially compared to some of the other ones I have tried.  You can add leftover potato, chickpeas, or even green beans to this meal and I like to serve it with brown rice and garnish with diced chili peppers.<br /><br />The entire package is supposed to be two servings but is realistically one. The total contents have 820mg of sodium, 6g of dietary fiber, 8g of fat, and 1g of saturated fat. The meal is vegan and is certified kosher.

review/summary: Product plus shipping = not buying!
review/text: Hi folks. This will be my very first review for a Amazon product, so please bear with me....Tasty Bites is by far my favorite choice of pre-packed Indian treats. I've tried the 3-4 other major Indian food manufacturers products and Tasty Bites is consistently better, which is also borne out by other customer reviews. So, I was very happy to see that Amazon carries my 3 favorites, the product offered, Bombay Potatoes, and also their Kashmiri Spinach and the eggplant dish, who's name escapes me for now. Having already purchased some other Tasty Bites products that I have never tried before through Amazon, I was very happy with the low cost per package, which comes out to approximately $2.61 per package, since I am an Amazon Prime member, that is the total cost delivered to my door, a tremendous price, considering the least costly alternative from my local market is $3.95 per package. So I was really jazzed when I thought I could get all my faves for the same great price, but sadly, this was not to be........Amazon does not stock my 3 faves, some other company does, and not only is the per packet cost higher than Amazon's, since it is not covered by Amazon Prime, there is also the $16 plus shipping charge on top of that, bringing the per package price to $4.40 something, nearly $2 more per package than the Amazon choices. I can go to my local market and get my faves for half a buck less, but if Amazon started offering them, I would be in pre-packed Indian food heaven. How does one go about petitioning Amazon to start carrying products? I know some people will purchase these 3 great products at the higher cost and added postage, but wouldn't it be great if Amazon delivered the orders through their excellent Amazon Prime?

review/text: I tried to drink this, I really did.  I'm a newlywed, and some of my medications tend to kill my libido, so I really wanted this to work.  But I simply can't make myself drink this nasty, vile stuff.  It made a nasty, seaweed-green paste inside my tea infuser, and the smell is even worse than the taste.  No way -- I've ordered capsules instead!  I told my husband -- I love you, but no way can I do this, not even for you!

review/summary: We BOTH like it!
review/text: I normally make my own baby food, but we are getting ready to move overseas and so I needed to find healthy, pre-packaged baby food that travels easily and tastes good. Since my son is used to fresh foods (he is 7 months old and has been eating nothing but homemade fruit and veggie purees for about a month and a half), I was concerned about the taste. He loved the apple & carrots puree. Good consistency and not too sweet-I tasted it too because I don't feed my kids anything I'm not willing to eat :). I liked that I could squeeze it straight onto a spoon (good for traveling), and that it's organic. Over all, great product and would definitely recommend it to other parents, especially those who need it for a trip.

Kenco has the international smoothness that I can only get with Nabob and Kenco.  The Kenco cup is a small cupper, though.  It's not a full cup like Nabob.  It is lighter than Nabob and makes a creamier coffee than Nabob.  I like them both.  I now reach for Kenco more than Nabob, because I am a small cup drinker and the flavor is great for those days when you want less caffeine in the morning and more taste.  Nabob and Kenco (and Gevalia Hazelnut for a strong falvored coffee that guests will enjoy).

review/text: The Kenco discs are good. The coffee is fine but the reason I gave it three stars is because I think these fall in the range of your good medium roast coffee but you may pay a little for the name. It brews a euro cup (smaller than a traditional American blend) that's solid, good flavor, and has a nice bite to it. But these aren't much different from the Maxwell House "House Blend" discs that brew more coffee for a less cost. It's nothing against Kenco. If you want these, buy them..it's good coffee. But for the cost/product ratio, I'd say you would be just as happy with Maxwell House.

I am currently sipping with International Delight's Cinnabon flavor and its just an amazing taste. You can taste the flavor as a subtle after taste, and when I am drinking it, I tend to take big long gulps as its so good, I don't want to put it down. It makes a lot too. A nice big cup of coffee that is bigger than most of the other tassimo cups. Rainforest Alliance Certified means I can feel good that I'm drinking something that goes to help our planet. I am going to make sure I stock up on these as they last a while and make a big cup. They are a great normal coffee (other than an espresso latte or machiatto)

I am not sure what this is - doesn't smell or taste like coffee sort of like weak bad tea or cat urine.<br /><br />Believe me I am not overstating my experience - this stuff is horrible.

review/summary: Good Price But Not Much Spice
review/text: On a diet and craving cinnamon candy (like hot tamales), so I searched for a sugar free alternative. The price was great for the quantity. I keep some in my purse and desk drawer and they do satisfy my occasional candy desires. However, they are not nearly as spicy as I would like. I don't know if this is because they are sugar free as I have not tried similar products. But, with that said, they are not bad tasting. My only real complaint is that they are already a bit sticky when you take them out of the wrapper.

review/text: I've tried just about every coffee out there.  They go from no taste to super pucker strong.  This is the best one and has been discontinued so if you want it, buy it and stock up.  You can make this one with all different amounts of water to get the strength you want without any bitter taste even when strong.  I understand only supermarkets and Walmart will be carrying it though when stocks run out elsewhere and if you search, you can find it at a good price.

review/summary: Acceptable taste, Made IN CHINA
review/text: I bought 5 different brands & assorted dehydrated fruits. (Why so many? I send boxes to servicemen overseas). The taste of this product is ok but not good.<br /><br />It is dehydrated so the texture is... well a dehydrated texture. The fruit taste mildly like the fruit they are suppose to be.<br /><br />If real fruit flavor is what you seek & fresh fruit is not an option, buy DRIED fruit instead of dehydrated.<br /><br />My concerns: I am reluctant to buy or eat any food product made in China. In 2008 all baby formula made in China was recalled due to dangerous contamination with poison chemicals, this was just a few years after a similar formula recall when it was discovered that Chinese made formula had substitued a chemical for the protein in formula & 10s of thousands or more babies were found to be sick or died from malnutrition.<br /><br />In 2007 all or nearly all Chinese manufactured Pet Food was recalled for the same reasons.<br /><br />Therefore I don't trust any food product made in China. If you like this product then eat it as junk food. In my opinion, no one should assume it is a healthy snack or a better choice than a candy bar or cookie.

review/text: After reading that dried apples, when eaten daily, can help lower cholesterol levels, I've been on the lookout for good dried apples.  I've tried different brands, and when we bought a variety pack of Brothers dried fruit crisps at a local store, we found our winner.  I just got on Amazon to see if I could find a better price here.<br /><br />My two year old and four year old have been devouring the pear and peach crisps.  I've been eating the apple ones...and my 9 month old baby has even been enjoying the broken bits of the apple ones.  These are an excellent, healthy snack.  They have the "crunch" you'd expect from a potato chip, so they have that snack-y appeal. Knowing they're all fruit, I love feeding them to my kids...and I love eating these, too!

review/text: If your child is picky take note:  the apple and pear look the same but the strawberry & banana are in tiny pieces and are red colored.  For some reason, my 2 1/2 year old did not eat those.  I'm not giving up, don't get me wrong, I think he will eventually eat them, but I'm just letting everyone know.  I think these are a GREAT travel snack especially if you don't want to be cutting fruit.  They kind of melt in your  mouth which is cool.  I would not say these will fill you up, even for a busy boy toddler, so you may want to add a protein or fat with this as a snack.  That said, it will curb any minor munchies in a healthy way and on the go.

review/summary: YUM!!  Great for kids with sensory issues...but they are from China
review/text: I have a 2-year-old daughter with some sensory issues which have greatly affected her eating.  She will not eat anything that doesn't feel or look right to her.  The only fruits she will eat is a whole apple (with half of the skin peeled off so that she can hold it from the side with the peel on, and eat from the peeled side!), and these freeze dried strawberries.  One package is just the right size...there is enough for her in the bag, but not so much that there are leftovers which get soggy.  I am so glad to have found another fruit for her to eat!  She will not touch real strawberries.<br /><br />My 4-year-old can't stay away from these strawberries and loves all of the other flavors we've tried, too.  She will down 3-4 bags a day if I let her.  And my husband, who is thrilled when he actually gets in one serving of fruit per day, will eat a bag if I put it in front of him or it ends up in his lunchbag.<br /><br />I love that I don't have to worry about strawberries getting moldy the day after I buy them, so I can stock up!<br /><br />EDIT:  Just found out these are from China.  Wouldn't buy them again...

review/summary: Great Fruit Snacks - Highly Recommended!
review/text: A friend recommended these Brothers Crisps and I am very pleased that we took her advice! Being a type 2 diabetic and trying to watch my carbs and calories, these are good snacks that satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings without overly spiking up my blood sugar levels. The real test with any "good for you" snacks is if my teens will eat them, and they also love them!<br /><br />These are made from real fruit (and nothing else) that has been sliced and freeze dried, making them crispy (exactly like "Astronaut Ice Cream") but they will reconstitute in your mouth if you leave them in long enough. This process also makes them very flavorful.<br /><br />This variety pack has an assortment of 3 different types, Fuji Apple, Strawberry Banana, and Asian Pear.<br /><br />Fuji Apple:<br />About 1 1/2 Apples per pack<br />39 Calories<br />7 NET Carbs (6 from sugar)<br /><br />Strawberry Banana:<br />About 1 Banana and 4 Strawberries per pack<br />45 Calories<br />8 NET Carbs (6 from sugar)<br /><br />Asian Pear:<br />About 1 1/2 Pears per pack<br />40 Calories<br />8 NET Carbs (7 from sugar)<br /><br />I like the Asian Pears the best, but all of the flavors are really good. The Strawberries can be a little tart which is different and not displeasing to me.<br /><br />These are a good tasting healthy snack alternative that, if it wasn't for the fairly high cost, I would keep on hand all of the time!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Note: These are made in China<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Tastes Great but concerned about manufacturing processes
review/text: To be completely and 100% fair, I have tried this product before and enjoyed it.  The only part that concerns me is that this product is manufactured in China, with no information on the sources of the fruits. On their website they say they "source fresh fruit" and that " We are not concerned about issues surrounding where our product is produced because we take great care to ensure the quality and food safety of our products."  I'm not suggesting that this product is bad (which is why I gave it 5 stars) but I share more of a concern than evidently the company does, as to where they are getting this fruit, processing it and shipping it.  With the history China has had with kid's toys/formula/etc in the past, let's just say we don't feed these products to our child.  I would love it if the company would provide a tour and exact explanation of the process and sources, rather than discounting that information all together.

It's a shame because it's the perfect snack. It's also a shame since the company just wants to save the extra money so they must be saving quite a bit if they still ship all this back to the US and STILL save money. No thanks.

review/summary: A great Trio of Flavors ...
review/text: I really love the Brothers Crisps simply because they are preservative free, and I have preservative allergies! To be specific, these are sulfite-free, not to mention: gluten-free, vegan, nut/tree-nut safe, dairy free, Non GMO, and even Kosher.<br /><br />This particular variety contains three of my faves, so instead of ending up with 72 bags to get the entire assortment - I ordered the variety and got 24, a much more manageable number!<br /><br />Here's the rundown on what's in the package<br /><br />Strawberry/Banana - contains 1 banana and about 4 strawberries. These are an interesting combination of tart and sweet, and are my personal favorites. I've occasionally even used these on my oatmeal, although I enjoy them straight out of the pack. (45 Calories)<br /><br />Fuji Apple - most kid friendly. Strong and sweet apple taste, nice large pieces that look like apple slices. The package contains 1 1/2 apples and really would make a good substitute for potato chips in a lunch. In fact, most kids would consider it a treat. My sister's grand-kids raid her cupboard for these. (39 Calories)<br /><br />Asian Pear - about the same sweetness of the Fuji apple but without the apple (or strong pear) taste. Once again, this contains 1 1/2 pears, so it really gets you going on your fruit requirements. (40 Calories)<br /><br />The highest nutritional level is the Strawberry/Banana Combo since the strawberries are such a great source of vitamin C, but all of the packs are great choices.<br /><br />Because these are freeze-dried instead of dehydrated, there is no sticky residue to worry about. They are perfect for carrying in the car, sitting at a desk, hiking, backpacking, wherever you want an easy-to-grab healthy fruit snack.

review/text: These are WONDERFUL -- BUT, the title makes it sound like you get 24 bags that are 8.46 ounces each. NOT SO! Each bag is only 0.35 ounces. The 8.46 ounces is the amount you get for all the bags put together.<br /><br />As I said, these are wonderful! But they are very expensive for the amount you get.<br /><br />I gave them 4 stars because the title is deceiving! If you zoom in on the picture, you'll see the bag says 0.35 ounces.
