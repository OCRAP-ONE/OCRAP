review/summary: Still Looking
review/text: When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  I'm still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on.

review/summary: The kids love it!
review/text: After trying several brands of Hot Cocoa my kids have decided that this is the one for them.  I'm certainly happy about it because not only is it delicious, but it's also more affordable.  3 boys can consume a box of hot cocoa very quickly, even with limits set.  It's also very convenient to have it shipped automatically.  If we don't drink that much I simply skip a month.  If friends come over and we drink a lot, I just order an extra box.  It's quick, simple and delicious.

review/summary: Found the secret
review/text: To everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these k-cups, here's the trick.  Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad.

review/text: I saw these on sale so I nabbed them.  For anything larger than a 6oz cup, the results will be too weak.  I end up brewing one with 6oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it.<br /><br />The peppermint was the flavor I was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that I loved the most.  I'm on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k-cups in the future.  It might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my Keurig.

review/text: A pleasant surprise awaited me when I first ordered Grove Square milk chocolate Hot Cocoa cups. Not a coffee drinker,<br />I use our Keurig K-cup brewer mostly to make cocoa, and a few other brands I tried simply did not hit the mark. Grove Square cocoa tasted full-flavored, with just enough chocolate essence to make it a perfect drink. The first experience made me anticipate (with pleasure) the next time I popped a Grove Square K-cup into the machine!

review/summary: Creamy & Rich Cocoa
review/text: I was hesitant to try this cocoa after all the horrible reviews about how it tasted so bad, and had a really bad Sucralose flavor. I don't know if I'm just not as picky as others or what it is, but I thought this hot cocoa was really good. Creamy and rich, and almost TOO sweet. I don't think it has an "aftertaste" though, how some have described. I used the middle water setting on my Keurig or "small mug"...7.25 oz., I guess. Everyone has their own tastes and preferences, but as for me, I really like this product!

review/summary: best k-cup hot chocolate
review/text: This is hands down the best tasting k-cup hot chocolate available.  The Cafe Escapes or whatever the brand name is tastes very watered down and artificial, while this one tastes thicker and milkier.  I love the dark chocolate flavor, although if I didn't know it wasn't dark I probably couldn't have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa.  I will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option.  These are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool.  Everyone always wants hot chocolate!<br /><br />Something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about 6 oz per k-cup.  I use 2 k-cups per mug and the flavor is much better than when I try one (too watery).

review/text: So if you are a person who likes swiss miss / hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station SO DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!  I can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever.  It just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that.  This product has a strong fake sugar taste and I am perfectly OK with diet sodas and other fake sugar products.  There is something about this I just can not put a finger on it but it made my stomach curl.  I even waited for it to cool down, but it got worse.  Very disapointed in this product and it was not what I was expecting at all.

review/summary: Too watery after multiple settings.
review/text: A hot chocolate packet was the first K-Cup on my new Keurig (it was 1 a.m. and I wasn't ready for coffee before bed). I had read they ran a little watery but I decided to try it on the 10 oz. setting, took a sip, and tossed it. The next morning I made one with 8 oz. and added some whipped cream. The taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery. My husband made one to try at 6 oz. and said it tasted like sugar water. I might try combining 2-3 6 oz. servings to use the box up but we won't be buying more.

review/text: I bought this brand of hot chocolate K cups cause it had the best review on Amazon at the time.  The kids love it - they especially like the peppermint flavor which I can't see any other way to get except in this mixed box.  You get milk chocolate, dark chocolate and peppermint flavors.  I tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste.  I make it on the lowest setting on my Keurig which I think is around 7 ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them.  If you like a strong chocolate flavor this isn't it.

review/summary: Better than the others, but still not quite there
review/text: I feel like I've tried every hot cocoa there is in the k-cups.  While I do think this is the best hot cocoa so far, it still isn't great.  I'm not sure what it is, but all of the cocoa k-cups seem to have a weird taste to them.  It's almost like there is artificial sweetener in them,, but I know there is not.<br />I set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa.  This has more body to it than others.<br />I'm still waiting and hoping that Dunkin' Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k-cup.  There really is nothing better than that.<br />If you want a k-cup hot cocoa, I would def. recommend this over all the others.

review/summary: Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?
review/text: I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon.

review/summary: Not bad. Not bad at all.
review/text: I have read some really funny reviews about this product.  Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.<br /><br />I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.  I'll buy it again!

review/summary: Perfect Cocoa
review/text: Everyone in my family likes hot cocoa. I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good, its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids. I will be ordering this product from now on for my family.<br />In the interest of product comparison, we have ordered Timothy's white hot chocolate, and Green Mountain Hot cocoa, Timothy's was great, but pricy, and Green Mountain didn't really taste all that great to our family. It had a watered down taste to it.

review/text: When I weigh the convenience of a K cup against the price and the taste, I would characterize these as a winner. Not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet, these are pretty darn good. They nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that I've had with some other brands. Do not select 10 oz on your machine though. Make it only at 6 or 8 oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion. All in all a fine cup of hot chocolate.

review/text: I am actually surprised at how good this product is. I am a Cuisinart Keurig owner with two teens that love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year round.<br /><br />Price point: The price for these at the store ( exact brand ) is almost triple of what we pay here for the same amount, with subscribe and save this makes these quite affordable for my family use. In comparison to other more expensive brands it's a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantity.<br /><br />Flavor wise: My kids love it, and have already asked me to purchase more. My daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup. I love the dark chocolate in my coffee to make a mocha ( 10oz coffee to 4 oz chocolate ) and it's much better than some other brands that I have tried in the past.<br /><br />Overall impression:  Great value, good flavor, excellent price point I will be purchasing more.

review/text: Ordered on a whim.  My first "Grove Square" purchase.  Great for the family's occasional cocoa desire.  Being a K-Cup it's fast and easy.  Was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee, so far so good.  Great cup of dark, rich cocoa.  Maybe could taste a LITTLE better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk.  The ease and simplicity, and lack of clean up, make this a better option for me.  Will order again.  Nice to see it on subscribe and save.

review/text: I really like hot cocoa!  I like it sooo much that I have a Cocoa Latte machine, which is great, but sometimes I just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher.  When that happens I used to put on the kettle and heat up the water, then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir, and stir, and stir.  And after all that stirring, I'd still get little lumps in my cocoa.  With the K-cups, I get smooth rich cocoa with NO lumps and NO clean-up.  Easy and yummy!<br /><br />Please note: THESE ARE NOT SUGAR-FREE.  The very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and I did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.  Each cup has only 60 calories, but if you want sugar-free or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you.

review/text: This tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn't taste very chocolatey. The name brand cocoa Kkups are better, or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better.

review/summary: Great Tasting! Great Value
review/text: You can't beat this deal! 3 Boxes of 16 K-Cups for little more then $20. No other store can even match that price for Hot Chocolate K-Cups. Your normally going to be paying around $12-$16 for 16 K-cups alone. This package give you 48 K-Cups for a great price.<br /><br />The Hot Chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the B70 except for the travel mug. Low in calories and great tasting. Defiantly a must have if you own a Keurig brewing system!

review/summary: Best Hot Cocoa
review/text: Grove Square is the best k-cup hot cocoa I've tried.  And I've tried a number of the other brands.  This tastes like "real" cocoa used to taste. And if you add a little milk it's even better. It's so hot from the Keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway. If your looking for a real chocolate-ly flavor give this a try.

review/summary: Good flavor and wont break the bank
review/text: Of the few Hot Cocoa flavors we've tried, this is the best so far.  It has the richest flavor and I dont notice the artificial taste that others have commented on.  Its also very affordable compared to other k-cups right now.  I thought that the k-cup making process must have gotten more expensive over the last year, but now I know they are truely sticking it to us since these are still reasonable priced.

review/summary: FAVORITE HOT COCOA!
review/text: This is the absolute best hot cocoa for the Keurig Brewers. All of the other Hot Cocoa's that we have tried we had to "doctor" to make them taste good. We had to add more cocoa and more sugar. I was pretty much making my own cocoa, which defeated the purpose of the brewer. But the Grove Square Hot Cocoa does not need any help. In my opinion, It has just the right amount of flavor!!

review/summary: Pretty good hot chocolate
review/text: I'm giving this product 5 stars because I think it is great considering that it is made with water.  The hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size.  If you want a large cup of hot chocolate, use 2 k-cups.  It is fairly low in calories, most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little k-cup.

review/text: KCups are a godsend; among KCups, these are near the top.<br /><br />The Keurig brewer is a blessing, hot beverages in seconds, mostly coffee; but there are greater and lesses among the coffees, and so, it seems, among the hot cocoas.<br /><br />This is so rich and vibrant, it announces itself from two rooms away.  Silky, smooth, bursting with all the things chocolate is supposed to deliver, it's a must-have in this household.

review/text: Great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k-cups have.  I've tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.  Will definitely purchase more, but at the rate my family downs these, we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective.

review/text: I bought a box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa because I love their Cappuccino French Vanilla.  I used the medium cup setting and added some whipped cream...it was to die for.  Very yummy and almost as good as homemade.  I never noticed an aftertaste like other reviews, but it could be because of the Redi Whip I added to it.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: Got a brand new Keurig machine for Christmas and immediately went to work finding the cheapest and best tasting K-Cups on the market. I came across this when searching for some good Hot Cocoa and am amazed at how many K-Cups you really get out of this. 48 K-Cups for about $20 when I purchased was a great deal when most Hot Chocolate prices were 16 K-Cups for $15~$19.<br /><br />This is a great deal and you get to try out Peppermint, Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate. It's light on calories and most important of all taste GREAT!<br /><br />Must have if your a Hot Chocolate lover or have family that wants a easy to make, great tasting Hot Chocolate for less!

review/summary: Best tasting cocoa k-cup available
review/text: After trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters.
