review/summary: Not at all sure about these
review/text: So I lived in the Philippines for 15 years and this brand "7D" is the BEST by far. However I've never seen this packaging (looks the same in the picture, but the actual pack does not have the usual transparent 'window'). The taste is NOT what I expect from this brand. It was OK and I could not be bothered to return, but I advise against buying these.

review/summary: THESE ARE DELICIOUS!
review/text: I am not one to eat dried fruit, but I got 2 packs of these for free. After sitting on my counter for about a week, I finally decided to try these dried mangoes.<br /><br />THEY JUST TASTE SO GOOD. It's like candy. It's chewy, but still edible. I ate a lot of slices in one sitting, so I felt sick after. Eat a few at a time and save them for later for maximum enjoyment.

review/text: ...at the ABC Store on the Vegas Strip in the Miracle Mile. Wanna say Planet Hollywood. The 3.5oz bag was $3.59 so half this price. Very yummy and very sweet. And as mentioned earlier lots of sugar. Was interested in ordering from Amazon but I think I'll stock up here first. The store had a large package for $20ish.

review/summary: Addicting and the Best
review/text: Hands down the best dried mangoes around. Nice sweet and sour thing going on. Not too excessive with either (sweet/sour) ... just right. The texture is perfect and the strips are well cut in terms of thickness, height and width.<br /><br />I finished a package in less than an hour...which I wouldn't recommend due to the sugar (30+ grams per serving  and 2.5 servings per bag). That said. It's not much worse than drinking soda over the course of your day...actually, it's better.

review/summary: These Mangoes Taste Great!!! :)
review/text: I bought this product here at Amazon.com so i could reach a total of $25 or a lil' more (FREE Shipping..lol) and when i received it, it was just as i imagined it would be, tastes great! These mangoes are exactly as you see in the picture. (exept mine came in a white bag.) They are long, thin, dried up mangoes. If you have tasted other dried up fruits then you will definetly like these mangoes. I recommend you give the item a try, it tastes good. :)

review/summary: Carolina Aromatic Rice
review/text: We first bought this rice from a little General Store in Murrell's Inlet not far from our place in Garden City Beach. We heard about it from a guide on a Riverboat Tour who raved that it was the best tasting rice ever and only grown right there on the PeeDee River so we had to try it. She was right!  I don't know what it is that makes this rice taste and smell so good, the soil, the water, whatever, but it has a great flavor and aroma when cooking that will spoil you for regular grocery store rice.  It's more expensive to buy from Amazon but when run out and I can't get to the beach to buy more I pay the price because it's worth it.

review/text: I have searched for a canister for the pup's biscuits so they could easily be on hand but without the eye sore of a box.  I hate clutter & it would be one of the only things on my counter.  Compared to other products I found (online and in stores), this one ended up being reasonably priced and well made.  One reason I chose this canister was because the lid is NOT ceramic... like other people have commented, it's a great feature (b/c a ceramic lid would be easily broken, especially when dealing with puppy).  I get the fact that color in images varies from individual computers to real life; however, the red appeared to me more "fire engine" online but seems a little more burnt red in person (but I love the color). Also, I didn't really pay attention to the fact that the center of the lid is transparent... not a bad thing, just an FYI.<br /><br />Many canisters out there were available for personalization, but I don't want to change out my canister every time I get another dog.

I especially like the fact that the lid is a nearly-unbreakable metal design, since I chipped the ceramic lid from our last treat jar by setting it too hard on granite counter tops.  My only wish is that the jar would be made in a larger size.  With two large dogs, I go through a large volume of treats and have to refill it every 3-4 days.  But overall, this treat jar is exactly what I wanted.

review/text: Most people are accustomed to a fairly high-sodium diet (>2500mg).  It is everywhere and in places you wouldn't suspect.  For someone like me who has to pay attention to sodium because it spikes my blood pressure, this was a great find.  This product has no added salt/sodium.  As such, many will find it bland if they don't add a little salt (the cooking instructions do say "salt to taste").  Being used to not using salt in cooking, I found it tasty enough without adding salt.  For salt-sensitive folks, this is a great product.

review/text: I didn't realize at first this product has zero salt in it.  I neglected to read the package directions.  After experimenting a bit, I've found this tastes amazing when you add salt to taste, about 1/4-1/2 cup light cream, about 1/2 cup water and 1/2 stick real butter to every two pouches of sauce.  I add previously cooked chicken breast meat and simmer to warm through. Serve over basmati rice and YUM...quick and easy dinner.  Sure, it's not low fat, but it tastes very close to what I have had in Indian restaurants.  I have also made it with a vegetarian soy chicken called "FriChik" and it tastes great too.

While I'm no means an expert, I lived in London for awhile and sampled some of the best curry while also knowing you can find great flavors in local spots in metropolitan cities.<br /><br />As such and now that I'm back in a suburb, I really just wanted something that would satisfy my craving for a Tikka Masala-type curry that I can throw veggies and chicken into.<br /><br />This isn't it. While it's not horrible, there just isn't much flavor. There seems to be a lack of cocunut milk to give it a hint of sweetness and the cloves that are usually added to balance out the colors seems watered down. I say skip.

review/summary: Not so tasty bite.
review/text: I was hopeful that Tasty Bite would be a nice, easy home alternative to expensive Indian food but it wasn't. The sauces are bland and boring. The Rogan Josh is equally unexciting. I added a lot of additional spices and other ingredients to both in order to get a decent sauce. I guess you could call it a workable Indian sauce base, but that's about it.

review/summary: Take a pass people --- watery thin sauce, little flavor, yuk!
review/text: This is the most bland boring sauce I've had the misfortune to encounter. It's not the salt (though certainly that's a piece of the puzzle) but the sauce itself tastes very watered down and with just a hint of any spice. And the only spice to taste is a little bit of pepper. That's it. It distinctly lacks in any sort of flavor. Indian flood is very flavorful (usually) so that pretty much makes this one a pass completely.<br /><br />Don't bother. Find a good Indian recipe on the net and make your own or find a good Indian buffet.

review/text: This simmer sauce wasn't what I expected. I made Chicken Tikka Masala with this sauce for my roommates. It didn't thicken like I had expected and had more of a curry flavor than a tomato flavor. I used to order this dish from my local Indian eatery, and this just didn't compare. It wasn't awful but it wasn't what I was looking for and I won't order it again.

Yeah, I know salt is everywhere but a brick of pink salt is just too cool for words.  I figure on using it as a serving surface for a while and then recycling it in my mortar and pestle when the time comes.  If you are reading this then you know it's not anything close to a need-to-have item but it's a luxury that I'm happy to own.  I bought 4 of these and will probably buy a 4 more.  The Z-Shop seller that sells them for half the price is not selling what is pictured; rather, they are selling 8"x4"x2" bricks and not 8"x8"x1" salt plates.  (They're still pretty cool too!)

review/summary: Super Sour, Over too Soon
review/text: For those of us Sour Candy aficionados this is about as good as it gets.  It is a shame that the initial sour blast goes away so soon and all you are left with is a boring old lemon drop.  It has an advantage over the Warheads mega sour candy because the sourness tastes distinctly like lemon and does not have the chemical undertones that the Warheads do.  In addition the lemon drop is better than the pathetic candy that you are left with when the sour part of a warhead is finished.

review/summary: Extremely Sour
review/text: First off, my 4-star rating is for people who WANT an extremely sour candy.  On a more objective scale this candy would easily rank zero or one stars.  I have heard this described as "disgusting stuff" and for most people, this would surely be the case.<br /><br />Nobel Super Lemon is often cited as "the most sour candy in the world," so it seemed like the ideal gift for my old boss -- who loves sour candy and has impossible standards.  He thought it was adequately sour, but he claims to have eaten candies that are stronger.  I'm less of a sour-candy fanatic, and found it to be extremely sour.  It makes my saliva glands sore and I wince in intense discomfort.  My mouth is instantly flooded with drool and my speech is impaired for a short while.<br /><br />All candies of this type appear to be normal hard candies with a thin layer of sour dust on them.  This means, of course, that the extreme sourness only lasts a few seconds before you are sucking on a generic lemon-flavored hard candy.<br /><br />Comparing this to other extremely sour candies I've tried, however, I can't say that this one is obviously any more sour.  Mega Warheads are about the same.  However, if you've tried Tearjerkers Extra Sour Gum, this definitely goes a step beyond that.  Skittles and other "tangy" fruit candy would not be considered sour at all in comparison.<br /><br />For people in North America, Mega Warheads are basically the same product, but at a better value.  Mega Warheads also come in a package with candies of different flavors, making for a marginally more interesting product.

review/text: These are coated with a fine, super-sour 'Warheads'-type of powder (ascorbic, citric and malic acids I belive)that once gone, reveals a pleasant, if unremarkable lemon candy. I agree with Shervyn below that the sour coating has a less chemical flavor than domestic Warheads brand, making them 'better'.<br /><br />They are good, but their (relatively) high price makes them a "Glad I tried them, won't bother again" item for me. YMMV.

I was not expecting such a sour taste, and I had never tasted something quite that sour before.  As another reviewer stated, these candies are great for surprising others.  I have given them out and watched guests spit them out across the room because they were not expecting the initial sour bite.  Even so, they are surprisingly addictive for me.  I get these from a local Japanese grocery for much cheaper than Amazon offers them (even before shipping costs).  If you like sour/bitter lemon, then these candies are the ones for you, with no chemical aftertaste at all.

review/text: I loved this mix when it still contained the sesame sticks. It was the perfect blend of salty, sweet and savory. Planters has recently changed the mixture, replacing the deliciously addictive sesame sticks with bland, nubby wheat pretzel sticks - quite possibly the worst pretzel sticks I've ever had. I didn't realize the formula had changed until I opened a can I bought yesterday and discovered the gross replacement pretzels. I don't know if it's the case with every can, but in the can I purchased the pretzels made up 1/2 the can's contents. I won't be purchasing this product anymore due to the formula change. The sesame sticks were perfect, the pretzels are anything but.

review/text: My 7-month old grandson did not particularly care for this item.  It contains onions and that is new for him.  He may acquire a taste for it a little later on, but for now we'll stick with the green beans & rice.

review/summary: Great for a picky eater
review/text: My daughter tends to prefer sweeter foods and I have a hard time getting her to eat an entire jar of anything in one sitting, but she will eat this without complaint.  She has her little mouth open for the next spoonful before I can get it to her, so I know she likes it!  A good option for picky babies.

review/summary: My Babies Did Not Appreciate This One.  Yet It Introduces Them to Onions
review/text: I gave this product four stars because on the fourth feeding, my 10-month old twins ate it without complaining even though they were unenthusiastic.  They disliked it the first two times so much that they refused to eat it.<br /><br />I feel that at least they were introduced to new foods that they'll probably like when they're a bit older.<br /><br />When I purchased this item, I was unaware it doesn't have anything sweet like all the other Earth Best flavor brands I've purchased.  Others have carrots, for example, and my babies like that.<br /><br />The ingredients for this brand are as follows: "Organic Green Beans, Water, Organic Whole Wheat Flour, Organic Roasted Onions."<br /><br />Roasted Onions - what was I thinking?  At least they weren't raw onions.  No wonder they wouldn't eat this on the first attempts.<br /><br />In the end, I'm glad I purchased this product because my babies tried onions and new foods, and this may be a natural way to introduce such foods starting at an early age.

review/summary: My Son LOVES This!!!
review/text: I wouldn't say that my son's a picky eater, but he definitely has his preferences.  He's just turning six months old now, but at our pediatrician's suggestion we started him on solid food on the earlier side (four months).  A couple of weeks ago, he transitioned from "first" foods (pears, apples, and other single-note wonders) to "second" foods like this one.  Although he's generally willing to try new foods, his responses usually range from "I guess I'll eat it" to "I might eat it if I'm desperate" to "I'd rather starve."  The Earth's Best "Creamy Apple Chicken Compote" fell into that last category.  To be honest, I tried it, too--sometimes it motivates him when he sees you eating it, and liking it--and it was fairly foul.<br /><br />But since he's big for his age (already in 9 and 12 month sizes) and growing quickly, it's important that he get enough protein--which means that, really, we can't so much give into temptation and be like, "fine, eat applesauce."  And it's been a challenge finding high-protein foods that he likes and will reliably eat.  BUT HE LOVES THIS STUFF!!!  He'll eat it morning, noon and night.  He'll eat it when the house is quiet; he'll eat it amidst distraction.  He'll eat it while the television's on; he'll eat it while the cat is staring at him.<br /><br />The Amazon price isn't, you know, earth shattering, unless you live in the Boston area and your only other source of organic baby food is Whole Foods.  In which case this is about half price.  We've started buying it by the case.

review/text: My twins dislike most vegetables, but they have happily eaten these green beans since they were six months old.  They're 15 months now, and they still prefer them to almost anything else I put on their trays, including cheese, fruit, and even their own birthday cake. They'll eat other green beans, too, but these are definitely the favorite (and clearly preferred to the ones I make myself).

review/text: I have a 4 year old Boston Terrier who recently seemed to develop food allergies. I bought this food hoping it would help with her itching (which was in turn causing her to lose hair) and it really did help! She loved the stuff! I was dreading having to buy my dog 40 dollar bags of dog food. I love her to death but with a baby on the way I feel there are more important things to spend that money on but this dog food seems to have quality ingredients at a good price. The fact that it's American made was also something I really liked.

I'll be buying and recommending Hi-Tek for as long as their around.

review/text: In my opinion Progresso makes the best Italian Style breadcrumbs on the market.  As I use a lot of them it's difficult to find the 40 oz containers.  Sams Club and Costco used to carry them but no more at least not where I live.  The product is great and since I buy enough for free delivery and there is no tax it's actually cheaper than buying locally.  I use these breadcrumbs for frying fish, baking chicken, making Italian meatballs, meatloaf and various other Italian and American style dishes.  Highly recommended

review/text: These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment.

review/summary: I can't believe I like this so much...
review/text: I don't mind sweeter wines like a Riesling, but I don't usually go so much for fruit flavored wines like this, but this wine has changed my mind. This is a great summer sipper or party wine. Actually more of a gulper. It's so light and smooth, that you'll end up going through a bottle before you know it. So be warned...You might feel something cold on your face and you look up, and it's the floor. I'm just saying.<br /><br />Now for the technical stuff:<br />I reconstituted this one to somewhere between 5 1/2 and 6 gallons. I meant to make a little less, but messed up. At that level it came out to a little less than 9% ABV, which I think is a little light. I would recommend reconstituting it closer to 5 gallons, because I believe it can handle the extra alcohol without affecting its drinkability. Ideally I'd say measure the specific gravity as you're adding the water and shoot for the middle of the suggested range. If you go this route, you'll need to add water, mix thoroughly, then measure. And you'll need to repeat that each time you add more water, until you get to the desired SG. If you don't mix it well, then your readings may not be accurate. After all steps were completed I left it in the carboy for about 2 weeks longer, then bottled and let it age for about 1 month. That was all it took, and it was ready to drink. I chill this one for about 20 minutes before drinking. I know it's a red, but this is more of a wine cocktail in my opinion and it really makes it refreshing.<br /><br />The Rating:<br />The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 was due to how low the alcohol content would be if you mixed it to the full 6 gallons per the instructions. If you add a little less water though, you'll be in good shape. It also came with labels, corks and plastic heat shrink capsules for the top. Definitely worth the price and I plan to make it again...soon.

review/text: I didn't want to make this per directions after reading reviews on how sweet this was. I made this to right at 5 gallons including the addition of a little Everclear to boost ABV. I used half the F-pack during the initial fermentation process so it wouldn't be &uuml;ber sweet at bottling time. Wonderful raspberry flavor. So very pleased with Cornucopia. I have the Blueberry Shiraz fermenting now. I'm going to try a few others before the year is out.
