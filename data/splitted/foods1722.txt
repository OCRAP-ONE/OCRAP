review/text: I found these because my Trader Joe's was out of their Pita Bite crackers every time I went in there. These are exactly the same ones. I top mine with mozzarella and bruschetta. The only negative comment is that there were very few whole crackers out of all the boxes, most were pretty broken up. Tastes the same, though!

review/text: My family LOVES these crackers.  Our local wholesaler stopped carryng them so we thought it was a great idea to order them on Amazon.  However, when the crackers arrived, we were lucky to find 10 WHOLE crackers in a box, the rest were bits, pieces and crumbs.  We were very disappointed!

review/summary: Not Gluten Free!
review/text: It really annoys me when searching for gluten free products, products like this show up! You come across it on the list and get all excited thinking you found something new! You scroll down to the allergy listing and it clearly says wheat free! So you go to the ingredient list and the first ingredient is wheat flour! This is not the only product that amazon.com has done this with! You have to really read though everything before ordering!<br />For companies, If you process it on shared equipment with an allergen, it is not free of that allergen even if you cross check every ingredient you put into it! If you run it down equipment that previously had the allergen on it you are causing cross contamination and therefore can not rightfully label the product free of that allergen! On the same note, you need to disclose on all packaging that it was processed on shared equipment so those of us with allergies do not get sick by eating foods that appear safe but are not!

review/summary: Jolly Rancher Assorted candy bag 5 pound bag!
review/text: As of August 17, 2008; All prices subject to change<br />ASIN B000F8GWR2 - Twelve 7 ounce bags (not currently available)<br />ASIN B0000V416I - 5 pound bag, $20.00 + $9.58 shipping ($29.58)<br />ASIN B000NMG2LQ - 5 pound bag, $15.75 + $12.75 shipping ($28.50)<br />ASIN B000HROH2I - 5 pound bag, $23.29 + $17.93 shipping ($41.22)<br />ASIN B0017D3TJS - 17 ounce bowl, $4.95 + $6.56 shipping ($11.51)<br />ASIN B001ASEWQE  - 1.25 pound tub, $5.85 + $7.49 shipping ($13.34)<br /><br />All of these product listings are for the same product, although there are some minor differences, most price, quantity and seller.  This review, which covers all six listings, is 5 stars for the product - some of the listings deserve less and I'll tell you why.  B000F8GWR2 is for twelve 7 ounce packages (5.25 lbs), B001ASEWQE is for a 1.2 pound tub, B0017D3TJS is a 17 ounce plastic, lidded bowl; the others are 5 pound bags.<br /><br />B001ASEWQE and B0017D3TJS have only one thing going for it: it comes in a tub.  But you have bowls, right?  So, the tub's not exciting and the price there is too high when you factor in shipping.  When shipping is charged by weight, it matters that the listing for B000NMG2LQ claims its shipping weight as 7 pounds, while the rest of the 5 pound packages say 6 - unless the box weighs over a pound, 6 is correct and the renegade 7 pounder is just dipping into your pocket.  Still it's B000HROH2I that is really ripping you off, with $17.93 in shipping charges.  The best deal turns out to be straight from Amazon, with B000F8GWR2 showing me $8.53 in shipping - and the potential for free shipping.  Of the 6, only the one from Amazon makes any sense to buy as a consumer; the others might make sense to a wholesaler, although I can't see how - the best price is the best price!  And, of course, look into the prices yourself because they're subject to change and by the time you read this, they might be completely different.<br /><br />Jolly Rancher candies, particularly the original hard candy flavors, are great.  The flavors are strong enough so that each flavor is distinct, unlike so many other candies.  Watermelon tastes like watermelon, cherry like cherry - these things are literally mouth-watering, in the best way.  Individual wrapping keeps them clean when little hands dig for their personal favorite.  Personally, I've been stocking up on them as part of my plan to quit smoking; it'll certainly make quitting a delicious experience, especially as my taste buds recover.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/text: I bought these because we love Mrs. May's Almond Crunch, which we've bought at Costco. We like walnuts, too, and thought this snack would be just as good as the almond crunch. Unfortunately it's not. The skin on the walnuts makes the walnut crunch taste bitter and there's a strange kind of health-foody malty taste, too. We kept opening bags thinking the next one would be better, but they were all the same. Buy the almond crunch instead, that's really good.

review/summary: I may have gotten a bad batch...
review/text: I originally got these in the 1 pound bag and they were great! Perfect condition, great assortment, neatly wrapped individually. The candy itself is amazing. If I were rating the 1lb bag, it would absolutely be 5/5 stars. But this review is about the 3lb bag and NOT the 1lb one (I mention this because the same seller lists both bags in a single listing). I decided to get the 3lb bag and I was terribly disappointed. Over 75% of the bag was one flavor, the bag was a cheap generic bag which split open in shipping (the 1lb was in a very nice, tough, and resealable bag), the individually wrapped candies themselves were covered in an unknown sticky residue, and many of the candies were either 1/2 piece or 1&1/2 pieces inside the wrappers. It seems the 3lb bag contains the rejects from the 1lb bag.  Maybe I just got a bad batch? I guess I will return it.<br /><br />Edit: the seller has been very helpful and explained that the batch I got was likely damaged in transit, and has verified that the 3lb bag is the same quality at the 1lb and that I likely got a bad batch which could be returned. And so I will return them and purchase another to see, as the candies themselves are amazing enough for me to mention that they are amazing twice in the same review. Hopefully the next ones won't have the same issues.

review/summary: Great sugar alternative
review/text: What is Xylitol? A sugar alcohol that is:<br /><br />* Nearly half the calories of sugar<br /><br />* Prevents tooth decay<br /><br />* 100% natural<br /><br />* Tastes almost exactly like sugar<br /><br />Sweet-X Xylitol in granular form can be used just like ordinary table sugar at a ratio of 1:1. Like sugar, it is all natural, and has a great taste. It is about as sweet as table sugar, but has 40% less calories. When eaten plain it has a unique slippery bead like texture with a cool, almost mint-like quality; while table sugar has a hasher granular texture with a warmer, heavier quality. When dissolved in food, its slippery texture and cooling effect is not noticed, and so it is difficult to tell it apart from table sugar.<br /><br />Unlike table sugar, xylitol actually prevents tooth decay. Many microorganisms cannot digest xylitol. Xylitol is proven to be the best tooth decay fighting sweetener available.<br /><br />Unlike normal table sugar, xylitol cannot be used to bake yeast based breads because the yeast used cannot digest xylitol.<br /><br />Xylitol tastes great mixed with other high intensity sweeteners such as stevia (SoooLite!, SweetLeaf, etc.). I use it with equal portions of all nature SoooLite to make a great tasting low calorie natural sugar substitute that tastes almost exactly like sugar. It is a great mixture.<br /><br />Xylitol is all natural and safe. In 1963 xylitol was approved by the FDA for use in food production in the US. Xylitol exists naturally in the human body. The human body actually makes up to 15 grams of xylitol a day. Xylitol has a mild laxative quality in some people when high amounts are ingested. This usually subsides once the body adjusts to using it.<br /><br />Please do not give xylitol to dogs. Although safe for humans, dogs can develop a life threatening reaction to even small amounts of xylitol.

review/summary: Good Soda Alternative
review/text: In my effort to rid my all-American diet of high fructose corn syrup (found in almost all major sodas sold in the States, and everything else), I've been buying San Pellegrino sparkling drinks for about six months now. I'm very partial to this orange flavor as well as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0075LIHUC">blood orange flavor</a> as they're not as bitter as the lemon flavor, and still satisfy the craving I occasionally get for something sweet. I might also add for the benefit of my Jewish friends: the drinks are kosher.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's not the healthiest thing to drink - there's still a ton of sugar (though it also advertises that it's made up of 16% orange juice), but if you're going to choose a sugar-laden drink, better it be this than a can of high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />It's pretty tasty alone, but a bit of vodka or rum works well with it too.

review/summary: Long-time Favourite Drink
review/text: San Pellegrino Aranciata has been a favourite drink of mine for years. I've never much been a soft drink fan, but I enjoy the combination of fruit juice and carbonation that Aranciata offers. It's sweet enough that it tastes great, but doesn't taste chemical or artificial in any way, and doesn't include HFCS. It also tastes pretty good on the rocks, even after they start to melt.<br /><br />And speaking of drinking it on the rocks - Aranciata is a great mixer! Try making a vodka screwdriver with it instead of orange juice sometime and you'll see what I mean. The other flavours that San Pellegrino offers are great as well - Limonata and Blood Orange are excellent. One note, though - if you can, buy it in the little glass bottles. They have a neat shape and are much more fun than the cans - although it's worth noting that the cans are much nicer than soda cans.

review/summary: LOVE these!
review/text: If you live in Ohio, then you can't have these, or so they tell us.  Because, here in Ohio, we like our food bland.  Bland and so dead that all the flavor is boiled out of whatever we get to eat and if it isn't cooked that way, someone has to complain and say they speak for all of us.  Ohio, the food concentration camp of North America!<br /><br />Sarcasm aside, when we USED to have things like this, people's minds were blown apart.  Kids loved them, we all ate them all the time, and life was generally sunny and happy.  Now that they're gone, we have 212 gray days a year here in Ohio, all because they've taken away our happy food and ANYTHING that remotely resembles flavor.  So, if you're blessed enough NOT to live in Ohio (I've heard it's spreading to Indiana too so watch out...), be sure you partake of these.  They're completely awesome, great for vacations, and taste just like the pops, only without the stick.  And when you enjoy these wonderful pieces of candy, please, remember us poor folks in Ohio with our bland, boring, lifeless food and be glad you know how to live "outside the box."  Highly recommend!

review/summary: The Quintessential Breakfast Tea.
review/text: Calling this blend "English" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea." It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word "English," which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday "work horse," and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee.

review/summary: Picky Great Dane Loved it
review/text: First, my dog gobbled it down just like it was canned food. It was pleasant for a human to work with. Super easy-just add water. High quality human grade ingredients. Tasted it myself.Felt like I was really giving her something healthy and alive instead of uniform baked brown kibble. Very versatile because it can stand on it's own, or you can mix it with their kibble. You can even add in your own touches if you want such as goat cheese, yogurt, extra fruits and veggies or raw meat, but it is complete and balanced as is. I'm hoping to clear up some skin and coat issues that just occured after 5 years of doing fine on Eagle Pack dry kibble. I'm willing to give live a food a shot and have often though of feeding raw but didn't know enough about dog nutrition to ward off doing more damage than good. With this food, I feel confident that she's getting the benefits of raw, with the convenience of instant oatmeal! Did research on the company. Very good clean facility, small family owned. I'll update in a month to see the progress we've made on this food. As far as cost, I was already paying $57 for 33lb dry kibble form Eagle Pack so This is actually a bit more cost effective because the 10 lb box makes 40lbs reconstituted. Eventually, I may switch to a different formula and add in my own fresh meat, but for now, it's a great way to get your feet wet in the raw food category without too much effort or knowledge.

We had him on a high end kibble and he got sick and never really enjoyed it. We switched to some high quality canned food but I didn't feel it was right either. Did some research and finally found this product and we are totally sold. First off-he loves it. It is great to see your dog get excited to eat. He never seemed to have much of an appetite before-now he is always looking for his next feed-but has not put on any weight. He hasn't been sick once since we started this diet-plus his poop is v healthy which it never was before. I sometimes add some extra meat/veg or fruit if I have time and the ingredients-but he is just as happy with it alone. I would recommend this food to any pet owner. There are different varieties-I like the 'Keen' but I think it depends on your pets needs.

We tried all of the following: Panacur, Metronidazole, probiotics, digestive enzymes, aloe vera, immodium, yogurt, pumpkin and 2 foods highly recommended for his situation. We saw NO improvement in his diarrhea. Someone recommended Keen. Thank the Lord! He had a formed poop after one meal of Keen! He's now had 4 meals of Keen. His poop is normal. Highly recommend for any dog with a sensitive stomach. It's VERY easy to mix. Very convenient for travel too.

This food is much lower in moisture compared to can dog food. Another plus is that this box will lost a long time and is cheaper in the long run.

review/text: Man, my dogs are all over this food.  I only just got it, so I can't yet comment on coat and feces, but they mauled their bowls it was so tasty, and these are pretty picky dogs who generally prefer cheaper foods and put their nose up to anything delicious, so I am SO HAPPY I can get them to eat something good for them for once.<br /><br />Smells delicious, like people food.  Will definitely buy over and over and over again.

review/summary: Honestly Amazing!
review/text: Our dog, Madeline has been eating THK for approximately 30 days and the difference it has made in her overall health has been amazing. Madeline has a mass in her throat which the vet believes is cancer, but we are not willing to put her through surgery and treatment (she is 12). She is not in pain, but it is nearly impossible for her to eat whole kibble because she cannot swallow large pieces of food so she eats (inhales) Keen twice a day with applesauce and plain yogurt and salmon oil. As Madeline has always had an outstanding personality we were thrilled when her new food gave her more energy and improved her coat. She sleeps through the night and is able to keep up when we go for walks. We love Keen so much we are switching our other girl, Blue-Bell, over too! Thanks HK!

review/summary: The DIShonest Kitchen lies and rips you off- feed a real raw diet for much less
review/text: The meat in THK dehydrated diets is not raw. It it would not be a human grade food if the meat were actually raw. The manufacturer told me that the meat in their food is "dehydrated" at a temperature that actually cooks the meat and that is how it is able to be labeled human grade. If this is the case, why use the word "Raw" over and over again in the advertising and ingredient list. It's not raw and it's not as good as raw.<br /><br />Secondly, and perhaps just as important, is that the consumer is paying for things their pet can't digest. The consumer pays for the very expensive dehydration process for VEGETABLES and other things that carnivores cannot digest and do not need. The only way to get the nutrients out of vegetables, fruits and seeds, and into a dog's system is to puree the vegetables and break down the cellulose or to COOK them. From I can tell, neither of these things are done to the vegetables. Ironically, the part of the THK diet that shouldn't be raw is, and the meat, which should be raw, isn't.<br /><br />The fact that a great deal of the honest kitchen diets are not digested is pretty obvious to people who feed it to their dogs. You can clearly see the celery, bananas, and other whole chunks of vegetable/fruit that come out in the stool. If you happen to take a look at the stool after a bit of rain has washed away the smooshy parts, you will see mounds of undigested vegetable matter that seem to equal 80% of the total volume. So not only are you feeding something that isn't being digested, but you are feeding lots of it. Why would you pay for something that is completely wasted?<br /><br />I know several dogs who are or were on THK who presented with hot spots, fleas, allergies, and other chronic conditions that didn't exist when they were on raw diets. I have seen it over, and over again.  After seeing what I've seen, I could never go back to feeding a dehydrated diet from this manufacturer. I do see some promise in the Ziwi Peak line and Stella and Chewy's, so you might want to try those out and stop paying for chunky veggies your dog can't digest.<br /><br />It is far less expensive to feed a raw diet of human grade meats and bone from your grocery store. You would probably pay 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of THK diets. You would even save money if you went with a pre-packaged frozen raw diet such as Primal or Nature's Variety. I know a lot of people feed THK because they are afraid to feed real raw meat, but I pray that will change. THK is making millions, and for that they should be commended. They shed blood, sweat, and tears to create a market for their food and I know that was hard work. But they are/were doing it dishonestly. On top of that, they have the gall to name themselves honest. Yikes.<br /><br />To THK,<br />If you care to tell us exactly what temperatures or radiation your meat is exposed to prior to packaging, and issue a statement that states your finished product contains non-irradiated, raw meat, I'll be happy to edit my review. Since meat begins to undergo chemical changes at 120�F and litterally cooks at 140�F, I hope you can supply proof that your product is processed at temperatures below these and is not irradiated.

review/text: This was a gift for my father.  He has false teeth and most of the candy is taffy-like.  For someone who wants a remembrance of things past, this is a great idea.  But read the type of candy carefully, depending on who you want to send it to.  We sent the 40's because my dad was a young man then.  But he left most of the candy to us, and we didn't recognize most of it.  Probably would have been better to buy the 50's candy.  The box was rather small, too, although there were many different types of candy (in very small portions).  Did enjoy the candy cigarettes!  No wax lips, though.

The usual assumption is that grade A is better than grade B but unlike eggs or meat, the grade refers to when the syrup is harvested, grade B being the more intensely flavored.  Makes pancakes and waffles worth getting up for!

review/summary: Highland Sugarworks Grade B Maple Syrup better than Coombs
review/text: My opinion is exactly opposite of B. Atlas'. I'm on Day 5 of a Master Cleanse, drinking lemonade made with Grade B maple syrup and cayenne pepper. I'd tried Coombs before, and thought it was fine, but decided to try Highland next. Ordered Coombs again last week because it was cheaper this time. In a side by side taste test just now, I much preferred Highland for its lighter, less sweet, straightforward Grade B flavor. In comparison, Coombs was a prettier amber color than Highland, but too sweet and with a heavy burnt caramel taste. To my surprise, the caramel doesn't show through in the lemonade, but the maple taste doesn't really either. Though Highland should definitely take packing lessons from Coombs, I'll order it again. Now to get through these two jugs of Coombs first...

review/text: I'm a mapleaholic and have bought many, many grade B syrups over the years. Many are really only good for baking and cooking uses, not so much for pancakes.<br /><br />This particular syrup is an exception. It has the intense maple flavor of Grade B syrups, but doesn't have the somewhat overpowering molasses overtones that too many of them have.<br /><br />This syrup is superb on pancakes, yet keeps its integrity in baking. I used it to make my maple walnut cake as well as a maple glaze and both came out perfectly.<br /><br />Considering how high maple syrup is in the grocery store, with Subscribe and Save, this was an excellent value, as well.

review/text: The whole grading thing in maple syrup is so misleading. I first bought Grade B maple syrup from a Wholefoods store, because it was cheaper, and I thought, how much worse can it be? Hah! The well-kept secret is that it is BETTER than Grade A. Thicker, darker, richer, and with more maple flavor than Grade A, this treat is hard to find in stores, but the Highland Surgarworks is a great product that fills all of my Grade B syrup requirements. And don't just put it on your pancakes! Make maple butter to spread on your cornbread or rub under the skin of a chicken or turkey before you roast it. Use it in pies and cakes. It is delicious.

review/summary: Best maple syrup on the market.
review/text: This is really outstanding, and far better than I expected it to be.  I had read a comment in Cooks Illustrated that Grade B maple syrup has a much stronger, more pronounced flavor.  I can remember as a child that my parents always bought maple syrup (rather than the imitation stuff now made from corn syrup), so I grew up with it.  And I have occasionally splurged at the grocery and bought a small bottle, just as a reminder of how things used to be.  However, my kids grew up with Log Cabin, Aunt Jemima, Mrs. Butterworth's, etc., which are products that have never been close to a maple tree or anything else remotely organic.  However, when my kids have tried the "real stuff" they were unimpressed.  But as the Cooks Illustrated article points out, most grocery store maple syrup is Grade A.  So I wanted to see just how different Grade B syrup is from its better-selling sibling.  Wow!  I was stunned by how good that Highland Sugarworks syrup tastes - it is intense and complex, and I think far better than any syrup I have ever used.  Both of my kids agree, and now refuse to touch the stuff based on corn syrup.  Of course, now I have two big bottles of corn syrup-based pancake topping I bought at Costco that are not going to be consumed.  Maybe I can donate them to the next Pancake Breakfast fund-raiser held at my church?  But it is clear neither of my kids will be touching it, now that they have tried honest-to-God maple syrup, made the way it is supposed to be, from trees!  Hats off to Highland Sugarworks - they have a real winner here, and Amazon sells it at a great price (and it is even cheaper if I sign up for periodic shipments).  I am definitely a new fan!

It is slightly stronger than store bought grade A, but I can't compare it to other dark grade B, as this is the first grade B I have purchased.<br /><br />I was really disappointed when I read the label, which says "made in Vermont" but then goes on to say from family farms all over New England. ??? I bought this because I searched for  Vermont maple syrup specifically, since I read they have the highest standards in purity and practices.  So I am a little miffed to think that this may not live up to those standards. It is probably good and well, but who knows?  It could come from anywhere else in the region, where the standards are not so high as Vermont, and then they just bottle it in Vermont and claim it is Vermont maple syrup.  Actually they do NOT claim it is Vermont maple syrup, just "made in VErmont", probably because they can't legally call it Vermont maply syrup.<br /><br />That is just my opinion, and I could be making a mountain out of a molehill. But I thought people might want to know, especially if they are buying this on the virtues of being "Vermont maple syrup".

review/summary: LOVE this product!
review/text: I have purchased this product on several occassions now, always 2-3 bottles at a time. My husband and I love it and will never go back to fake syrup again. It is very high quality syrup, love that the bottle is well constructed and easy to use, the top is a flip top and easy to pour. I always keep coming back to this particular brand because the price is always best compared to many others and it is a very crisp, clean tasting maple syrup. Highly, highly recommend this brand and product!

review/text: I was a little concerned about trying the B Grade as I thought it might have too strong a flavor.  But being a molasses and brown sugar lover I should have known that I would LOVE Grade B.  This is what Maple Syrup is supposed to taste like !  Also adds richness to cooking.  The quality of this product by Highland Sugarworks is excellent and reasonably priced.  I will definitely be buying this again.

review/summary: Excellent Syrup
review/text: We bought this after having trouble real maple syrup at our regular grocery stores.  We first tried Grade A, and most recently tried this version.  We won't be going back to anything else.<br /><br />It was a better value than other brands and the occasional times we can find real syrup in grocery store.  It is thicker than grade A and way thicker than "pancake syrup," so if you use the same amount, you may find it to be too strong.  In fact we've joked about keeping the empty container and partially filling it when we have company for breakfast, as they seem to think that they need to use the same amount of this as they would the imitation stuff.

review/text: GradeB Maple Syrup has a much more robust flavor than Grade A. It DOES NOT mean it's lower quality. The grade has more to do with the flavor. This is great for the maple syrup lemon juice fast. It gives the juice more depth and makes the fast much easier to maintain. I like it on pancakes too, but that's just me. Once I tried Grade B I never bought Grade A again. This is a good price and fast shipping.

review/summary: Grade A is not better than Grade B
review/text: Grade B is simply harvested out of the prime season and has a depth and color that reflects this.  Grade C does not really exist anymore.  Maple syrup grades were redefined into two primary grades A and B with color differences within those to create more color grades.  I suspect this was done to push most of the formally grade B syrup into grade A for marketing purposes.  Since the general public assumes that Grade A is better than Grade B I can see why.  Grade B Syrups now take up what use to be Grade C and the darker Grade B.  This richly flavored and not quiet as sweet syrup is not for everyone and may not be best for cooking in some cases, but for pancakes and waffles this is the best.

review/summary: Grade B Maple Syrup tastes best
review/text: What's NOT to like about natural maple syrup? Grade B has a stronger flavor. As a result less is needed than using grade A to sweeten. Maple syrup imparts a clean sweet taste. No artificial ingredients, preservatives or additives. My kids prefer it to the flavored sugar syrups of national brands. We are a family that still cooks from scratch. We don't want all of the preservatives, additives and artificial ingredients in our diet. It tastes better and is cheaper than eating fast food out and prepared boxed foods. We use it on pancakes, waffles and hot breakfast cereals.

review/summary: Great Maple Syrup, packaging was superb
review/text: I remember the great tasting maple syrup that I had as a child in Michigan and Canada. I remember going to the farms and sampling the product. As an adult, I have tried to buy high quality syrup from Canada and have been disappointed. Doing a little research, I found that Vermont is where all the unadulterated quality syrup is now sourced.<br /><br />I found grade B to be a little too dark if tasted on its own. It is, however, perfect in its richness, darkness, and maple flavor once it has been drizzled on your food of choice. It is like being a kid again!<br /><br />Packaging: I ordered one jug. It appeared to be pre-packed by the supplier, with the "ready to ship" sticker on the box. I imagine they did this due to the leaking others have experienced from time to time. Problem solved! The packaging was wall to wall insulated and the jug itself wrapped with bubble wrap. I can not vouch for other quantities, but a one jug order will be packaged very well.<br /><br />Health: I am a health nut, a trained chef, and a biomedical engineer. Not only is this good quality syrup, but maple syrup has been found recently to have a wide variety of healthy antioxidants. The amount of syrup needed per use is very small, due to the quality and intense flavor. The sugar content is partially and possibly totally made up for by the content of flavanoids usually found in citrus and the catechins found in green tea, tree bark, and chocolate. These help inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates to reduce blood glucose spikes. This is worlds better than drizzling corn syrup on your carbs which would increase the glucose load. I have no problems with eating a little with my oats every morning. Eating healthy does not mean not enjoying your food!

review/text: If syrup isn't real maple, I don't bother. I think it's a travesty to use non-maple syrup on pancakes. I also flavor my oatmeal, oat bran, cookies, soy yogurt, and lots of other things with maple syrup. I especially like the Grade B, because you get the deeper, richer maple flavor, and less of the pure sweetness of the Grade A. My father loves maple syrup, and I bought this as a gift for him. He had never had the B before, and now he's converted too. This is kind of expensive, but I really think it's worth the price. Per ounce, you're saving money--it's a half gallon! YUMMY!

review/text: good product and jug material is good as well.<br /><br />easy to clean<br />look neat<br /><br />however, if there is a transparent column in the jug to see the level of syrup, it will be great.<br /><br />that's all.

review/summary: mmm mmmm Good!
review/text: This syrup is so good!! My only complaint (the reason it got 4 stars instead of 5) is it's expensive - relatively speaking. If I'm not mistaken, we used to have real maple syrup on our pancakes when we were kids. Now, the stores don't have real maple syrup unless you are willing to donate a leg for a small bottle. The syrup isn't even regularly real maple flavor! It's mostly corn syrup with artificial or at best molasses flavoring.<br /><br />I've been buying real maple syrup for baking and cooking but I just couldn't stand the taste of the fake stuff on pancakes anymore so I bought this. The taste is wonderful! I just wish it wasn't so expensive compared to "breakfast syrup".

review/summary: Okay only
review/text: I personally prefer Coombs over this product. First time I ordered to try it out. Will do with it, but won't buy again. Tastes slightly woodier to me than the caramel, smooth taste of Coombs.
