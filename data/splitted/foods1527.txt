review/summary: Delicious, fresh, and tasty!
review/text: These are delicious, fresh and tasty!  My kids love 'em and so do I.  I was surprised as my cans are mostly full halves and some nearly whole nuts with only some "bits and pieces" -- much better quality than I expected.  The first can was gone in three-four days!  A big hit at my house.  So you may eat more than you would otherwise, with so large a supply...keep that in mind.  ;)<br /><br />A great deal - much cheaper per ounce than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />2012-07-07 update: Have purchased multiple times and quality has remained good.

review/summary: Tasty but suddenly expensive
review/text: These are generally fresh tasting out of the tin, and they keep well enough, though they mightn't be spectacular.  They were a fantastic deal when I subscribed them about a year ago, but suddenly they have jumped to the point where they have nearly doubled in price.  It's time to jump ship on this deal.

review/summary: If you are not picky about whole cashews then this is for you
review/text: Cashews, and most nuts in general, are not that cheap. Comparing this to say Kirkland brand cashews shows that this provides a huge savings. I do not feel that they are too salty and the only minor issue I see is that there are some little tiny pieces to go along with the halves. This is not even really a problem as it is stated on the container that this is halves and pieces. I will be ordering this again.

review/text: I purchased this product before, and it was perfect: lots of halves, not too salty, not very greasy.<br /><br />This time however, I decided to stock up and purchased 5 "2-tin" packages when it had a good price.<br /><br />Turned out to be super greasy. There was so much disgusting oil that I had to use paper towel to drain it every<br />time I wanted to eat.<br /><br />Overall, I would say the inconsistent quality deserves a one so they can improve.

review/summary: Tasty snacks
review/text: I use this for a tasty and not horribly unhealthy snack. (Cashews are not the best nuts from a health perspective - other tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds are generally accepted to be better - but at least they seem to beat peanuts in most people's opinions).<br /><br />The nuts are a great substitute for starchy/sugary snacks such as candy-bars, chips, pop-tarts, etc., which I might otherwise gravitate toward. Also, I appreciate the fact that they have a bit of salt on them - since I like to bicycle a fair amount, during the summer I'm often looking for a way to replace electrolytes (aka, salt) while I snack.<br /><br />I have to admit that the frugal part of me also gets a charge from the low price per ounce of these nuts vs. the more aesthetically pleasing, but no more tasty full cashew halves from local stores (e.g., Whole Foods sells these for $16/pound - more than three times the price).<br /><br />I'm deducting a star for a slight batch-to-batch variation in the flavor, and slightly excessive oiliness of the surface of the nuts.

review/text: I discovered these little peanut butter chips at a health food store in New Orleans and instantly loved them. They are great as a dessert topping, individually as a little snack, or even, blended with tofu and made into a "mousse" or pie filling!<br /><br />While these may not be the healthiest food in the world, they are certainly a somewhat healthier version.<br /><br />SELLER NOTE: In my experience, Vitacost is a great seller and their shipping is calculated on a per-order basis, not a per-item basis (I did not realize that, the first time I found these and was hesitant to purchase them because of the shipping cost). I bought a few bags of these and several other items and even got free shipping!<br /><br />I rely on Amazon to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review helped you in the same manner.

review/summary: Zen-Like Tea Experience
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Zen Green Tea with Lemongrass & Spearmint has a subtle, mild, light green tea taste, not bitter at all. I don't taste any of the additional flavors Tazo puts into this tea; maybe my palate isn't developed to this point. However, it still is one of their better teas, and has less of an artificial taste than the others I've tried. Maybe the flavorings are just too mild in this tea, but when it comes to flavorings, I prefer them this way; I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. It is not a strong green tea, so it would definitely appeal to people who enjoy herbal infusions and milder teas.<br /><br />The ingredients in Zen are: green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint, lemongrass, and natural flavors. Zen contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "an enlightening blend of the finest green teas and rare herbs available in this world." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Zen as "smooth, lemony, earthy, refreshing". Tazo describes the aroma as "lemon, mint". The web site also says, "Select pan-fired green tea from Zhejiang province in China, artfully combined with lemongrass, spearmint and a hint of lemon essence. Zen's distinct green tea flavor accented with lemon and mint is impossible to express in words. Best simply to experience its sweet, lingering aftertaste." I don't taste the lemon or the mint or the sweetness; still, it is a nice green tea. It is relaxing and enjoyable to drink.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: Another flavor I missed from my days at the University of Rochester, this sauce has a little more kick than Country Sweet, and maybe a little broader 'flavor envelope', and I am so glad I could find it at a reasonable price on Amazon to bring it down South! I think I might still veer more towards Country Sweet, but if you get one, have the other around for those days you need to change up...<br /><br />Now if only Nick's Garbage Plates could be found on Amazon!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Blaine

review/summary: Better than many choices out there
review/text: While this isn't my very top choice of cat foods available, it has worked very well as a transition food for the six months that we need an all-stages food until our kitten gets older.  When she was very small, we were able to give her her own kitten food by setting up her feeding station in a box that our adult cat couldn't get into.  Now that they are the same size, we can't keep them from stealing each other's food, so we needed something they could both eat.  We tried a couple of holistic all-stages foods, and this one has been the best, by far.  Both cats prefer the little "T" shape kibble over round kibble, they seem to enjoy the taste, and it keeps them and their digestive systems happy ... and that keeps ME happy.  ;-)  My older cat does better on a grain-free food, and has gotten a case of the itchies on this food, but it is not nearly as bad as with most grain-inclusive foods we've tried.  Once kitten is old enough, they will both be back on a grain-free diet.  In the meantime, this has really fit our needs.

review/summary: Put good in, get good out
review/text: CLIFFS: 100% Recommended from a paranoid, research crazy owner who wanted nothing but the best for my kitten.<br /><br />FULL REVIEW: My kitten loves this food. As with all kitten/cats you learn they have personalities, specific tastes and favorites.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time researching cat food and discovered so much BAD food out there.<br /><br />THE KEY TO KEEPING YOUR CAT HEALTHY IS GOOD FOOD AND EXERCISE, READ THE INGREDIANTS, THE FIRST 5 ITEMS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND ARE THE LARGEST PORTIONS OF THE FOOD.<br /><br />Research indicates this is one of the best all around foods you can feed your cat/kitten. We started with K****nchow, which in the word of cat food is about a 5 outa 10 in quality, its got the #'s but not the wholesome natural ingredients from which they derive. Think about taking a vitamin vs. eating veggies.<br /><br />This brand doesn't pack the most protein (which is crucial to cat development) but its well over the recommended amount, and quiet frankly, I'm not comfortable with a heavy protein diet, I believe there can be too much of a good thing.<br /><br />This grain free food also has lots of actual vegetables and items you can identify in the food itself.<br /><br />This food smells almost fit for human consumption, you can pick up the flavors just by the scent, doesn't smell like typical big brand crap.<br /><br />Many reviews claim softer and shinier coat and I have to agree. I've had a few cats the past 20yrs and hers by far is the softest coat I've ever felt.<br /><br />What I find great is she ignored the K****nchow when wet was out, but now will often choose this to snack on when the wet food has been out a hour or 2.<br /><br />This is good on her stomach and stools are not overly smelly like they were on other brand food we started initially. The food itself doesn't overly smell either.<br /><br />Provides plenty of lasting energy too.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased and could not recommend it more. Pricier? Of course. But its absolutely worth it at the rate she eats this. A bag this size lasts our kitten at least 4 months. For 30 bucks?! Why not?!

review/summary: Our 3 Cats Love This Food
review/text: We have 3 cats that didn't seem to be enjoying their food very much--even though we'd tried several varieties. We received a sample of this food from our veterinarian and they acted like it was a real treat. So we decided to try a large bag and see if they acted more interested. Sure enough, they became more excited about eating. Since it is a bit pricey for our cat food budget, we mix it half and half with the less expensive food. They always pick this out to eat first. We'll be buying more for them.

review/summary: Preferred Choice to Supplement a Canned Food Diet.
review/text: I tried a few dry food brands after the pet food recall of 2007.  I tried some grain free, and noticed some problems from the cats.  I tried going all wet - but apparently - my 17 yo needs some of the grains in dry food,  Their main food of choice (I'm not much of one for switching - had trouble with Turkey and Salmon flavors) is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>.<br /><br />I started with this Dry when it was Eagle Pack Holistic Select.  The formula was EU certified (which has a higher degree of ingredient integrity than US pet foods).  Since then, this company merged with the new owners of Wellness - so the 2 brands can compliment each other.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />EDIT: 3/24/2011<br />I've switched some things up since the Wellness problems (and still waiting for Wellness Chicken Recipe to Return).<br /><br />I have started rotation feeding wet food, and have found that I use less dry food than before - here is my general shopping list:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Will be giving the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> a try.<br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (Also not grain free, and Multi protein source. It does contain Herring. However, cats have reacted positively to this food).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />This is why I prefer the smaller bag.  Except for the removal of additional Vitamin K (google on that one), the ingredients haven't changed much since I started in 2008 (when it was EU certified).  For saving Vet Bills - it pays to have kitties on a high quality diet.<br /><br />PS - the bag comes with its own zip lock closure, I've never had a problem with spoilage nor a-toxins.<br />PPS - some have found this a good rotation ONLY, it eases the budget: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.

review/summary: Very Good Product
review/text: I bought this flavor by accident as I had been buying the anchovy, sardine, salmon meal version of Holistic Select over the past year, and I wasn't paying attention. The chicken is $2 less than the anchovy & sardine one, but both our cats seem to like the anchovy & sardine better. Overall I will stick with Holistic Select because I believe it to be a high quality cat food, and worth the premium. One of our cats will not eat moist food if his life depended on it so we went with this brand which seems to be one of the best dry foods on the market. I just placed an order for the duck meal Holistic Select so we shall see if that one is a hit too.

review/text: We have 5 cats and when we fed them other dry cat foods (several brands) that contained corn or corn products (genetically modified, I'm sure) and wheat or wheat glutin), we would find one or more throw-ups on the floor just about every morning.  We eventually figured out it was the dry cat food.  We started feeding them Holistic Select which is corn and wheat free. Now we seldom find throw-up and if we do, it's because of hair balls.  What a difference!  We have been sold on Holistic Select Adult and Kitten Health food for the past year and we will continue to use it even though it is a bit costly compared to the other dry foods we were using.  My son and daughter have also switched and experienced the same results.

review/summary: A food that works for both new kitten and fussy adult cat
review/text: My 8 year old cat is one of the fussiest eaters on the planet. She will not even touch a food if she sniffs it and decides she doesn't like the smell of it. I have tried the tactic of just leaving it out and not giving her any other options for food and she just ends up starving. She has been eating a cheap brand of dry cat food with ingredients that I now know are just horrific for cats her whole life. The first five ingredients were brewer's rice, chicken by-product meal, corn meal, chicken fat and soybean meal. As you can probably see, this is a food I was desperate to get her off of. She has also been a very skittish cat and would often have anxiety attacks about seemingly nothing. Like, at the very slightest noise she would literally jump 4 feet in the air from fear and if you were near her or touching her when it happened she would unintentionally scratch you to ribbons in her mad dash to get away. I was sad when this happened because normally she is such a gentle cat and has never bit me in her life, there is no way she would scratch unless she was terrified and completely out of her mind. I had an inkling that the junk food might be exacerbating this problem, much like how gluten and dairy could exacerbate the problems of autistic children.<br /><br />All of my attempts up until now have ended up in failed attempts and money wasted on food she wouldn't eat. This happened again and again and I almost thought it was a lost cause until Holistic Select chicken meal formula. We recently rescued a kitten off the streets and I knew I didn't want to start feeding her the same junk that my older cat had been eating for years. I was looking up some grain-free formulas and decided to go with one of those brands since cats shouldn't really be eating grains. To make a long story short, both the kitten and cat didn't like it. The kitten will nibble on it if there are no other options (she's easier to please, thank goodness), so I've kept it around and leave it out so there's something out when their other food is gone, but all in all, not a success by any means. I had a sample packet of Holistic Select chicken meal lying around that I received probably about a year ago and never got around to giving to my cat and the kitten got at it and bit away at the packaging to get the food inside. I looked at the ingredient list and hey, not too bad! I hoped beyond hope and offered some to my older cat and she eagerly ate it! Hallelujah!<br /><br />So I quickly bought a bag from Amazon and prayed that she would continue eating it. Well, I am now down to a quarter of the bag and I recently had to reorder. Both of the cats eat it with no problems and my older cat actually has far less anxiety attacks. She seems much more calm and is now willing to let my husband come up to her without running away in fear. He can even pet her a little. This is a miraculous change than just a few months ago when the mere sight of him had her diving under the bed. I have recently been eating healthier and I know what a difference it makes for me and there is no difference with our pets. What we feed them has a drastic affect on their well-being and behavior. This is not the absolute best food out there, but it's pretty darn good. I have recently ordered some wet food cans from Holistic Select since I know little kitten will go crazy over that and it's good to supplement the diet with some wet.

review/text: My cat has irritable bowel syndrome which we battled for months when we first got him from the shelter. I must have tried 5 different brands before I finally found Holistic Select. It is the only food that gives him perfectly normal bowel movements. (Yes, even tried blue buffalo and a few other expensive products). I recommend this food to everyone for their animals with delicate stomachs. Plus, it doesn't hurt that he absolutely loves it and the unique shape makes him chew it rather than swallow it whole which means it's good for his teeth too!

review/summary: Kitty LOVES this!
review/text: My cat was a rescue who came to us from the shelter with another food, one that has a LOT of name recognition and is very widely touted by veterinarians who sell it.  When that food was running low, I decided to research things before buying her any more.  I'm glad I did my homework!  This food (Chicken Soup etc.) was one of the highest-rated dry foods for nutrition on more than one independent website, so I decided to take a chance on it.  We just started gradually switching our cat over to this a couple of days ago, and she is already picking around in her bowl to eat these nuggets first, leaving the other stuff behind in her bowl for later.  It's too early to tell if she will have behavior changes due to the switch, but it's enough for me to know that she obviously likes this new food better.

review/text: The rice paper wrappers are very good and consistent.  I just run them quickly under lukewarm water on one side, reverse and repeat, shake off excess and then put them immediately on a plate.  You don't need to place them in water.  I like this shape better than the round.  I place them with a corner facing me and use that corner to start the wrap.  Then I fold in the left and right corners and roll the whole thing up - gives me a little more control than the round size.  But you can also wrap them using the straight side to start.  I have a new recipe for fried vietnamese summer rolls using this type of wrapper and I'm looking forward to trying it.  I haven't been able to have egg rolls since going GF, so if this new recipe works I'll be one happy puppy :o}<br /><br />The description said 50 ct for the pkg, but there were only about 28 per pkg.

review/summary: Odd background flavor
review/text: The texture is fine but this has a very odd background flavor to it. I've tried to place it and think it might be from the coconut but I'm just not sure. Though I enjoyed this brand's Oatmeal Raisin granola, I would never buy this flavor again.

review/summary: I absolutely LOVE this granola.
review/text: Let me put it to you this way.  No other granola has me on the internet searching for it so I can buy it in bulk to save money.  Seriously.  It's crazy how much I love this stuff.  I complained to the owner of the store where I buy it that this particular flavor always sells out first.  He now keeps 2 extra cases on hand just for me.<br /><br />This granola is unique.  Maybe that's why some people don't like it.  It's like none I've ever tasted.  Once I made a bowl of it and had to stick it in the fridge to go and answer the door.  I of course forgot about it till the next day.  I saw it and it had turned into a oatmeal of sorts.  I decided to taste it and damn if it wasn't good in a different way.<br /><br />This is premium granola.  It's not for beginners.

I live in Los Angeles and was in love with La Brea Bakery's granola but at $8.99 for a 12oz bag I hated buying it.  I found this one at Big Lots for $2.50 a bag and love it actually more!  My Big Lots store has no more.  I am going to order this 6-pack and eat it everyday at work with soy milk!  The highlight of my morning.

I find it very satisfying with somee added strawberries or blueberries and it holds me until lunchtime.  It gives me a lot of energy for the morning.  I will ofen snack on it in the evening or have it for lunch with a container of yogurt. The only negative is that it dosen't have a lot of fruit and nuts.

review/summary: The standard for salt water taffy
review/text: With the advent of the internet, it's very easy to get your hands on salt water taffy without having to be near a coastal city, state fair, or theme park.  While there's no substitution for freshly made taffy, the next best thing is purchase a souvenir box of salt water taffy, and the Fralinger's brand sets the standard for all boxed taffy.<br /><br />Two important things to know about taffy, outside of flavor, is its stickiness and softness.  All salt water taffy is sticky; however, if stored in a cool environment the taffy becomes more manageable and easier to unwrap.  With the Fralinger brand, room temperature should be adequate enough so that the taffy doesn't stick to the wrapper.  The softening process is a very important process when making taffy as it requires proper folding and stretching of the candy.  When dealing with softness you should not be struggling to eat or chew too heavily as to allow the taffy to get stuck in your teeth; these are signs of poorly made taffy.  This brand strikes a good balance between softness & elasticity, making it very easy to chew.<br /><br />Of all the salt water taffy I've encountered, I still find myself enjoying Fralinger's.  The flavor itself is robust enough without being over powering, nor is it too subtle to where you can't taste a difference in flavors.  For price comparison, I typically find the 12 oz (~0.75 lb) box for around 6-9$ at specialty candy stores or air ports, both notorious for over pricing, but again this is not an easy product for many people to hunt down.<br /><br />For those who are curious, there is no actual salt water in salt water taffy.  The Fralinger brand is the first salt water taffy brand to manufacture and sell the product.  To my knowledge the original stand/store is still operational to this day making its taffy in Atlantic City's boardwalk.

review/summary: Great product, but a bunch of it was stuck together = (
review/text: I ate Fralinger's salt water taffy every summer when growing up, during our beach vacations to the Jersey shore. I was excited to see it available on Amazon and ordered it so I could share it with my kids. At that time, the description and ingredients list on Amazon did not include peanut butter. One of my kids is severely allergic, we would not have bought it. I wrote a comment about that and now see that my comment is missing, and the ingredient list now says "peanut butter." Good move Sweet Gourmet! Sadly my younger daughter could not try the taffy, but my older daughter brought it to school to share with her class as part of her NJ state report. Unfortunately when we opened it many pieces of taffy had melted out of their wrappers and were stuck together. Uncomfortable situation but we made the best of it. So...the product is fantastic. The delivery, not so much.

review/summary: Very good Red Hots
review/text: These Red Hots are really good! Sweet and full of flavor. I make Sweet Cinnamon Tea with them. I melt them in my Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Pot. I put these where the tea bags go and fill the water well only about half full of water. I stir them in the tea bag holder to help them melt faster and better. I then pour the cinnamon water into a gallon pitcher about half filled with tea. I then fill the rest of the pitcher with more water. It's much cheaper than buying cinnamon tea bags. It's easier to make than it sounds. These made my tea really good. These are a good value for the money. I have tried other brands that didn't have the cinnamon flavor that these have. They're hot but not too hot. I will order these again when I am nearly out. They got here well before the expectant date. I was so pleased.<br /><br />Thank you for such a great product.

review/summary: Not made in China.... Yah !!!!
review/text: I, like probably many of you, have been going nuts about this "Jerky from China" situation...  Every product I have found has" Made in China" in small print somewhere at the bottom of the package.  I don't think using pet treats from China is a good idea right now...  I have been researching companies and this is what I found from The Real Meat Co. sales dept:<br /><br /> The Real Meat Company products are made in the USA and meats sourced from USA, New Zealand and Australia.<br /><br />1. The meat in our products is sourced from only the finest farms, free ranging and humanely raised without growth hormones or antibiotics and our fish are from the deep clear oceans of the South Pacific.<br /><br />2. There are NO ingredients from china.<br /><br />3. We do not use any grains and have no wheat or gluten.<br /><br />4. No preservatives, no anti-biotic, no flavorings, no growth hormones, no colorings.<br /><br />5. It is not irradiated.<br /><br />6. Every shipment of meat carries USDA, FDA certification. (believe it, they check all small companies)<br /><br />7. They're YUMMY! HEALTHY! And four footers LOVE Real Meat Foods and Treats.<br />====<br /><br />OK - No "Made in China" and no "irradiation" - Yah !!!!  These sound like a safe option.  I have ordered the lamb and the venison and am hoping for the best....<br /><br />Update:<br />OK - These came yesterday and my dogs love them - they actually all took off to separate corners to eat their treat.  I like that they are small and easy to chew or tear... no choking...

review/summary: Excellent grain-free treat
review/text: These treats are the bee's knees.  I've bought them in EVERY flavor they offer.  Venison is a great flavor, but my pups love all the flavors equally, it seems.  Each treat is about 1" wide and 1" to 1-1/2" in length.  Good sized treat for a bigger dog, and if you have smaller dogs like my shelties, these jerky treats tear apart easily into smaller bites with no crumbs, no mess.  They smell like the jerky I buy for myself, and have quality ingredients.  The shelties love them!  I gave a bag to my sister for her giant dogs and they love them too, they work hard for these treats to get them out of puzzle toys.<br /><br />My younger sheltie can't handle grain or gluten... he has epilepsy that is possibly triggered by gluten, so I feed both furkids grain-free everything.  Even if he didn't have epilepsy, I'd probably still feed grain-free, including these treats, because my shelties have *fantastic* silky soft coats from feeding them this way.  I don't buy these treats here, I get them elsewhere, but they are a fantastic deal for 12 ounces of treats, it's a LOT of little torn-up bite-sized treats for my shelties during training.  Each bag lasts me about a month, I think.

However, if you're only going to sell 10% of this cup as Kona beans, then either make that knowledge public, and up front, or lower the price of these cups back down to 60 cents a cup. Don't make us pay a premium for only a hint of the beans.

review/summary: Not in Fisher Packaging as show on Web site
review/text: The ad is deceiving as it show the almonds in Fisher packaging.<br />When you receive it it is in a clear unmarked bag.<br />You do not know if it is a Fisher product or who makes it.<br />They were almonds

review/summary: Delicious Creamy Smooth Chocolate
review/text: The delicious ingredients of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GSE7K6">Raw Organic Dark Chocolate L.O.V.E. Cup with Yacon Syrup-1 ozs.</a> / <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I8GT5K">Raw Organic Dark Chocolate L.O.V.E. Cup with Agave Nectar-1 ozs.</a> are simply Cacao, Yacon Syrup, and Himalayan salt. These are packaged by [...]301-703-4116 and sold here on Amazon. Yacon is probably my most favorite sweetener but because of its expense, I don't use it exclusively. In my opinion is the healthiest sweetener as well as the best-tasting sweetener. It is wonderful to see it offered in this chocolate. I ordered 7 cups and they arrived quickly and in great condition. Out of the wrapper and papercup, they weighed in at about 1.04oz. Each had more cacao nibs on the top than shown on the photo and as I am not a fan of the nibs, I knocked mine off into the disposal and just eat the creamy part. Some chocolate without sunflower lecithin or soy lecithin can have an inferior texture but these are Raw Organic Dark Chocolate L.O.V.E. cups with Yacon Syrup are creamy with a superb texture. You don't get the cane sugar roller coaster rush but the flavor is delicious and satisifies that I-want-a-chocolate-treat craving. Great job Natural Zing!<br /><br />Here is an excerpt from an article by Sirova Raw Foods about Yacon<br /><br />Yacon Root Powder: Health Benefits of this Andean Superfood<br /><br />Yacon, also known as Apple of the Earth, is a lot more deserving of its nickname than regular potatoes, whose French name "pommes de terre" literally means "apples of the earth". Indeed, the yacon root, native of the Andes, actually tastes quite similar to a traditional apple, and is a lot sweeter as well.<br /><br />But, is its sweetness incompatible with its low-glycemic properties? Not at all. Its sweet taste is due to its high concentration of inulin, a sugar which is not recognized by our body, and therefore does not affect it the way regular sugar does. After ingesting yacon root, the sugars are simply eliminated without causing spikes in blood sugar levels. Also, yacon root is quite low in calories compared to main sources of sugar, and therefore does not contribute to weight gain in the same proportions.<br /><br />Yacon is also quite common in Andean remedies, and for good reason. Amongst many studies:<br />A Chinese study found that "the extract from the leaves of Smallantus sonchifolius (yacon) was found to show potent anti-diabetic activity,"<br />An Argentinian study determined that "yacon syrup is a good source of fructooligosaccharides and its long-term consumption produced beneficial health effects on obese pre-menopausal women with insulin resistance,"<br />A Swiss study concluded that "yacon markedly accelerates colonic transit in healthy individuals. Due to the low caloric content of yacon, the root could be a useful treatment in constipated diabetics or obese patients."<br />Yacon root is also thought to be prebiotic, and helpful in helping recolonize the digestive system with healthy bacteria in cases of bacterial imbalance.<br />According to David Wolfe in his book "Superfoods: The Food and Medicine of the Future", "As a prebiotic, yacon is good for digestion, stimulates positive colon health, and helps with the absorption of calcium, magnesium, and B vitamins. Yacon helps to regulate friendly intestinal flora, and espeically improves the growth of certain probiotics (...), thus helping to reduce constipation. Yacon root contains significant quantities of potassium and antioxidants. Because of its high antioxidant value, yacon is beneficial in reducing free-radical damage in the body, especially in the colon."

review/summary: My favorite raw chocolate!
review/text: If you've never had raw chocolate before, be ready for a new experience. The texture and flavor of the L.O.V.E. Cup is truly extraordinary. It doesn't snap or crunch like more mass-produced chocolate bars and it's not nearly as sweet. Eating a L.O.V.E. Cup is like savoring a fine glass of wine. I love its almost chewiness and the way the flavor builds as you let it melt on your tongue and move around your mouth. They are so satisfying.  It's more like eating a nutritious meal than snacking on a confection. I also love the cacao nips, which add another texture and more flavor.  Can't believe anyone would scrape them off!<br /><br />Not sure why this seller is currently charging $8, since another Amazon vendor sells them for $3.49. Even that may seem expensive but consider the variation in the price of a bottle of wine, which can range from $4 for a grocery-store brand to easily over $40 for one from a good boutique vineyard. A L.O.V.E. Cup is the latter but at a price that's only 2x more than a mass-produced bar of 77% cocoa.

review/summary: Took Expensive & Tastes Awful
review/text: At $8.00, I was expecting a box of these things.  I got a single one in the mail.  It tasted nasty.  What an incredible waste of money.  We passed it around the home and everyone agreed this is tastes nasty.  Recommend that you avoid this product.
