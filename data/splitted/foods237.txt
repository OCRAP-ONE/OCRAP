review/summary: My family LOVES this bread!
review/text: This bread is very tasty.  I like it because it's so moist and maintains its texture instead of becoming crumbly the second day after being baked.  It is so easy to make sandwiches, spread margarine or peanut butter and in general, do whatever we would normally do with bread.  We are able to fully enjoy bread now instead of eating the cardboard-textured bread we were buying.  I love this bread and highly recommend all Pamela's Products.<br /><br />Also, the subscribe and save plan has been a great deal for my family.  We save money and I don't have to remember to go online to order.  I simply get an email telling me my order is about to be shipped and I get at least a day or two in which to go online to make any changes to the order - with a click of a button I can skip any order.  I just love it!

review/summary: Easy, flexible, tasty, great texture = WIN
review/text: I've tried ten different GF bread mixes, and this is the only one that yields a GF bread that my gluten-eating family members like. I have found that the directions apparently used JUMBO eggs. I have tweaked it a bit, using an extra egg white or two for added loft, and when I do the sweet bread, I only use half the sugar amount listed in the recipe on the bag and add a little salt to balance it out. Doing it that way, my "I-only-eat-bakery-breads" hubby LOVES it.<br /><br />I use a Zoji bread machine on the QUICK course setting, LIGHT crust. This keeps it from being overkneaded or baking out the moisture. Then I cool it completely on a wire rack (uncovered). The loaf lasts a week at room temp without molding (if it's not eaten faster than that).<br /><br />This bread is PERFECT FOR SANDWICHES, because it is sturdy and not crumbly or dry. You DON'T HAVE TO TOAST IT TO TOLERATE IT.<br /><br />Other GF bread mixes I have tried include 2 different ones from Gluten Free Pantry, 2 from Bob's Red Mill, 1 from Orgran, 4 types from Breads From Anna (=our 2nd choice), & Namaste. All of these molded within 2 days at room temp, and refrigerating/freezing made it necessary to toast it to make it tolerable. With the exception of Breads from Anna, all the other ones I listed in this paragraph are really worthy of use for bread crumbs or croutons or making stuffing...but not much else.

review/text: I had been making the Red Mill bread, but I have to say this blows away the competion in both taste and ease.  I don't have to add a bunch of extra different ingredients (like egg whites, butter, etc).  Good flavor & nice looking loaf.  The bread is soft as one reviewer mentioned. We don't mind, but some might.

review/text: Since learning my husband has celiac disease, he hasn't been able to eat pizza with us on homemade pizza nights. It used to be a treat. So I was excited when I first tried the bread mix thinking he could enjoy pizza again. However, the dough never seems to bake throughout; it always turns out gummy. We've tried letting it rise even longer than the hour recommended, even that didn't help. I still have a few bags left so I'm going to try something other than pizza.

review/summary: best GF bread
review/text: I have been gluten free for 5 years and this is the best gluten free bread I have had.  It is easy to make in the oven or in the bread maker (you must be able to make 2 pound loaves in your bread maker). This bread is not all crumbly like most breads.  It is moist, slices good and keeps well.  It also freezes well.  It is not too bad for being expensive if you order it from Amazon.  it's an even better deal if you put it on automatic order.  My mom and niece (who do not have to eat gluten free) love this bread.  They always eat some if I let them!  I wish I would have known about this bread sooner.

review/text: This is, by far, the best bread mix I've had, and I've tried quite a few. I have found pre-baked breads that are better than this, but they are few and far between, and I find that this mix is actually better than many of the frozen breads out there. Try adding herbs and spices to the mix (rosemary and a little extra olive oil is really good, or Italian herbs) or any flavor you like, it's a great base. It also makes great pizza dough, though it's a bit hard to work with in terms of texture. I definitely recommend this mix, it's tasty, has a great texture, and pretty easy to make, all in all.

review/summary: Good, but not great...
review/text: If you have been deprived of sandwiches for a long time because of a gluten sensitivity , this bread mix may seem like a treat. On the other hand, if you have found Whole Foods gluten-free loaves, such as the Prairie bread with pumpkin and sunflower seeds, then I think you'll be disappointed as I was. I tried the manual mixing method, and took special care to allow the bread to rise as I would a non-GF bread. The instructions say only to let it rise 1 hr. which I believe is inadequate. Perhaps the yeast in the supplied packet was not as active as it should have been -- in any event the resulting bread did not rise properly in several attempts. Flavor is not that great, but I did make some "everything" bagels which were fairly tasty if not very light.

review/summary: my daughter ate it!
review/text: My daughter is on the autism spectrum and very picky.  She has also recently been discovered to have sensitivities to wheat, dairy, eggs, soy etc..  This was our last hope for her to be able to have a sandwich.  We ordered the single package first and prepared it with the suggested egg replacement, in our bread machine on the gluten free setting, which did not mix well, and was not fully cooked in the middle when finished.  So we took a leap of faith and ordered the 6 pack of Pamela's bread to try again because the taste seemed very good from the small pieces we ripped off the ends.  When I made this the second time I used the regular oven, and used less liquid (as suggested on the package to avoid under cooking) ---and tada!!!  It's wonderful, and lighter and softer than any other gluten free mix we've tried (we've tried 4 others) and my daughter ate it!  She can now enjoy a cashew butter and preservative free jelly sandwich on real bread!  Whew! Thank you Pamela.

review/text: We have tried several kinds of gluten free bread for my celiac son who is three years old.  This has been the best overall in texture and taste.  It smells wonderful when its baking too.  We use a bread machine on the lightest crust at rapid bake, if the crust gets too brown the bread dries out too quick.  Keep in the fridge after the second day as it will mold after about 4-5 days, but will last alot longer in the fridge.

review/text: After recently finding out my daughter has food allergies, I have been searching for foods that she will eat and love, especially bread.  As a mother, I don't want her to feel deprived.  I made this bread on the weekend and it was gone in 2 days.  It's wonderful!  In order to make the experience less traumatic we have removed all of the foods that she cannot eat from our household... wheat, dairy, & egg.  Pamela gives specific instructions for making this bread dairy and egg free.  We all love it.  In fact my younger daughter (age 2) was extremely [read fit-throwing] upset this morning that we were out of the bread we made. We're instant fans.  Thanks Pamela!

review/text: Pamela's bread mix is a wonderful product. Honestly, just eating a plain slice reminds me of Cake... It works extremely well in my bread maker.  I was using Udi's GF bread product at $6.00 per 12oz loaf. Pamela's gives me a 2 pound loaf for approx. $5.00. That's 1.25 pounds more bread for a dollar less than the cardboard tasting Udi's multi-grain product. I might add that it also comes with one packet of yeast included in each package, so you have everything you need to make some great bread. I think this could be the beginnings of a beautiful friendship...

review/summary: Try this mix first if your baking GF bread for a child
review/text: This is by far the best GF bread we've found for our 8 year old who has Celiacs.  Super easy to bake in our West End Hi Rise bread maker - simply follow directions and the loaf comes out perfectly.  It has a very child friendly taste - I disagree with other reviewers that say it is too sweet, it is similar in taste to a "normal" honey wheat loaf - and MOST IMPORTANTLY NO HORRIBLE SOUR AFTER TASTE like we have found to be the case in some of the other mixes and store bought loaves we've tried.  The texture is denser than "normal" bread similar to other GF breads - almost cake like - BUT it is tasty, moist and NOT CRUMBLY like other GF breads. The slices kept perfectly in a vacuum-sealed Ziploc bag in the fridge for 5 days.  I took two slices out of the fridge and put them in the microwave for 10 seconds on each side to get it back to room temperature since my son has never liked to eat cold bread.  Also, we have had NO STOMACH ISSUES as a small minority of reviewers claim the get when they eat this bread.  Hope this helps:)

review/text: I am writing this just after finishing off the last two slices of a delicious, crispy and flavorful gluten-free pizza! This one is a winner.<br /><br />I was worried about the few bad reviews that said it had a weird taste, but with all the additional spices we added it was even better than the delivery kind! I was so impressed, I can't wait to make another. We only used 1/2 of a bag and it will feed about 2 or 3 people. So at $2 + sauce, cheese and toppings - it's a steal!<br /><br />Next up, slowly rising in my bread oven is my first gluten free loaf of white bread. I can't wait. Going gluten-free has never been easier, and I am not a chef! Just someone who is looking for some natural healing without the sacrifice of good taste.<br /><br />PS. I ordered this on Sunday, and it arrived on Tuesday. How is THAT for customer service!!!

review/text: Having only recently discovered my gluten intolerance, my experience with GF products is limited...BUT, one thing for sure, the bread substitutes in the freezer departments of most grocery stores don't do much for the taste buds.  In fact,  the whole experience can be compared to trying to chew sawdust. (No, I haven't tried Udi's at Whole Foods.)<br /><br />With that in mind, and after reading the reviews, I decided to try another option  and bought the Pamela's GF Bread and Pizza Mix.  What a difference.  Yes, is is a bit spongy, but that's not an issue with me. What is important to me is it has texture and flavor. I made it my bread machine on the dough setting and baked it in the oven following the package directions for oven baking.  It got very brown at 60 minutes (rather than the 70 the package suggests) so I took it out. Let it cool (almost) and when I tried it - WOW what a difference.<br /><br />As I said, I'm new at this but, I recommend it over ready made.  Next step will be to try and make my own from scratch - but, I'm not quite there yet.

I like it plain because it works better for sandwiches; I do add ground flak seeds for more fiber.  I use my bread machine so it is fast and easy. The bread is very porous and jam will leak through to the plate. The bread is smaller than sandwich bread.

review/text: I have tried a few of the gluten free breads and they crumble when you try to make a sandwich.  I tried this brand and it was so moist and easy to cut.  I kept it in the fridge for over a week and it stayed good to the last piece.  It worked great in my bread machine.  I look forward to trying other variations and pizza crust!

review/summary: Decent if baked in regular oven
review/text: I take exception to the holes being poked in the bag prior to shipping.  Now I have 6 bags with holes in them.  A good entry for bugs.  Why can't they just fill the bags without air in them like other flour companies do?<br /><br />The first attempt at making this bread in my bread machine was a failure.  I use a Zojirushi bread machine, maybe that's the problem.  I'll have to research other machines that might be better for the gluten-free products.<br /><br />My second bread attempt had better results.  Followed the directions for oven baking and it came out OK.  It looked fantastic when it came out, nice & high but it didn't take long to deflate.  The taste and texture is just OK so I still haven't found a delicious gluten free bread mix that I can say I love.

review/summary: Really good when fresh
review/text: This was one of the first bread mixes I tried after learning I couldn't tolerate gluten.  Fresh out of the oven it is amazing to eat with just some butter/jam on it.  It even smelled like real bread when baking and was just incredibly yummy freshly baked.  I could have eaten the entire life, haha!  But I found the next day it was not as good, even with retoasting it in the oven.  It was very heavy and dense and had a strange bitter taste to it.  Because of the dense texture though I think this would work really well for sweet breads.  I tried using it as a pizza crust and it was just way too heavy and overpowering of more delicate flavors like cheese and mushrooms.  The flours used in this were a little hard on my tummy too.  Overall it is okay, but I am not amazed.  I would probably skip this unless I plan to use the whole loaf fresh from baking or just for sweet breads.

review/summary: I can eat bread again
review/text: After my diagnosis of celiac diseas, I pretty much just gave up on bread; I'd tasted the storebought, premade rice breads that my sister in law tried, and decided if it didn't taste or feel like real bread, I'd just do without.  And because I am intolerant to legumes, all mixes and breads with bean flour or soy flour are out.  I also need to avoid dairy.<br /><br />Enter Pamela's Amazing Bread Mix. While I've made this in the oven, and it's not hard, this mix does amazingly in my 10 year old, primited Breadman bread machine. I simply follow the instructions on the bag, set my machine to medium 2 pound loaf, and in two hours I have the best gluten free bread ever.  It is soft, light, and springy.  It has a slightly sweet taste, probably due to the sorghum flour.<br /><br />If you try this, I highly recommend using the bread machine. I've had a lot of successes baking it in the oven, but I've had a few loaves explode over the sides of the pan, making for a not-so-aesthetic-appearing loaf.  In the bread machine there is plenty of room, the loaf rises nicely and doesn't under- or over-bake.<br /><br />Thank you, Pamela!

review/text: We couldn't wait and cut the loaf before it was completely cool. No problem! The loaf was moist and tasted like real bread. Maybe the flaxseed and coconut oil helped. The bread was fresh for days right up until the last crumb was gobbled up. Sliced thinly, it makes great toast too. I'm not a fan of those bean flours and this bread was much better than the others I have tried. At last a really delicious bread mix that tastes like real bread. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and added 5 tablespoons of ground flaxseed. I don't have a bread machine and it was a bit tricky to mix with my old hand mixer but it rose beautifully and baked up perfectly. The smell of freshly baked bread was wonderful.

review/summary: My daily bread
review/text: After figuring out that I was gluten intolerant about 3 years ago, I tried a bunch of breads (mostly frozen) available in specialty grocery stores, and a couple from dedicated GF bakeries, but didn't really like any of them.  I made my own GF bread for a while, using a Bette Hagman (Gluten Free Gourmet) recipe, and that was good, but quite time consuming.  Once my baby was born and I had no time to bake bread from scratch, I discovered Pamela's GF bread mix.  It's very easy to throw it in the bread machine, and it comes out great.  The house smells good, the bread is fairly soft, and it keeps longer on the shelf than the bread I used to bake.  (I still usually freeze 1/3 of each loaf, because it does start getting stale after several days.)  Now, I usually add 1/4 cup of flax seed meal and 2 T water to the mix for Omega-3s.

review/text: I'd definitely see if there's a health food store that gives samples, or an organic restaurant that carries this, or a friend with it--try it before buying.<br /><br />I was used to French's and Heinz's yellow--staples in my fridge along with Grey Poupon and Gulden's. But I have been, in the last year, switching to organic products and produce. I purchased this to replace my about to expire French's yellow mustard.<br /><br />Well, this stuff is awful. I don't know why it has that odd taste--the vinegar, the particular mustard seeds?--but I put this on a sandwich and hated it. Then I decided to try again, a different day, and again, scraped it off the turkey. I could not bear it.<br /><br />I threw the nearly full bottle away.<br /><br />For now, it's back to non-organic mustard until I can taste other organic mustards and find one that doesn't make me wanna spit out my food.<br /><br />Pity.<br /><br />Mir

review/text: To be honest, like the other reviewers, I had not read the label as carefully as I should have before purchasing this product. It is based on apple cider vinegar, not the usual plain white vinegar that most mustards are based on. As a result, it has a sweeter apple-hinted flavor to it. I turned out to really like that flavor, but others may not.

review/summary: Great tasting for a health food bar...
review/text: I typically get the brownie crunch flavor, but happened to grab one of these white chocolate chip bars by accident.  It was a good accident.  These are really good.  I actually think I like them better than the brownie crunch. I usually don't like anything white chocolate because it's overly sweet, but this isn't.  I typically buy my bars at whole foods, but they are quite expensive.  I may start buying them on amazon.  Only downside is that you can't pick and choose what you'd like in a box on amazon.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The ingredients seem pretty good as well.  Nothing screams to me as a scary lab created chemical.  It's got a good amount of fiber, lots of protein and no added sugar or fake sugar (a big pet peeve of mine). It tastes very good in comparison to some other "healthy protein bars" out there that taste like chalk and smell like feet.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />It does have more calories and carbs than I would like to see in this size bar. 240 calories & a whopping 27 grams of carbs.

review/text: I'm a big fan of nutrition bars as a convenient snack or meal substitute in a pinch and this bar is delicious! This was my first thinkThin bar and I found it interesting for a few reasons. The bar is enrobed by a thin layer of what looks like white chocolate. The bar itself is chewy, soft and possesses a cake-like texture which I enjoyed. It had the right amount of sweetness for me and the flavor profile is quite simple and straightforward; nothing spicy or tricky. The only thing I disliked about the bar was the slightly synthetic-tasting white chocolate flavor, but it was not so terrible that I wouldn't eat it again. I would definitely be interested in trying out the other flavors when I get a chance.

review/summary: Celiacs/Gluten Free buyers beware!!
review/text: Purchased approximately 24 of these bars in different flavors (the chocolate fudge being my personal favorite, though the brownie crunch is also tasty).  The texture is a bit chewy but the flavor is good...for a protein bar.  Not necessarily on par with the average sugar-filled candy bar of course.  The carb/sugar/protein content is on par with most higher end Gluten Free protein bars I've discovered (including Quest Bars and NoGii).<br /><br />All things considered - flavor, consistency, and quality, I'd likely give these 4 stars.  The issue, however, is that after eating about 6 bars with no issues, I began having gluten reactions to the next three I attempted to eat.  Needless to say, no matter how much protein you consume, your workouts are not going to go well if you're horribly sick.<br /><br />I have written to the company to complain, but cannot afford to take this risk, especially with other comparable bars available.  I caution anyone with Celiac Disease to try these at your own risk, they say GLUTEN FREE on the label, but something was not or a batch became contaminated.  I've been a diagnosed Celiac for over 10 years and I (unfortunately) know the reaction all too well and this bar sparked it.<br /><br />Although I wanted to support this bar for it's high protein content and GF label, I will not buy Think Thin bars again for this reason.  I've moved to Quest Protein Bars for now as I've never had any gluten or allergic reactions to those (and they tend to taste better if you like an almond/caramel type flavor) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00418OR56">Quest Bar 2.12 oz. Low Carb, Gluten Free, High Fiber Protein Bars (Box of 12 Bars)</a> - though you'd likely want to buy these from the actual site as they are much cheaper there.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you have no food allergies or specific dietary constraints, these might work for you...good luck!

review/summary: Think Thin White Chocolate
review/text: The one thing I do not like is the chemical aftertaste I get. But, I know this is what all bars of this type taste like this. I like the variety of flavors these bars come in and the convenience. The high protein makes it a good snack to tide me over until I can eat a meal. But it takes me 45 minutes to eat an entire bar because it is so sweet. I think I will stick to more natural snacks. I would buy these again though if they were on sale. I do appreciate the many products out there for people like me with celiac.

review/summary: Good, but by locally, if possible
review/text: ThinkThin are the best-tasting of the low-carb and gluten-free protein bars, in my opinion. They are now available at many more stores than when I ordered a box from Amazon awhile ago. And they are much cheaper at every store I've been to than the online price. At even Whole Foods, I typically pay $1.69 per bar, and get a slight discount for buying an entire box. Once you add shipping to Amazon's prices, they are more expensive online. Also, keep in mind the season when ordering them. All of the coatings had melted and were stuck to the packaging, then fell off in pieces when opened, due to having melted during shipment. But if you can get them locally, give them a try. There are many flavors to choose from, though most stores seem to only carry a few.<br /><br />Those people who claim they are awful tasting probably haven't tried other protein bars that are low-carb and gluten-free, and expect them to taste like candy bars or high-sugar bars that may be more tasty, but are also full of ingredients that render them nutritionally useless.

review/text: I have tried these bars in the past but was very disappointed with this product, I ordered, went to eat the bars and they were covered with a white film and crumbled.  Amazon was great and understood my problem and sent another order.  This order was also covered with a white film and crumbled.  I wasnt going to do a 3rd time.  Kind of turned me off on ordering this kind again, not sure what the problem was - the date was 8/13 so i dont understand unless it was that batch.

review/summary: Okay, but no better than that
review/text: These are edible enough - a very mild peanut flavor to the rather cakey center, with a not very chocolate-y coating on the bar.  I ordered them along with a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006W20AFA">Quest Bar 100% Natural Chocolate Peanut Butter</a>, and find I prefer the taste (though it's still not that strong) and texture (very chewy) of the Quest bars.  Also, the Quest bars have 150 calories, 45 calories from fat, and 17 grams of fiber to the Think Thin bars' 240 calories, 80 calories from fat, and 1 gram of fiber.  I find the two bars equally filling - and the Quest bars' all natural ingredients are also more appealing.<br /><br />No more Think Thin bars.  It's the Quest bars I'm reordering - in several different flavors.

review/text: Chocolate fudge is the best. The rest of them don't taste good to me. I am type 2 diabetic and went on the Atkins diet. I ate these on the way home from work, before dinner. I ate less, as a result. It took me almost a year, but I lost 32 lbs...felt great.. and was never hungry. I eat these bars even when I am not dieting. I love them. You feel full for at least three hours after eating one, so they work very well as a diet aid.<br /><br />The Atkins bars are very delicious too, and easier to find here. But, they are not as high in protein and don't keep you full as long as these Think Thin bars do.

review/summary: Favorite Gluten Free Protien Bar I've  Found to Date
review/text: I've found protein supplementing a necessity having a diet of pretty much only veggies and fruit [and candy]. I devastated when I found out that I needed to go gluten free because it pretty much cut out any protein bar I could stand eating every day.<br /><br />Then I found these.<br /><br />These taste great and have the protein I need. Their texture is a bit chewy, but still in the range of a yummy bar. I guess I just miss having a crunch in my diet [note: they're crunch bars are great, but they have a little too much fiber for my digestive system]. I've got to say, these certainly don't taste like white chocolate, but they are delicious. I think the branding in this company just decided to call this bar white chocolate, because thinkthin has another chocolate flavor and this one has a more complex flavor symphony working for it that would deter from the title of simply chocolate.<br /><br />I do wish they had a little more nutritional value in them, but I shouldn't ask for too much when flavor is more of my concern in a protein bar. They've got a little calcium and iron, so I'm happy. Especially when I compare their 230 calories to my old bar of 320 that had the same amount of protein [and a lot more nutritional content].<br /><br />These are also quite affordable when you buy the case [compared to the other gluten-free bars.]. I've been eating a least one a day and slowly over the past 10 months I've watched my lanky muscles grow into what they should be as a daily biker and intense artist who's apt to throw their whole body in their work.

review/summary: Edible
review/text: I read the other reviews and thought I would give this protein bar a try.  My taste buds must not be like the reviewers who liked this bar.  It was edible at best.  It has a smooth filling with an artificial taste and after taste. As one who started a weight watching quest with Tab in the early '60's (bad, bad after taste that still lingers 50 years later) I am willing to try a product on others recommendations. This one, though it has 20 grams of protein, is not worth a rebuy.  As I watch what I eat and look for low carb, high protein snacks, calories weren't key in this purchase.  If you want high protein and great taste, try the Questbar. It's like a rice crispy treat made from nuts.  thinkThin does make a very nice product in their thinkThin crunch bars.  I ordered the white chocolate dipped mixed nuts, and will keep on buying them.  I think they are crunchy and tasty.

review/text: I had tried this bar before so I knew I liked it. Honestly White Chocolate is the best flavor. I received a fresh shipment from amazon and there was no doubt whether they were good quality or not. This bar is a chocolate nougat with a white chocolate coating. I personally don't find a chemical after taste but I usually eat sugar free products or usually eat food sans sugar, so be forewarned. If you prefer a sugar free taste then you are in for a treat because they are the closest you can get to a candy bar with zero sugar and 20g of protein.

review/text: I noticed that some people said that eating one was enough, but that's probably because of the taste. I've tried two other flavors of it before, one was chocolate, and I never liked them at all. I don't understand why some people say that it tastes like a candy bar, it looks really pretty, but then when you actually it bite into, it's terrible, b/c it's all mushy inside. Maybe buy one to try it, but don't buy in bulk unless you're sure you like it

review/text: Normally, this are outstanding bars.  If you dont believe it, go to a local health food store and try one (Trader Joes sells them as well).  I subscribed via Amazon a few years ago, and for whatever reason the last 3 boxes have arrived damaged.  They have a awelfull tainted taste unlike ones that are found in local stores.  They had a yellowish color (normally off white), and looked like they had been melted several times over even though the expiration date was current.  The last box, Amazon said they would fix the issue but havent.  I cannot return them because of Amazons policy.  Also interesting, I wrote a review similar to this one regarding the same issue, but Amazon deleted it off the website.  In any event, I cancelled my subcription and will contact the makers of this good product to let them know that somewhwere in the shipment process it is being mishandeling.  I would venture to say that many of the one star reviews are from people who dont know what these bars should really taste like,

review/summary: Zero sugar, great taste
review/text: I love this bar--BUT bear in mind that I have to try hard to find a zero-sugar food that's easy to grab and throw in my purse.  If you're just looking for something yummy, this may not be your favorite.  But if you're looking for zero sugar, it's almost impossible to find, and when you do find it, it usually tastes bad.  In fact, there are some chocolate or chocolate/peanut butter versions of this same product, and I HATE them.  Gross.  But the white chocolate tastes great.  Caveat:  They are 230 calories per bar, which is too many calories for me, so I cut them in half and keep each half in a ziploc bag in my cupboard for a quick grab when I'm running out the door.  Then we're down to only 215 calories, but still filling.  I love this bar.

review/text: I like the Think Thin bars for their nutritional profile, not so much for their taste.  I've tried the brownie and the dark chocolate and sometimes have to swallow hard to get them down, along with some kind of beverage.  When these arrived the first thing I noticed was how soft and chewy and "fresh" they tasted- in comparison to the others which are very firm, if not hard, bars.  Wow.  That makes all the difference.  These went down like a dream, and while I'm not going to say you will love them like a Snickers, I will say that they don't taste bad at all and chew like a warm oatmeal cookie.  I am beginning to wonder if it is just this flavor which is so soft and tasty, or if my other bars are just old and hard.  All bought on Amazon, though.  In any case, they were MUCH better than expected!

review/summary: I took a chance... and I love them!
review/text: I have had mixed luck with many of the gluten free bars... some hard as a rock, crunchy and crumbly choke-to-death on, weird pasty flavors that are nothing like you imagine... On a whim I got a box of these ThinkThin White Chocolate Chip bars, and I was just going to struggle thru them if they were not as good as I had hoped...but I really really like them!  I'll admit the first bit I thought it was way too sweet and the white chocolate was a little weird tasting (isn't is always, really?!), but that faded away to the nice chocolate flavor with little choco crunchy bits.  They remind me of a denser 3 Musketeers bar only with white choco coating and the choco crunchy bits.  I am almost tempted to try to other flavors, but I am spoiled on these.

review/summary: Not my favorite, but not a bad choice
review/text: Not as tasty as the Chunky Peanut Butter Bar, but still loaded with protein and gluten-free.  Thank you, Think Products!

review/text: I tried the other chocolate bars and thought they were too bitter.  The white chocolate bars are fabulous!  They are not bitter.
