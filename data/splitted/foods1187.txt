review/summary: BEWARE-VERY SLIMY
review/text: The strawberry licorice wheels are pretty good.  My biggest complaint is the slime.  You don't think you ought to have to wash your hands after having licorice but with these you do.  They have a pretty good flavor and tend to be addicting (what candy isn't).  Just know what you are getting into because 5 lbs is a lot of candy.

review/summary: Not great, but not bad either.
review/text: These candies were not bad and I will probably buy again, but I was disappointed.  They are very chewy (almost tough) and just taste like an inexpensive candy.  Ironically, in the same order, I also purchased the black licorice wheels (also by Haribo) packaged in the smaller bags.  In contrast, the black licorice wheels were very fresh, moist and tasty.  I think whether or not a person likes the red wheels simply depends upon their individual taste.  If the red ones presented like the black ones (moist, fresh and very tasty), I would be very pleased.  Perhaps it would be helpful to describe the red ones as an "ordinary" and the black ones as "gormet."

review/text: The older Haribo red licorice wheels were wonderfully flavored and had a great texture.  The current wheels have no flavor and are impossible to eat because of the waxy and slimy feel.

review/text: Great for those of us allergic to eggs wheat soy and all seafoods!  Few oils make it for deep frying.  They either smoke at 350 degree and up or they alter the taste of a food in ways we don't like.  I've been a Mazola fryer forever but decided given how hard it is to scrape off a pot it just might be not too good looking in the arteries either.  Better find an alternative.  This one is a costly one indeed but so far no one has noticed I changed cooking oils and my fried foods are golden brown and the pot is far easier to clean.  Here's too my circulatory system!

review/summary: Not just a great flavor
review/text: Walnut oil certainly has that - a wonderful, nutty flavor that lends a solid undertone to salad dressings and vegetable dishes.<br /><br />It has other uses in the kitchen, though. Artists sometimes use walnut oil instead of linseed oil, since it's one of the few vegetable oils that hardens to a tough film when exposed to air without just going rancid. As a result, it's my choice for treating wooden spoons, cutting boards, and the like. Unlike most oil finishes, it's completely edible. Unlike mineral oil, it hardens inside the wood's grain. When new wooden tools appear in your kitchen, oil them, let them sit overnight, and wipe away any excess in the morning. Repeat daily for a week, weekly for a month, and every few months after that. Although toasted oils have a richer flavor, I prefer the untoasted for my woodenware.<br /><br />-- wiredweird<br /><br />PS: Although you can still get walnut oil as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006OJAGU">painting medium</a>, you should use only food-grade oil on your woodenware.

Just put ice in a blender, pour the mix over and blend.  I also add yogurt on occasion or sherbet and it is so good.  It's also great over ice cream or sherbet right out of the container.

review/text: I thought I was getting a good deal on this water. I love it so much, and I'm trying to get into the habit of drinking water. I've never seen bottles this small of any kind of water. The smallest size in the store is around $1 per bottle. I misread the label while trying to figure out what size the bottles were for the purchase, and I feel stupid. A case is too heavy for me to carry home from the store, so I thought I'd check my trusty Amazon. I will have to come up with something else. I'd return this water, but the mistake is mine. Still, I'm baffled that someone would charge this much for water. (This review is for the 11.15-ounce size of Fiji Water.)

And, just like fresh-squeezed juice, there's no water, sugar, or preservatives added, only 100 percent pure premium pasteurized juice<br />Uses fruits grown right in the US<br />All our fruits are grown by US farmers in Florida, and Florida only!<br /><br />And Amazon's Product Description for the Bluebird Unsweetened Pineapple Juice was listed as...<br />Florida's Natural Growers was organized in 1933 by growers who had a personal interest in bringing the best possible citrus products to the market. Today, we are one of the largest Florida citrus cooperatives of growers, with a membership base of 13 grower associations. The entire cooperative is made up of more than 1,000 grower-members who own more than 50,000 acres of fine citrus groves in the heart of central Florida. We own the land, and we personally nurture the fruit until it reaches peak ripeness. Because we process and package everything ourselves, we can guarantee the quality of our citrus juices. Citrus growing is a time-honored tradition in central Florida, one that has been passed down through generations. Our grower families came together through Florida's Natural Growers to ensure that the knowledge and lands our grandfathers passed down to us continue to thrive and to cultivate the juiciest, best tasting oranges you can get anywhere in the world. As a grower-owned operation, we believe it's important to know exactly where your family's food and drinks come from. Our Florida's Natural� Brand Premium juices are made and packaged right here in the U.S. so every time you pour a glass, you can be sure that it's always fresh and never imported.<br /><br />NONE OF THAT IS CORRECT!!!!<br /><br />What I received was...<br /><br />Pineapple Juice From Concentrate (this is listed directly on the front of the Bluebird Pineapple Juice can)<br /><br />The ingredients, which were clearly listed on the Bluebird Pineapple Juice can are: Water, Concentrated Pineapple Juice, Ascorbic Acid<br /><br />Concentrate from Costa Rica - this is what was stamped on the bottom of the Bluebird Pineapple Juice can.

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: This is a really great product. One really cool thing about it is that didn't look anything like dog food...there were actual pieces of identifiable chicken and vegetables. Both my dogs LOVED it and my cat even stole some! I usually buy my pets all natural organic foods, such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands are VERY expensive and PetSmart doesn't carry Halo brand. I'm really big on only giving my pets foods that have decent ingredients. Wellness, Halo and Blue Buffalo all have all ingredients that I would eat. Sadly, times are tough and this product was SLIGHTLY less expensive. The ingredients are all great, the first 3 ingredients are vegetable broth, chicken and vegetables and not just by-products or corn meal. So, I gladly bought this instead. It must be a VERY palatable food, they really loved it and snarfed it quiet quickly. The only negative comment I have about this product isn't really about the brand, just the fact that it is wet food as apposed to kibble. Wet food should only be fed to senior dogs without teeth or VERY sparingly as a treat to healthy dogs, as it can cause them to become dogs without teeth.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: I like almost everything about this product, so I'll start with the positives. Firstly, the packaging is pretty, even the can and the salt/pepper packets. It's a good size if you're not super duper hungry - it's the exact size I prefer my lunches to be. It's also a good size for a late-night snack. It tastes GREAT. Seriously, it's weird that something with so few ingredients could have this much flavor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fat and calories for this product make it something I can't enjoy very often. I imagine a lot of the fat comes from the olive oil, which does taste lovely but is too much for me. For one very small serving you get 5g of fat and 170 calories. You're likely to eat the entire thing as it's quite small, so that's 10g of fat and 340 calories which is just too much for this amount of food.<br /><br />But - if you're not concerned about that, I say try it...you'll probably love it.

review/summary: Good meal - If you spiff it up
review/text: I confess. I am not a vegetarian. However I purchased these to consider bringing on a trip as a self-contained meal.<br /><br />First of all - This comes in a can just bit bigger than a tuna can, with a peel-off cover. It includes salt, pepper, and a spork. The meal says it has "2 servings." However, in most cases (unless you are sharing with a friend) you will eat both servings yourself.<br /><br />For the entire can, the food values are:<br />Fat 10g<br />Sodium 720 mg<br />Carbs 52g (Fiber 14g - Sugars 4g)<br />Protein 10g<br />Total Calories 340<br /><br />I tried this first as an "on the go" meal taking just a few bites out of the room-temperature can. I wasn't thrilled.<br /><br />So I emptied the can into a bowl and added an ounce of shredded cheese and a small piece of leftover chicken breast (cut up). I ate it with a small pack of Cheez-its and really did enjoy it as a meal.<br /><br />While I don't recommend this as an "eat out of the can meal," I do think it has possibilities as a side dish. So, 3 stars.

The flavor isn't too strong in any sense, so it may not be a taste that everyone likes but I have to say that I love it.  The packet of sauce adds some nice flavor to it, but I usually eat it without adding the sauce.  Also, the convenience of this is wonderful, it comes with a spork and doesn't need refrigeration.  My local grocery store sells these for around $3.85 each, so the price on Amazon is great!

review/summary: Pretty filling for lunchtime...
review/text: The whole wheat tastes somewhat like couscous and is pretty filling alone but i would definitely add something to it like grilled chicken or something. I added a slice of cheese and microwaved it to make a sorta cheesy whole wheat dish, which brought a lot of flavor to the otherwise bland product (but I still recommend it). You can add diced onions, some salt and pepper and this can make either a tasty side dish or a light meal. The 2 problems i have with this product is the sauce that comes with it which is absolutely disgusting. Its made of vinegar, pineapple and some other gross stuff that do not go well together so i did not use this. My other problem is the can is not microwavable (so it says on the carton, although I did not try it myself). Otherwise I really like and recommend this product and would definitely buy it again.

Although strikingly reminiscent of a faintly familiar British game piece, each one is a marvelous triumph in texture with a rich coating of caramel and soft chocolate filling that pairs well with the crunch of a petite hazelnut in the center.

review/summary: A Gum that Cleans your Teeth like Brushing them!
review/text: I have never had a gum leave my mouth feeling so clean.  It's like "you brushed your teeth" feeling.  I hate the fact that almost all other gums now have aspertame that turns toxic when stored in a hot place (I don't know how it got to the store?!), so I would buy it even if it wasn't for the other best benefit of this gum - cavity prevention.  You have to take 3 or 4 pieces at a time to get the "clinical-tested" amount of xylitol to stop the bacteria that causes gum disease and tooth decay; but it's well worth the improved dental health... and the bacteria-killing effect is proven to work months and months even after you stop taking it.  EXCELLENT CINNAMON FLAVOR!

My dentist strongly recomended i chew it 5 times a day (I am pregnant and apparantly 3rd trimester your teeth bacteria determines the babies future teeth health).  I could not have asked for more!

review/summary: Tea. Earl Grey. Hot!
review/text: Ok--one of us at home loves Earl Grey tea and the other...not so much. I tried a box of this tea, knowing that the Yorkshire blend is a very strong, tannic and solid tea, good with milk and and not for those who insist on dainty china cups of scalding, almost-colorless hot water. This Earl Grey combined the heartiness of the regular Yorkshire breakfast type tea with the scent of bergamot. Neither overpowers the other. The Earl Grey disdainer was impressed. A good cup of tea, still hearty but nice in the afternoon. If you like your tea on the bolder side, this is a great blend. Not subtle, but not overscented and flowery either. We like it.

review/summary: Very fine Earl Grey
review/text: I love Taylors' Yorkshire line of tea. One of my very favorite morning brews is Yorkshire Gold - the ultimate example of English black tea, so I was excited to try the Earl Grey. Lighter on the Bergamot than super-premium teas, I still liked it a lot and will continue to buy it at this fair price. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I was spoiled by the Earl Grey from Mighty Leaf. However, Mighty Leaf is about 3 times the price; for my money, I would rather drink Yorkshire's EG as my afternoon cuppa. My final score is 4.5 stars. Try it.

It really tastes more like a fair-to-middling black tea with a tiny hint of bergamot. Don't expect it to have a nice strong Earl Grey taste.

No, but like others have said for the price it is a great tea and well worth your money. Taylors of Harrogate make great tea and this is another fine example.

review/summary: Fits in Our Diabetic Diet if I Tweak the Recipe
review/text: Both my husband and I come from a strong family history of type 2 diabetes. He was diagnosed 10 years ago and I was diagnosed a little over a month ago.<br /><br />When I made this pudding mix with skim milk, it spiked my husband's blood sugar so for a long time, we haven't had it. My husband has quite the sweet tooth and since he is very active and a normal weight, I decided to try making it with heavy cream instead. Skim milk has approximately 11.9 grams of carbs per cup and you need 2 cups to make this recipe. That's just too many carbs for us. Plus I know my husband and there's just no way he's going to limit himself to a half cup serving.<br /><br />The heavy cream I buy has no carbs. Instead of 2 cups of milk I replace it with half heavy whipping cream and half water and cook as directed on the package. It sets up just fine. My husband loves it and even when he eats half of it at a time, it doesn't spike his blood sugar. It hasn't affected his weight or his cholesterol levels either. I make it about twice a week or so.<br /><br />The downside: Adding heavy cream adds LOTS of calories to this pudding so if you are someone who has to watch fat/calories then this wouldn't work for you. I don't eat it because I only just got my blood sugar down to normal levels and I have more weight to lose so for now I'm leaving it out of my diet plan.

Whipped cream not necessary, pudding still tastes great.  Sorry that it is so much chemical additives etc., but when I went low-sugar a few years ago, I gave in to the alternative sweeteners.  This product is more difficult to find in stores so buying a case from Amazon was my way of stocking up.

review/text: I heard that this is hard to find and I did look at a couple major grocery stores in the area and no luck. So I broke down and got 24 (uhhg) on Amazon. Less than a buck a box and free shipping though. Just wondered, why is the vanilla version 6 bucks more for a 24 pack. Crazy but got that too. Just cooked my first batch and it reminded me of Mom's meals at home back in the 70s. Yeah they had instant back then but Mom liked it warm and I think she thought it tasted more "natural." But eating warm pudding does bring back memories. And now that I am nearly 48 I am glad I can have this low cal version. I like to eat something sweet at night (well all the time!)so this will help me stay on that pre-summer friggin diet!

review/summary: a gluten free blunder
review/text: Typically I find that Enjoy Life products surprise me with how good they are- especially considering they avoid the ten most common allergens in their ingredients.  I want to like this product, but it just just does not stand up to the superior taste quality I have found in other products I have enjoyed from this company.  The box advertises a "NEW crunchier taste!" and, sans the "er", the claim would be an outright lie.  The product is not remotley crunchy, however, the texture is not wholly unpleasant, though it is visually unappealing.  The cinnamon taste is what made this product unpalatable; it is very overpowering and after eating only a few pieces creates an oil like coating on the tongue, that is not at all quick to dissipate. The cinnamon taste is less akin to that of an oatmeal cookie, and more like the taste of cinnamon oil in an inexpensive candy.  Sorry Enjoy Life this one's just not for me.

review/summary: LOVE this in Yogurt!
review/text: I agree that this granola is not as yummy when eaten like cereal BUT this granola has become a staple in my yogurt eating :).  I have used it in regular yogurt or coconut milk yogurt and it gives it crunch and extra flavor.  I love crunch in my yogurt and this doesn't get soggy fast.  I also really like the chewy raisins.  I am not a big fan of raisins but the raisins in this mix are drier and chewier than regular raisins and I really like them.

review/summary: Good Gluten Free Granola
review/text: Enjoy Life Cinnamon Crunch Granola is pretty good.  It did have a strong cinnamon taste though.<br />I don't like raisins, so I didn't really care for them being in this granola.  It's a bit hard to chew,<br />but it's pretty good considering that it is gluten free and free from common allergens.  Yummy!

review/summary: Great granola! Incorrection nutrition information on Amazon
review/text: This is a great gluten-free granola. I enjoy it with yogurt and fruit and with soy milk and fruit. I am excited to try making a gluten-free fruit crisp with it. I was dissapointed that the nutrition information on Amazon's site was inaccurate. There is less fiber and more sugar in the product than listed. However, I will still continue to purchase this delicious granola. My husband and son who don't have to follow a restrictive diet also enjoy it.

review/summary: This is the BEST.
review/text: Whoever gave this a bad review must have been eating something else!  This is the BEST g-free cereal I have had to date!  It tastes JUST like regular granola, and it's crunchy and cinnamon-y and delicious!  I just had a bowl, cold, with soy milk and it was fantastic.  The granola did not get soggy, and I liked the chewy texture with the raisins.  I actually had to go and re-check the bag to make sure I wasn't eating something with gluten!  There is NO way the bad reviews on here were trying the same thing.  I am VERY picky about my foods.  This stuff is fantastic.  I bought my bag recently at a King Soopers while on vacation.  I just came on Amazon to see if they sold it, and they do!  I am so excited, I will definitely be purchasing this regularly.

review/summary: A pleasant surprise!
review/text: We just got some sample packets of this cereal in another product.  We put it in a bowl with some Rice Dream on it and let it sit after taking the initial taste.  First bite before soaking was OK.  Good taste but a little too hard.  After soaking it was great!  I grew up on Quaker 100% natural, but have been on a celiac diet for the past ten years.  Aside from one other cereal that I really like, I think this one is a real winner.<br />Other great things about it are the fact that it contains no corn.  The reason I like this is that I believe corn to be a major allergen that typically flies under the radar.  Kudos to "Enjoy Life" products!

review/summary: Best GF cereal I've found
review/text: I love the cinnamon crunch cereal; I eat it out of hand, with coconut milk and with Greek Yogurt for meals; I toss a half cup with a scant quarter cup of GF chocolate chips and have trail mix on the go. I don't care for berries in general, so I've not tried that flavor - but I buy this by the case.<br /><br />It is quite crunchy to me - not at all crisp, though, or wimpy - it's a harder, heavier crunch than many cereals advertised as crunchy; and I was taken by surprise the first time I had some, but was immediately won over.

review/text: Obviously opinions vary on this, but I eat Enjoy life granola daily.  I don't understand the comments about it not being crunchy, unless perhaps people have had outdated bags. I appreciate Enjoy Life being dairy, soy and corn free as well as gluten free, as I can't have any of these.  The Cranapple flavor is the best--I mix it with Erehwon Gluten-free brown rice cereal and use vanilla rice milk.  Since opinions differ so on this product, if you're on a gluten-free diet you should try it.

review/summary: Good but with caveats
review/text: Your satisfaction with this product will depend on how you eat it. This is not the kind of cereal you pour into a bowl, add milk and eat immediately. Unfortunately, the cereal is very hard; I would not call it crunchy, it's just plain hard.<br /><br />There are two ways around this. I customarily pour this cereal on top of plain yogurt, add milk and let it sit in the fridge overnight. By morning, the cereal is soft but not soggy. Of course it's not crunchy/crispy either but when you eat gluten-free you tolerate a lot. Alternatively, you can add milk or water to the cereal and heat it in the microwave. It's actually good this way, like a form of oatmeal.<br /><br />I don't mind the flavor, but again, I've been eating gluten-free for 3 years and know not to expect too much. I do like the fact that a serving provides 5 grams of fiber (more challenging to get on a gluten-free diet) and is fortified with vitamins and minerals.

It's a flavor our local<br />stores often don't stock, so we order it by the 24-pack so it's always on hand.

review/text: First off, it does have the right texture of instant pudding. The pudding is super straightforward to make. You just whisk it into a couple cups of milk, less if you like thicker pudding. In 2 minutes it starts to set up into pudding.<br />For sugar free, this one was okay. But the fake sugar taste was very easily detected, and it did not taste remotely like white chocolate! It had a very odd flavor that tasted exactly like some other food item I've had before.<br />Stick to other flavors. This one is just not good tasting at all.

review/summary: Over-ripe bananas
review/text: Jack Daniels Old No7 is a Tennesee Whiskey - bourbon, basically. It has smooth caramel/toffee undernotes and a hint of woodsmoke. However, to my (rather untutored) palate, the dominant and most distinctive flavour is one of over-ripe bananas. The flavour is very familiar but I just couldn't put my finger on it for a long time, but when I did it was almost shocking. Nearly rotten bananas, but without the cloying sweetness.<br /><br />JD is, therefore, very much like a good single malt - the tastes and aromas can be almost overpowering and are very much an acquired taste. Whereas a single malt benefits from a dash of water, however, JD really needs ice to temper the strength of the sensations it leaves on the tongue (although I prefer to drink it neat, like any halfway decent whiskey).<br /><br />Anyone who mixes this with Coke should be taken out and shot.

review/summary: Fantastic!!!
review/text: I've tried all seven of these flavors and LOVE them.  This assortment is full of surprises for me.<br /><br />Surprise #1:  I didn't care for the bacon.  I love all things bacon, but this one just didn't quite do it for me.<br /><br />Surprises #2 & #3:  The Chipotle and Thai Chili are indescribably delicious.  They both had wonderful savory flavors.  They had a little heat to them, but not painful at all.  They were just simply delicious.<br /><br />Surprise #4:  The Habenero is also very flavorful.  I tried one by itself at first, because I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.  It had a good flavor and a nice kick.  It wasn't as extreme as I'd feared.  Just be careful though, because jelly beans naturally stick to your teeth and gums.  These beans are too hot to loiter in your mouth like that.  You're much better off chewing, swallowing, and then cleaning them out of your teeth.  As far as the heat goes though, I ate a handful of five of these and they were pretty comfortable.  I wouldn't want to eat more than that, because that's not a good way to enjoy them.<br /><br />The Wasabi is also really good.  I really like the taste of wasabi, so this was a great treat.  It's not too hot, just a good flavor.  If it's too extreme for you, then eat two or three and add another flavor like Himalayan Sea Salt.<br /><br />I also love ginger, so this flavor was a great one for me too.<br /><br />This assortment really surprised me.  I expected these flavors to be too extreme to enjoy, almost to the point of being more of a gag gift.  Not true.  These are very tasty and they make a great snack.  Just keep your hands off my Chipotle beans, because I called dibs on 'em.

review/summary: For adults only!
review/text: David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans are by far the best jelly beans I have ever eaten.  They are noticeably fresher and slightly softer in texture in comparison to other tiny jelly beans.  However, it is definitely the taste that really sets them apart.  It is not possible to absent-mindedly eat these while reading or watching television because the intense, natural flavors demand your full attention.  Think of them as flavor delivery vehicles.<br /><br />I was fortunate to receive a sampler pack that included the all twenty different flavors currently available.  However, I was most looking forward to the spicy hot ones that are included only in the Man Mix and they didn't let me down:  they are a treat.<br /><br />The habanero beans have a clean, fresh habanero flavor, not a generic pepper taste, with the expected amount of heat and just a little fruitiness.<br /><br />The chipotle jelly beans have a beautiful reddish color and that lingering smoky taste that is found only in chipotle peppers, with a moderate heat.<br /><br />The Thai chili has a similar level of spiciness and a flavor true to the small whole chilies served as a condiment in Thai restaurants.<br /><br />The unique wasabi flavor really develops as the jelly bean is chewed until your tongue is so happy it won't sit still.  If you like to munch on wasabi peas, try these.<br /><br />Then there are three flavors included in the Man Mix that are also included in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a>.<br /><br />The Himalayan sea salt jelly bean is instantly recognizable because of the distinctive mineral flavor.  I was impressed that they are not unpleasantly salty.  How did they do that?  It must have been difficult to get this one right but I like the results.  These are also good as a palate cleanser after some of the more intense flavors or with the pepper-flavored ones.<br /><br />The bacon jelly bean reminds me more of cured country ham than bacon, with roughly equal notes of pork, salt, smoke, and sweet.  I don't eat much meat and at first I didn't particularly care for their intensity, similar to ham base, but when I started combining them with half of a pepper- or wasabi-flavored bean, I enjoyed them much more and was very sorry when they were all gone.  They are also good with half of a black cherry jelly bean.<br /><br />The ginger ones have a very explosive flavor much like crystallized ginger but without the chewy fibers.  These are also good in a triple combination with the bacon and wasabi flavors.<br /><br />This is not just a novelty selection of candy with unique savory flavors, these are really great jelly beans.  I am keeping my fingers crossed that David's Signature Beyond Gourmet will come up with other distinctive flavors such as bhut jolokia and rocoto peppers, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, black peppercorn, dill pickle, crab spice, and curry!

She hasn't learned the pincher grasp with her fingers yet so she can't feed herself cheerios but she sure loves to hold sticks of food in her hands. I try everything my baby eats and when I first tasted these, they reminded me of Cheetos. The cheddar flavor is very evident. Some pieces are small -- some even too short for her to hold -- looks like sizes vary slightly. She hasn't had any choking issues with these since they melt in your mouth fairly quickly. Sodium value is also fairly decent.

review/text: These will be great for my daughter when she's over a year old or so, but at 11 months, she is not quite ready for something this large and crunchy.  They don't dissolve easily like the Gerber lil crunchies or puffs and I had to dig a whole wagon wheel out of her mouth so she wouldn't choke because she put the whole thing in there and it just sat there without dissolving, even using her teeth and gums to try to mash them.  They are about the size of a quarter so I tried cutting them up into cheerio size pieces but they still just sit on her tongue and don't dissolve and she has a hard time swallowing even the smaller pieces.  I bought a bunch in bulk so I will save them for when she's a little older.  I just wanted other parents to be careful what ages these wagon wheels are fed to.

review/text: My toddler loves these. Once open you have to finish them within a week or so or they absorb moisture and loose their freshness.

review/summary: good tasty treat
review/text: My 11 month old daughter loves these. Not only is the taste great, the texture is really soothing to her gums. She does prefer the Garden Tomato flavor over this one, but she'd rather have these than other teething biscuits. Would definitely recommend both flavors.

review/summary: My 9 month loves these!
review/text: I like the veggie dip and the garden tomato flavors best but I think my little one would eat any of them.  He loved the puffs and now the crunchies.  They are a perfect size for getting him to feed himself but they can get messy.  Even when they get stale, he loves them.  It's a good snack for him and definitely a little overpriced, but Amazon has them cheaper than any store in my area. And I'm as a first time mom, I'm a sucker for any baby related foods that seem healthier than what my nephews are eating.

review/summary: Son's favorite snack!
review/text: I started him off on the Puffs, since I was a little afraid of the Crunchies because they looked so big. But he actually has a lot easier time with these. They seem to dissolve a little better than the Puffs, and since they are bigger he can manipulate them better. He either holds them while he noms on one end (they dissolve fast), or he's able to push it around in his mouth well enough that he doesn't gag. The Puffs tend to go to the back of his tongue and he often coughs and gags on them. They are nutritious, and there may be better snacks out there but for right now these are awesome.
