review/summary: So it's not a cocktail mix?
review/text: Once we figured out this isn't intended for mixed drinks, the Boy took it to school to serve at a party. The 9th graders generally liked the tart/sweet combination--"surprisingly unique."  But a couple did note the "chemically" or "articifial" aftertaste that you tend to get with all these sugar free drinks.

review/summary: My favorite Mocktails flavor
review/text: Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini<br />The Appletini has a taste and smell reminiscent of the green apple Jolly Rancher candy, but not as sweet. It tastes almost like a real apple martini, except it isn't dry of course. Out of the three different Crystal Light mocktails I have sampled (Mojito, Margarita, and Appletini), the Appletini is my favorite followed by Margarita, and then Mojito.<br />Each packet is mixed with approximately 2 quarts of water, and it mixes very easily. The liquid pours out in clear green color, and was a perfect complement with my meals or even by itself.<br />Overall: 5/5 stars

review/summary: A Taste Sensation!
review/text: You may recall that I first tried the Margarita. I absolutely hated it! Took one sip and threw the entire container out!<br /><br />Next I tried the Margarita. And I was in love with that! So refreshing and delicious!<br /><br />But I was totally unprepared for the delicious treat in the flavor of the Appletini! Definitely my all time favorite flavor [next to the Pink Grapefruit!]  that Crystal Light has ever come out with!<br /><br />Light apple flavor, although the color says lemon-lime Kool-Aid straight from your childhood days! LOL<br /><br />Again, each canister comes with 5 flavor pouches, and each pouch makes 2-quarts. So, this is a big bargain when compared with diet sodas! Only 5-calores per 8-ounce glass, and no carbs or sodium!<br /><br />I highly reccommend this taste sensation! And for a little summer sizzle, serve this in your best martini glasses for an extra treat! You're going to love it!

review/summary: good, but mojito flavor is better....
review/text: I think these new Mocktails are clever...a low calorie (5 calories per 8 oz serving) taste of some of your favorite drinks sans the alcohol (but who says you can't jazz them up yourself?).  I've tried two of the flavors, Mojito, which was my favorite and the Appletini flavor.  Both I liked, but the apple one didn't have the green apple bite I had expected, so I might make that one with a little less water to pump up the flavor a tad.  The color was just one notch down from day-glo....quite bright, which I hadn't expected, but that was ok with me.<br /><br />Overall, I would buy the mojito one for sure, and might purchase the appletini flavor.  Each container has five packets, that each make up 2 quarts of drink mix.  A nice thing to make up if you are trying to get your liquids in but aren't keen on drinking a lot of sugary and calorie laden sodas.

review/summary: Crystal Light Apple Cider!
review/text: Well the good news is that Crystal Light Mocktails are low in calories and sodium as well as being gluten free. The bad news is that a cocktail without the alcohol is like a party without the music. There just isn't any fun. Granted you could ADD alcohol to the product but that's not really the point is it? I mixed up Crystal Light Appletini and the first thing that hits you is the color. Vibrant lime green. Visually pleasing sure enough, but drinks this color are usually targeted toward teenage boys. As for the taste? One of my friends described it as Granny Smith apple juice. I myself think it tastes like apple cider with a hint of Jolly Ranchers green apple. The price is pretty steep, although to be fair each packet in the container can make two quarts so that's something. The packaging is eye-catching and I can see it drawing in customers on aesthetics alone. This product isn't for everyone but I'm sure ladies in their early 20's will love it.

review/summary: A great, lighter Appletini alternative
review/text: Have you looked at the ingredients on Appletini mixers?  One of the main ingredients is High Fructose Corn Syrup.  UGH.  Crystal Light has now come out with one of their famous 5-calorie (no HFCS) versions.  It tastes similar to bar-made or HFCS-made appletinis, but has a lighter, less syrupy taste and feel.  I really enjoyed tasting a decent appletini without thinking about how many calories or HFCS were in the intake.  Yes, it has chemical sweeteners in it, but isn't that what HFCS is, too?<br /><br />There are a couple of downsides to these new "Mocktails."  First: the packets in the container force you to make an entire pitcher of mocktail mix.  That's great for a party, but for two, you have plenty of leftover.  We're just keeping the rest in the refrigerator for other nights.  Second:  Crystal Light doesn't put any instructions on the label for adding alcohol to their mixers.  I guess they don't want to encourage alcoholic drinking?  But are people really buying these just for the "taste" of alcoholic drinks?  Methinks not.  So we just added a couple of shots of vodka to a shaker, ice, and filled the rest with the mocktail.  That seemed (and tasted) about right.<br /><br />I think Crystal Light's new mocktails are a welcome addition to the HFCS-laden mixers out there.

review/summary: Lacks some kick
review/text: Of the three Crystal Light Mocktails, I was excited about this one but it turned out to be my least favorite.  The flavor was so weak so I probably would recommend adding more just to give it some life.  The best thing about these mocktails is that they are so low in calories (5 per 8 fl.oz.), low in sodium, and gluten-free.  A canister yields ten quarts but right now, the product is a bit on the pricey side.  If you are craving an adult version of Kool-Aid, this is not for you because the flavors are very subtle.  But at least it won't turn your tongue blue.

review/summary: An amazing flavored drink that looks neon green.
review/text: Crystal Light has really stepped it up in there "flavor department" with these new cocktail inspired beverages.  The flavor in question is "Appletini" and is mocked from the cocktail found in a bar and/or restaurant, hence their term "mocktails".  Crystal Light has three of these flavors on the shelf right now; Appletini, Mojito and Margarita.  The Mojito is crisp and clean, very good.  I haven't tried the Margarita, yet.  As for the Appletini....<br /><br />This flavor is wonderful; it is vivid, juicy, sweet and even a bit sour.  Another review in this forum claimed that this tasted a lot like an apple Jolly Rancher, in many ways I would have to agree.  This is really a nice break from the traditional flavors Crystal Light (or even Kool-Aid) has to offer.  How many times can strawberry, fruit punch, lemonade and grape be dressed up?<br /><br />There are five packets in the container, each making 64ozs (8 cups).  Once this drink is mixed it is almost a neon green color, reminding me of Hi-C's "Etco Cooler". I don't know if anyone else remembers that drink, it was inspired by Ghostbusters and Slimer was the mascot.<br /><br />I digress; this is a wonderful drink, with a wonderful flavor. It is low on calories and sugar free.  In addition, if someone really wanted to make this an alcoholic beverage rum or vodka could be added, since alcohol isn't included in the mix.  Who knows, maybe it will be included next time.....

review/summary: a sweet treat
review/text: I have tried the Crystal Light Mocktails in both the Mojito and Margarita variety,and loved them both, so I decided to try the third in this "limited flavor" series. As soon as I opened the packet, I could smell the sweet apple scent. It smelled just like a Jolly Rancher green apple candy. Yummy! I thought it might be a bitlike a  sour apple flavor, but I was wrong. Instead it was just the opposite, very sweet. In fact, the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of five is because out of the 3 flavors, I felt this was the only one I could taste a bit of the artificial sweetener. I know this is  used to keep it 5 calories and it isn't really too bad.  Other than that, it was perfect. Sweet, refreshing appletini flavor.<br /> When I made up my first pitcher of them, I decided to try a something different. Instead of taking water directly from my tap,or a gallon jug, I used individual bottles of water. It took 4 bottles to fill up a  2 quart pitcher, which is the serving size for each packet of The Crystal Light Appletini mix.  After mixing in the Appletini mix, I made sure it was well blended. Then I poured the mixture back into each individual bottle, making sure to blend it in between pours, so each serving would be evenly flavored. Now I had four perfect servings to take with me anywhere. Great for work instead of plain old bottled water. I have to say this was a great idea for Crystal Light and wish that they would introduce some more mocktails and not just for a limited time.

review/summary: A Tasty Adult Drink Without the Alcohol!
review/text: I am so glad that someone finally came out for an adult drink mix with flavors for adults! I enjoy the regular Crystal Light drink mixes but they have that over powering kid flavor. I am not always in the mood for a full flavored kid drink.<br /><br />The canister has 5 packets that each make a 2 quart pitcher of appletini. If you are not familiar with Crystal Light , it is sugar free and low sodium. There are 5 calories in each 8 ounce serving. The packets come in a nice plastic container which keeps them dry and fresh until you are ready to use them.<br /><br />The Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini has a bright neon green color which at first had me thinking it would be another kid flavored drink. It smells like those wonderful Sour Apple Jolly Rancher candies I ate as a child. I was expecting an overpowering sour apple drink. What I was pleasantly surprised with was a nice, smooth apple drink that is mild but very tasty! It has a nice light taste that is pleasant and refreshing. I like that they are a low calorie option that tastes great!<br /><br />I can't say if this taste like a real appletini, as I am not a drinker and have never had one. I can say that this is a nice change of pace from the usual Crystal Light flavors. I would definitely buy this again and will be trying the other flavors as well. This will be a wonderful addition to parties for those who do not drink alcohol but want an adult flavored beverage! This flavor will also be finding a place in my every day pantry. I really enjoyed it!

review/summary: Crisp Green Apple
review/text: This new drink mix by Crystal Light could be called Green Apple instead of Appletini, because that is exactly what it tastes like.  I enjoyed it.  It is light and crisp tasting, a bit tart and sweet.  There is a slight aftertaste because of the artificial sweetener.  But it is only slight, and that is how they can make this drink only 5 calories per serving.  There isn't any type of alcohol flavor in this drink, even though it is called a mocktail.  So if you like the taste of crisp green apples, you will likely enjoy this drink.

review/text: I like appletini's and this matches the flavor quite nicely.  It does have quite a chemically after taste if it's not very,  very cold.  I drank my first glass when I had just made it wrinkled my nose,  it was far too sweet and had a weird/strong after taste.  But I put it in the fridge anyways,  and cold with ice,  it's a nice drink.  I dilute it more than the maker recommends,  I use half their drink and half sparkling mineral water.  It's a refreshing change from ice tea and lemonade and though our first taste was through Amazon vine,  we will buy it again which is proof that it does work for us.

review/text: These have an appealing, sparkling-apple taste but the flourescent green color is a little offputting.  They seem to pack quite a phenylalanine punch:  I'm mildly sensitive to it and after my first couple of glasses, my hands were numb and my head was pounding.  If I wanted a hangover, I'd drink the real thing!  But if you aren't bothered by aspartame, this is a nice change from the usual anemic peach tea and lemonade flavors.

review/text: I am always wary of flavoured drink mixes because sometimes the flavouring leaves a lot to be desired, but the Appletini Flavored Drink Mix by Crystal Light is cooling, refreshing and provides relief on these hot summer days. The flavour is crisp, light and almost makes you feel like you are sitting at a tiki bar sipping a cool Appletini. The only thing missing is the vodka but adventurous types can add that with no problem.<br /><br />Crystal Light's Appletini Flavored Drink mix is guilt free as it is only 5 calories per serving, 90% fewer calories than other similar brands. The canister comes in a 1.69 oz. (48g) size containing 5 flavor packets which makes 2 quarts per packet. The pre-measured packets insure quick, easy, accurate and delicious Appletinis as swiftly as you can add 8 cups of water. No muss, no fuss, just a refreshing drink to quench the thirst of children and adults alike.<br /><br />So beat the summer heat with a cool, crisp Appletini. One sip is all it will take to jump on the Crystal Light Appletini bandwagon.

Not exactly like an appletini on its own either (you know, since it doesn't actually have any alcohol), but mixed with a shot of vodka and you've got yourself a good refreshing diet cocktail.  Also, it's more affordable than the diet cocktail mixers you'd find in the liquor store.<br /><br />BTW, it doesn't taste like a true green apple so if you're expecting that, sorry.  (But green apple Jolly Rancher?  Yes.)  And if you don't like sugar-free products or think they have a weird taste, or only like all-natural products, this probably isn't for you.  I've consumed Splenda and diet soda and Crystal Light for years and I'm used to it, so take that into consideration with this review.  =)

review/summary: Great sugar free drink
review/text: This is a great product that I love! While it doesn't taste exactly like an apple-tini of course, for what it is it's very tasty and very low in calories, so how great is that?  I made some of this for my gal pals and they really liked it as well.  It's a very refreshing and light drink.  I thought the flavor was very strong made by the directions but I find if I add a bit more water it's just right! I will definitely purchase this item again!

review/summary: not the most natural tasting
review/text: I'm always looking to stay hydrated during the day and before workouts.  Drinking plain water can become quite dull and to keep it interesting, I tried these Crystal Light Mocktail in Appletini.  The bright green color makes it look like the name but taste-wise it seems a bit artificial.  A bit of an aftertaste kept me from really enjoying the flavor as much as I thought I would.  These might work better mixed with seltzer but with the plain water I don't think I would try these again.

It's not bad when diluted with some ice sitting out on the porch in the summer, but I can see getting sick of it pretty quickly.  If you really like appletinis, but don't want the alcohol then this might be worth it for you, but I don't think I'd buy it again.

review/summary: The Crystal Light flavor list continues to grow!
review/text: My wife and I love Crystal Light and we drink some every day.  We like that they have a broad selection of flavors and you can switch around between them to keep yourself from getting tired of the same old taste.  We just recently purchased some of their new Mocktail flavors to try.<br /><br />This one is an Appletini flavor.  We don't drink Appletinis so we have nothing to compare it too but it is not bad.  My first impression was that the flavor was a little weak when compared to the other Crystal Light products.  We had just made the mix with cool water and had it with lunch.  The next day it was much colder out of the refrigerator and the flavor was much better.<br /><br />We like Crystal Light because it contains no sugar and caffeine which we both need to reduce in our diets.  This product does have 5 calories per 8 ounce serving but that is very low and not an issue for us. Each packet makes 2 quarts and each tube contains 5 packets.  That means this four pack will make 10 gallons of drink.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars as it is a good product but not necessarily my favorite flavor but, I would drink it again!

review/summary: Heh, Mocktails!  nice name!
review/text: Heh, Mocktails.  Flavor without the alcohol.  If only Crystal Light offered a recommended alcohol to spike into their Mocktail, I'd probably give this 5 stars!  Anyway, on to the review.<br /><br />Each container comes with 5 packets of powder, each making 2 quarts of drinks.  Perfect for the picture during late spring or summer.  The fact that this is not sugar-based has the added benefit of you being able to mix this very easily, even cold.  With most of these types of packets (I also buy a lot of the Crystal Light individual drink packets, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ53K6">Crystal Light On The Go Peach Tea, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>), I mix the powder with a small amount of hot or warm water, then fill it to the final volume with a combination of ice and water, to get an instantly ice-cold drink!<br /><br />I'm not an Appletini person, so I can't tell you how real this is.  The flavor is overall nice, and I think that if someone avoiding the sugar may naturally want to avoid the alcohol as well, so overall, this isn't a bad idea.  Personally, though, I'd probably add a shot of vodka or rum to each drink to give it the added ... flavor.  Final thought, if this is a bit too strong for you, feel free to dilute it by mixing it into 2.5 quarts of water instead of 2 quarts per packet, or filling it into a glass with ice.<br /><br />Overall, recommended.

review/summary: Crystal Light is Great
review/text: Well, I can't really write an extensive review because, either you'll like this or you won't. I like most of the crystal light flavors (this one included) and what I appreciate the most is that they are flavorful with 0 calories. If you're the type who is trying to be healthier and drink more fluids, but really don't want to just drink water, the various crystal light products are something to look into. For this one, keep in mind, it's a Mocktail. Non-alcoholic (although I guess you could mix alcohol with it if you wanted to). I've never had an alcoholic Appletini so I can't really compare. I just thought this one tasted good. It tastes kind of like a liquid form of a hard candy, a bit on the sweet side so if you have sensitive taste buds, you may have an issue. I like that so I was fine with it. I doubt this is a replacement for an alcoholic beverage but I'll leave that for others to compare.

However, I just didn't like the taste of the appletini flavor as much as other Crystal Light Flavors.  Now, I will say that I've never had an an alcoholic Appletini, but always wanted to try one.  That is why I bought this.  It could be that I wouldn't like a regular Appletini either.  So, perhaps people that have had them and like them, would like this. I think also if you lie those hard candies that are apple flavored, you would like this.  It taseted similar to me.

review/summary: SO Good!
review/text: "Oh my God, this is so good," was the very first thought that came to mind as I took my first sip.  I honestly expected something ho-hum and too terribly sweet or tart.  Boy was I surprised!<br /><br />The directions say to mix a packet with 2 quarts of water.  I used an empty 1 quart Gatorade bottle and shook up the mixture to make my drink, so I got half the amount of recommended water.  Needless to say I thought the especially concentrated drink was going to be too sweet (I don't like syrupy sweet things) but this was anything but!  I poured the drink over a full cup of ice (maybe that helped dilute) and this drink is incredibly refreshing.  It tastes very much like an apple flavored Jolly Rancher.  My favorite part about this drink: 5 calories.  No carbs!<br /><br />The only thing that takes me a little aback is the very bright green color.  It reminds me of "ectoplasm" kool-aid from the years when Ghostbusters was popular!<br /><br />The kids love this drink, too!

review/text: I've been a Crystal Light drinker for ages, a particular fool for their Raspberry Ice products (though Fruit Punch makes the rotation once in a while, and it doesn't take much to talk me into other flavors). In theory, I loved what they did with this new grouping of flavors from the moment I saw them. I decided that I had to test them myself, and selected the Appletini variety.<br /><br />I hate to make the comparison to another product, but the similarity is uncanny. The smell and taste of the Crystal Light Appletini threw me directly back to my childhood. If you've ever spent too much time sucking on an apple Jolly Rancher, you will know what I mean! I will certainly be moving onto other varieties, now that I've been so happily enchanted with this one.

It's the right color (although I bet it's artificial in all versions of the mix) and the perfect flavor.<br /><br />I'm getting some for Christmas stocking stuffers for my family members who are into cocktails but also always watching their calories.<br /><br />I haven't figured out if their calorie comparisons are related to alcohol free vs w/ alcohol but I *think* it must be compared to the full sugar versions of the mixer because otherwise it wouldn't make sense.<br /><br />If you or a friend like appletinis this is a perfect item!

review/text: Let me put in a few qualifiers first. For one thing, I was drinking this at double strength, over ice, with vodka. I found that if you do make it the full on diluted version, it's got an off-putting taste that I can't put my finger on. However, at double strength, you can happily mix it with cocktails or blend it with ice to make a slushy, and you're in good shape. Unlike the margarita mix from the same brand, which has none of the tartness or flavour that you'd get from a margarita, this particular mix tastes almost exactly like an appletini.

review/text: I tried both the Margarita and Appletini flavors.  Neither of them was particularly strong-flavored.<br /><br />The Margarita, for me, had an odd coconut aftertaste at first.  Not unpleasant, just strange.  The more I drank, the less I noticed it, and my husband said he did not notice it at all.  When I set the glass down and didn't drink for a while, there it was again.<br /><br />The Appletini tasted like apples.  No surprise there.  My first impression was that the flavor was weak, but the more I drank, the more I tasted the, somewhat artificial, apple flavor.  Not bad, but not memorable either.<br /><br />Will I buy these again?  I would say no, although my husband said he'd possibly give the Margarita one a try again in the summertime.  For me, I'll stick with the standard lemonade flavor Crystal Light.  It's more intense than either of these.

review/text: Unfortunately, the product description doesn't specify the ingredients of this.  Most sugar-free water enhancers contain aspartame, which I am highly allergic to.  I decided to take a chance, but was out of luck.  The Appletini flavor is excellent - and tastes very similar to a green apple Jolly Rancher (or even Apple Pucker). I loved it.  The product comes in packets, as a powder, designed to make 2 quarts.  So, this isn't a travel-friendly size but is good for home use.<br /><br />Too bad they didn't just use sucralose.  If aspartame doesn't bother you, I highly recommend these.  For me, I'll just stick with Mio and hope they offer a green apple flavor sometime in the future.

review/text: I am a long-time fan of Crystal Light drink mixes, so I was excited to try this. I thought it was a wonderful drink. I wouldn't say it tastes like a martini though.. to a family member, I described it as "sour green apple punch." It's very tangy and refreshing, and very easy to make. I think it would be a good beverage for the summer, but the apple also puts me in mind of the fall. I would definitely recommend this, and I would also buy it again in the future.

review/summary: apples and cystal-tini
review/text: I never  used to be a big fan of Crystal lite, however the New "Appletini" flavor has a bit of the sweet and tart that I am fond of, and turns the recognizable  Appletini green  when water is added.  I found that by adding a splash of ginger ale gave it more of a zing for those of us who crave a bit of effervescence.<br /><br />In case you like your Crystal less "lite"  you can add a dash of traditional vodka to make a quick and easy drink for those  drop-in guests or if you are like me and have zero bartending skills.<br /><br />I also like the fact that it comes in individual tubes and you can use the entire  packet to make a quart pitcher (which in my opinion is too weak) or use a smaller amount to make a glass. It is quite refreshing in a sour apple kind of way and I would buy it.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Product for Those that are Looking
review/text: Anytime I see a product trying to imitate another product, I'm sceptical.  I've tried Crystal Light many times and in may flavors, but honestly this does taste like appletini mix.  Personally I'm not a big fan of appletini's, but my girlfriend likes them.  I think it has a strong flavor for being low calorie.  Personally I liked the margariti flavor better, but that's just a preference.  Both were very full of flavor and worth the cost.  I will probably not buy these as much, but my girlfriend most likely will.  Either way, it impressed me.

review/text: This has become a new favorite in our family. I have been telling everyone about these crystal light mocktails. The mojito is my personal favorite. The appletini has a green apple like taste. I imagine that it tastes very much like an appletini might taste. It has a nice light refreshing flavor. My children and my husband have completely enjoyed this flavor. I will be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Refreshing, with or without alcohol.
review/text: As with other Crystal Light products, this powdered drink mix is potent (one packet makes a half-gallon), super low-calorie, pleasantly flavored/colored (a light green color, which is weird since the packaging is magenta), and quick to dissolve.<br /><br />These packets are a great way to whip up a bunch of appletini refreshment -- which can either be a refreshing alternative to lemonade, or a quick-and-easy cocktail mix for parties. I'm a guy, so Appletini isn't my favorite drink, but I did find it refreshing and keep some mixed up as an alternative to ice water when I want a little more flavor.<br /><br />Crystal Light, as with other artificially flavored drink mixes, actually balances out the alcohol flavor in mixed drinks; this Appletini mix is no exception. I find that the artificial sweeteners like Aspartame actually cut down alcohol more effectively than plain old sugar. This stuff mixes well with Vodka or white Rum.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite stuff to drink, but it does make a refreshing low-calorie alternative to other popular mixed drink flavors.

review/text: I love Crystal Light. LOVE it.  However, the crystal Light Mocktails Appletini flavored drink tastes awful to me. Either that or my taste buds are protesting the fact that there is no alcohol involved in any part of this drink!<br /><br />This product is simple, quick, and easy to mix.  The taste just wasn't for me and probably tons of people will like the taste. I am just not one of them.<br /><br />Natalie S. for Amazon Vine

review/summary: Confused. This doesn't taste enough like the Appletinis I've had to have the same name...
review/text: When I first heard of Crystal Light's Mocktails line of flavors, I wasn't quite sure what to think. Are these intended as low-calorie hard drink mixers? Are you just supposed to drink the flavored waters made with these powders, and have that serve as your drink, minus the alcohol? The limited information on the back of the containers didn't help, although I suppose Crystal Light might not feel comfortable endorsing alcohol consumption...<br /><br />Either way, THIS particular flavor of Crystal Light's Mocktails line didn't help things. Granted, I haven't had many Appletinis, but comparing what this powder mixed up to the proper Appletini I tried at Carrabba's recently left me still scratching my head. This mix didn't make anything even close to what I tasted at the restaurant. The apple flavor wasn't all that "fresh" tasting, nor was it terribly strong or potently "apple-y", which I think would've improved this mix, had that been the case. It also didn't taste sweet enough, going by what my Appletini-loving friend said of the perfect Appletini. He described the perfect Appletini as tasting like a liquid jolly rancher with a kick. Alcohol or not (not, in the case of my mixture of this powder and water), this mix just, again, confused me. There wasn't enough apple taste to it, and I wasn't sure what else they were aiming for. Either way, they missed. If their Appletini doesn't even really taste like apple, should it even be called Appletini? If a tree falls in the woods, and no one's there to hear it...<br /><br />Crystal Light got a dead-on hit with their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> flavor. Appletini, however, is a total miss. Better luck next time...

I realize I'm not being very helpful, but I'm at a loss for something to compare Appletini to!

review/text: I preferred Red Bull before I discovered Blue Sky, and it also contains glucuronolactone, which most other energy drinks don't have and that seems to be the difference in how well Red Bull and Blue Sky work for me.  This tastes much better than Red Bull, although I wish it were not quite as sweet (but they all taste too sweet to me).<br /><br />The 16 oz can is more than I want in one serving, but the price is so much better that I just put half in a bottle for later. If I do drink the whole thing, I'm not jittery like I would be if I drank more than one Red Bull without several hours in between.  Perhaps it has less caffeine, but still gives me a nice lift.  I like the "juiced" version also.

review/summary: Unlike the bright green ones, no industrial waste by-products
review/text: We love these and buy them regularly despite the occasional hard one, because they are the only ones we've found that my wife won't have a chemical reaction to.<br /><br />The bright green color in the other brands comes from tartrazine (yellow 5), a chemical by-product of coal tar. It's been shown to increase irritability and other effects of ADD in some people (like my wife), and in others, actually causes serious allegric reactions. That's why other colors can be listed generically as "artificial color" in some products, but yellow 5 always must be listed explicitly.<br /><br />So, that pale "more like yellow" color one of the reviewers complained about is...well, that's the color of actual food - dried peas with wasabi on them. The bright green that seems so attractive on the other brands is someone's industrial waste disposal problem that they've lobbied to keep legal and convinced you to pay for the privilege of eating and feeding to your kids.<br /><br />I don't want to sound like a health nut, I eat lost of junky food. But after 20 years of undiagnosed ADD, my wife was finally advised to stay away from this color, and in the 10 years since, life is Better with a capital B. Her mood swings, anger and irritability that came from raging ADD symptoms are a memory. (One that comes back with a vengance every few years when she forgets to check the label on some food that doesn't seem remotely like it would have artificial yellow.)<br /><br />Do you know anyone who is perpetually irritated? Do your kids sometimes get way out of control? Well, that could be a million things. Really. But I know from first hand experience as well as research that yellow 5 is among the possible causes, and if you take a look at the labels on your food in your pantry, you'll see they've been feeding you this your whole life without your knowledge.<br /><br />If you'd like to see if yellow 5 is having an effect on you or your kids, try ditching all that stuff for a few weeks. And if you'd like a great crunchy spicy snack while you're doing it, munch on some of these - they're great!

I like this product much better:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5YTS">Hapi Hot Wasabi Peas, 9.9-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)</a>, however they are more expensive.  I can find the Hapi brand at my local HEB, and I think I saw some at WalMart.  I don't think I will buy the Roland Feng Shui brand again.  I will finish up the bag and find something else somewhere.  I like the price, though, especially for such a big bag, and I have no complaints about the flavor.  Regarding the color, why should I care if they are green or yellow?  I just assumed that the ones that are really green in color are made that way with food coloring.

review/summary: Good peas
review/text: I just rec'd my 5lb bag.  The packaging survived the trip to Afghanistan - so no worries there.  The plastic packaging is sturdy and has a zip lock style seal across the top.  Now the peas!  I am a big fan of Hapi brand but was tired of paying the premium price.  I began my search for a reasonably priced veggie that packed a wasabi punch.  I found them on the first try.  Since I know Hapi best, I will make the comparison 1) Price:  Feng Shui is cheaper; 2) Taste: Hapi peas are a little sweeter and the wasabi is a tiny bit more mild that FS.  FS peas pack a bigger crunch - not tooth breaking crunch - more like a half popped popcorn kernel crunch.  Some of the FS peas have a huge wasabi punch.  In fact, I just ate one that brought a tear to my eye and prompted me to write this review.  3) Appearance: Hapi looks a little more appealing - but I am not sure that is a good thing.  How does a roasted or fried pea retain that neon color?  FS looks more natural and may be healthier.  Look at the nutritional information/ingredients for yourself.  The only real concern I have is that FS is a product of China.

review/text: We had been buying Trader Joe's Wasabi Peas, but decided to give Roland Feng Shui a try since the reviews were decent and the price was cheaper.  We don't like them at all.<br /><br />Another reviewer made reference to "the occasional hard one".  Maybe we got a bad batch because almost the entire 5 lbs have been much too hard for our liking.  We like good crunch, but this is ridiculous!  I'm talking about the watch-out-or-you're-gonna-break-a-tooth kind of hard!<br /><br />Another thing we don't like is the level of wasabi heat.  It's very inconsistent.  Much of it is okay, some are too hot, and some are take-the-top-of-your-head-off HOT!!!<br /><br />We will be going back to Trader Joe's for our wasabi peas.  They may be more expensive, but they are SO much better.  Consistent level of crunch, even heat, and MUCH better flavor!

review/text: While I realize there are costs to importing a product, this is way too much.  When in Costa Rica, I paid $2.00 a bottle for 280ml bottle retail in a tourist trap area, and was told later that I had paid too much at that.  This is a wonderful Salsa, but this is far to much money for it.

review/summary: A taste of Costa Rica
review/text: This "salsa" is used like catsup in Costa Rica...but better! It is made of different vegetables, and has a tang without heat. It is the key to some dishes, like the ubiquitous black beans and rice (Gallo Pinto). I was thrilled to find it available from Amazon. If only that was true of the cashew fruit wine...<br />  Use it in traditional dishes, on eggs, sandwiches, in soups...it is very versatile and delicious! Enjoy, and, as they say in Costa Rica, Pura Vida!

review/summary: Great stuff, but wow - quite pricey!
review/text: Just came back from Costa Rica and have to say that this stuff usually makes rice and beans and/or eggs, etc. outstandingly better. Brought back several containers of it as souvenirs for friends, better than a postcard (anyone who's experienced the Costa Rican postal service knows that anything you mail from there probably won't make it to the states anyhow).<br /><br />I was hoping to find an affordable way to replenish my own stock when the two 700ml bottles I purchased there ($5.00 each nearly anywhere) run out - they're more popular around my household than I had anticipated. But I can't understand how the prices in the states can be about five times what these sell for in the supermarket down there. It's good stuff - but not THAT good. I'll bring a second suitcase next time, but ketchup will have to do after my stash runs out...<br /><br />It's made by Unilever, a giant multinational. Odd that they don't assertively market it in the 'states because it is a tasty sauce.

review/summary: Best Earl Grey Tea
review/text: I have tried many types of Earl Grey tea and this is my family's favorite. I just wish there wasn't so much waste ,it comes in tins and unfortunately they are not recycable. I wish companies would stop packaging products with so much waste that has to go in the landfills.

review/summary: Not a premium taste as indicated in other reviews
review/text: The tea is OK, similar to Lipton kind you'd get in a grocery store.<br />I was expecting something really special but this is not. Bergamot flavor is barely noticeable. The tea quality is below medium. Not impressed. I wish I bought one pack, not 6. Not sure what I am going to do with all of it.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I LOVE LOVE LOVE this brand of Earl Grey! I've wasted money trying other brands and it doesn't compare to Bentley's. It's difficult finding this particular brand and have only found it at Ross Stores, but it's a hit or miss. At least with Amazon, it's a guarantee! This product has an amazing flavor that has become very addicting. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Black Tea Refresh
review/text: I look forward to my Earl Grey tune-up twice daily. An important ritual in my life affords me a wonderful pick-me-up. The aroma when I open the tin entices me to boil water and prepare the brew. Now that winter is here tea time really is enjoyable as I watch snow flakes fall and feel warmed by my cup of brew.<br />Nothing feels quite like this time during the day.

review/summary: I'm a convert
review/text: I've never liked teas or coffees. I have no idea where I got this tin of Earl Grey, but one day I decided to crack it open and give hot tea one more chance. I was astounded. The flavor packs an incredible punch, unlike most the bland teas people have offered me before. In the past month I've become so accustomed to drinking a cup every day that when I went on holiday I tried out Starbucks for the first time to get my Earl Grey fix...it was bland and tasteless in comparison! I cannot wait to try the pomegranate and ceylon that I got as well.<br /><br />Suggested:<br />2 sugars<br />splash of milk

review/summary: Best of the Best
review/text: I love earl grey tea.  I've tried most brands that are available.  This by far is the very best.  It has an excellent flavor, and it leaves no bitter after taste like other teas do.  This is the first time I have tried Bentley's tea.<br /><br />The one negative is, I love this tea so much, I drink more tea.  Another reviewer complained about the canisters and a waste.  I have 4 empties now and I am planning on using them to put grease into.  I like the way the canisters keep the tea so fresh.<br /><br />Yes I am on auto delivery, I'm drinking so much I'm at a delivery once a month.  I hope you will love it as much as I do.

review/summary: IF YOU EAT THIS, IT WILL SEEM LIKE YOU'RE PART OF MY FAMILY
review/text: My great-grandmother made it, my grandmother made it, my mother made it, and now I make it! (I hope my daughters will make it and this chain will never end, connecting one generation to the next through food.)<br /><br /> It is perfect for Thanksgiving.<br /><br />Here's the best recipe that is NOT printed on the packaging:<br />Pour the corn into a big saucepan. Pour milk over the corn (my mother uses whole milk, I use skim. No one can taste the difference.). Cover the pan and put it in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, put it on the stove and add butter (a stick for about three bags of corn. A third of a stick for a single bag, etc.) Add salt, pepper and about a quarter cup of sugar (for three bags of corn). Put the heat on low and stir every now and then for HOURS. Seriously. HOURS. Like, maybe, four hours. Or six hours if you want. It doesn't matter, you just let it stew,  making your whole kitchen smell like family and warmth and happiness and love. Add more milk every now and then when it gets too dry. Add more sugar every now and then, just a bit. Add more salt and pepper before you serve it. It should be the consistency of thick oatmeal. Not runny at all. You can eat it with a fork. It will make you happy. It will make you somehow, through the strangeness of the internet, connected to my family. I'll be happy knowing there are other people out there eating my great-grandmother's recipe.<br />Happy Holidays!

review/text: This product makes special oocasions and Holidays come to life. It brings back Childhood happy memories. I've been having Cope's Dried Corn for Holidays since forever. It makes our family complete for special dinners even if everyone can't be there. It is easy to prepare and so good to eat. I have not found another product to compete with Cope's Dried Corn, it's the BEST.
