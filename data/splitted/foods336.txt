review/summary: Not the best chocolate but still quite good
review/text: Though I like the organic idea I do not like that much organic food suffers in taste.  So it is very pleasant that this chocolate is available.  I would not compare it to some of my favorite premium chocolates but it is certainly as good as most of the mass market chocolate bars.  I prefer dark chocolate that is more bitter than this but I know my tastes are not the norm so most people will enjoy it more than I.  A good idea for a more healthy treat.

review/summary: Bland Dark Chocolate Flavor; All Profits Go To Charity
review/text: The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar offers a 2.25 ounces of smooth but unimpressive dark chocolate flavor.  It's of medium taste quality, in my opinion, like it's missing something.<br /><br />Packaged in a small brown and black wrapper, this candy bar is created using 54% cocoa, which has proven to be beneficial for cardiovascular well-being, reducing your risks of blood clots, heart attacks and strokes.  On the downside, this bar contains 330 calories, which compared to a regular candy bar without healthy cocoa ingredients, is a high fat content.  When compared to other bars packed with healthier cocoa, the Newman's Own Organics dark chocolate bar does compare in that regard.<br /><br />Newman's Own gives all of it's profits to charity, and the company motto is "Shameless Exploitation in Pursuit of the Common Good."  They are a company that does the right thing and sets the standard by which other companies should follow.<br /><br />Just for the chocolate, I'd probably pass.  But if I have to have chocolate, and I do have to have it, I'd choose Newman's Own Organics over another brand that doesn't use good business practices and donate their profits to charity; right up there with supporting mom and pop stores and shopping local grocers instead of buying at the nearest big-box super center.<br /><br />So it's not just a chocolate bar.  It's a chocolate bar that pays it forward.

review/summary: Too restrained for dark chocolate lovers
review/text: This is a fairly high quality confection.  The flavor is smooth, round, and fruity, almost raisin-y.  However, I am a dark chocolate lover, and dark chocolate lovers won't be seduced by refinement alone.<br /><br />So I consulted my spouse, a light/milk chocolate lover, and we both agree that while tasty, Newman's Own Organics dark lacks that subtle, almost spicy bitterness that brings out the complexity and assertive flavors of chocolate at varying cacao levels.  Now obviously 54% cacao isn't going to register on the palate like 70%, 75% or 90% cacao, but there can still be that "snap" to chocolate, which is often compared to notes in coffee or chili pepper, even at the lower percentages.  I can still, for example, perceive that note in many grocery store brand chocolate morsels, although the overall quality of those will not match the Newman's.  By comparison, the Newman's has a waxiness that reminds me of Dove or Cadbury's.<br /><br />I will say that this is probably a safe choice for company, where a little something sweet is desired that won't be too much for less-than-diehard fans of the dark stuff.  It's agreeable; just not distinctive enough to kill for, which is pretty severe criticism where chocolate is concerned!

review/summary: The lighter side of dark chocolate
review/text: We have a bit of a dispute over these bars in my house, so I can say with some authority that they are right for some people, not for others.  At 54% cocoa, these are darker than milk chocolate but much more mild than many of the dark chocolates you can get.  I personally found them lighter than I like in a dark chocolate and a little waxy.<br /><br />On the other hand, my daughter is a huge fan of dark chocolate, and gives this the thumbs up.  If you like your dark chocolate on the light side, you may like these too.<br /><br />At 2.25 ounces, these are about the total size of a retail candy bar, and a smidgen bigger than some. They're short and wide, divided into 6 nicely stamped squares. For those into that sort of thing, they're made from organic ingredients and support Paul Newman's charitable works.

review/summary: Possibly the best dark chocolate ever
review/text: Ok, so I am a little biased. I adore the late Paul Newman, his family, his enterprise, his charity, and all of his products. But I also love me some dark chocolate! I take my chocolate tasting very seriously and wouldn't give it high marks just based on sheer good will. This is some seriously good stuff! Even though I love dark chocolate, I am not what one would call a chocoholic. I have restraint. I typically have a bar in my cupboard, then after dinner break off a piece or two. I savor it, then I leave it at that. Tonight I tried a piece of this delicious confection had to eat half the bar all at once. It was SO GOOD! What I love about it is it's creamy consistency. You usually find that in only milk chocolate, whereas dark chocolate usually has a sharp, almost bitter taste to it. You don't get any of that bitter taste in this bar at all - and yet it's a true dark chocolate. How do they do that? There are lots of subtle undertones of flavors, and it makes for an amazing dessert. And of course coming from Paul Newman, it's heaven sent.<br /><br />Bonus too that they took such great care in choosing the best fair-trade organic chocolate. That's a big deal because if you look at most commercial chocolate sources, it makes the diamond industry look tame. This makes Newman's Organic a truly guilt-free delight. Enjoy!

review/summary: Great, but even darker might be better for my taste
review/text: Very goo bar but a little sweet for my taste... I like my chocolate even darker. I compared it with similar bar from Trader Joe's with the same 54% cocoa, although the Trader Joe's bar is a huge one pounder. The Newman's bar was slightly smoother, perhaps just a little more waxy and sweeter. Big plus for Newman's Own is that it is organic and rainforest alliance certified.  Next, I'll need to move up to the next level of dark from Newman's Own. Maybe that will be the perfect bar for me. I know I like the Trader Joe's 70% bar better than this one but the darker version of Newman's Own might be even better.

review/summary: Too sweet for me
review/text: For those wanting dark chocolate, this simply is going to do the trick.  It's 54% cocoa solids and really quite sweet.  In terms of texture, it's a bit grainier than average.  It's not shiny, but kind of matte, and melts pretty reasonably.<br /><br />Each 2.25 oz (64g) bar has six large-ish squares, making portion control a little challenging.<br /><br />In terms of flavor, this definitely earns a solid three stars.  It's really not bad at all, like a very reasonable cocoa.  It's so sweet that it tastes a little like a really high end milk chocolate at first, with a good finish for a milk chocolate.  All in all, for a dark chocolate this is better than Dove (less "smooth" because it's grainier, but definitely a better finish), but can't hold a candle to a good high end dark chocolate like Lindt.<br /><br />In terms of organic chocolates, Green & Black makes a darker, smoother, better finishing chocolate, and the bars are bigger, too.

review/text: This was a really nice flavored dark chocolate.  My family of five each tried and enjoyed it, even my teenage son who doesn't normally enjoy dark chocolate.  As a family we agreed that it is really good chocolate.  However if Hershey's Dark Chocolate is cheaper, we would still by the Hershey's as we all agreed its very comparable in taste.  That said, if organic is something you are looking for in your chocolate, you can't go wrong with Newman's Organic Chocolate Bar.

review/summary: Medium-dark, not bitter, somewhat creamy
review/text: I happily accepted a review bar as I am a fan of Newman's Own chocolate, usually buying the orange flavored version of this bar <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHSQYU">Newman's Own Organics Orange Dark Chocolate Bar, 3.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>.  (All Newman bars are available in both 2.25 oz and 3.25 oz sizes.)<br /><br />With only 54% cocoa, this bar is not particularly dark tasting, for people who are extra-dark chocolate fans.  To my taste, it is somewhat sweet (not bitter) and almost creamy.  For those wanting a darker chocolate, Newman's does have a 70% cocoa bar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHSQRM">Newman's Own Organics Super Dark (70%) Chocolate Bar, 3.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I prefer this bar (and its various-flavored versions) to the higher cocoa content bars as an everyday treat that I can have a bit of here and there and enjoy a silky chocolate flavor and yet not feel over-caffeinated afterwards.

I love dark chocolate, and Newman's 54% cocoa is an excellent balance between sweet and bitter.  The melt point is just right for eating.

review/summary: Creamy, Tasty, but Not Too Chocolaty
review/text: This chocolate is very creamy and delicious either raw or melted. It is only 54% cacao, which is either very good or not so good, depending on your preferences.<br /><br />My wife and I love dark chocolate, and try to make our chocolate desserts (such as brownies, ganache, mousse, and chocolate buttercream frosting) as chocolaty as possible. This chocolate might not have enough punch for us, compared to the<br />Ghirardelli 60% and 70% cacao (bittersweet) chocolate that we usually buy. This chocolate is not as intensely chocolaty as either of those, and is sweeter and more creamy. I enjoy milk chocolate (which has much less cacao than dark chocolate) more than my wife does, and liked this chocolate more than she did.<br /><br />This is a very good start if you are just getting into dark chocolate, though, or are already sure of what cacao level you prefer.

review/summary: Excellent Creamy Taste
review/text: I honestly wasn't sure what to expect with Newman's Own Organic Dark Chocolate.  I happen to love dark Chocolate but realize it is for some an acquired taste.  Also, the term "organic" can sometimes mean something more natural but less satisfying either because of a harsher flavor or a strange texture.  Neither is a concern here.  This chocolate is not only satisfying for a dark chocolate lover like me but its rich creamy texture makes it an excellent choice for a quality chocolate for those who normally find dark chocoalates too strong.  This is not a quick fix bar to gobble down at lunch or on the run but one to savor with an after dinner beverage.  For a first entry into the chocolate market, I think they have a winner!

review/text: I am not a chocolate connoisseur, but I've tasted enough varieties to know some of the differences. I like dark chocolate but still prefer it to retain some sweetness, which can be a tricky balance. (Ever try 95% dark cocoa chocolate? It's like paying $5 to eat a stick of chalk.)<br /><br />This chocolate bar is labeled as 54% cocoa, which is an interesting choice. It has a nice aroma, and the color is somewhere between milk chocolate and one of those European dark chocolate bars. Most importantly, it tastes great. There is a smooth consistency, and it has a really nice blend of sweetness and bitterness. I shared the bar with a couple of other folks, who had the same impression. We give it 3 thumbs up.

review/summary: Yummy... but smaller than you average chocolate bar
review/text: I found this chocolate bar to be truly delicious.  It has a perfectly respectable ingredient list.. all organics, essentially evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin and vanilla, all USDA organic certified).  The cocoa is listed as "Rainforest alliance certified."<br /><br />The chocolate is only 54% cocoa, so it is not bitter or overwhelming like some dark chocolate.  This would be a nice bar for someone wanting to make the move from milk chocolate, but not liking the super-high-cocoa-content bars.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this bar is smaller than most that I see on the market.  I though that was just the angle of the photo and didn't think much about it, but it actually is smaller.  It comes with scores for 6 square pieces that are a bit larger than I might otherwise give myself, although even with that, I'll admit that I planned to eat one piece and ate two instead!  The chocolate is creamy, and nicely satisfying.  Probably not the bar for a super-serious-chocolate lover, but a nice quality bar for someone wanting to support organics and find something a bit nicer than average, but widely likeable.

It's rich and creamy without that bitter aftertaste I associate with so much dark chocolate. It's not exactly melt in your mouth but neither is it extremely hard and crunchy. It has a nice texture and I found it very pleasant.<br /><br />It is rich so I don't think I could eat the whole bar at once. I wish it was breakable in smaller chocolate squares - as it did not break off evenly for me. I love organic products and chose to buy them whenever I can and money allows. Everything is better with chocolate!

review/summary: has what I want from a chocolate bar
review/text: While I'm not a chocoholic, what I want out of a chocolate bar is the following: It doesn't give me a migraine (I got my first migraine ever after eating a Dove Bar in the 80's, and I've eaten chocolate from chocolate bars that have been followed by migraines); it's delicious; I feel good immediately after eating it; it's priced right. With the exception of the migraines, this is all subjective, and whether or not consuming a certain food will result in someone getting a migraine is obviously unique to the individual.<br /><br />Chocolate prices have been rising lately (I'm writing this on Feb. 23, 2011), due to a 12% rise in the price of cocoa coming from the Ivory Coast, which is the largest producer of cocoa beans in the world. Other than that the chocolate for Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bars are from cocoa grown on Rainforest Alliance Certified farms, I do not know which country these farms are located in, but I imagine that the rise in the wholesale price of cocoa beans affects the entire retail market for chocolate. Non-gourmet chocolate bars are presently priced at under a dollar per ounce retail (e.g., 38 cents an ounce for one type and size Hershey's Dark Chocolate bar, 58 cents an ounce for Lindt), while one type and size of a gourmet Godiva Dark Chocolate bar sells at present for $1.58 an ounce. It looks like the Newman bars are selling for around $1.44 an ounce (I say "looks like" because the retail price depends on the size of each bar, how many are in a pack, etc., etc.). So for gourmet chocolate, that's an acceptable price, IMO.<br /><br />I received one 2.25 ounce bar to sample for review purposes and I found that I could only eat two of the six squares the bar is scored into at one time (and per day) before I felt sated on chocolate. Chocolate and dark chocolate in particular may or may not have some health benefits (you know the drill, what's supposed to be good for us is constantly changing), but I buy dark chocolate bars and eat them one or two squares at a time (per day) because I enjoy eating a little chocolate and in case there really are health benefits. Given my fairly modest chocolate consuming habits, I think I can afford Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bars, and so they meet all of my standards for what I want out of a chocolate bar. The taste is quite rich and that suits me fine, as it means that for me, a little bit goes a long way.

According to the package, the ingredients are Organic Dark Chocolate (Organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lechtin and organic vanilla). The cocoa is "Rainforest Alliance Certified" organic, which the Newman's Own Organics has been associated with for years.<br /><br />Another thing that's nice about Newman's Own chocolate is that the company backs its claim that their cocoa beans come from farms and plantations that do not mistreat their workers or engage is slave-labor practices.

review/text: I am a HUGE fanatic of dark chocolate. I was excited to try Newman's organic dark chocolate. It's 54% cocoa, which should put it somewhere between not too sweet but not too bitter. It's a small size bar (2.25 oz), and 330 calories. Frankly, if it was larger, I'd feel much guiltier eating it!<br /><br />The chocolate is not very sweet, but not bitter. Actually, it really doesn't have much flavor at all, which was surprising. Compare this to a Dove Dark Chocolate, and the difference is very obvious. Dove is creamy with deep flavor. The Newman's is dry, almost chalky consistency without much flavor at all.<br /><br />Overall I was pretty disappointed in this chocolate. I love that it's organic - just wish it was tastier.

review/summary: Not My Cup of Tea... Err, Bar of Chocolate.
review/text: I used to hate dark chocolate. I didn't care for its dryer texture or bitter taste. Then I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and chocolate pretty much became a no-no. Through careful experimentation though, I discovered I could occasionally enjoy a square of dark chocolate with higher cacao percentages because they have less sugar. I began to appreciate the flavor of chocolate without the milky sweetness and have since been a big fan.<br /><br />Keeping that in mind I'm always trying new brands and blends in search of the perfect dark chocolate bar. Unfortunately, as much as I love Newman's Own as a company and many of their other products this chocolate was just not for me. It's too sweet and the vanilla taste came through strong. It melted into a watery consistency in my mouth and almost had an alcohol-like tang to it. Once I'd noticed that tang I checked the ingredient list and sure enough it's made with chocolate liquor which some may like but I personally don't care for when I reach for dark chocolate.<br /><br />At only 54% cocoa this is pretty low on the spectrum of darker chocolates and with it's texture would be a great introduction to dark chocolate for someone who doesn't like it usually. It kind of reminded me of an oversweetened version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RBRY0Y">Lindt Lindor Truffles Dark Chocolate, 60-Count Box</a>'s centers. If you like organic and fairtrade chocolate this is certainly not a bad place to start but I would recommend trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFWQR6">Theo Classic Organic (70% Cacao) Dark Chocolate, 3-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> (or any other Theo chocolate bars which are my FAVORITE Organic and Fair trade chocolate products) if you're looking for something similar but with a higher cocoa content.

review/summary: I love this dark chocolate
review/text: To me, dark chocolate is the only kind worth eating. I've always loved it. I'm aware that many people don't like the flavor. I really think this Newman's Own Organics dark chocolate is a great even for people who normally prefer milk chocolate. It's 54% cocoa, which truthfully is a great balance between sweet and bitter. I personally prefer even more cocoa content, up to 70%, but 54% is a good compromise for those looking for a more traditionally sweet candy bar.<br /><br />Like any dark chocolate, if you're expecting creaminess you won't find it here. The chocolate is hard and not easy to break into squares. That's just the way dark chocolate is. But the texture is great - very consistent. Its flavorful and the 2.25 ounce bar is a perfect size if you're looking to indulge.<br /><br />Newman's Own makes generally fantastic products, pretty much everything I have tried - from their perfect Italian salad dressing, to their crisp pretzels, to this dark chocolate bar - is awesome. They use quality ingredients. And with the millions of dollars they've donated to charities, it's a way to support good causes.

review/summary: Nothing special
review/text: Maybe it is because this chocolate only contains 54 % cocoa (vs. let's say the 70 % Lindt) but I found the taste disappointing. This might be premium chocolate, and it might be organic and Rainforest Alliance-certified. But the flavor still is surprisingly bland and cheap - a tad too sweet and creamy, with a bit of a waxy texture in too thick a bar. This is just a run-of-the-mill dark chocolate and nothing to entice the palate with.

review/summary: An American Chocolate to be Proud Of
review/text: I wasn't expecting much when I bit into this bar, because I'm usually disappointed by American chocolates. Not here. This lovely chocolate has super creamy mouth feel, great dark reddish brown color and most importantly, a clean, classic chocolate taste. Compared with with other premium brands of comparable cocoa content, this bar is a little sweeter and is less bitter.<br /><br />It is important to me that Newman's Own sources chocolate grown on Rainforest Alliance Certified farms, another reason I can feel good about buying this chocolate in the future, which I will. Recommended.

review/summary: OK - but not a favorite
review/text: This 54% dark organic chocolate by Newman's Own is passable.  It is very dry, as are the higher percent dark chocolates, but not as flavorful as others, such as the Lindt or Godiva brands.  Although I enjoy many Newman products, I would not buy this chocolate, I enjoy either of the other brands much more.

review/text: Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate (54%) comes in a 2.25 oz bar that packs a great chocolate taste with a hint of orange in the undertone. It is creamy and very satisfying for those moments, minutes, hours, days when nothing but chocolate will satisfy your craving.  Really good quality.  The 2.25 ox bar contains 330 calories, 200 of which come from fat.  While this sounds dreadful, one square of the bar was so satisfying, I was able to leave the rest for another day.

review/summary: This is what I like in a chocolate bar
review/text: This dark chocolate bar is 54% cacao, with a solid chocolate taste--not overly sweet as some bars are, but not at all bitter. The chocolate melts nicely in the mouth without the waxy texture that some cheaper bars have. While the nutrition label lists this bar as one serving, for me it is two generous servings at 2.25 ounces of flavor. It is also 330 calories (200 from fat) which also makes me want to split it into at least 2 servings or share with a friend. It is easily broken into six substantial squares, so that makes sharing easy. Half a bar is a very satisfying treat. If the price is not too hefty, this is a bar worthy of satifying a serious chocolate craving.

review/summary: Smooth and rich dark chocolate, tastes great, worth trying
review/text: I love all types of chocolate but especially dark chocolate. I would consider this to be one of the best dark chocolate bars that I have tried so far. It is very smooth and rich without a bitter aftertaste. These bars are 2.25 oz. and each has 330 calories. For the size of the bar I would consider that 330 well spent calories. The size is just enough to satisfy you without being too large and excessive.<br /><br />These chocolate bars are 100% organic. I don't buy a lot of organic products but it is nice to know that this product is 100% natural.  Each bar contains 54% cocoa which is dark but not the darkest that I have tried. My personal opinion is the darker the chocolate the better it tastes for the most part. These are definitely worth trying.

review/summary: nice dark chocolate, but too sweet for my taste
review/text: I am a lover of dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, this chocolate will disappoint true dark chocolate lovers.  Its waaaay too sweet!  Its not bad chocolate - its creamy, its rich, its got good cacao flavor, but they put too much sugar in it.  I prefer the very complex, slightly bitter, very dark (71% cacao) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JI0CK">Dove Silky Smooth Dark Chocolate</a> instead.  Also, the Newman's chocolate is broken into six relatively large 1.5 x 1.25 inch squares - IMO just a little too large to just put one square in your mouth and allow it to melt away.  The Dove is broken into 1 x 1 inch squares - the perfect size to melt on your tongue.  Even the wrapper on the Dove is better as it is true foil and easily allows you to keep the remaining chocolate wrapped up tight.  The Newman's comes in gold paper meant to look like foil, but its only paper - it does not close well.  Overall, disappointed.

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious chocolate bar
review/text: I received a sample of one Newman's dark-chocolate bar through the Vine program. I live in a part of the country where it is warm in the winter and the bar arrived slightly melted. I put it in the refrigerator to return it to a solid state--and I can imagine the shudders of chocolate connoisseurs since chocolate is not supposed to be refrigerated. It causes "blooming," a grayish discoloration of the shine on the chocolate. The chocolate actually did discolor, but that didn't matter to me personally, because I love cold chocolate bars which are crunchy to the teeth and smooth to the tongue.<br /><br />I could go into all the ways that Newman's Own is a great company (it is), the fact that the ingredients in this chocolate are organic and healthier than those in a regular chocolate bar (they are), and that there's a lot of solid research that dark chocolate is good for your health (it is), but since several other reviewers have already covered all that and done a great job, I'll stick to the main issue:<br /><br />How does it taste?<br /><br />In my opinion--and I love chocolate--this bar tastes great. And particularly great for dark chocolate. Many regular dark-chocolate bars are, for my personal preference, rather too bitter. The bitterness that is supposed to be there as an essential part of the flavor experience of dark chocolate is present in this Newman's Own bar, but not to the extent that the bar doesn't offer a sweet treat.<br /><br />As for the texture, to me it felt quite smooth as it melted on my tongue. The aftertaste is excellent. It tastes just as good as the initial bite of the candy.<br /><br />What about the price? I wrote Amazon about the price today, and they wrote back it is going to cost $25.85. The suggested retail price appears to be $35.88 for 12 bars which comes to a little under $3 per 2.25 oz. (64 gm) bar. The Amazon discounted price comes to about $2.16 per bar, which is cheaper than any other source on the Internet is currently selling it.<br /><br />How does it compare to it's conventional, U.S. competitor, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IXWBZG">Hershey's Extra Dark Chocolate Bar</a>? The Hershey's bars are larger, weighing in at 3.52 oz., and they come in a pack of 14 selling for $31 on Amazon. That's $2.21 for a larger bar. I haven't tasted that bar, but the reviewers who have claim much the same thing I am for this bar for the Hershey bar's taste, that it has great flavor with no bad aftertaste.<br /><br />In the end, since the taste is at least as good as its conventional competitor, the choice for a consumer as to whether to choose this product will probably come down to two main things: a desire to support the company selling it and/or the fact that this bar is organic and has a healthier sugar in it. As for myself, considering those two things, I would personally choose this bar.

review/summary: Fancy, creamy, and not too bitter!
review/text: Newman's is a brand that I'm used to hearing on fig bars, prunes, and other things much healthier than chocolate, so I wasn't sure how good their chocolate was going to be.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that not only was their chocolate very fancy, but it was also very smooth and not as bitter as other dark chocolates.<br /><br />The packaging, as you can see from the picture on the description page, is very ornately designed, and the bar is the same.  It is divided into sixths, and on each sixth there is an engraved N.<br /><br />The taste, which I was very surprised at, wasn't bitter like Hershey's dark chocolate tends to be, but it wasn't too sweet.  It was just the right bittersweet mixture!  Also, on top of this, it had a very creamy texture, much like milk chocolate would.<br /><br />In one 2.25 ounce bar, there are 330 calories, so I wouldn't necessarily describe this as a healthy snack, but all of the ingredients are organic, making it more nutritious than your average chocolate bar.<br /><br />Overall, it is a deliciously different type of dark chocolate bar that I recommend to all chocoholics (like me).

review/summary: Yes, you can have it all
review/text: Note: by "all" I did not mean *my* chocolate.<br /><br />Newman's own organic dark chocolate is really fine chocolate, more like that you would expect to find at a chocolatier than at a grocery store!  There are things about it which are, in my experience, fairly unique.  It is a dark chocolate with the mouth feel and texture approaching milk chocolate.  It is not chalky, bitter or grainy.  There are ways in which the texture approaches truffles. I am guessing that is  because they use cocoa butter instead of some other oil or fat, like most commmercialy available chocolates.  It is 56% dark; not as dark as some, but in my opinion it strikes a nice balance bot6h smooth and dark.<br />It is made from high quality 100% organic and Rainforest Alliance certified; good for you and the planet.  If that's not enough, Newman's own donates 100% of after tax profit to charity, a product you can feel good about no matter how you look at it!<br />I would say without reservation that htis is the best organic dark chocolate that I have had (and I have had quite a few)!<br /><br />My only real issue with it is that mine is gone and I will have to order some more.

review/summary: OK, But A Fairly Low Percentage of Cocoa Solids
review/text: I've been a fan of Green & Black's Maya Gold, Organic Dark Chocolate with Orange & Spices, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 5) for many a year, so I was delighted to be offered Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar, 3.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12) for review. (There is currently no link availble to the Pack of 12 2.25 ounce bars) I've been anxiously waiting for my package to arrive, as I had discovered a few recipes on the Newman's Own site, one of which is for a Chocolate Angel Cake that sounded just delightful - and a great way to use up some of that chocolate! Imagine my surprise when that Pack of 12 turned out to be a single 2.25 ounce bar!<br /><br />As a result, I really cannot comment on this particular product other than to say it has a nice, smooth chocolate taste, though it is fairly low in cocoa solids. Any other properties that Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate might have as a candy or confection coating or baking ingredient will remain untested. Strictly as a chocolate bar, this is one I can take or leave. Green & Black's - long involved in the organic, sustainable rainforest movement - will remain my go-to dark chocolate bar.

review/summary: Not As *Bitter* As Most Dark Chocolates!
review/text: I really like NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANIC DARK CHOCOLATE BAR. It's not as bitter as some dark chocolates like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G0MG0K">Ghirardelli Chocolate Squares Dark Chocolate 60% Cacao, 5.25-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> but that's due to the lower cocoa content, 54% vs. 60% and higher in others, so it can be a good or bad thing depending on how you like your dark chocolate to taste.<br /><br />For me, this is just right; not sweet like milk chocolate and not bitter at all! My only complaint would be that I wish the bar was scored so that the pieces would be a little bit smaller. Right now the bar is somewhat scored into six squares, but those are pretty big squares, so you have to break them in half to let it sit comfortably in your mouth and let it dissolve.<br /><br />That's really the best way to eat dark chocolate: put a small piece in your mouth and let it dissolve slowly . NEWMAN'S OWN DARK CHOCOLATE starts melting almost immediately into a chocolate cream that coats your tongue and the roof of your mouth, so that you get that wonderful taste just enough to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to those who love chocolate, but want to skip the milk chocolate and find that other dark chocolates are too bitter. NEWMAN'S OWN DARK CHOCOLATE will satisfy that craving without making you go overboard.

review/summary: Tastes Like Chocolate, Not Like "Health Food"
review/text: The dark chocolate flavor of this NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE BAR is mild, compared to dark chocolate bars manufactured by specialty candy makers (for example, See's Candies).  But the flavor is quite good, especially for a "commercial" candy bar designed for general sale in grocery stores.  Unlike many health food store "organic" products, this "organic" chocolate bar leaves no unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />The bar (approximately 2.5" x 4.5") breaks into six large snack pieces. One bar (one serving) weighs 64 grams, has 330 calories (200 fat calories), and 22 grams total fat.  There are 5 grams sodium, 37 grams carbohydrates, 4 grams fiber, 28 grams sugar, and 3 grams protein.<br /><br />The label warns that the bar is manufactured on equipment that may have been used to process other products containing peanuts, other nuts, milk powder, wheat, soy and egg (although the bar itself contains none of these).  The bar is 54% cocoa (Rainforest Alliance Certified).<br /><br />Because I'm a big fan of "Newman's Own" products, I was eager to try this offering from the "Newman's Own Organics" line.  It did not disappoint.

review/summary: Disappointing on a number of levels
review/text: My wife and I independently taste-tested this product. My wife is a regular consumer of dark chocolates while I tend to prefer milk chocolate, and/or chocolates with fillings. After trying it out, we both decided that we would not purchase this product in the future, though for different reasons. Here are our independent reviews:<br /><br />My wife: I am confused by the labeling of this product. It is called a 'dark chocolate' but has a 54% cacao content. Most dark chocolates that I buy have upwards of 65% - 75% cacao. When I first opened the package, I noticed a smoky aroma. I eat a lot of dark chocolate, including raw chocolate, but I never noticed such a smoky aroma before and found it pleasant. My first bite was disappointing. It is a bit too sweet for me, and is certainly significantly sweeter than the dark chocolates that I buy. It is smooth, which I like. While I appreciate the fact that Newman's own is producing an organic, minimally processed, chocolate I will not purchase this again.<br /><br />Me: From my first bite I knew that this chocolate was not for me. It had a distinctly waxy feel that I usually associate with inferior chocolates - this was an immediate turnoff. There was absolutely nothing distinctive about this chocolate - no fruity notes, no particular bitterness, nothing that sticks out. While this chocolate is better than a lot of what constitutes the mass market, I cannot recommend it.

review/text: I started this review process on a bad note: I was under the impression that I was destined to review "Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar, 2.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)." In fact, I received a pack of one. You can see the problem right off, particularly since I had recruited three other tasters to help me evaluate the product and then had to tell them they each only got a quarter of one bar.<br /><br />The bar is smaller than most other organic chocolate bars on the market (at least in my market), so I'm hopeful it will be a bit cheaper. (Many run from $3.50 to $4.50 apiece.) It has a somewhat lower percentage of dark chocolate than my favorite brand, as well.<br /><br />Like all of Newman's products, this is a perfectly fine product, and the charitable donation included with each purchase is always a winner.

review/summary: A great organic chocolate option - dark chocolate for people who don't like dark chocolate?
review/text: THE QUICK TAKE:  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate is a great chocolate option.  At 54% cocoa solids, it's just over the edge of dark chocolate.  So it makes a nice change for those wanting dark chocolate that isn't so dark.  And, it's sustainably and responsibly produced - making it as guilt-free as chocolate gets.  The price at Amazon varies and can be high, so you'll need to look at the current price and your other options to decide what works for you.<br /><br />TASTE AND TEXTURE:  To have a little fun, we did a taste comparison to some other chocolate we had in the house.  The Newman's Own Dark Chocolate compared well to other premium and organic chocolate we had. It's decidedly darker, less sweet and firmer than a milk chocolate, with a very nice texture both to chew and on the tongue.  And it has some really nice subtleties to the flavor.  But it's not nearly as strong as what aficionados would consider a "dark" chocolate.  So it's a good option that might just hit the (bitter)sweet spot you are looking for in chocolate.<br /><br />PRICE:  These bars are relatively expensive.  That's to be expected for a premium chocolate that's organically produced.  We're lucky enough to have a lot of options for locally for organic chocolate.  Newman's Own is an excellent product, but you will want to compare it to the other options available to you.<br /><br />PRODUCTION: There are two important aspects that make this chocolate as guilt-free as chocolate gets:<br /><br />First, organic production.  Newman's Own has one of the largest organic chocolate sourcing operations in the world, which is highly commendable.  So you and your family get great tasting chocolate without consuming other things you don't want to eat; and, you also get the knowledge that the producers are working to minimize the impact of your consumption on the places where the chocolate is grown.<br /><br />Second, responsible sourcing.  Far too few people know that most of the world's cocoa production is tainted by child labor and often forced labor - or, in plain terms, slavery.  If that's news to you, Google chocolate slavery for some eye-opening information.  Or have a look at some of the Amazon listings, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GAN1VQ">Bitter Chocolate: The Dark Side of the World's Most Seductive Sweet</a>.<br /><br />All of that is a lot to fit into a chocolate bar - but Newman's Own has done that, and more, and offers you a lot of excellent options in chocolate.  If this one doesn't suit you, there are several more on Amazon.

review/summary: Borderline Dark Chocolate
review/text: This chocolate is only 54% cocoa solids. Given that many of the better bittersweet or dark chocolates have 65-80% cocoa solids, that gives a lot of room for other ingredients, which in this case is sugar.  Although being organic, you get the high falutin sounding "evaporated cane juice", which is, of course, sugar.  Although the chocolate flavor is good, this bar is on the sweet side.  So if you are looking for something stronger or with a sharper edge, you should avoid this one.  However, if you have a sweet tooth, and want a good fruity chocolate flavor, this chocolate would be to your liking.

review/text: I'll keep it short: I like chocolate, especially good chocolate.  While this bar may be organic, with great texture (not waxy), the flavor seems to have been left out.  It's labeled "dark chocolate", which it is, but it's also very, very bland.  I ate most of the bar, just broken into pieces, trying to decide if it's something I'd use for baking.  I wouldn't.  I'm not a big fan of Ghiradelli, but I'd use their chocolate in baking before I'd use this.  If you're looking for a mild dark chocolate bar with great texture, this is for you (not as bitter as Hershey's Dark).  But if you're looking for a good, strong-flavored, dark chocolate - keep looking.

review/text: This bar is billed as 100% premium organic chocolate, actually, dark chocolate 54%.  My passion is dark chocolate.  It's 2.25 ounces totaling 330 calories, and they are absolutely delicious.  Bottom line, however, this bar tastes more like the richest, most creamy, milk chocolate bar you will ever eat versus true dark chocolate.  There is no slight to outright bitter edge characteristic of dark chocolate, yet the bar is not overly sweet.  By rights this bar should lose a star regarding the dark chocolate issue, but it's just too good overall.

review/summary: Pretty Awful.
review/text: This was pretty bad for dark chocolate or any other chocolate for that matter. The consistency was sort of like chalk, extremely crumbly and way too sweet/milky to have that great punch that dark chocolate has. I would like to say that the overwhelming sweetness was due to the lower cacao percentage that I like, this comes in at 54% where I prefer around 72% and up. But it is just way too sweet. I ended up breaking it up and making a small batch of muffins and not a soul noticed.

review/summary: Nice chocolate, is it "dark?"
review/text: Overall, this is a nice chocolate bar with the benefit of being organic and rainforest certified.  The chocolate dissolves quite smoothly and evenly - we compared it against a number of other dark chocolate bars we purchased from Trader Joe's and other places, and it dissolved more smoothly than any others.  It isn't as bitter as many other dark chocolates, and hence, it may appeal to some people who don't really like other dark chocolates.  The appearance of the bar was great - it had clean, dark surface, and there were no white blemishes or other marks that sometimes mar chocolate bars.  The bar breaks with a nice "snap," and the aroma is quite nice.  Overall, both my wife and I found the taste to be excellent.<br /><br />On the downside, the bar has fewer cocoa solids than the other cocoa bars we tasted - 54% cocoa solids.  Most of the others we sampled had 70%-80% cocoa solids - a couple were even higher.  This _could_ be important to some health-concious consumers, because many studies examining the health benefits of dark chocolate have defined "dark" to mean 65+% cocoa content.  That should be taken with a grain of salt, because some recent studies also have found merit to chocolates with lower cocoa content, but the majority of studies to date have focused on dark chocolate.<br /><br />Another possible concern related to this chocolate could be the price.  A twelve pack of bars comes in at $25,85 (possibly plus shipping); Trader Joe's has a number of bars that, although sometimes not as tasty, are certainly not as expensive.<br /><br />In sum, for taste, aroma, and presentation, this is a really good chocolate bar.  The negatives are price and a lower cocoa solid content.

review/summary: Heart Healthier and Tasty Too!
review/text: I don't usually like anything other than milk chocolate. But I do know that the benefits of dark chocolate are good, so I thought I would give this a whirl and I'm really glad I did.<br /><br />Much to my surprise I found this to be an altogether pleasant experience. This chocolate has a rich, creamy texture when allowed to melt slowly in your mouth. It also was wonderful just to down-right gobble, but I don't recommend it. (Gobbling that is) This product is just too good to gobble willy-nilly!<br /><br />It had no unpleasant bitter aftertaste that I've come to expect with certain darker chocolates. I sometimes like my chocolate to be a bit on the softer side, so I also tried the candy a tiny bit melted and found that it was even better. There is no waxy taste to this bar and it melts well, it is rich, creamy and full bodied. And I had to really restrain myself from gobbling this up in one sitting.<br /><br />I'm not one who likes European chocolates; I have a love of Hershey's and always will, so this product is right up my alley, and if I find myslef looking for something a little different...this will be it from now on.

review/text: This is nothing like the Newman's Own chocolate I've had in the past! I don't know if they are changing all their chocolate products, after trying this I hope they are!<br /><br />Usually I'm not too crazy about dark chocolate & find that even the lesser percentage dark chocolates are still too strong for my liking.  This simply is not the case with this Signature Series bar!  It melts nicely in the mouth & isn't too bitter or too sweet.  The flavor is very well balanced & very satisfying.  After the first sniff & taste I thought I'd devour the entire bar; it was so good!  However, I enjoyed about half the bar & was amazed that my chocolate craving was soothed!<br /><br />Imagine that - chocolate left for another day!<br /><br />Last, I'd like to mention the ingredients because to me they are very important.  I would like to think that if you are considering Organic Chocolate, you care about the ingredients too.<br /><br />A big problem I have with the majority of Organic chocolate is the soy lecithin.  Ever notice that it's hardly ever organic?  Soy is a huge crop & I believe something like 80% of of it is GMO!  Big time Bad!  Thankfully this bar is ALL Organic:<br />Organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin, organic vanilla.  The Cocoa butter is Rainforest Alliance Certified.<br /><br />(A few Organic chocolate bars on the market contain NO soy lecithin!  Even better!)

review/summary: Good Product, but it is merely organic, not gold.  Are we worthy?
review/text: Newman's Own Organic Dark Chocolate Bar is good if you like semi-dark and mildly sweet chocolate that is a little harder with a slightly higher melting point than that of European chocolate of similar expectations. I liked the chocolate very much but I did not find it to have any superior qualities to Hershey's chocolate. The product is sold in a pack of 12 bars but my sample from the "Vine" program consisted of only one bar. I am not sure if my opinions would have changed given a larger sample, but my confidence and enjoyment of the review would have been significantly greater by having a larger sample from which to provide a better comparison of quality and quantity with competitive products. I am certain that the people running the Vine Program at Amazon fully understand the importance of having a reasonable sample in quantity and that such quantity that reached the reviewers may have been less than what was originally planned to be a sample of sufficient size. In other words, "Who ate the chocolate?" is a question that should be investigated by an independent party and that those with chocolate remnants on their fingers and lips should no longer be allowed to participate in management of the Vine Program.<br /><br />In summary, Newman's chocolate is good, but in my opinion nothing special that could justify the cost. But, the Newman products are supposed to be of higher quality with the excess margin being used to support worthwhile causes and I have no problem with a product such as chocolate where an inflated price provides excess margins to do some good that might otherwise may not have not been done.

review/summary: Another home run for Newman's Own
review/text: I really enjoyed the (alas, all too small) sample of Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate provided to me by the Amazon Vine Program.  Make no mistake, it's a serious, rich, and elegant chocolate, perfect for those times when you want something better than the goodies on the rack next to the register at the supermarket.  But more playful adjectives, like "yummy" and "scrumptious" also came to mind while enjoying it.<br /><br />I don't eat many sweets and desserts these days, so when I do I make sure it's the good stuff.  And this complex, nuanced (yes, yes-- and yummy, too) dark chocolate certainly qualifies. With this new addition to its product line, Newman's Own continues its reputation for delicious, healthful, and environmentally responsible food products.

review/text: Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate bar is a tasty, fairly creamy chocolate bar.  One bite will satisfy your mid-afternoon chocolate craving and hopefully help you make it through the rest of the day.  Of course, any bite of chocolate around that time would probably do the same, so why choose this one?<br /><br />Its socially responsible.  The cocoa beans are grown on rainforest certified farms. From their website, "The Rainforest Alliance Certified(tm) seal guarantees that the cocoa in our Signature Series was grown on farms that meet comprehensive standards for sustainable farming, protecting soil, waterways and wildlife habitat as well as the rights and welfare of workers, their families and communities."<br /><br />Its organic.  Newman's Own is certified by Oregon Tilth.  If organic foods are important to you, Oregon Tilth certification is your guarantee that high standards have been met.<br /><br />Its simple.  Organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin, and organic vanilla.<br /><br />Its yummy.  54% cocoa means its intensely chocolatey.  There is a hint of sweetness, but it retains the bitterness dark chocolate fans like.  Not too creamy, not too dry.<br /><br />Compared to a few other dark chocolate bars, Newman's Own stands up pretty well.  I did a little taste test with the following: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001988CN4">Organic Dark Chocolate with Almonds - 3.5 oz Bar</a> was the best, but it had an unfair advantage with the addition of almond bits. It was a little creamier than Newman's Own. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016XLU4">Organic Dark Chocolate - Regular, 59% cocoa, 12 Units / 2 oz</a> was almost indistinguishable from Newman's Own. Same texture and very similar flavor, perhaps slightly more intense. Trader Joe's Fair Trade Swiss Dark chocolate had 71% cocoa so it had a drier texture.  I even tried one by Ikea, which was inexpensive and chocolatey, but actually my least favorite.  It did not appear to be fair trade or organic.<br /><br />Overall, a good solid organic fair trade dark chocolate bar.  Dark chocolate fans will like it, milk chocolate fans might be converted.

review/summary: Rich, decadent, silky, and 'feel-good' in content, origin, and manufacture.
review/text: "Silky" is the word I kept coming back to as I tried this chocolate.  It's smooth, rich, and ... well, "silky" is just the right word.  Everything about this chocolate is decadent, but also feel-good insofar as it bears the 'organic' and 'rainforest certified.'  What does this mean in a practical sense to consumers?  From the Newman's Own site: "The USDA Organic Seal assures that at least 95% of the ingredients are organically certified." and "The Rainforest Alliance Certified(tm) seal guarantees that the cocoa in our Signature Series was grown on farms that meet comprehensive standards for sustainable farming, protecting soil, waterways and wildlife habitat as well as the rights and welfare of workers, their families and communities."<br /><br />Seals and certifications don't mean much in the mouth, however, and that's where this chocolate excels.  It's rich without being excessively bitter.  Smooth without lacking depth and substance.  It's easy to eat (and that comes from someone who struggles with chocolate, at times), and it's a very accessible dark chocolate.  A very adult alternative to the over-sweet milk chocolate one might find in a more pedestrian alternative.<br /><br />I don't know how better to celebrate this product than to just list the ingredients: Organic Dark Chocolate (organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin, and organic vanilla).  This stuff is as feel-good as it is taste-good.  Can't wait to try the other varieties.

review/summary: Yum, could have used a bigger sample though
review/text: Vine sent me this to review - I LOVE chocolate, especially dark chocolate so I was quite excited.  Now if you order this product you will get a pack of 12 - I got 1 so my only option was to simply consume it.  And I enjoyed that oh so much.  It had a harder texture than your hershey's special dark, but had a very similar flavor and sweetness.  It was very very tasty.  I would have liked additional bars to try things like baking with to fill you in on things like does it melt well in chocolate chip cookies or to make chocolate covered strawberries... I will have to guess on this as I didn't have enough to do that experiment.  Due to the harder nature of the chocolate I believe it would work well in cookies but not so much on strawberries.<br /><br />I like the idea of my chocolate being organic - I like where Newman's is going with their product line... I hope that they keep the word "Organic" meaning something other than just another sales pitch tactic.<br /><br />Anyway - if I'm in the market for Dark chocolate - I would pick this up without a second thought.

When you are done with 3/4 of them, thats when you realize that there is something kind of an aftertaste/not so smooth taste about this.  I do not get this feeling when I try a Lindt or dark chocolate truffles from Central Market/Whole foods.<br /><br />Overall - they are made of pure organic ingredients - but for whatever reasons - the cocao/manufacturing ... - the taste did not go over well with me.

I was looking forward to trying this 54% chocolate bar.<br /><br />I eat a little dark chocolate daily and found this was too sweet for my taste.

Someone who is used to milk chocolate might like the Newman bar better than I did.<br /><br />As for comparing nutrition facts, all three bars use different portion sizes...so I didn't find it worth the effort.  Newman's 2.25 oz. bar is considered a single serving.  Green & Black's 3.5 oz bar is considered 2.5 servings, and Endangered Species 3 oz. bar is two servings.

review/summary: Not Calorie Worthy
review/text: I love chocolate and was really disappointed by the weak, almost non-existent chocolate taste of this bar.  Since there are no milk solids in dark chocolate, it is supposed to provide a deeper pronounced chocolate flavor.  However, this bar doesn't provide much in the way of chocolate flavor. There's no immense pleasure derived as the chocolate melts in your mouth which makes the bar not worthy of its caloric content.<br /><br />Break off a piece and hold it against the roof of your mouth and run your tongue over the bottom of it.  It feels sort of waxy, and it takes a bit of work before the chocolate flavor starts to come through, and when it does, it's nothing to really appreciate.  Flat tasting is a good way to describe this bar.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this, and I don't recommend it.

review/summary: I'm interested in the health properties of dark chocolate
review/text: After reading a number of articles on its possible health benefits, I became interested in finding a good organic dark chocolate to "take" instead of red wine (to provide polyphenols in my diet) and aspirin (for its blood-thinning properties). I appreciate the opportunity to review this 2.25-ounce 54% cocoa chocolate bar.<br /><br />One of these bars is divided into six squares. Two squares equals .75 ounces. According to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, half an ounce of dark chocolate was enough to boost antioxidant activity and reduce oxidation of LDL cholesterol. (I could not find the percentage of cocoa in the chocolate used in this study.) If these bars were divided into 8 instead 6, two sections would be closer to a half ounce serving, and this would bring the cost of a daily "medicinal" (:-Q) dose of chocolate down some. If these bars are priced comparably to the other organic chocolate bars in the Newman line, however, the .75-ounce serving of two squares will still cost less than a can of soda from a vending machine. If I'm not drinking red wine and taking aspirin, that's not going to break my bank account.<br /><br />Milk chocolate fans may not like the taste, but I like this chocolate a lot. It has just the right amount of bite in the finish without being bitter, and it melts slowly enough but not too slowly on the tongue. I'd like to also try the 70% cocoa bar to see which I would prefer. I'm after the health benefits more than the "sweets" aspect.<br /><br />Being Rainforest Alliance Certified, I can eat this chocolate without guilt, knowing no child slavery or destructive growing practices are involved with its manufacture.

review/summary: Not worth the extra money
review/text: I've tried my fair share of different milk & dark chocolate brands. In the end, there are two simple categories for me in the affordable chocolate range:<br /><br />(1) Cheap, too much factory taste/feeling, not really worth the calories - Hershey's, etc.<br />(2) Memorable, usually more expensive but when you bite into it you agree it's worth it - Green & Black's, Lindt, etc.<br /><br />I'll eat from either category depending on my budget and level of chocolate neediness. My impression of this Newman's Dark Chocolate is it is priced as if it belonged to category #2, but tastes more like it belongs in category #1 (I suppose high end of category #1). Still, I would skip the Newman's and buy something from category #1 to get something that tastes like category #1 and save some money.

review/text: I generally like items from other Newman's product lines as they always seem to have a great, borderline decadent flavor.  So I was genuinely surprised at how disappointing this bar was.  I love dark chocolate and when given a choice will always choose it over milk chocolate, but I found this bar to be bitter, almost burnt tasting, and the texture was exceptionally gritty.  To be fair, dark chocolate isn't going to have the silky texture of milk chocolate, but that doesn't mean it should crumble in your mouth.  All in all a very disappointing experience.

review/summary: Better than no chocolate, but not as good as one might hope
review/text: Unlike the other members of my family, I'm not a chocoholic.  I'm a take it or leave it consumer and in general, I go for the good stuff.  This sample bar was my introduction to the Newman's Own Organic Chocolate line, and in order to get a variety of opinions, I shared this taste with several co-workers.<br /><br />My immediate impression was that the bar had the nice, crisp snap of well-tempered chocolate, and also that it had a lovely texture, melting quickly and smoothly in my mouth.  The "dark" chocolate bar has a slightly smoky flavor, but only 54% cocoa, which is less than what many may be looking for in a dark bar.  (Newman's Own also has a super dark bar with 70% cocoa.)  All of us felt that this bar was sweeter than we would have ideally preferred, more akin to bittersweet chocolate than a true dark chocolate.  It was suggested, for that reason, that it might be a nice high-quality bar for baking--though as noted previously, it is not a standard baking bar size.<br /><br />The other thing that all of us noticed was a very subtle orange note to the flavor, to the point that we searched the ingredients for an explanation.  The ingredients of this organic bar are very simple and straightforward.  In fact, there are only five, none of which would explain this undertone.  And it wasn't a problem, overt, or unpleasant; it was simply commented upon.  Further perusing the Newman's Own offerings, I see they produce a dark chocolate orange bar, and I have to suppose there is some minor cross "contamination" of the flavors.  Mystery solved.<br /><br />A quick survey among my cohort revealed that there was only one of us who really cared that the product was organic.  Yeah, the rest of us are Philistines.  Based on the high price point and the low percentage of cocoa, even though we'd enjoyed the treat, none of us was inclined to purchase the product again.  Your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Good noms
review/text: Chocolate is by definition a Good Thing, dark chocolate doubly so.  And organic, Rainforest Alliance Certified dark chocolate?  Very nice.  It has a good flavor.  At 54% cocoa, it's not nearly as dark as some of the other bars on the market, and so is rather smooth on the tongue (I will dispute that it's waxy as one reviewer reported.)  It's true that it's not silky the way really fine chocolate is, but it doesn't purport to be.  It's the sort of chocolate you could find at your local supermarket.  High end there, but nowhere near the price or quality of a bar of Vosges organic dark chocolate.  Nor should it be compared to something like Vosges or even Godiva.  It's a good, affordable organic chocolate bar that has some good credentials in the environmental department.<br /><br />The bar is smallish, but I also debate the assertion that it's too small to share with a friend.  There are six good-size squares in this package, which are more than enough for two assuming that no one is being a glutton.  (That said, I admit I ate the whole bar myself today, but if there'd been anyone else here I'd have shared.)  Yeah, more is better when it comes to chocolate, but it's by no means necessary.<br /><br />Enjoy this chocolate bar for what it is.

review/summary: i love your movies, paul, but not your dark chocolate
review/text: first off, the size of the box this bar of chocolate arrived in was ridiculous. it could have fit at least 50 bars or more. c'mon, amazon, you can do better.<br /><br />now to the real review, which i should qualify by saying i prefer my chocolate 70% dark. this is only 54%, which i failed to notice when i requested this vine product. that said, this tasted too much like milk chocolate. milk chocolate in a bland, mass-produced, thoughtless way. this is just boring chocolate. it's ersatz chocolate. basically, once you've gone dark, you can't go back. and this, for me, was back.

review/summary: Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark
review/text: When the bar of NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE arrived on our doorstep, it was a race to see who would devour it first. My daughters, my husband, our cat, and even our guests all lined up for a square of this delicious treat. But we had only one bar! So bit by bit, I doled out hunks of My Precious until the line had dissipated and only one hunk remained. So yes, I was the good hostess and the last to pop God's Gift to Chocoholics into my mouth.<br /><br />I should pause to say that I am not normally a huge fan of dark chocolate, but I will eat it in a pinch. This was not a pinch, but there I was, savoring a mouthful of truly delicious cocoa. What I generally dislike about dark chocolate is the bitter aftertaste, but with NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE, they have managed to create a pleasantly sweet flavor that both mitigated the bitterness and complimented it. I was surprised. I really liked it. Even afterwards, after I had allowed it to melt in my mouth and slide down my throat, the pleasant flavor lingered. I found myself scanning the others for remnants of their squares, but alas, they too had eaten every crumb.<br /><br />The packaging announces that NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE is organic and 54% cocoa. Oh and it's "premium." Ordinarily, I'd consider that to be advertising puffery, but I'm here to tell you that this chocolate *is* premium. And delicious.<br /><br />Nutritional facts (which are absurd to list on a bar of chocolate!):<br />  Serving Size: 1 bar (although a stack of bars is highly recommended.)<br />  Calories: 330 (but they're tiny chocolate calories, so they don't really count.)<br />  Total Fat: 22g (you know, that may sound like a lot, but it's METRIC. See? Practically calorie-free.)<br />  Trans Fats: ZERO. (And trans fats are a kind of fat, so in a way, it's fat free!)<br /><br />Whew! All that science has made me hungry! Why did I only get one bar?  I definitely need more NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE!!!!!

review/summary: Smooth organic chocolate with a semi-sweet taste
review/text: I love dark chocolate, so I was excited to try this Newman's Own Dark Chocolate bar.  First, I was impressed that the bar, which is smaller than other specialty chocolate bars but still a generous six squares, is just a single serving size.  At 330 calories, 22 grams of fat, and 28 grams of sugar, it is still an indulgent treat, but if you choose to share the bar (as I did), you can satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling too guilty about it.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed the taste of this bar as well; I found the chocolate to be rich and smooth.  At 54% cocoa, it is definitely not as dark as many other dark chocolate offerings out there--in fact, I found the taste to be a bit sweeter, more reminiscent of semi-sweet chocolate than true dark chocolate.  Although this was fine by me, some dark chocolate lovers may be disappointed.  So, unless you need your dark chocolate to be of the extra-dark variety, I would definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: If you are used to waxy mass-produced chocolate, Newman's Own Organics might take a little getting used to. This is the real deal, 100% premium organic dark chocolate. The texture is a bit different from the run of the mill waxy chocolate that most people are accustomed to, but the flavor is very good and the rich dark chocolate melts in your mouth! Ingredients are: "Organic Dark Chocolate (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Cocoa Butter*, Organic Whole Milk Powder, Organic Chocolate Liquor, Organic Soy Lecithin, Organic Vanilla). *Rainforest Alliance Certified(Tm) Cocoa." I enjoyed this dark chocolate but not everyone may appreciate the texture. Give it a try and see what you think!

review/summary: Disappointing Dark
review/text: I found this bar rather lacking in chocolate flavor.  At 54%, it might be possible that I am used to a higher cocoa content (60%+).  While some other reviewers have mentioned the mouthfeel as "grainy", I found it more chalky.  It melted well in the mouth without any grainy feel, but when chewed, became a rather gummy mass of chocolate.  It wasn't awful by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a little strange.  If you don't like dark chocolate, you would probably enjoy this bar--it seemed more like semi-sweet chocolate to me.  If you like dark chocolate, however, prepare for disappointment.

review/summary: Review based on taste only!
review/text: When reviewing one of the Newman's Own products, it's always tempting to let one's opinion of the goals of the organization temper one's review of the product. I try to avoid that as I figure that the reader can decide those issues and is reading this to see what a reviewer thinks of this particular product.<br /><br />I like this product, but got it to try as part of the Vine review program and I don't know that I'd actually buy it because there's no price info available yet, so you can't compare it.<br /><br />On the upside, I like the taste. Until the last few years, a 54% chocolate was considered 'dark' and I like dark chocolate of about this percentage (up to about 60%). I think it's robustly chocolate, without the bitterness of the extremely high chocolate you see these days. This bar seems a nice balance of chocolate and sweet.<br /><br />One the downside, I find it just a bit on the grainy side. It's subtle, and didn't stop my enjoying it, but I noticed it compared to other high-end brands of chocolate bars. It's just not as smooth.<br /><br />Would I buy this compared to others? It's hard to tell without being able to price compare, but given that I don't consume enough chocolate for the price to really matter, probably not.

review/text: Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar, 2.25 oz.<br /><br />I'm a firm believer in the Newman's Own corporate objectives and enjoy many of their fine products. I appreciate the facts that this chocolate, according to them, "is formulated with some of the finest Certified Organic chocolate we've ever tasted, made from cocoa beans grown on Rainforest Alliance Certified(tm) farms." While the New Organics Dark Chocolate is very good, it has a slightly grainy texture which, for me, spoils the mouth-feel a little. A small point, I suppose, as it is excellent chocolate with a 54% cocoa content. I certainly recommend it for its rich chocolate aroma and taste.

review/summary: Yummy smooth dark chocolate that is also good for your health!
review/text: Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />**** Recommended with warm fuzzies.<br /><br />I just received my single 2.25-ounce bar this morning and it was a good thing that I already ate breakfast as I nibbled (instead of chomped) on this with my morning coffee.  I have always liked all of Newman's line of foods, because they taste good and are made of high-quality ingredients, and because his foundation donates hundreds of millions of dollars to charities throughout the world.  (And I love his movies! :-)  Paul Newman walked the philanthropic walk in helping to make the world a better place.<br /><br />This 54% cocoa dark chocolate bar has an all-organic ingredient list that is free of artificial sweetener and extraneous additives and fillers, which is all too common in chocolates, candies, and foods these days.<br /><br />Note that, at the time of this review's writing, the "Ingredients" and "Nutrition Facts" listed on Amazon's site for this dark chocolate bar are actually copied from another "Newman's" chocolate bar, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHYQQC">Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar, 2.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> , and so this information that is currently listed on Amazon's site for this dark chocolate does NOT apply to this product; it refers to Newman's Milk Chocolate.  Hopefully, Amazon will correct the listings in these two sections for this product.<br /><br />Amazon's "Ingredients" listing: Organic Milk Chocolate (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Whole Milk Powder, Organic Chocolate Liquor, Organic Soy Lecithin [An Emulsifier], Organic Vanilla), Natural Coffee Flavor.<br /><br />Actual Wrapper's "Ingredients" listing: Organic Dark Chocolate (Organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin [an emulsifier], organic vanilla).<br /><br />Wrapper's "Nutrition Facts" listing (with Amazon's corresponding "Nutrition Facts" listing, that actually apply to Newman's Milk Chocolate bar, in parentheses):<br /><br />Calories:  330 (340)<br />Calories from Fat: 200 (190)<br />Total Fat:  22g 34%DV (23g 35%DV)<br />Saturated Fat:  13g 65%DV (12g 60%DV)<br />Monounsaturated and Trans Fat: 0g (0g)<br />Cholesterol:  0g 0%DV (5mg 2%DV)<br />Sodium:  5mg (30mg)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 37g 12%DV (37g 12%DV)<br />Fiber:  4g 16%DV (1g 4%DV)<br />Sugars:  28g (33g)<br />Protein:  3g (3g)<br />Vitamin A:  0% (2%)<br />Vitamin C:  0% (2%)<br />Calcium:  2% (20%)<br />Iron:  10% (15%)<br /><br />So Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar has more vitamins, calcium, and iron due to its use of milk, while the dark chocolate has more fiber and less sodium.  Many people do not consider chocolate to be a high-fiber food, but dark chocolate (not milk chocolate) ranks among the top-20 for high-fiber foods.  Dark chocolate is loaded with flavonoids that act as antioxidants, keeping your heart healthy and reducing oxidative stress.  Flavonoids also balance hormones in your body, and they activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase levels in your body (biochemical gibberish that translates to "helps regulate your blood pressure" :-)  Studies have also shown that dark chocolate, perhaps due to its increased fiber content, makes you feel more "filled up", giving you more of a feeling of satiety compared with eating milk chocolate.<br /><br />At the time of this review's writing, Amazon had not yet priced this chocolate. But even if it was priced higher than other dark chocolates offered by the larger candy factories, I would still buy this because I believe in Newman's cause and charities.  I also love dark chocolate that is combined with nuts and/or berries, such as the Chocolove dark chocolates, and I hope that the "Newman's" dark chocolates line also eventually includes those.<br /><br />I love dark chocolates with cocoa content that goes to 77% and beyond, but these are not as sweet and have a subtle bitterness compared to dark chocolates with lower cocoa content.  The 54% cocoa content of this Newman's bar strikes a happy balance of sweetness that will appeal to those who are more accustomed to milk chocolate's sweetness.  This chocolate is not as sweet as some of the other 54-55% cocoa dark chocolates out there because many dark chocolates add higher amounts of extra sugar to their bars.  The flavor of this chocolate is nice, but with a slightly fibrous texture; just don't expect it to be as sweet as some of the more-sweetened dark chocolates on the market or else you may think that this tastes a bit bland compared to them.  Likewise, some people think that heavily-salted food tastes better than lightly-salted food.  The "evaporated cane juice" used as a sweetener in this chocolate is a healthier alternative than the processed sugar that is included in many chocolate bars (including the Belgium-made Chocolove bars that I love).  Both refined sugar and cane juice come from sugar cane, but cane juice is less processed and retains more nutrients.  So enjoy this smooth rich dark chocolate "health food" guilt-free, but in moderation.  I certainly will enjoy eating the rest of this chocolate bar while watching my DVD of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019UGYK0">Cool Hand Luke (Deluxe Edition)</a>

review/summary: I expected a lot more from the Newman's Own brand.
review/text: I have tried a couple of products from the Newman's Own line and, while I didn't necessarily think they were better than their competitors' products of the same type, they definitely held their own.  I sadly did not find this to be true with the Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar.<br /><br />When it comes to reviewing edible products, I find it helpful to compare and contrast with a similar product from another brand.  Because I love Dove Dark Chocolate (though I try many different kinds of dark chocolate), I used the Dove Silky Smooth Dark Chocolate Bar as comparison (though I prefer the Dove Promise individual bites, it was easier to compare bar to bar).<br /><br />The Dove Dark Bar is 33 grams and the serving size is the entire bar.  The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar is 64 grams, nearly double the size of the Dove Bar, and still 1 serving is considered the entire bar.  Now, I am as much of a chocolate lover as the next person (probably more, in fact), but there is no way I need nor want to eat to consume 64g of chocolate in one sitting (especially sub-par chocolate).<br /><br />In most nutritional areas, especially fat and sat fat, the 33g Dove bar and the 64g Newman bar are almost equal if you consider that one is double the size of the other.  Newman's only clear win over the Dove bar is on cholesterol, having 0mg even though it is double the size of the Dove (which has 5mg cholesterol).  For those watching sugar, the smaller Dove bar has 17g while Big Daddy Newman has 37g.<br /><br />With the health business out of the way, let's get down to brass tacks--taste and texture:<br /><br />Texture.  I am accustomed to the smooth, creamy texture of Dove dark chocolate--I find its mouth feel luxurious.  My initial thought on biting into and chewing the Newman was waxiness--quite nasty at first but, once I got it chewed, it had a nicer mouth feel.  It is not creamy like Dove, but it loses the waxiness once chewed.<br /><br />Taste.  The only thing particularly pleasant to me about the Newman bar was the finish...the very last taste as you're swallowing it.  That has a deep rich dark chocolate taste and, despite the 37g of sugar in it, is not overly sweet, which is nice.  As for Dove, the entire process of biting into it, chewing it and swallowing it is enjoyable, so there is no contest.<br /><br />In summary, if you have your heart set on contributing to Newman's Own because of the good work they do, or you must have an organic chocolate bar, I suppose this will do.  But it is not, in my opinion, any competition for ANY other brand of good dark chocolate I have tried.

review/text: Like most health-conscious people, I appreciate the idea of organic food, and Paul Newman's Own is one of the most respected brands on the market. That's why I wanted to try this chocolate bar.<br /><br />I'm not a big "chocoholic," but I do enjoy a taste of decadence on occasion, and this was one of those occasions.<br /><br />To make a long story short, I tried it and liked it, but it didn't taste nearly as good as Lady Godiva or even my old cheapie "standby" Hershey bar.<br /><br />Sure, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHYQAS">Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar, 2.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> is  flavorful, but to my taste buds it seemed a little harsh... Oh, how do I describe it? I guess what I'm trying to say is that the texture wasn't creamy enough.<br /><br />In all fairness, I must confess that I often enjoy chocolate while drinking green tea; you know, a generous chunk of chocolate romancing my palate, followed by a sip of hot tea to mellow and enhance the taste sensation. Well, that proved to be what did it for me. Yes, I loooved it when savored in that manner<br /><br />I shared it with a friend who is more of a connoisseur than I am, and he loved it...straight from the stylish, golden wrapper.<br /><br />Another drawback for me is the expensive price. This 2.25-oz. size isn't available yet, but I found Newman's other same-size bars on Amazon for $26.88 per box of twelve. That works out to about $2.50 per candy bar (plus postage). Ouch!<br /><br />Needless to say, I would rather spend my hard-earned money another way. Sorry, Paul. I dearly love you and enjoyed many hours of quality movie time with you, but I'll stick to buying your salad dressings. Meanwhile, I'll get my chocolate kicks from my old friend, Mr. Hershey. Even Lady Godiva is out of my budget.<br /><br />With the small amount of chocolate I digest, it's not going to kill me. :-)<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 24, 2011<br />Author of "Dream Reachers" (with Chase Von) and other books

review/text: I love dark chocolate, but I found this bar too bland for my tastes.  It has one note of flavor and not very interesting.  Funny thing is, when I handed the remaining squares out, everyone who usually only liked milk chocolate loved this bar.  So if you like milk chocolate, but would like the benefits of dark chocolate, this may be the perfect compromise.  However, if you like the bracing complexity of dark chocolate, you may find yourself giving this chocolate away.<br /><br />I usually really like Newman products and like supporting their business, this is the first item I will not be repurchasing.<br /><br />NOTE: The bars are as tall as an iPhone and a little wider than one -- just a heads up if you think this is a large bar, it is not.  You will want to note the weight of the bars if using for a recipe.

I even used to date a chick who was into wine and tried to get me into the whole dark-chocolate-with-wine thing, which I never got.  I got into wine, sure, but dark chocolate was never anything I really cared for.<br />So when I got this, it was with much hesitation.  I don't even LIKE dark chocolate, why on earth would I want this?<br />-<br />I cannot explain what this bar did to me.  I took a small bite and was hooked!  It's just wonderful.  How do I describe this - it was ultra smooth without any of that bitterness which I detest in dark chocolate - not even a hint!  It was pure excellence.  I did see other people here mentioned that it seemed "grainy" and I can say I felt none of that.  I thought it was gorgeous.  I literally could not stop eating it.  And that never happens - I am very much into food but it's rare that anything grabs me like that.  I did put it down halfway through - and I was transformed from a guy who hates dark chocolate to a guy who now knows what real dark chocolate is.  I put it down because I was on my way out the door - but you can bet that as soon as I got home, I ate the rest.  It was just so fine.  I would absolutely get this again, and I look forward to a time when I can buy this for someone else, so they too, can experience the luxury of this fine dark chocolate.

review/text: I'm a big fan of chocolate and of Newman's Own products, so I was very excited to try their chocolate. This bar is 54% cocoa, which I consider somewhere between milk and dark chocolate (but more towards dark), and this is right in my personal sweet spot. This is high quality chocolate with a complex flavor, but it was not as smooth as I usually like. My favorite chocolate, the Scharffen Berger 41% extra rich milk, is obviously much more of a milk chocolate bar, but I have had 60% cocoa chocolate that was smoother than this 54% chocolate. I do recommend that you try this chocolate because I think it would appeal to many chocolate lovers.

It is rich with some sharpness, but does _not_ have a "burnt" taste that several other brands have. It melts nicely in the mouth to a smooth texture, without becoming overly buttery. And it has a good aftertaste.

review/summary: Not All Great Dark Chocolate Bars Hail From Europe
review/text: I've always been a fan of Newman's Own products and this dark chocolate bar did not dissapoint. I like my dark chocolate bars to have a bit more cocoa (70% at least) but for those who shy away from the bitter flavor, this bar offers a good balance with a hint of sweetness the higher cocoa bars lack. You won't mistake this for a Hershey bar by any means. The product is certified organic and uses Rainforest Alliance Certified cocoa so you can feel good about what you are eating. A great bar at a very reasonable price that holds its own against the more expensive offerings from Europe.

review/summary: Does not disappoint.
review/text: NOTE: Guest review from my chocolate-loving friend LW:<br /><br />I almost missed the 2.25 oz. bar at first, wedged as it was, in its brown and black wrapper, alongside the inflated-to-full-size plastic air cushion in its Amazon book box. But once I'd extricated it and opened it, it was substantial. All 22 grams of fat (13 saturated) of it. Sorry, I looked. But not to worry -- that's for the whole bar. With a modicum of discipline, you can easily spread that shame across six nights by breaking off one generous carefully scored square each night (bigger squares than the one on your hotel pillow). That's all you need at a go anyway -- the taste is very rich with a subtle liqueur-like finish -- just what you'd hope its 54% cocoa content would deliver.<br /><br />[Bar provided as part of Vine review program might have been smaller than bars available here for sale.]

review/summary: Chocolate...Sigh
review/text: Satisfying.<br /><br />I love that this chocolate is organic. From the first to last ingredient.<br /><br />I love that the first ingredient is dark chocolate.<br /><br />I love the taste. Intense, rich with a hint of sweet.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't love was the meltability on the tongue factor. I don't know if the bar is so thick that this slows the process. I broke it into a smaller chunk and it sat on my tongue awhile. Not that that's awful..it's chocolate for goodness sake... I guess I could say it's slow to melt. Chewing didn't hurry the process.<br /><br />Allergies or Vegan? The standard disclaimer appears. "This product manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, other nuts, milk powder, wheat, soy and egg." However the only listed ingredient on that list is the organic soy lecithin.<br /><br />Overall tasty. And pretty much what it promises.

review/text: I am a chocolate lover and it was the first time I tried an organic dark chocolate. It tastes alright but it does not seem to have the same smoothness and bitter taste which come with the typical dark chocolate.  It is also a little pricey for over $2 dollars a pack. I would prefer the Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate over this.

review/text: I will say upfront that there are very few dark chocolates that I like. I'm a fan of Ghiradelli, and Lindt, but not most of the others I've tried. The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate was tasty, but the texture wasn't as smooth as some of the others I've tried. I'd say it's better than most (say, Hershey's Dark) but still needs tweaking to be as good as Lindt.

review/text: I admit that I am not a big dark chocolate fan. I first noticed that the chocolate does not have that sharp bitter taste that most dark chocolate has. Then again, it doesn't really have any taste. By the time I was done eating the chocolate bar, I kind of felt like I ate some wax. From there it did not agree with my system.

review/summary: Very Tasty, But Kind Of Small.....
review/text: I've never eaten Organic Chocolate before, and I often find Dark Chocolate to be somewhat bitter, so I was very interested to taste Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate. I found the taste to be surprisingly sweet and smooth, and I enjoyed it very much. The actual amount you get per bar seems very small for the price, however........But it is a fair-trade product, so that knowledge does go a long way towards justifying the price.

review/text: I must admit that I have never eaten an organic chocolate bar so I was excited to taste Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar.  Unfortunately, I found the taste to be bland.  The texture is nice and I liked that it didn't melt in my hand while I was eating it but this bar has the distinction of being the first chocolate bar to enter my house and not get completely eaten.  Newman's Own is a fantastic organization that donates generously to charity so I feel guilty saying this but I would not purchase or eat this chocolate bar on my own.

review/text: I love what Newman's is doing and I applaud their products.  I must confess that I am not a big lover of dark chocolate and prefer milk.  This particular bar tasted chalky, like maybe it had been available for a while (which, since it was free, may have been the case).  It also had an unpleasant after taste.  I am not sure if Newman's has  a milk chocolate bar, but if it does, I will get one to add the comparison to my review.

review/summary: Is there such a thing as bad chocolate?
review/text: Some might argue that, just as there's no such thing as bad sex, there's no such thing as bad chocolate. (Even the worst of the latter I've ever consumed - in Leningrad, Russia in 1984 - was still edible. My history with the former we needn't discuss.)<br /><br />So, here we have NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE (NOODC). Mind you, it doesn't contain such poncy embellishments such as almonds, macadamia nuts, cherries, pomegranate, mint chips, bacon shreds, rice krispies, orange peel, caramel filling, peanut butter, raisins, walnut pieces, toffee crunch, coconut, red pepper, coffee beans, cranberries, blueberries, white chocolate chunks, or the kitchen sink. It's just 100% chocolate, i.e. evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, and vanilla - all organic, of course. (It must be pointed out, however, that vanilla is used by chocolate makers to mask the flavor of imperfectly roasted cocoa beans. Hmm.)<br /><br />At 54% cocoa, NOODC isn't particularly elevated on that scale. Who in a chocolate company determines the what and why of an optimum concentration, I wonder? Probably the (cocoa) bean counters, I imagine.<br /><br />Because I have a taste disorder described more fully in my review of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618861882">Remembering Smell: A Memoir of Losing--and Discovering--the Primal Sense</a>, I can't judge the sweetness of this candy, but only the chocolate flavor and the "mouth feel." Both are pretty much average and acceptable. Is it better than one of my favorite brands, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CH40HQ">Cadbury Royal Dark Chocolate Bar, 3.5 oz, 24 count</a> bar? Uh ... no. But, it's infinitely better than that Commie chocolate eaten back in the nostalgic good old days of the Cold War! I mean, without any of the added embellishments mentioned above, a plain chocolate bar has to work overtime to stand out from the rest of that genre on the shelf.<br /><br />Actually, I was more interested in the subtleties of the label. Paul himself is pictured with Nell, his daughter by Joanne Woodward. Nell started the Organics Division of Newman's Own in 1993, and remained at its head when it chipped-off the old block in 2001. Dad still lent his support, though, before he died. I gather it's Nell`s leadership and participation that's inferred in the confectionary's subtitle, "The Second Generation."<br /><br />Again, according to the labeling, the cocoa has been certified by the "Rainforest Alliance." Perhaps I'm being cynical, but it makes me wonder how much Nell's company tips this outfit for the granting of its certification, however legitimate such a ritual blessing may be. Similarly, there's the notation "Certified Organic by Oregon Tilth" - whatever a "Tilth" is.<br /><br />Also, there's the usual CYA disclaimer: "Manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, other nuts, milk powder, wheat soy, and egg." The potential hazards for allergy sufferers aside, how might those possible contaminants affect the organic quality of NOODC if they themselves aren't organic? Inquiring minds want to know. (Perhaps the "USDA Organic" sticker carries implications here. I'll certainly sleep better at night knowing the guv'mint is involved.)<br /><br />And the fact that a 1 bar serving size contains only 5 mg of sodium means that my wife could chow down the whole thing - minus the single bite I was tossed - without fear of elevating her already borderline-high blood pressure. After all, dark chocolate is reportedly a health food.<br /><br />Would I buy NOODC on at the local chain supermarket without it being at a bargain, club price? Probably not. I've never been convinced that "organic" isn't mostly a marketing ploy to raise the sticker, and NOODC at full price doesn't give more satisfaction than a less expensive bar laden with assorted impurities, toxins, and carcinogens. And both go down equally well with a glass of cold, non-fat moo.

review/summary: Delicious 54% Dark Chocolate
review/text: I don't know if I have any of Mr. Newman's products that I didn't like.  This is no exception.  At 54% cocoa the bar isn't overly dark.  Even it color it is fairly light. There isn't the hint of bitterness that usually comes from a dark chocolate bar.<br /><br />I found myself breaking the pieces into quarters.  A piece is about an inch square but smaller is even nicer to savor.  This is not chocolate to feed on but to eat, savor and enjoy.  The feel is wonderful because it quickly melts in your mouth and is just wonderful.<br /><br />The bar is small. It makes you want to savor and eat it slowly.<br /><br />Delicious, just delicious.

review/summary: OMGosh!  A chocoholic's dream!
review/text: I have had a lot of chocolate in my life time, from all over the world. I've have the pralines in Belgium, the smooth satiny rich chocolate of Switzerland (which I consider the best) and spent some time in France trying their orange and chocolate combinations. I do love American chocolate products also! I prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate, unless in Switzerland where the milk is the most creamiest (and unpasteurized) I have ever had the joy of trying.<br /><br />Newman's Own Organic chocolate bars rival that of my European favorites.  It has just the right amount of "dark chocolate" flavor (54% dark) without being too bitter.  It has a solid texture that quickly becomes creamy as it melts in your mouth. The sweetness is not overwhelming, and this definitely falls into the "dark chocolate" lover's category.<br /><br />I feared that "organic" chocolate would not taste good, since I am not into "organic" this and that.  I hated the "Carob" years when everyone tried to convince me that Carob tasted just as good as chocolate, though it wasn't even really close!  This chocolate is very very good.<br /><br />I don't eat chocolate for my health, of course (unless mental health counts) and this stuff is high on the calories (330 per bar, or 64 grams, or 2.25 ounces.) compared to another brand's special dark chocolate bar, which is 180 calories per 41 grams.<br /><br />The choco-holic in your life (and you know there is one) will find this to be a very delicious treat! The gold foil wrapper inside lets you know you are buying something special!<br />Highly recommended if you like dark chocolate!

review/summary: Delicious, not bitter. Also good for PMS!
review/text: I'm more of a milk chocolate kind of person, so I didn't expect to like this, but it's actually very smooth and not bitter.<br />Since dark chocolate is so good for you, and milk chocolate, well, isn't, I was hoping I'd find a dark chocolate bar that didn't have a nasty bitter aftertaste. This meets that criteria!<br />The bars are small, but it's rich and satisfying, and all you really need, even for PMS. I can feel the grumpiness melt away, replaced by mild euphoria and a feeling of peace, contentment, and love for everyone. Chocolate is a miracle drug, and this particular one is high quality, good stuff.<br />DH knows that there are certain times he will need to throw one of these in ahead of him and run past and wait for the chocolate to kick in. He considers these a good investment, and I like the taste, texture and health benefits.<br />I feel much less guilty eating these than I would milk chocolate, or my beloved forbidden white chocolate.<br />I'm very satisfied with this product.

review/summary: This product illustrates the deficiencies of the term "organic"
review/text: I can't give more than a 3 star average for this item, when considering the flavor and taste of this "organic chocolate" bar.<br /><br />Like some other Newman's Own food products that I've tasted, it doesn't offer any special quality, other than that the ingredients are virtually all "organic".  Unfortunately, our local, state and Federal requirements for "organic" foods, are severely flawed, and this product potentially  illustrates this problem quite well.<br /><br />The ingredients in these chocolate bars may meet most standards for organic foodstuffs, but there is an important element missing in the case of chocolate, that most people don't understand.<br /><br />I have read several articles recently about the high lead content of much of the chocolate that we consume, and for a period of time this problem was presumed to be that the cocoa beans themselves were (are) contaminated with lead, due to the leaded gasoline  in the engines of the farming equipment used in those countries that grow cocoa beans.<br /><br />However, some articles mention that lab analyses show that raw cocoa beans themselves have a relatively low amount of lead in them, compared to the final, processed chocolate products (and compared to other similar food products).  Some observant writers have then suggested that the high lead concentrations in cocoa products, are probably due to lead in the air near and over the drying beds, where the beans themselves are dried.  The reason for this contamination would be similar to the original theories, since there is likely high lead content in the air around these drying beds, for the prior reasoning (the lead in the gasoline used on the cocoa bean farms is emitted by tractor and other vehicle exhaust,  and then these contaminants attach themselves to the drying cocoa beans).<br /><br />At any rate, if the price of Newman's Own organic dark chocolate is as high as I suspect it is,  I would recommend buying a cheaper brand of chocolate bar ("organic" or not), since there's no way to know whether Newman's Own chocolate has less (or more) lead in it, than other brands do.

review/summary: Standard decent health food chocolate bar
review/text: If you go to a health food store, you'll always find bars like this near the checkout counter.  They are high end chocolate bars that use all organic ingredients and fair trade cocoa.  They all taste pretty good and sometimes they go on sale so you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for them.  Newman's Own tastes very similar to any number of high-end organic chocolate bars.  They have about 40 percent more calories than you'd get with a Hershey's, but they also taste better.  I wish the squares for breaking off pieces were smaller, because this is really nibbling chocolate, not something you'd eat a whole bar of in a single sitting.<br /><br />I wouldn't say these are special or extraordinary chocolate bars.  They're perfect decent, though, and if I had a hankering for chocolate and they were on special, I'd buy one at a checkout counter.
