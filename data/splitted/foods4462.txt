review/summary: Liquid Napalm.
review/text: At a cookout, a friend showed up with this stuff. I was the first to take the plunge. I tried to pour just a drop onto a small plate of nachos, but more than I wanted came out - maybe a 1/2 teaspoon. I mixed it around and dug in; it was good, but packs some serious 5 alarm heat. It is sweetly smoky, but this lasts only for the initial few seconds before the blazing, unquenchable inferno from the pit of hell begins. My eyes watered. Sweat formed on my brow. My nose ran. Brutal... just brutal. Another friend poured this stuff on his burger like ketchup (dripping down the side), and ate it like it was nothing! I can only conclude that my friend has a cast iron stomach.

review/summary: My favorite so far!
review/text: OK.  I grew up in a family that would pay me a $1 to eat a Jalapeno.  As such, it does not surprise me that many people find this sauce TOO hot.  I do not.  It is perfect thus far.  My experiences in different foods follow.<br /><br />First Taste : Drop on my finger : At first, great aroma and flavor.  Then, the heat started to build and hit max fairly quickly.  With other sauces I have found this means it will then die down, however Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce lingers.  The burn lasted a good long while (I would estimate 15-20 minutes, with pretty much a glass or 2 of water).<br /><br />Chicken Alfredo : Afraid that the drop on my tongue was unrepresentative and the heat would de-intensify with food, I put on 4 or 5 drops to a medium bowl of Chicken Alfredo. This was a tad too much.  It didn't kill me, but wow did I drink several glasses of water.<br /><br />Wendy's Chili : I loved this so much I picked up another bottle from a store nearby work that carried it and thought it would do well in Wendy's Chili (which is close by).  I put one drop first and tried.  Not quite enough.  I put another drop and it was perfect.  While Wendy's chili is certainly not the best, this hot sauce made it all that much better!<br /><br />Hamburger : I purchased a Jalapeno burger patty from Stater Bros (local food chain).  2 drops mixed with other condiments (Chipoltle Mayo and Jalepeno Mustard) was perfect.  It added the desired amount of heat and flavor (did I mention this sauce has a fantastic flavor!?!?)<br /><br />Chili Mac : Made with ground turkey.  Yep, this is a pretty low ball dish.  I meant to put 2 drops, but wound up with 1 drop and a dollop the equivalant of 3, so 4 total.  I'm not sure if I'm just building up resistance, but this was awesome.  It wasn't so hot as to have me sweating, but it was a definite (and enjoyable) battle to finish it!<br /><br />I have tried all of the "usual suspects" (Tapatio, Trader Joe's Jabanero (which also isn't bad)) in addition to Melinda's Ghost Pepper Sauce, and this is my favorite by far due to both heat and flavor.  Melinda's has a fantastic flavor, but leaves much to be desired in the heat department.<br /><br />Feel free to clue me in to great tasting hot (and hotter) sauces.  I have always been a fan of "heat", but now I am an addict (thanks to Dave's Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce!!!).

review/summary: New Favorite Sauce- Compared to Dave's original
review/text: I like to think of the potent flavors found in Dave's line of sauces sort of like Stinky cheeses. Some people hate them, some people love them, and there is a lot of subjectivity so any review that regards the flavors or smells as good or bad must be taken with a grain of salt because it's all about personal preference. I'm not saying that Dave's sauces taste like foot cheese, just pointing out another "food group" that can pack some very pungent strong flavors and smells that some people find very repulsive. Dave sauces are thick with ingredient and not "watered" down or full of vinegar. They have a very strong smell and flavor that some people may not like. I think that like fancy cheeses, dark beers, or black coffee, powerful hot sauces like Dave's are an acquired taste that takes time to appreciate.<br /><br />I find the Ghost pepper version here to lean sweeter and smokier than the original dave's by quite a bit and like both very much but for different reasons. Heat level is very hard to compare amongst things unless they are orders of magnitude different. The Ghost bottle has one more "+" next to the "insanity" rating than the original but I find that heat level "ratings" within an already very hot group of sauces are not very important since it really all comes down to how much capsicum is ingested and how much comes into contact with the sensitive parts of the mouth/throat. The long term cost of desiring a spicy hit at nearly every meal is actually lower with sauces in this category because they do the trick in small doses. My limit is about a teaspoon on a meal and that makes for a very powerful endorphin response that leaves me rather incapacitated for about a half hour after meal time. Usually use less than that but everyone once and awhile pepper heads feel the need to push limits and cause some real pain. I  have noticed that different sauces (made from different peppers) have different heat "behaviors." Some are a hard hitting short duration burn in the mouth and on lips, and some you can feel as a warm buzzing through the torso for hours after eating them. The extract used in Dave's sauces seems to be a pretty good blend of both of those attributes, but I would say that the ghost pepper adds a more drawn out, building style heat that effects the "whole body" rather than just the mouth more-so than the Original Dave's Insanity Sauce.<br /><br />My bottle of Dave's Original Insanity was almost empty, so I picked this Ghost variant up at World Market as it would be a shame not to have another bottle of magma ready to go. I couldn't resist opening it right away and trying it out. The first experience with it left me wondering if I might have an allergy to it as it caused some sensations I had not felt with other sauces. The more I used it, the more I started to appreciate it's "effects." From my subjective point of view, it is the best flavor in any hot sauce I have ever had. I usually get bottles of various "normal" heat hot sauces (watered down habanero, jolepeno, chipotle, watered down cayenne) around the holidays from family members and most of them are enjoyable, but none can compare to this. I can only attribute the flavor to the Ghost pepper as no other sauce I have ever tried has has the particular flavor found in this sauce. The only ingredient that is "out of the ordinary" here to explain that is the Ghost peppers themselves.  If you've tasted the flavor of many pepper sauces and are looking for something "new" this has to be tried. The original Dave's insanity sauce contains a lot of pulverized, likely concentrated onion that gives it an addictive pungency that some would describe as "smalling like something that should be used to strip paint." The Ghost pepper variant does have a touch of garlic but does not come across to me as being anywhere near as pungent as the original (keep in mind, I liked the original, for the same sort of reason I suspect, that people take a liking to "stinky" powerful cheeses).<br /><br />Oh yea... one final consideration... Be careful with it, it's pretty warm. I'd suggest against pranking people with it as there is some potential liability there that is not worth it IMO.

review/summary: Dollar for dollar, simply the best
review/text: Kudos to Dave for bringing great taste and amazing heat together like this,  sure the heat is extract boosted, however, for the money, this sauce is the best deal out there, no close seconds.  This one sets the standard for hot sauces of this genre.<br /><br />I've tried several hundred (maybe a thousand by now) and have been making my own sauces for over 4 years, I've grown several gardens dominated by Jolokia peppers and have made some pretty wicked all Jolokia pepper home brew versions; however, Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce is still very hard to beat.  His Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia "select sauce" is a notch better, but for the price of about 3 bottles of his select sauce, you can get a gallon of Jolokia pepper sauce, and this is the quantity that I get.<br /><br />My favorite use of this sauce is to impress guests who think they can handle heat, mixing it with other commercial or homebrew sauces, putting a dab in ranch for salad, and eating it with just about everything except sweets or cereal.  I'll keep trying every hot sauce known to man leaving no stone unturned, creating my own with my own Jolokias, Habaneros (etc.), but you'll never catch me without plenty of this one around.

review/summary: Tasty with a nice lingering burn
review/text: This is the highest "rated" hot sauce I have tried. (As well as the first Dave's sauce). I am thinking that maybe people have different reactions to pepper types, because sauces with cayenne pepper, even if they are not as potent, seem "hotter" to me.<br /><br />The other thing that leads me to think this is that I am not an experienced chilihead, and was careful about trying this sauce carefully.  A tiny droplet on a chip led to a great smoky initial taste, and a growing burn that topped out at hot, but very manageable.  This lead to more and more over the next day, and my comfort level tops out at a small pour into a cup of chili gives it nice taste and a solid burn that I can deal with, and I can still feel hours later- in a good way.<br /><br />A fine sauce, I thought this 5 oz bottle would last forever, but I can already see that I will run out sooner than expected.

review/summary: Not for the faint of heart by far!!!
review/text: I am from Buffalo, NY, I make my own sauces because I have yet found one worthy of my level of heat. I can say that this is some insane stuff. I put sauce on everything that is not sweet (snack cakes, cake, cereal and things like such)but on eggs, toast and everything else I do. I make home made mayo and other things that I put sauce into, just so that you get the idea of the pepperhead that I am.<br /><br />I just got done devouring home made wings that I fried, and coated myself. I separated my wifes wings, for she is 8 months pregnant with our daughter, and I commenced to take a challenge set by one of my co-workers. I drenched my 10 wings in Daves Naga Jolokia blended hot sauce, not off of his Insanity line. Totally separate, and full of it's own unique flavor, I took the challenge!<br /><br />9 wings later, I saw a glass of milk that my pregnant wife was drinking so she would not get heartburn, I devoured the glass, and followed it up with a beer. I was fine after 5 to 10 minutes, and I won't say that I was in pain, just that I give respect to a sauce blended for only one drop. But I will say that 10 is not far away.<br /><br />Definitely not today though!

review/summary: Kick to it
review/text: I will preface this review with a little about myself. I only recently bought a "hottest sauce" while at a kind of flea market in England. It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:<br /><br />The sauce is very hot. Almost too hot. It has a pasty consistency, almost exactly like tomato paste. Very finely ground. It has a more gummy consistency to it, like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there's no such actual ingredient.<br /><br />What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.<br /><br />So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.<br /><br />So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.<br /><br />If I change my mind as I go through this bottle, I'll update or comment on here again.

review/text: I got used to it pretty quickly, so it gets used more like ketchup now, but it really doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from other sauces. It leaves a burn more on the lips than the throat, and gives a whole new meaning to the term "ring of fire" about a day later.

review/summary: Fire,Heat & slow burn
review/text: My initial impression of Dave's once opened was this sauce stinks. Sorry Dave! I just went down to the kitchen to smell it again and it does have a smokey,spicey woody smell to it. Had this with grilled stired eggplant and as a testament to this sauce, it didn't destroy the flavor of the mellow eggplant stirfry. Be careful when pouring as this bottle doesn't have a restrictor. But it does come out thick and pours slow enough. Had porkchops on the side & this sauce seemed to bypass the actual food & leave you with the heat in back of the throat. Not the most flavorful hot sauce but appropriate for chilli, Crock pot stews and the like. Also, I like hot sauces to be done soon after dinner. This, you will feel long after dinner is finished in your esophagus, stomach ect. It almost wears out it's welcome. Having said that, Dave's is a definately a HEAT multiplier for food. The best HEAT sauce I've ever tasted. Cheers!

review/text: All the other sauces were hot, but we wanted to try this one.  We used 9 drops in home made wing sauce (about a cup of wing sauce).  This is powerful, using as directed is a must.  We started with one drop and worked our way up to 9 drops in a cupfull of wing sauce.  9 drops are perfect for us.  This most definitely has a heat and kick of it's own kind.  If you like HOT and I mean standing on the sun hot, this is for you...but do use it as directed on the bottle and start small.

Taste could be better but this stuff is hot! Be careful not to leave this stuff lying around the house though. My pops came home from work that same night and mistakened this for regular hot sauce. He doused his food with this stuff and got one bite before realizing something was wrong. He was in a lot of stomach pain (enough to bring him to the floor) and sweating as if he'd ran a marathon. Now there's a danger label on it that i personally made.

review/summary: Proceed with caution!
review/text: Was at a market (World Cost Plus?)and came across this. There was another brand too, Melinda's or Meranda's...something, yeah. I decided to go with this one as the other had carrots and mango puree and other stuff (blah). I'm sure this is too make it not so hot but I figured this might cover up it's natural taste too.<br /><br />So I stopped at Taco Bell on the way home. Figured start with something mild and got a ranchero chicken soft taco. Put one drop of this stuff and smeared it around. Not bad. Complimented it nicely. Second was a meximelt. One drop only again. This time it seemed they merged together and boosted each others spices. By the time I was done I had a nice long heat going and some sweats which lasted untill I got home.<br /><br />You know when you take a shot of hard liquor on an empty stomach? That burn? Imagine that burn slooooowly moving through your system. Yeah, it' like that. I'm sure it will kill any parasites living in your intestinal tract. Might even remove any bubble gum you swallowed as a kid.<br /><br />Next day, tried it again, this time on a burger. Threw some ranch on it and tried 2 drops this time. Got to my second burger and knew if I did 2 drops again that I might be in trouble, so went with only 1 drop.<br /><br />1 or 2 drops per item seems to be the right amount. Pouring this stuff on like it was Tapatio WILL without a doubt lead to problems!! But I will be taking this to work for all those Tapatio junkies and others who just eat raw chilis straight up. Hehe, let's see if they think they're still macho now, huh?!! This stuff is deceiving! Seems fine at first, but man o man, that heat will catch up and bite you! I have bought the habanero version of Tabasco and didn't care for it. That was mainly vinegar with way too much of a black pepper type taste. It is hot, but I ended up throwing that away. This however, I definetly will be buying more of!!! It may overpower your food if you use too much of it, but for most part it merges with your food and creates a new flavor. Those who said it tasted bad or metallic must have had a bad batch.<br /><br />By the way, me, i'm not....well wasn't a big chili person untill recently. I used that mild sauce (aka "weak sauce") up untill a few years ago. So I haven't trained myself into eating stuff as hot as this. Pretty much an average guy with a growing interest for new things : )<br /><br />update: finally did try that Melinda's version of Naja. Did not care for it at all! It had a very quick bite to it and too much of that pepper extract taste (even though it isn't loaded with extract). Sadly the Melinda's is sitting the fridge, barely touched.....but my Dave's is almost done.

review/text: I came home tonight and was ecstatic to see this arrived.  I put hot sauce on pretty much everything and habanero started to loose its umph some time ago.  After preparing some spaghetti, I turned the bottle upside down and tried to shake the paste-like sauce into my bowl.  Excited, I began to smack the bottle.  I probably knocked 6-7 drops into my bowl.  Then I read the bottle, which belatedly instructed me to use one drop.  About 4-5 mins into dinner it hit me; my lips went numb and I began to sweat.  Shortly thereafter my nose began to run.  I went a little bit lighter on the next bowl- like 3 drops.  This was still extremely hot- I continued to sweat and became a little dizzy.  I don't see this stuff bringing a grown man down.  However, it is a half hour later and I think that I am high.  I am also afraid of what tomorrow might bring.  Although this is a must have for those who like hot sauce, you should seriously be weary... it is indeed hot!

review/summary: Death in a Glass Bottle
review/text: Alright.<br /><br />I'm just a sixteen, almost seventeen year old kid. High School Student, bored and wanting to buy some cool stuff. I tend to blow all of my money on cool internet stuff... I figured hot sauce was the next best route to take. I've tried a lot of neat stuff from cool organic pills that change bitter foods to sweet and insane prank sprays, but, I figured this would be my next step in the process.<br /><br />Wow. Just wow. I bought this stuff last week and it arrived this Friday, after picking it up with a good friend of mine, Brandon, at the post office, we headed home. I opened the package and we both vastly underestimated this product. He took a lot of this stuff. A lot. Probably a good-sized spoonful, at once. He was crying. A sheen of sweat covered his face as he fell on the kitchen floor, panting. Water, milk, bread, nothing worked. It was pure agony. He is a spicy fan, so, I was surprised to see this from him. Hesitant myself, as I'm not a big fan of spicy foods, I tried it. I saw the darkness. My left ear felt like it was about to explode and there was a trail of fire leading down my esophagus.<br /><br />I began to stumble around my kitchen, grabbing popsicles and milk and water. I had vastly underestimated the potential of this sauce. It is the destroyer of worlds. I'm not experienced with this stuff, but, my friend is, and it is the hottest thing he's ever had by miles. This stuff is 400x hotter than tabasco sauce on the Scoville scale.<br /><br />I invited my friends Rob, Matt and Cyrus over. Rob barely had a dab and nearly died, Matt took a small amount on a spoon and then downed a glass of milk and said "That's nothing" and smirked, then, a moment later, began swearing and freaking out, grabbing his bottle of fruit juice he brought over and chugging it. Cyrus began to cry and pant heavily. This stuff is amazing. Simply amazing. I added one good sized drop to some tomato soup I made for dinner, as well as a lot of other delicious spices (I'm great at makin'  the stuff) and it really added a lot of flavor and a good amount of heat without making it overbearing.<br /><br />This sauce tastes really good and, as long as you aren't making your friends eat the stuff straight out to witness their horrified reactions, it will last an extremely long time. Do not drink this stuff straight out of the bottle without putting it on some sort of food. Trust me, unless you're looking for a kick, this is not a joke. This stuff is insane, I guess that's why it says "INSANE++" on the bottle. To quote Rob, "It's not hot anymore... IT JUST HURTS!!" Careful with this stuff!

If you just use it to harm your friends as a party trick, that's fine, but it has a nice flavor when consumed with a little restraint.<br /><br />The "real deal", seriously hot enough for any purpose, will probably keep deer out of your garden.

review/summary: The Hottest It Gets
review/text: Dave's Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce is the hottest sauce i've ever had. All that is required to send your mouth on fire is one drop. I just had a dab and my tongue was on fire.<br /><br />This sauce is made with the Hottest Pepper in the World, The Naga Jolokia.<br /><br />It wasn't so hot I couldn't handle it but i'm sure if I had more than that dab I'd be in for more than I could handle. The sensation from the dab lasted a good 15 minutes.<br /><br />The sauce contains the ghost pepper, hot pepper extract, salt, vegetable oil, roasted garlic pulps and acetic acid. It's a delicious addition to many foods- especially sauces, meat and ethnic foods. Not for people with heart/respiratory problems.<br /><br />Amazon has the best price i've seen on the sauce so far. So, if you like it spicy and you want to try a sauce with the Ghost Pepper in it, I Highly Recommend it... If you can handle it, that is.

review/summary: Heat Disappointing, Taste Pleasant
review/text: I purchased this sauce because I recently tried a raw Naga pepper and it was extremely hot and hoped this sauce would rival the real thing.  I am definitely a chili head, I have no problem eating extremely hot peppers, sauces, etc.  For me this sauce disappointed as far as "extreme heat", however the flavoring is quite pleasant.  I did have some of my co-workers try on a tortilla chip and a couple of them were almost in tears and said it was the hottest thing they have ever tried.  If anyone knows of any other hotter sauces please let me know (other than pure capsaicin crystals which I would never touch!)

review/summary: Sauce not meant to be inhaled
review/text: While heating up some oil to fry some vegetables and an egg on, I threw about a tablespoon of this sauce into the frying pan for seasoning. I had used about 1/3 of the bottle so I knew what I was getting myself into. I must have not realized that the oil was too hot to add liquid to without causing it to vaporize. Instantly after pouring it in it began to boil violently. A sizeable cloud of Dave's hot sauce quickly formed above the pan. I thought it would be OK at first. I backed off after getting a small whiff of it. It was very potent--like mace. After about 25 seconds I couldn't stop coughing but I continued cooking thinking that just the small whiff had gotten into the wrong place in my throat and I would soon return to normal. Little did I know that it's vapors were spreading throughout the house. Within minutes my roommates were coughing across the house. My dog was also wheezing.<br />After opening all the windows and doors in the house and turning some fans on I ate my egg/vegetable patty sandwich. Even with no visible signs of Dave's hot sauce left in the pan it was still very hot, to my liking.<br />This sauce should be used with caution. When consumed the wrong way it is very unpleasant.

review/summary: Not all that...
review/text: To those of you who tried this and wrote a life story about how you thought you were the baddest when it came to handling HOTTT sauces but tried this, died and gone to heaven:  I must say that I'm actually quite disappointed because I expected hotter.  I got this sauce in the mail today, tried it and was disappointed.  I then ate our own home grown naga morris with dinner (naga bhut/naga jolokia) and that ended up being hotter! I just tried the sauce again for the second time today and I'm even more disappointed now.  After reading all the stories people posted here, I seriously thought this was it, but this is far from being "it".  I cannot and will not claim, like most of you, that I can handle the hottest of the hot sauces, but this I will say with all honesty: this sauce is a DISAPPOINTMENT!  I hope to find something hotter; maybe I'll skip the Dave's brand next time.  To those reading my post: If you're looking for the ultimate HOT sauce, this isn't it.  This is far from "it".

review/text: I eat alot of spicy food, and I had a small taste of this straight and it is pretty hot!!!<br />It has a very distinct aroma and taste. It is a very tasty sauce, but so hot! I mixed between a quarter and a half of the bottle into a 1 litre much milder chili sauce. And it is still pretty hot with a long lasting effect, this is not wasabi and you can probably feel it for 15 minutes.<br />I do not think many people eat this straight, you do not need much if you want to spice a casserole. Do not get this on your fingers! you might forget and touch your face with some particles on your hands , Ouch!<br />I wanted a really really really hot sauce and this is it.

review/summary: fantastic sauce!
review/text: There are plenty of reviews about this sauce that I feel did a good job describing it. I'll focus on what jumped out at me in particular. First off, when you open up the bottle (after shaking it to death, just like you should on all extract sauces) you notice an aroma distinctly vinegar, with naga fruitieness and a hint of garlic. The taste is just amazing! You can't even taste the extract over the powerful naga sweetness. The one area you will surely notice the extract is in your stomach. Never use this stuff on an already empty stomach, best to prime the pumps. Even an iron gut may fall pray to uncontrollable stomach cramps. And yes, this stuff is pretty hot. Way to hot for most people in fact, even though I was only able to make my bottle last a week (did I mention that I eat whole naga jolokia peppers with no liquid or food?). So if you are able to finish your bottle in a week email me at ... we'll get together and get our heads checked.

review/text: This is the real deal...not some watered down ghost pepper sauce found at local farmer's market. I love spicy food and add a few drops to my own sauces/salsas to bring them up to a level that most people have never experienced. Its become somewhat of an addiction for myself and I love the stuff. However, you may want to give clear warning to guests if your serving it up at a friends and family get together! Otherwise you may not have anymore friends or family.  A bottle of this stuff should last a year or two as just a dab will do.

It's definitely hotter than any other sauce that I've bought at a store and the heat lingers for a while after being consumed.  The shipping was very decent also (ordered on Thursday, received on Monday from seller ACSS).  The taste, however, has left me with something to be desired.  It just tastes like any other hot pepper.  I was hoping it would have some other spices in there to really get the flavor going, but it doesn't.  Bummer.

review/text: when i first got the sauce, me and my friend tried just a small dab of it and it was great. the heat rose considerably since the initial intake but soon downsided. me and my friend where having a cook out later that night and we brought down the sauce with us to put on our burgurs and hot dogs, also for otheres to try. the cook out started at sundown and one of my friends took the ghost pepper sauce thinking it was BBQ sauce and drenched his burgur in it. i could feel the sting of the sauce in my nose and looked around to see who used the sauce and saw my friend set the bottle down and i could see the sauce dripping from his burgar. he took a big bite before i could say anything. he was drunk and didnt notice the initial pain but not even 5 minutes after he finished the burgar he was running around screamming bloody murder dranking every thing in site. it was one hell of a site but he soon had go to the hospital for sedation because he couldnt sleep and the heat kept rising. we found out in the morning he put about 1/5 of the bottle on his burgar. this stuff is no joke use with caution.<br />good in chili, water down to 1 table spoon per 2 ounces of water and soak burgurs in for min of 5 hours before grilling, same for chicken and pot roast.

review/summary: The Food Enlivener
review/text: A month after buying this bottle and ready to purchase my next one, I can safely say this has made food fun again.  I have the 5oz. bottle at home and have nearly consumed it in that time, and also keep a smaller bottle (obtained from the 4-pack gift crate) at work.  The odor/flavor is reminiscent of Tabasco, but with a level of bite that would grab ANYBODY's notice.<br /><br />First, I should say that I never use this directly as a food topping, but instead blend it into a sauce of one sort or another.  I practically live off of Bird's Eye Lightly Sauced vegetables (one of which is a penne in alfredo sauce, another is rigatoni/vegetables in tomato parmesan), and this stuff complements them nicely.  Cut a hole in the bag, pour a liberal dose in, and shake the bag up until the contents are thoroughly mixed.  In the case of the alfredo sauce, I enjoy the heat at the point where the sauce has taken to a light orange tinge, but mileage may vary.  It mixes nicely with ketchup as well.  I would recommend a 1:10 ratio between the hot sauce and whatever base you're combining it with, but this is purely a matter of preference.<br /><br />I would only assume that if you're reading this, you already know the heat that a ghost pepper packs, and if you want scare stories feel free to read the other reviews.  If what you want is a good way to [literally] spice up any dish, though, I think you need look no further.  Carry an emergency bottle for trips to places that promise spicy food but fail to deliver.

review/summary: Pretty good, but not as hot as I expected
review/text: My boyfriend and I love all things hot..  Our refrigerator door is stocked with over a dozen varieties of hot sauces, ranging from "it's not hot but it's fantastic on chicken", to "do you want to use the liquid death in our Ramen tonight"?  As well as an assortment of hot pepper spices in our spice cabinet (including home grown dried and crushed habanero peppers)..  So when I saw the Dave's Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce at the local Kroger, I was elated, thinking I'd have something perhaps hotter than my "liquid death"...  As others have stated, it's a very thick and pasty sauce.  And it's got a pretty decent flavor, but it's still not the hottest sauce in my stash.  And it's definitely not the most flavorful.  (Tropical Pepper Company's Habanero X Line has them beat in the flavor category)..  Maybe this is a sauce that gets hotter over time..  I guess time will tell.

review/text: I was probably like many of you...let's get the hottest stuff on the market and have "fun" with it. I was looking for something that would impress others and pull some "dare you" pranks with. I tasted this stuff with a drop on my tongue. It was as if Satan had taken up permanent residence on my taste buds, but it was kind of a nasty "manufactured" hot. I was actually disappointed...that was until I added just one little drop to some Pace salsa. Man, it took that Pace salsa and turned it into something special. The Naga Jolokia pepper tastes added so much yumminess. I now find myself adding one tiny drop, yes that's enough, to many of my dishes. If you like things super spicey or just a little spicey, this is the bottle for you.

But, this sauce I've had for six months, and have used less than a tablespoon of it.  My advice... make sure you have a glass of milk right along side you when you have some of this sauce and oh yeah...start small.

review/summary: Hot, but that's about it
review/text: I've been itching to get my hands on Dave's for quite some time. When I saw the Ghost Chili variety, I was quite pleased, as I am currently growing the chilis in my own garden to make sauce, so I thought I'd finally check it out.<br />What I got was a rather large bottle of thick sauce that smells pretty fierce, and has no flow control. I imagine the lack of flow control on the bottle is to make up for the thickness of the sauce, but it really seems like this sauce is made for idiots to suffer on youtube.<br /><br />I dipped my finger in and gave it a try, and what I found was a pretty disgusting sauce. It has a very bitter taste, unlike any other sauces I've tried. Ofcourse, after the initial disgust, I was in pain. This sauce will make your speech slur, and your next meal to be flavorless and bland. It IS however, very entertaining.

review/summary: Extremely Hot, but Nice Flavor as Well
review/text: As a huge hot sauce fan, I admit I buy a lot of hot sauce that is purely for fun. It's just something to try and make my friends taste and go crazy, or just something I use when I want something super hot. Those types of sauces are just for show and you can't really use it for actual food.<br /><br />That's where this hot sauce is a little different. It is not the hottest I've tried, but it is VERY hot and its enough to feel the burn all the way down. It's in the big leagues for heat, but also has an awesome flavor. It works great with chili and mexican food.<br /><br />I expected it to be more like a ghost pepper (which I've eaten raw) but it wasn't as close as I imagined. However it does have that flavor, if that's what you like. It's a smoky flavor with a lot of heat.<br /><br />It was shipped fast and everything I expected. Good stuff!

I will have to agree with the above reviews in regards to the heat index. I tried the smallest dab on the end of my fork and must say the taste is good, kind of a cross with tabasco and louisiana hot sauce but the burning sensation of a thousand fire ants stinging the inside of my mouth quickly blocked the ability to taste anymore.<br />After mixing with a bit of other hot sauce in the fridge the ghost pepper sauce is a lot easier on the system. Still had a sweat on but at least I can handle it now.

review/summary: Item definitely as described
review/text: Received this a day earlier than the estimated ETA (ordered 1/16 and received 1/19).  It showed up packaged nicely in big thick bubble wrap contained within an innocent-looking plain shipping box.  Didn't know it had arrived until I checked my tracking status through amazon and seen that it had delivered.  Went out to the mailbox a little bit ago and brought it in.  Not sure how long it was out there, but I think it was partially frozen (current outside temp is 10 degrees).  However - frozen or not - this stuff means business.<br /><br />I actually hesitated for a bit before breaking the plastic seal and opening the bottle.  Tried telling myself that I may as well let it thaw before opening - yet I think I was just stalling.  For better or worse, though, I decided to open it up and give it a try.  Using a small narrow measuring spoon (1/8 teaspoon I believe) I put a small dab of this lava-colored stuff on the end of the spoon.  Hesitated for a bit longer before placing spoon in my mouth and seeing what it was all about.  It took roughly 1 second before my tongue gave me that info in short order.<br /><br />Immediate taste was very pleasant with a taste of its own for this particular pepper sauce.  I am by no means a 'chili head' or enjoy eating a lot of hot sauce with my food, but I can say that I did enjoy the flavor more than tobasco or habanero sauce.  However, the flavor was almost immediately dwarfed by an intense burning sensation on my tongue which made its way down my throat.  After about a minute or so the burning was in full effect with sinuses cleared and my complete undivided attention directed toward pain management.  Call me a wuss, but I ended up going for a glass of milk about 3 or 4 minutes after tasting a very small dab of this stuff.  It's truly amazing how fast milk can provide nearly instant relief from this type of pain.  Nearly an hour later and my tongue still has a slight burning sensation lingering where initial contact was made.<br /><br />Use with caution.  As others have stated - the bottle does not have a regulator cap.  Mine had a thick consistency which was probably due to it being partially frozen.  But even at a very cold temperature, this hot sauce will seem like a gift from Prometheus himself.

review/summary: Nice alternative to habaneros
review/text: I've been raised on chili. My mom, grandfather, etc all grew their own chili gardens and we had handmade chili at just about ever meal growing up so I'm not try any new chili I get a chance to. I got a chance to try this one when I visited my uncle that had just bought a bottle. He told me how he had pranked several people at work with it and they thought it way very very hot. He didn't think so himself. After trying it myself I can say it's hot enough. Up there with a bottle of habanero. See thing is after a chili is as hot as a habanero you really don't need anything hotter. If you pour more than a teaspoon at a time you are asking for trouble/pain. Just a single drop was enough to get my eyes to water and tongue to burn all over. I was disappointed that it didn't get hotter over time since I saw some other people reviewing this chili where they said it got hotter over time and burned all the way down to their stomach. I guess if I tried to down the whole bottle at once, but I'm not crazy enough to do that!

review/text: If you want something really spicy on your food...then look no further! This stuff is hot, especially the first time you try, i have pranked many people into trying it, i tell them nahhh its not hot its like tapatio hot sauce but it taste better and so they pour it all over their food and after 2 bites they give up, i have made wings with this and gave some to my cousins and they went into their fridge to drink a whole gallon of milk! The taste is very good. I bought 2 bottles but after that i found that they sell this product for  6.99 at world market so i save myself money buying it there.

review/text: this sauce seemed weak at first, maybe I used too little.  Which brings me to the next session.  Second time I used quite a bit more and was finally perfect for the hotness.  It does bring tears to the eyes.  Not too bad, but I have been cooking with MAD DOG 357.  That is the real hurt right there.  Only  The Source  extract is hotter than but more expensive(never tried) yet!!!  Anyway, eating this right now while writing, so good(perfect, but does take a little more than a few drops).  At first, each bite might take you a minute or two to get thru at first, but trust you will want more and will finish.  Your food might be cold before you finish, but the heat will still be there.  Thankfully, this is not an extract, so you can pour more on.  Just beware, it does say keep refrigerated, dont know why......

review/text: I bought this for my fiance because no hot sauce on the planet seems to be hot enough for him.  I just opened it and tasted a single drop.  My chest started to hurt and I began coughing. It has been about 5 minutes and the sensation of a bag of pop-rocks in my mouth is finally beginning to subside.  That being said, the flavor is AMAIZING.  If you want something that 1tastes great with the sensation of getting punched in the stomach, this is the product for you.  I am sold and a fan for life!

review/summary: Wow!!! This is super hot!!!!
review/text: I ordered this bottle knowing it may come in well after thanksgiving. It arrived much sooner than anticipated. When I first got the bottle I immediately opened it and was greeted with a sweet&smokey aroma. I tried one drop and flavor was amazing. Shortly thereafter, my tongue was immersed in a sea of searing pain. I would have much rather placed my tongue on a searing iron covered in rubbing alcohol. Fast forward to thanksgiving, I had a guest over that considered himself a "hot sauce connoisseur" and able to handle any kind of heat. I let him know to use only one drop, he ignored my warning a proceeded to douse his turkey the fiery red liquid. After finishing the first slice he was in obvious pain, profusely sweating, and he seemed on the verge of crying. Three beer and two glasses of milk later he seemed to approach normal again. I would recommend following the clear warning on the side of the bottle......try one drop and move up from there

review/text: This is a good to have for people who use Sriracha instead of ketchup (me).  Has a smokey ripe fruit flavor to kick it off that I imagine Tabasco would taste like if it didn't taste watered down.  Note: not talking about heat yet, only flavor.  It doesn't last very long but it is nice.  Wait a few seconds for the heat to begin.  Not an instant heat but it will take you to a nice place.  If you are anything like me, Mark Twain, you have some endorphins going right now.  Congrats.  You may want to have some milk nearby if you are not used to this sort of thing.  Also that lady who gave a teaspoon to her husband did not read the part on the bottle that says one drop at a time.  I am not surprised if he had a little heartburn.

review/summary: Endorphin Therapy
review/text: I've suffered from chronic pain in the head and sinuses for many years, and got tired of taking all the medications I take. I thought that maybe I could trigger my own endorphins to take up some of the weight. I started with jalapenos, and that worked for a little while, but it's a lot to eat. So I tried some regular grocery-store hot sauces, and I was swigging them just to get a decent burn. Then I decided to go for something very hot and found Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Sauce. Little dabs with my finger to my tongue causes a good burn, but it took a bit more than a dab to get the endorphin burn going. Each endorphin burn gets rid of the headache/sinus pain for about an hour. Still, it's the best I've tried yet. I've read it runs 650,000 scoville units, at 130x the heat of a jalapeno.

review/summary: It's just amazing.
review/text: Like all the other reviews state, it is ridiculously hot.  However, it is also typically used incorrectly, whether it be on purpose, or an accident.  Personally, if I accidentally got a giant glob of this on something, I'd just trash it and start over.<br /><br />You seriously only need to put a couple drops (1 just doesn't do it for me, but a glob WILL leave you hurting) to add the amazing flavor, without killing your taste buds, or yourself.<br /><br />My family are a bunch of wimps when it comes to hot food, I however really like it.  So I got a bottle of this, after having tried some at a company lunch in Chicago.  It is perfect if used properly.<br /><br />Recommend it for anyone that likes to add a kick, with a good flavor, along with the caution: USE IT RIGHT!  Don't try and impress anyone, and you'll be in heaven.

The tuna itself is pretty good (I'd probably give it alone 4 stars), but the REALLY STUPID tab top type opening cans are a real menace.  They are NOT easy open (the can height itself is too short to make the tab top efficient); and once it is opened, the remaining edge is so sharp that it IS easy to cut oneself on it.  I will definitely not order this brand again unless they change the design of the can opening.

review/text: I am very impressed with the new Peanut Butter Grahamfuls by Honey Maid, which I just tried for the first time this week. They are fantastic! The portion is quite generous - enough to tame that hunger that gets you between breakfast and lunch. The graham cracker is very crunchy but does not fall apart when you bite into it. The peanut butter filling is thick and satisfying. The overall flavor is very favorable - a tad sweet but not cloying (like so many prepackaged snack bars are). They are very convenient and tidy to eat, and they really help fill the mid-morning hunger void and carry you through to lunch. I'm an adult but these would make a great snack for kids, too - especially after school to carry a kid through until dinner. Pair one with a few apple slices on the side and you've got it made! I really hope these make it on the market and are not discontinued like so many awesome new products tend to be. I'll be buying them every week! Nice work, Honey Maid!!!

This does take longer than any pasta that I have ever cooked. I timed it to take about 14-16 minutes. Plus it releases quite a bit of starch and rinsing has become a necessity to get rid of the goo. After I rinse the pasta I put it back in a pan w/melted butter or oil, and then top with sauce. Works like a charm.

And these are red COLORED anise/licorice flavored ....they taste nothing like 'red licorice'.  I bought several different types and none of them have me running out to re-order the product.  Sorry Eda ...just saying !

review/text: I'm obsessed with Golazo's Mandarina energy drink -- it's delicious orange taste is refreshingly good -- especially after finishing a work out. It not only tastes amazing, it is also guilt-free energy. It's all-natural ingredients is better than all the other energy drinks out there. Golazo Mandarina is AMAZING! I promise you'll love it as soon as you taste it!

review/summary: Best energy drink out there!
review/text: This drink is delicious. I was surprised at the magnificent taste and really liked that it has only natural ingredients. I have used this drink before and after soccer games and it is superb (especially when it is ice cold). Let your palate be the judge, but give this drink a try...it made me a believer. This is a liquid masterpiece in my book.

review/text: I am generally not a big fan of the "energy drink" taste, but tried this one based on a friend's recommendation and it is really good! The mandarin flavor is delicious but not overpowering and it gives me a nice energy boost without crashing later. The fact that it's natural is a huge bonus. I'll be trying the other flavors soon.

review/text: this coffee is a no no... why!? the reason why i bought this in the first place is because i've never seen this flavor before so i just got this to try... i followed the instruction and it somehow dont even work... no flavor to it at all and the color is nearly clear... so what i have to do to get the flavor is to put coffee in a pot and boil it... which is a big hassle. so i would rather stick with the original flavor... yuMmMm!!!

review/summary: Better tasting than the Dark Roast pods
review/text: I loved the idea and ease of the Senseo, but I was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted.  The grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety, so I decided to take a chance and order the Columbia Blend from Amazon.  I have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what I had been getting.<br /><br />If you are up for a change and want a smoother flavor, but still a strong tasting coffee.  Give it a try!<br /><br />I will note that the bag only comes with 16 pods vs. 18 in the regular bags.

review/text: The first time I ordered this coffee, it was great.  But the second time, it was undrinkable.  A couple months later I ordered again thinking it was just a bad batch.  But no, it was still undrinkable.  These pods produce something that has no similarity to coffee.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for making good on both bad orders with a refund.

review/summary: I wish it could be ZERO stars!!!
review/text: Anyone who really loves a gourmet cup of coffee will HATE this! It's burnt, bitter, weak, battery-acid! And, as consequence, those coffee lovers may begin to hate their new Senseo -- but take heart! Many online coffee shops now offer decent to delectable coffees at prices that rival this cheap swill. I don't specifically want to endorse any one product or online retailer but do a google search for "senseo compatible pods" and you'll find several on the first page. Also, please note that while these may initially seem pricier, most third party pods work with JUST ONE to make an 8-ounce cup instead of the two pods that Senseo brand products demand. You do the math and it works out to be a comparable costing cup of joe.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Hubby loves the rich taste
review/text: I don't drink much coffee, so it doesn't make sense to brew a full pot for my husband to have a couple of cups in the morning. We began using the pod coffee system years ago when the Home Cafe systems were introduced (before the current K-cup models). The pod coffee system is perfect for our household, and Senseo is just about the only manufacturer still offering the pods. My husband rotates the Columbian with Sumatra and Expresso pods, but the Columbian is his favorite, and he says that it is a very rich and flavorful blend. The aroma when the coffee is brewing is wonderful, and for anyone who only drinks a few cups, this system is probably as cost effective as brewing a pot of coffee and throwing out half the pot; plus, with this system, every cup is fresh, not stale or left-over. The Columbian is a rich and dark blend and perfect for coffee drinkers who want a traditional flavor of coffee.

Buying 4 at a time with Amazon's 'Subscribe and Save' offer, the shipping is free and you get a discounted price of only $14.87.  You will not find these pods anywhere at this price.<br />You can even skip a month without losing your savings benefits, or have them sent even earlier.<br />I put half a pkg of diet dry hot chocolate mix in (12 1/2 calories) and one tablespoon of Cool Whip Lite (20 calories) and have very lo-cal foamy, delicious Cafe Mocha right at home with under 50 calories, as opposed to a cup at a 'groovy' coffee shop which can have up to 400 calories and cost up to $4.<br />Every cup is foamy and delicious.  You can even make expresso with this machine and these pods.<br />Goodbye Mr Coffee and ordinary coffee forever@

review/summary: My Second Favorite AFTER Sumatra
review/text: I have been an avid senseo fan for about a year.  However, I was getting a bit bored drinking the same Dark Roast every morning (I found the other flavors too mild).  So I was very happy when I saw the new flavors  (Sumatra, Colombia, Kenya and Brazil).  After trying all of them, this is my close second favorite.
