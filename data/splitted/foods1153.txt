review/summary: Great kitty food
review/text: My two kitties differ on many of their food preferences, and we are also mindful of their health and so we try to limit their fish intake.  So, we are grateful that we found the wellness turkey recipe.  It's something that they both absolutely love and something that we feel good about feeding them.

review/text: I would truly recommend this brand to anyone with a cat. My cat had a ton of problems - from vomitting to diarrhea and really smelly poop. Not only did this solve all those issues, but he now has the most silkiest, softest, shiniest fur. The quantity of food intake has also decreased. No more begging for food every 5 minutes. Another bonus - my cat now has a lean and toned body that I'm envious of.<br />This product will save you a lot of trips to the vet!!!

review/summary: Good, healthy food
review/text: Did some googling on kitten nutrition and found that the food I was feeding my kitten did not have very high water content and that she was supposed to be eating a meat based food (grain is no good for cats).  This food seemed to match well with what google told me, and I've been feeding her this wet food for 2 months now.  She seems to like the food and she looks great.  She seemed pretty healthy before as well, but there was a noticeable difference after I switched her food.  Her coat is shinier and softer, she's more energetic, and has been maintaining a good weight.  I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I think its worth the price and I will keep buying it.

review/summary: Great, natural product
review/text: Wellness is a great cat food that my kitties just love. I chose this brand for its natural ingredients. Two of my cats have issues - one with diabetes and one with obesity. I needed a cat food that is grain free (for the fat kitty) and low carb (for the diabetic kitty). If you need a cat food that is not loaded with byproduct garbage, then Wellness is a great choice.

review/summary: Excellent Grain-Free Option
review/text: I ordered the Wellness Turkey to create a rotation for our kitten with Felidae grain-free formula. Until tonight he had only eaten Felidae, but when I opened a can of Wellness he went crazy for it! This will definitely be a part of our food rotation. Very high-quality food, mostly protein from excellent meat sources.

review/summary: Better than most canned food but still BAD
review/text: I have a cat who had serious intestinal issues. I needed a canned food that was grain free and also I need a protein that was not chicken - I had to start my cat on a novel protein. I bought this on the recommendation of a veterinarian (L. Pierson) on her web site, for so called "acceptable" canned food, because it is grain free. However if you read the ingredients list, it contains other ingredients that the same veterinarian says are allergenic to cats (e.g. carageenan). Also, even though its name claims it is "Turkey", (the turkey was supposed to be the novel protein for me) the ingredients list lists chicken and chicken parts as its 2nd, 3rd and 4th ingredients. It also has the same type of thickeners, fillers, and "flavoring" that all the other run of the mill canned pet food has.<br /><br />I originally gave this a 3 star rating (because it doesn't contain grains), but as I typed my review I was reminded of the deception and it made me change it to a 2 star.

review/summary: Positive for Wellness
review/text: My background is 50 years of dog/cat owner and college degree in chemistry so I'm not completely ignorant about pet nutrition. After a few days of Google research and reading pet food negatives and positives, I decided on a mix of Wellness both wet and the dry exclusively for my two rescue/shelter kitties based on reviews and availability. Price was not a deciding factor. After 1-1/2 years, they still gobble it down and I'm pleased to report both kitties mental and physical health to be outstanding with shiney, smooth coats, regular bowel movements, and healthy, energetic activity. I contribute this good fortune mostly to their diet of Wellness and a loving home environment although my billfold wouldn't mind if it were a bit cheaper. In my experience, Wellness has been outstanding.

review/text: We have been transitioning our 4 cats over from the crap Purina makes to Wellness, and for most of the flavors, they love it. They like it much better than Friskies. Yesterday was the first time we tried the Salmon and Trout flavor, and absolutely none of them would touch it. They left it in their dishes all day and went hungry.<br /><br />I'll still give it 3 stars, because overall Wellness is better than anything else out there. Just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders.

review/text: My two cats will eat anything. So why do I even care what they eat? I care because it's about their health and it's a important responsibility I accepted when I adopted them. This Wellness Canned food is very fresh and (according to the experts) has all the healthy nutrition cats need. I've tried a few different brands and this one gives my cats the best soft, full coat and even makes their poop smell less (super bonus!). It's pricier, but give it a shot.

review/text: During one of my "We've got to eat healthier" phases, I found this product. My family hates these phases because of the changes that take place.  We've begun to eat healthier over the years, but brown rice is one thing I can't get them to eat.  My son HATES brown rice, and anything he thinks might be healthy for that matter. Anyway, I decided to try it in spite of the complaints I knew I'd hear.  I like brown rice and it sounded interesting.  I used it in a recipe that normally called for white rice and it turned out great, EVEN my son liked it.  It does take a little while to cook and it is a little pricey, but it tastes good and it's good for you.

review/text: In the past, I have avoided brown rice, although I knew it was much better than white rice from a healthy eating standpoint, because I just couldn't get into the taste and texture.  While this blend does not have a significantly different texture, the taste and aroma are wonderful.  Rice is a large part of the Southern diet and this blend takes dishes to a new level.  Following the cooking directions will yield a perfect product, not gummy,  but very satisfying, especially for a meatless diet or entree.

review/summary: Better than sliced bread
review/text: I tried the Rice Select Royal Blend with a bit of hesitation as I am one who really has never cared for rice.<br />What I found was a product that truly surpassed what I thought rice could be like. This blend is absolutely delicious easy to prepare and goes well with everything.<br />While it does take a while to cook, I usually let it go for 50 minutes instead of their recommended 45 it is worth the wait.<br />The red and brown rice, being whole grain are of course good for you but they are tasty too.<br />The barley and rye included in this give the extra kick that rice has always needed for me. To me, it smells like popcorn while cooking but the flavor is much better.<br />I consider this the one food item that I now have to have in my cupboard and I eat it multiple times a week.<br />Personally, I eat it with a bit of salmon or tuna mixed in but have tried it with other protein sources and loved it with all of them.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOSD64">Bumble Bee Albacore Steak Mesquite Tuna, 4-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LLHRT0">Bumble Bee Pink Lemon and Dill Salmon Steak, 4-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a><br />Give this a try and I swear, you will never go back to plain old rice again.

review/summary: One of the best rice blends I've ever tasted
review/text: In an attempt to make my diet less dependent upon simple carbs, I've been shopping for whole grain products that don't taste like sand, cardboard or twigs and pebbles.  RiceSelect has come up with a clear winner with this blend of three different grain products: Two types of rice, barley and rye.  It has a warm, comforting quality, good flavor and is just loaded with the kind of fiber we all need.  You could do a lot worse and believe me, I have.<br /><br />Try cooking it in stock or broth and adding just a touch of butter and salt.  I make mine in my rice cooker (If you eat a lot of grains, get one.  Trust me on this, you'll thank me in the end.  Zojirushi makes some of the best.) and it's a nearly no-fuss operation.  Ingredients in, cooker on, walk away.  Come back to an amazing meal.

review/summary: Another great blend of whole grain goodness!
review/text: This rice is wonderful and I highly recommend it.  I use an automatic rice cooker so there is no work or guessing involved.  I think what I like best about this rice is the texture.  It has a lot of "crunch" left in it after cooking.  The Pearled Barley & Rye Berries add to that crunchy texture.  I sometimes like to add a bit of wild rice to the blend as well.  This rice blend has a lot more flavor than plain, white rice.  We also know that this whole grain product is much more healthy for you than the plain white variety.  I have occasionally found this rice in some of the stores where I shop but far too often I search for it in vain.  Thankfully, I can count on Amazon to have this in stock!!!<br /><br />I also like the Rice Select Royal Blend with Brown & Wild Rice with Soft Wheat & Rye Berries.  I alternate between these two varieties to keep things interesting.  I always make a big batch of this rice because the "planned overs" are also very good and can be used in a number of ways!

review/text: I purchased this on Dec 21 for a New Years arrival. It arrived on Dec 23. Off to a good start. I served this hm on New Years day to 8 people. They all loved it. One of them asked for Burger's Smokehouse contact info so she could order one next time. It was flavorful, not too salty, moist and tender.<br />What I did was wrap it up in foil like the instructions said and baked at 325. I then removed it from the oven, cut off the skin and fat and glazed it under the broiler.<br />Don't let the fact that it comes with it's skin and fat intact scare you off. This ham is delicious and the fat cap helps keep it moist. It made excellent fried ham for breakfast the next day and great ham sandwiches for lunch.<br />One clue to a quality ham is when you cut open the wrapper, a bunch of juice doesn't leak out which tells the consumer that this ham didn't have water added like many do. There are so many grades to ham that most people aren't aware of. They go in order of quality as follows:<br />Ham<br />Ham with natural juices<br />Ham with water added<br />Ham and water product<br /><br />For special occasions, most people want one of the two highest grades which are not easy to find in your local grocery store.<br />This "city ham" is one with natural juices but it certainly comes very close in quality to the higher grade "ham".<br />This is one of the best hams I've had.

I typically by the "Buzzworthy" and fill my "to go" coffee cup twice (using my Melitta Coffee maker, one large cup and one small cup buttons).  It's perfectly diluted, but still strong.  My mom prefers this brand, "Love At First Sip".  It's a milder blend, but still VERY good, even when pressing the small cup button twice.<br /><br />These coffee blends taste like the gourmet coffee you buy in the trendy coffee houses.  You will LOVE these coffees!

review/summary: The standard cup for camparison.
review/text: We have ordered this coffee several times over the past months to the exclusion of other brands. This makes a good everyday cup of coffee. It has Bold flavor without bitterness when produced using a Senseo machine. The frothing is even there. The pods are slightly smaller than those made for the Senseo but work well if placed carefully. The price is very competitive considering the quality of the product.

review/summary: Pods Ok but
review/text: Melitta has a good taste and if you have no choice but to buy for your Senseo coffee maker, they are ok but you must know in advance they don't fit the senseo very well (too thick) and you have to force closing the top which I felt was the reason i had to replace my coffee maker.

review/summary: Does not work in coffee makers as advertised
review/text: I purchased this product when Senseo pods were hard to obtain and thought it would be a good fill in.  The first pod broke my senseo machine and I should have given up then, however, the coffee box said it would work in any pod machine so I tried it in a Hamiliton Beach pod machine.  No luck, tasted like warm, brown water. Be very careful if you buy this product, it may ruin your machine or at the very least just be bad coffee.

review/summary: melitta pods for Senseo coffee makers
review/text: There is a problem with the Melitta pods for Senseo coffee makers. The pods are too thick and cause the locking mechanism to pop open during the brewing process, spilling<br />hot water outside of the nozzle. I have tried this multiple times, with the same result. If you use a used pod, the  already compressed pod works alright, but, of course, is not<br />producing full flavored coffee.

review/text: These pods do fit in a Senseo machine - they are larger and thicker, so it's a tighter fit, but they work. The spring on my old Senseo lid broke long ago, but the thing still closes tight and doesn't leak, so I'm aware of the fit issues. In short, the Melitta pods are quite superior to the Senseo brand ones, and they make a better cup of coffee. It's my daily cup, and pretty tasty. It's not the ultimate, greatest ever, but it's good coffee.

The pods were too big, and caused hot water to leak and spray out of the machine while in use!

Better than hot spraying water, though!

They are thicker than the Senseo pods and when using them the Senseo lid pops open and hot water spills out. After contacting Melitta they send me an email saying I would have to buy soft pods.

review/summary: Makes very weak coffee with a Hamilton Beach single cup machine
review/text: I've got a tiny Hamilton Beach single cup coffee maker that uses senseo pods. These melitta pods make a terrible cup of coffee in the machine, versus Senseo pods that actually turn out reasonably tasty for something so easy. I usually like a nice strong coffee (ie french press, aeropress), but for weekdays I settle for a quick and easy cup to get me going. However, the Melitta pods don't meet even a basic definition of coffee as far as I can tell. I've actually tried soaking the pods directly in hot water, and even then there is very little flavor. Kind of unbelievable. There is plenty of caffeine, just no taste whatsoever.

review/summary: Good flavor, does not fit senseo well
review/text: I like this coffee, but as others have mentioned the pod is a bit thicker than the senseo.<br /><br />I tried both options:<br /><br />Put it in the single pod basket on the senseo, force the lock closed. This works well but feels like you will break the machine with time. It really needs forcing.<br /><br />Or you can put it in the double pod holder. The problem here is it is too loose and does not seal well leaving you with weak coffee. You can moisten the pod before putting it in the machine. This does result in good coffee but is an extra step.<br /><br />Also they come individually wrapped. Perfect for a hotel or other public use, but a bit of extra waste at home.<br /><br />I won't buy again, and am looking for another pod that works with Senseo.

review/summary: Skeptical at First, but Now a Big Fan
review/text: My dog was initially skeptical about these thick, square, rather bulky biscuit and the first few days actually snubbed the product entirely.<br /><br />What he was doing and I later caught on to this was chewing them after lights out and after I'd gone to bed. I finally realized this when I awoke hearing a definite crunch by my bedside. I was very happy to see him eating and actually enjoying this pretty good quality snack.<br /><br />After the secret was out, he no longer kept them for bedtime chewing  but accepted them at any time I offered them.<br /><br />There are no wheat, corn, chicken or poultry by-products and when you see the overwhelming number of snack of poor nutrition, it's nice to experiment with healthier treats.<br /><br />These are large so this particular biscuit probably wouldn't be right for a little puppy, maybe a larger breed older puppy.

review/summary: OLD??? HARD AS A ROCK!!!
review/text: I have been buying Sweet Potato and Yam treats for my 3 dogs for the past year or two. My dogs love them so we make sure we always have a good supply on hand. I purchased these particular treats from this particular supplier because the price was a bit less than usual. However, they are so HARD that even my big dog has a hard time chewing them!! And my older small dog will not even try to chew them, though they are his favorite treat. This is the second time I ordered this product from this supplier and both orders were the same, the treats are too hard for the dogs to chew!! I ordered a second time hoping I just got a bad batch from them or something. However, both orders were the same, too hard for the dogs to chew!! I don't know if they have been allowed to sit around and get old and hard, or what. All I do know for sure is that I will not be ordering any more items from this supplier!! It's not cheap if you have to throw it away in the end!!

review/text: I just wanted to say that if you want to get your dog a healthy snack alternative, this product would be a good one; if the vendor did not ship you old, outdated, dried out and hard crap.  Very disappointed.  Luckily, I found a store that is close to me that carries this item that is fresh.  I would NOT recommend this vendor to anyone.

review/summary: MAY BE DANGEROUS! Product developed white mold!
review/text: I bought these imported sweet potato chips because they are less than half the price of SAM'S YAMS which are my dog's favorite treats. The first bag seemed fine, but the stored bags all developed what appears to be a silvery white mold, although the expiration date is December, 2013. I have no idea if this could be dangerous to dogs, but I tossed mine out, because we have had terrible problems with food poisoning of our pets from imported ingredients.<br /><br />If anyone else has had this experience I would like to know if the white stuff is natural or is, in fact, dangerous. Thanks!

review/summary: Sweet Potato Review
review/text: We've tried several types of sweet potato treats but this is the best we've found so far, mainly because it's the only one our yorkie will eat:) Others are so hard/rubbery you can't even cut them with a knife. This brand is chewable for bigger dogs and tearable for our yorkie plus she loves the flavor. My only concern is that the product is made in China but the ingredients seem pure.

If I'm leaving the house, and I'm going to be gone awhile; I leave him a couple<br />treats to keep him happy for at least a little while.

review/summary: Healthy Veggie Dog Treat
review/text: When you are looking for a Organic Veggie Treat for your Dog. This is a very good one. It is Rubbery Veggie slice that the dog loves to chew.<br />Do not give too many in a days time or you will have a loose orange stool to take care of. So 1 or 2 a day is best. I also found that although the puppies love to chew them if you give them more than 1 a day their baby teeth/gums become painful.<br />I switched to the Sweet potato fries for my puppies to keep away from the gum/tooth pain. My adult dogs Love the chips.<br />Great change from all the other Meat-additive treats out there.

review/summary: Product may be dangerous
review/text: Healthy Pets reports that sick dogs who have eaten sweet potato snacks show symptoms similar to Fanconi syndrome, "a condition in which the tubules of the kidneys don't function properly."  According to Healthy Pets, products implicated in anecdotal accounts include:<br /><br />Beefeaters Sweet Potato Snacks for Dogs<br />Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good Dog Treats<br />Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality<br /><br />According to Becky Lundgren, DVM, of the Veterinary Information Network, "Anecdotal reports from veterinarians indicate similar concerns about sweet potato pet treats made in China. Although no evidence is available that these sweet potato treats cause kidney issues similar to those related to chicken jerky treats, pet owners should be aware of the possibility."<br /><br />You certainly should. A prudent course of action that every shopper should take is simply looking for a "Made in China" label on any package of treats, and, if finding one, returning it to the shelf.

review/summary: Made in China!
review/text: This product deserves no stars.<br /><br />I read ingredients SO carefully. In my local pet store I decided to get my boys something different and bought them this treat. Checked the ingredients and they seemed fine. Brand is "Beefeaters USA". After a few weeks my dog was vomiting, had bloody stool, and drinking a lot of water. Five hundred dollars later after xrays and blood panels he came back cancer-free and with nothing blocking his system.<br /><br />Puzzled, I googled some of the brands of treats I was feeding them, and information on the organic dog food I feed them. Beefeaters is made in China AND is on the list of tainted dog treats. Thinking it was only chicken jerky I did not think to check.<br /><br />I learned the hard way. I will now either make their treats or make sure it is safe before buying.

review/summary: yummy treat
review/text: My little dog loves sweet potatoes, so this seemed like the perfect treat.  The 'chips' weren't what I expected, but she loves them.  The 'chips' are big slices of sweet potato, and are soft, not crunchy.  I was disappointed at first, but Misha begs for them, so that's what counts!  The slices are too big for my little girl, but cutting them into smaller sizes isn't a problem.  Will definitely order again!  It's a shame they are made in China, but I guess they are too expensive to make in America.  They are irradiated (according to the FDA - Food irradiation is the process of exposing food to ionizing radiation to destroy microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, or insects that might be present in the food.) so they are safe for our four-legged babies.

review/summary: Great for my Shih Tzu
review/text: Our family dog, a 5 year old (human years) Shih Tzu didn't take to this at first. It took a good week before he would try it. After he tried it, he was all over it. He's allergic to everything so it was nice to find a treat that he could eat. We found this at Pet Smart and got the clear plastic bucket (about one pound of treats). It's lasted him about 8 months now--serving it to him about 2-3 times a week ahout 2-5 of these treats each time. We'll be getting him so more of these. He's pretty happy when he gets these.

review/summary: Highly Recommended!
review/text: This is my favorite thing to feed my 11 year old aussie for a chew.  Her canines have become pretty worn, partially because she developed a habit of chewing her way out of chain link kennels about 5 years ago (which I no longer keep her in) but also because I used to give her very hard chews when she was younger.  I still give her a chew in the evening but it is always something pretty soft.  I like the Sam's Yamz but they are pretty pricey and then I found these!  I purchased my supply from Amazon which is perhaps I didn't have the same experience as the previous reviewer with them being pretty hard. The pieces in the bag I got were very soft and chewy.  With free shipping these are a great deal and don't wear done my dog's teeth!

review/summary: Good Healthy snack
review/text: My dogs love these.  There a healthy alternative to the other treats out there.  The one thing with these are it softens the stool and turns it orange.  If your dog goes on the neighbor's yard that's good but we all know the pain of picking up soft poop.  I guess it all comes down to how much you love you mut.<br /><br />I only give each about 1 or 2 a day and thier fine.  If your dog likes these, then try giving them raw sweet potatoes or sweet potatoes that have been semi cooked in microwave.  My dogs eat them as it was the beef or turkey jerky.

review/text: I can not wait until Amazon starts carrying French's Fajita Seasoning Mix.  I was able to find a box of 6 packets about 6 months ago and started using it.  My husband uses it in both our steak fajitas and our chicken fajitas and it makes both of them taste wonderful.  I have used other fajita seasoning mixes but they are either too spicy or not enough.  French's is just right and my husband absolutely loves it and he is a fantastic cook in his own right.  His Chicken Enchiladas have won many county fairs and our friends and relatives are always asking him to make them and the fajitas.<br /><br />Please Amazon, get this product in as soon as you can.

I got tired of a tomato base soup too - but I eventually got through 2 cases. Some cans were dented, but we didn't get sick from them - but dents in food cans causes worry and concern.<br />I particularly liked the mushrooms in this. It was a little delight each time I got a mushroom in my mouth - just the right texture.<br />I hope Amy's is working on the BPA issue found in the lining of their (and most everybody else's) cans.

review/summary: great taste
review/text: I've been trying with limited amounts of success to eat vegan and low-gi. Amys soups are excellent for this, they make it very easy to lose weight. One limiting factor is fat cravings, eating vegan it's actually hard to get enough fat.<br /><br />This is a long way of saying this soup tastes great, I can tell it's oily and i love that about it. I need fat in my diet or I'll lose my mind and eat a whole pizza. Low-fat diets are a travesty anyway, creating a market for high-sugar high-gi products labeled as "healthy"<br /><br />So this soup brings oil and mushrooms and a very good flavor. I've had about a dozen types of amys soups, and this is at the top with golden lentil, no chicken noodle, and trader joes lentil vegetable (made by amys).
