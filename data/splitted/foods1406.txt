review/summary: Better if not mostly broken
review/text: My son has been eating and enjoying these tasty gluten free cookies for awhile now but, this was the first time we ordered any.  The store we usually purchase them at is about a hour away so, with the price of gas, I was excited to find them on Amazon. I ordered these chocolate chip crunchy ones and a case of the soft ones. The soft ones arrived fine but, these crunchy ones were mostly broken.  I'm not sure if they were handled rough by the mail service or if they are just so delicate that they don't ship well.  Anyway, they were good but, I probably won't order any more of the crunchy cookies since we like to eat our cookies whole.

review/summary: Tastes Good
review/text: We have been using enjoy life products for awhile due to life threatening food allergies. During a walk for FAAN they gave out samples of this cookie. My child loved it and wanted more. At the time they did not carry it in the stores so I found it online. It was a great purchase. It came when expected and the cookies disappeared fast. I will be ordering more soon. :)

review/text: These are wonderful gingerbread men from Great Britain -- biscuits, not anything like American cookies. They are here for the Christmas holiday, and otherwise hard to find.  They come with the current Earl Grey's signature and his promise of excellence, and he comes through on his promise.  And yes, he is the descendant of that Earl Grey for whom the fragrant tea is named for. One can only hope that he will continue to give his name to more biscuits -- the Lemon Ladies and Shortbread Soldiers, just as wonderful, could use more good company!

review/summary: Disappointing flavor
review/text: I thought originally this was an assortment of three separate flavored candy pieces, but was wrong. Still, the mixture sounds good on paper: three ingredients I really like- honey, almonds, apricots. It just didn't taste as you would think.<br /><br />The apricot flavoring, if present (I couldn't taste any), is completely obscured by the overpowering taste of honey. While I like honey, the honey used here seems unusually strong, very cloying taste with a strong lingering perfumey/flowery aftertaste. Some of the pieces contained large chunks of almond, and the toasted nut flavor occasionally broke through the smothering honey to be a good taste compliment. But not all pieces were graced with sizable almonds. I shared the candy with a few friends including one who has had Turkish Delight before, and they all disliked it. We were all left disappointed.

review/text: This sauce was brought in to our lunch cafeteria by one of the short order cooks, Juan.  He told us to try it one day and we were hooked!  From eggs to potatoes to chicken to steak sandwiches to whatever, this salsa picante rocks!  It has a little bite but not too bad at all and has a very full flavor.  Don't know exactly what gives it the flavor but it isn't too peppery in taste.  Definately better than Tapatio or Cholula in flavor and milder in heat than those two.  Along with Arizona Gunslinger, one of my favorite 2 sauces!

The price for a four pack was a little more than half the local store price for the same items.... But for a single bone it works out to more than double the cost. I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product.

review/summary: A Little Sprout No Doubt
review/text: By now, most everyone has heard of the health benefits of eating broccoli sprouts.  The demand has driven the cost up to $3.80 for a 2-ounce carton at the few grocery stores that carry them.  Countless sprouters hawk their wares on the Internet selling both seeds and all sorts of fancy sprouting devices at a premium.  Add shipping to that.  Many growers make their own sprouters - and there are as many different designs as there are growers. Many websites show good pictures of these setups.  Most use glass jars with screen wire replacing the lid. After reading every bit of information I could find on growing broccoli sprouts, I ordered my first batch of seeds.  First off, at $20.00 a pound on Amazon.Com, these seeds  are $5.00/lb. cheaper than the competition plus Amazon offers free shipping.<br />I opted for a clear plastic jar in stead of glass for a sprouter. Glass and cats do NOT mix. I had to order three types of stainless steel wire before I got the size that was perfect.  Here's what works best for me. Stainless Steel Type 304 Mesh #16 X 16 .018" Wire Diameter 12" x 12" available at Amazon for $8.62 with free shipping. #16 means the number of openings per lineal inch. Most craft stores sell scissors to cut wire mesh.  Fiskars makes a good pair.  Cut a circle 1mm larger in diameter than the mouth of your growing jar.  I use Folgers 12oz. coffee jars(38oz.liquid capacity) and cut out the lid with a Dremmel leaving only the rim with a 1mm ridge to the inside.  Insert the wire mesh circle into the top of the remaining lid. It should slightly bow outward but not so much that you can't rest the jar upside down with the lid on.(see attached photo image) Draining after washing is the part that gets tricky.  I read one website that said beat, slam, shake or do whatever necessary to thoroughly drain the sprouts after washing. So, I killed my first two jars of baby sprouts by blunt force tramma. They turned to mush.  Here's a secret I learned the hard way.  Wash the seeds/sprouts by swirling them in cold water for about 20 seconds.  Then, instead of violent slamming, simply place the growing jar upside down on a fluffed white paper towel.  After a minute, squeeze out the towel, refluff it and place it back under the lid.  No beating.  No knocking.  No shaking.  After ten minutes, your sprouts are well drained, still fluffed and happy.  The paper towel soaks the excess moisture through the screen better than any other method I've found.  Next, place the jar on its side in indirect sunlight between 66 and 70 degrees. I like a window sill behind a thin curtain.  Wash and drain twice a day.  For me, they grow much better when not compressed.  Two or three times a day, I'll rotate the jar about 90 degrees to allow them to gently tumble and bring submerged sprouts to the light. Another thing that seems to help is a very gentle air circulation flowing across the screen.  I have a small air cleaner/filter set on low about six feet away from the containers. From the first step of soaking the seeds to harvest, it takes me between 8 and 12 days. I understand that different varieties of seeds sprout differently and there are many variables to consider.  I wait until my jar becomes full of sprouts. Even the few seeds that don't sprout and the hulls are edible.  Some people remove these. During the final draining, most of the husks will float away and stick to the inside of the sprouter making them easy to remove. On average, 3 tablespoons of seeds yields 6.4oz of drained sprouts per jar. Based on the weights I'm getting on a postage scale, $20.00 in seeds yields about $90.00 in sprouts.  They are greener than the pale sprouts from the grocery store and taste much better, too.  This is a fun and productive hobby for the Winter months.  I have yet to come up with a cool growing idea for the Summer.  I'm thinking of a very small, shelf-type refrigerator set at 68 degrees and rigging it where the light will stay on inside.  Another bright idea that might burn out.

review/text: Since broccoli seeds have gotten pretty expensive, I bought this brand because of the comparatively better price.<br /><br />I shared a bottle with another sprout enthusiast and we both had similar results: We did get an okay amount of sprouts, but judging by looks, 25% or more of the seeds did not sprout.<br /><br />It may be just the lot we got, and that may be an acceptable success ratio. Still, you might want to keep it in mind when estimating whether you'll be saving money or not.

review/text: I do like halva, but the cocoa swirl flavor never seems to be chocolaty enough to bother.  This Koska brand at least tastes like good halva; I've had cocoa halva that was barely palatable.  When there's no chocolate in the house this stuff is pretty good.

review/summary: Easy five stars...Baronet's best IMO
review/text: I will be brief:  I have tried probably 25 or more different coffee pods since I got my Bunn My Cafe for my office.  I am a bit of a coffee snob, so it took a lot of pride swallowing to go from grinding my own beans at work to a pod brewer.<br /><br />Having said that, Baronet has some real garbage out there, but they make up for all that with this little cheesy named gem.  BEST. POD. EVER.  It's bold, it's dark, BUT it's smooth as my one year old's butt!  True sign of good coffee?  Let it get completely cold in your cup, then drink.  This one passes that test with flying colors (dark, rich brown to be exact).<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />I am taking time to praise this pod only because finally FINALLY I have found one that can actually beat my very messy, very time consuming, grind + measure + brew, traditional method I was using before.  Most pods out there are way wayyyy too weak for me, or have so little coffee in them that you have to brew only half a cup to get some decent flavor.  Not so here, boys and girls...this is the real deal... a full 12g of coffee in every pod!<br /><br />If you are a strong coffee freak like me, and have given in to compromise for the convenience of pods, also check out Coffee Artisan's new 12g pods...some of them are almost as good as this Blast.  Their "Dark Side" "Extra Bold" pod is very similar to Blast, though not QUITE as good IMO).

Note: The pods are 12 grams so they will not fit the standard Senseo pod holder. You will have to use the extended holder to accomodate this pod. If you like strong coffee, this is the pod for you.

review/summary: Very weak coffee with the Hamilton Beach brewer!
review/text: I bought this coffee with high hopes as an alternative to the Senseo pods that are getting harder to find. We have two small Hamilton Beach coffee brewers that use Senseo pods, and we always enjoyed the coffee they produce. I was actually anticipating that these Baronet pods, from the reviews, might even be too strong ... but that was not the case. I don't know if the issue is that the Hamilton Beach brewers don't heat the water enough ... or the pods are just terrible ... but the cup they produced looked more like tea than coffee. We tried wetting the pods first, and I even put another pod in my cup to "brew" like a tea bag, but nothing worked. Weak, weak coffee. Maybe they work better with a genuine Senseo brewer ... but if you have the Hamilton Beach model ... steer clear of these! I wish I could return them but cannot.

review/summary: Wow, what a coffee
review/text: So, for about the past three months, it's been virtually impossible to get Senseo branded pods, so I tried these as an alternative, and I am happy I did. As soon as I tried the first cup of this particular coffee, one word came to mind: strong.<br /><br />I am using these in a first-generation Senseo machine. These pods are much thicker than the Senseo pods so you'll need to use the double-pod tray. They're packed much tighter than the Senseo pods, which also may affect how strong this coffee tasted.<br /><br />As long as these pods remain available, I don't think I'll even bother looking for more alternatives.

review/summary: Baronet Coffee Blast  Should be named Baronet WEAKEST Blast Ever
review/text: This  product is so weak one might think they have tea instead of coffee the pods are a quick way to add regular roast to a cloth pod and cash into the pod industry. I have always used Senseco but then Amazon and others are not having much luck with availability or reasonable cost to purchaser, gave this company a try at best it takes two pods and then not a full 8.0z cup only half to get this product to taste like a good strong cup of coffee. Title name is misgiving BLAST to me meant rich aroma strong blast of a bold coffee.  Very disappointed it is not  worth the cost even being prime and free shipping will never use again and if you love a strong flavorful coffee this is not the one.. Ripped off and not liking the taste at all.

review/summary: I'm not a rocket scientist, but making coffee should be easier than this.
review/text: Initial Review: One Star<br /><br />Pros: Amazon's delivery. I ordered this yesterday, and (with my Prime Membership), OnTrac delivery placed it on my doorstep today, Saturday!  Thank you Amazon.<br /><br />Cons:  Either this coffee is bad, or I just can't make it work.  I've tried 4 approaches on my Senseo machine.<br /><br />It is almost the weight of two Senseo pods (unfortunately no longer sold on Amazon...why??), so I used the two pod holder (wouldn't fit in one pod holder).  Coffee appeared to brew, i.e., the water ran through the machine fine.  The result was not even close to passable.<br /><br />Here are the ways that I tried it, and the result (Senseo users will understand these terms):<br />Right Brew Button, Two Bar Level:  Far too weak<br />Right Brew Button, One Bar Level:  Weak<br />Left Brew Button, One Bar Level:  Strong, quite bitter<br />Left Brew Button, Two Bar Level:  Weak, bitter.<br /><br />So the moral of the story is: Don't order pods unless they are specifically designed for your machine.  Since Amazon won't accept returns of any food product, I'm out the $23.  At least let my loss stand as a lesson for others:  avoid these if you have a Senseo. And if you do have the machine they fit, I suspect the coffee isn't that good.<br /><br />Message to Amazon:  You sold me the coffee machine, why don't you sell Senseo brand pods anymore -- or something that specifically fits (7g pods).<br /><br />Update/Revision, One Day Later:  Okay, since I'm stuck with these things, figured I wouldn't give up so easily.  So I went back to the Senseo with these Pods. And I managed to make reasonably good (3 Star) coffee. Lesson Learned. Important Note for Senseo users vis a vis this (and I assume other) 12g pods:<br />1. Make sure that you have the pod oriented with the correct side up/down.<br />2. Use the Right Brew Button @ the One Bar Level. This will yield a tasty cup of coffee, but certainly not two-cup yield.<br /><br />I don't know if the cost/benefit vs. using 7 gram pods is reality, but bottom line: (revised)3 Stars.<br />Moral of the story:  Don't give up

I carry one in my purse rather than spend money while on the road.  There is just enough kick to make them tasty.  We keep these in the refrigerator all the time as well so they are handy when we are looking for a quick snack.  Great product.

review/text: I will say I have never had Pumpkin ice cream. I really loved this flavor of Artic Zero. Not sure why they are charging more for it here at Amazon, maybe because it is a seasonal flavor, but doesn't seem right. Here is the thing with Arctic Ice, it is made from Whey Protein, so some flavors do have more of the Whey Protein taste, like the Vanilla Maple (okay for me) and the Strawberry (the flavor I really did not like) also the Coffee (okay for me) and I don't mind the taste of Whey protein. I do prefer my ice cream NOT to taste like Whey Protein, so my favorites that to me don't taste like whey protein are: 1st Chocolate, 2nd Pumpkin, and 3rd Mint Chocolate Cookie(I don't like regular mint ice cream at all, but like this very much). Putting them in the microwave just to slightly defrost, they all are creamy in texture. If you don't like Whey protein, try one that doesn't have such a strong whey protein taste.

review/summary: Needs some help from your spice rack.
review/text: I agree with the reviewer that stated the flavor isn't strong enough, a problem with all of the of the Artic Ice flavors, not just the pumpkin. However, I still give the product four stars because it's easy to address the problem by adding spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spices, or allspice.  I just recently purchased granulated lemon peel (it's a spice) and tried that to the chocolate flavor, it was excellent!  I'm also thinking of using the ice cream with non-fat milk and extracts, such as rum, vanilla, almond, etc. for milk shakes.  The pumpkin flavor could be used with real pumpkin, and coco powder to make a shake/smoothie that would still be low calorie.  To be honest, I wouldn't go through all of these extra steps to make the ice cream work for me if I didn't have an issue with gluten.  The low calorie count is an added bonus too.

Curiosity finally got the better of me and I ordered it off Amazon to try -- SO GLAD THAT I DID! I am going to petition my supermarket to begin carrying this flavor, because it is unbelievably good! Tastes like a delicious pumpkin pie in frozen form - you would NEVER expect the entire pint to have only 150 calories. It is seriously just so, so delicious. I'll definitely be ordering more (as a special treat) if I can't find it in stores sometime soon. MUST TRY!

No. This is a diet product that is only 150 calories, 0 grams of fat, and 20 grams of sugar in an entire pint (to compare, a pint of Ben and Jerry's is 920 calories, 48 grams of fat, 82 grams of sugar). Knowing that, I wasn't expecting much in terms of flavor. I have to say, the taste has really exceeded my expectations. I really enjoyed the light pumpkin flavor. As a guy who likes to work out and build muscle, I also love the benefit of the whey protein in this product. One pint contains 14 grams of protein (for comparison, that's as much as a McChicken sandwich) and 8 grams of fiber. I have a new guilt-free late night snack.

review/summary: These are great!
review/text: We first discovered these at Whole Foods market and liked them immediately.  There are quite a few varieties that Freeland makes, but this one is our family's favorite, mostly because of the sprouted buckwheat groats.  They are high in protein (8 grams!) and very tasty.  Perfect for me while I was pregnant and still great now that I am a nursing mom.  Buying them from Amazon garners a big savings as these are pricey for a granola bar.

review/summary: Missing the point
review/text: I think perhaps that some of the previous reviewers are missing the point. These bars are "live" food as they are sprouted and not cooked. Hence they are easier to digest, contain all the natural enzymes that nature intended, and a are naturally wholesome! No they are not super sweet but they taste great nevertheless. In my opinion, it's the best bar out there. I can't stand all the other processed bars. They use lots of sugar to cover the dead and processed taste. And I absolutely love the fact that these bars are free from all the common food allergens!

review/summary: Probably Good For You
review/text: We were expecting these to be a bit different than what we got.  They are drier and not sweet. (I actually tend to like things not sweet). I am sure they are probably good for you & they are not the worst bars we have tried. I think for the cost, I wish I enjoyed them more. You get enough bars to last a long time. They'll probably expire before we use them all, though.

review/summary: Yummy!!
review/text: This is the only prepared marinara sauce I've ever had that approaches that I make at home. There are discernable chunks of tomato, carrot etc. in the sauce - so if you are one of those people who prefer a completely smooth sauce, it's not for you. Also if you are used to a very sweet sauce, this is not for you. But if you like real authentic marinara, absolutely this is the right product. The spices are balanced and the tomatoes have the right mix of acid, sweetness and tomato flavor. Look at the ingredient list - everything is natural, no weird chemicals or preservatives. Plus the aseptic cartons will keep almost forever. One carton is more than enough for two adults and one child who loves pasta, for one meal. So one case is going to keep us in spaghetti, lasagna, manicotti, stuffed shells, etc. for a long time and the cost point was great, taking into account the free shipping. This is just a fantastic food product and I wish I'd tried it sooner.

review/text: Just received it today and am very pleased.  Had it on pasta for dinner.<br /><br />While enjoying it at dinner, I realized that it tastes just like the mild sauce at my favorite mexican restaurant... a rich garlic and tomato flavor.  So I tried it refrigerated as a dip for corn chips.  It was really, really good.<br /><br />I have 12 cartons of it and suspect that at least half will be eaten with corn chips.  Add a few peppers and you would have a great spicy sauce, but I don't want anything to detract from the garlic and tomatoes.

review/text: This is by far the best pasta / pizza sauce I have ever bought.  Delicious.  Big chunks of tomato, fresh garlic flavor, and nice herbs.  This is so fresh tasting, it tastes like it was JUST made.  This is actually better than anything i could make from scratch.  It's amazing in lasagna too!!!<br /><br />There are however no carrots, as another poster mentioned.  The ingredients are: crushed tomatoes, tomato puree, onions, olive oil, salt, garlic, sugar, parsley, oregano, natural flavour, pepper.

review/summary: One Hitch....
review/text: I used the Pomi marinara about a year ago and was very impressed with the flavor.  I usually put together my own sauce but occasionally, it is nice to have something tasty that can be used to pull a meal together quickly.  The drawback with the case of this product was not in the product itself but rather the fact the the entire case has an out date in five months. With just my husband and I at home, it is doubtful that I would use it all that quickly. I guess that is the problem with ordering food on-line--you are unable to inspect the out dates on the box. Five months is fine for a couple boxes but not for a case.

review/text: There is a list of 18 items in the description of this basket. I only received 16 and a couple of them were duplicates. There are also things that weren't on the list at all. I figure there's 5-6 items in the description that weren't included, and one of those items (the licorice candy) was one of the reasons I chose this package (one of my coworkers loves licorice).<br /><br />I understand it's probably a busy time of year for them but I'm still disappointed. I would return it but it's getting too late to order something else.<br /><br />EDIT: I wrote Amazon customer services and told them I was disappointed with the item but wasn't going to return it because we'd went ahead and started eating it and it was getting too late to get something else. They wrote back within an hour and said they were crediting me for the basket. So five stars to Amazon for customer service! That's impressive and they have a loyal customer in me now. This is the first problem I've ever had with an Amazon order, and now I see how they handle things. :)

NO CHEESE IN THIS BASKET AND NOTHING EXPENSIVE. There were crackers and a school lunch size packet of chocolate chip cookies. I am so embarrassed. Many other companies offer less expensive baskets with greater goods. Don't order this basket. Barb DV.

review/text: My mother had a major surgery and since my sisters and I live out of state we wanted to give her something extra special to help cheer her up.  I ordered this basket, being the largest one, paid a hefty price and even paid the extra money to have it overnighted.  She received it the next afternoon at 2:30, which is rather late for the extra $30 I was charged.  Though the basket was pretty the yummies were described by my sister staying with her as, dry and tasteless.  That made me really sad because I really wanted something extra special

review/summary: SIMPLY THE BEST PASTA!  THE BEST!
review/text: The Spinosi pasta comes from a part of Italy that is known for it's fine eggs, "Campofilone is the egg pasta capital of the world."  Reading that is one thing, tasting is another.  Having been a food buyer, with a test kitchen and tastings, I can't rate this pasta any higher.  Perhaps if I am in Italy in some romantic spot might be an exception.  But this pasta has a great taste because it is made from eggs, and not grain.  It has a great texture, where the pasta doesn't slide off your fork, but sits in a heap on top of your fork,holding the sauce very well.  No slipping and sliding off the fork, with that bland taste that is so prevalent.  Frankly, it was hard to believe that a boxed dry pasta could taste so delicious, and so fresh.  I wouldn't have thought it possible.  The Spinosi Fettucine is our favorite type.  Each type has it's own use, as pasta lovers know.  For a basic basil, olive oil, and parmesan cheese, it is just perfect.  The width is just right.  We have tried about all of the types available, which is limited, considering the number of types available, but we always seem to go back to this type of pasta, the fettucine.  I am sure that some persons have some particular dishes that would call for a different type of pasta, and they would probably buy a wide selection of types, but if you are just going to buy one type, I would suggest the Fettucine.  I find myself being amazed sometimes as I eat the pasta at how well it stands on your fork, and has such a wonderful taste.  I do recall better pastas in Italian restaurants, but it was probably not just home made, but had those special Italian sauces that are so astounding.  If you go to Italy, northern Italy is known for having the best pasta, in the Emilia Reggiano area, not too far from Parma.

review/text: This is an excellent product. I signed up for the subscription, we like it so much. However, with my first shipment, every single can arrived dented. The problem was not in the outside packaging - that was fine. But the cans, inside the shrink-wrapped case, were dented - on the inside surfaces of the cans! You couldn't see the dents until the cans were unwrapped. So the problem wasn't in the shipping, at least to me, but in shrink wrapping already damaged cans. Will be cancelling my subscription if my next shipment also arrives dented.

review/summary: Late nite snack
review/text: With being alergic to chocolate this is the only version of Betty Crocker Delights I can enjoy.  Warm, moist, cake-perfect snack before bed or for breakfast.  This won't stay around the house long with its great tast.

review/summary: Great dessert
review/text: We love Warm Delights, almost all the flavors. They are individual desserts but we usually split one between us. It makes just enough to eat and since none is left over, no over indulging. Even if you do eat a whole one, it's better than being able to help yourself to seconds. They are easy and quick to make and taste great. Yes they cost more than buying a cake mix and making a whole cake but they take less time, no added ingredients other than water, and again, no left overs. I have been buying them since they came on the market and will continue as long as they make them. The variety makes it nice too because you can have a different every day.

review/summary: Easy cinnamon cake
review/text: This was amazing for adding only water! I am going to try this with applesauce when I get to the store. The item arrived fast and safe. The cake baked up in 75 seconds and then I squeezed on the icing. A great buy with subscribe and save and the promotion that they had. The expiration date is early next year and I don't believe they will be around that long. This will make an excellent breakfast cake with the applesauce added. I will be trying another flavor soon!
