review/summary: FINALLY!
review/text: Got a Keurig for Christmas, and have spent the past two months trying to find great coffee that is also affordable.  Over a dollar each for the ones that I was getting at the grocery store was just not cutting it for me.  I purchased a reusable K-cup.  Couldn't stomach the weak coffee it made, and that was with superfine ground coffee.  Not to mention that it often only brewed half a cup.  So, after trying many different types, I decided I liked the taste of the Starbucks Sumatra the best, but it was way too expensive.  Come to find out, Green Mountain makes the Starbucks K-cups.  So I decided to try Green Mountain, as it is MUCH more affordable.<br />It's GREAT!  Nice, strong, flavorful cup of coffee!  FINALLY!

review/summary: Just about my favorite K-Cup coffee so far
review/text: Got a Keurig for Christmas, so I've been having fun trying the wide variety of available K-Cup products.  So far, this is my favorite of all the coffees, and one of the few I'd stack up against a good cup of freshly ground and brewed regular coffee. Usually I like K-Cups because they're convenient.  I like these because they're truly excellent coffee and taste wonderful.  These and Coffee People's extra bold varieties are good enough to pass for the real thing - no one would ever suspect they were K-Cups if you didn't tell them.

review/text: Finally a good strong cup of coffee.  After drinking weak, flavorless K-cups I found this one.

I only wish that the green mountain coffee would be offered as a subscribe and save item. Now that they are selling k-cups at Costco, I am tempted regularly to move to the lines they carry. It would be nice not to worry about running out, and to be rewarded a bit for my loyalty!

This coffee, GM Double Black Diamond (k-cup) and Gevalia Dark Italian Roast (Tassimo)come so close I do not purchase the ground coffee any longer. Very strong, full bodied coffee without being bitter or having an aftertaste. If you like strong, fresh coffee this is it.

review/text: I make my coffee like an ersatz latte and need a very robust coffee to pull that off---this fits the bill.  This is my method:  using a large mug, I first pour in about 1/4 c. of milk and nuke that for 60 seconds.  I then use either the small or medium (depends on my mood) Keurig setting and brew the coffee with the scalded milk, then top with a dollop of Bailey's coffee creamer.  Delicious!  I like a strong coffee but not a bitter one and Double Black Diamond works beautifully.

review/summary: If you like a dark and toasty big mug with just one K-cup, this will do it.
review/text: I have real issues trying to find a K-cup that will give me a robust-tasting enough mug of joe. For a while, I'd found near-perfection in the Coffee People extra bold mix... especially the Wake-Up Call (which got horribly expensive all of a sudden), but even those I only made on the middle setting of our brewer, and never the largest.  The Double Black Diamond still satisfied me on the largest setting, and has an intense, smoky dark edge that reminds me of the coffee that first converted me to the Pacific Northwest style of espresso---one I had a a tiny, roadside espresso stand out in the middle of nowhere between Tumalo and Sisters, in Oregon.  (It's probably not there any more--this was back in the 90s. LOL)  Anyway, it's definitely robust, and as I use milk/creamer, I don't find it bitter at all, but rich and worthy of savoring.  It will stand up nicely to a shot of your favorite flavor, and even shines through getting mixed with cocoa and vanilla for a toasty mocha.<br /><br />I just wish the coffees I'm finding out that I really, really like weren't shooting up into the "Can't Afford" ranges. But for those who love bold, smoky dark roast---this one is a real winner! I will keep it on hand for the times when I sit down with breakfast or with my Kindle to savor a cup of coffee rather than drink it in haste on the way out the door. But, if I find this coffee "loose" I'm getting it for my Eko-Brew reuseable K cups for sure.

review/summary: Nice Bold Flavor
review/text: I have been searching for a nice strong coffee for my Keurig that doesn't leave a bitter or flat aftertaste.  This a very nice bold flavored coffee that seems to fit the bill.  I am a bit spoiled after tasting Barista Prima's Italian roast as it has such a nice rich full-bodied flavor.  It is a bit pricier so the Double Black Diamond is a nice close second at a more affordable price.  I like my coffee black or with a little milk and this does not leave you wondering where the coffee went!

review/summary: Looking for a replacement for Starbucks and Tassimo? This is it.
review/text: I have been drinking Starbucks brand coffee with my Tassimo brand machines for years.  It was the perfect combination for me.  Now that they have stopped making Starbucks inserts I was forced to look for an alternative.  I bought a K-cup machine because it appears to be the dominant brand on the market.  This coffee is actually better than the original Starbucks!  I will not go back to the Starbucks brand even if they start making it for the K-cup machines.

If you like a medium roast coffee this isn't for you, but if you like 'Black Tiger Amazon' or 'Jet Fuel', you should try Double Black Diamond.  It will also stand up to a larger cup size for those of you that can brew them.  I usually brew it on my Keurig's 9.25 oz. size and it still makes a satisfying cup.

review/text: My only hesitation in purchasing a K-Cup Brewer was whether the coffee would be bold enough for me. Since purchasing my brewer, I've tried many varieties and Double Black Diamond is my favorite. I drink my coffee black so I don't like weak coffee - I want it to be bold and smooth, not bitter. Black Diamond will not disappoint if you like good coffee. My other favorites are Green Mountain Expresso Blend and Coffee People Jet Fuel. I love my Cuisinart K-Cup Brewer - easy to use and no clean-up. I can make just one cup of fresh coffee whenever I want and don't end up throwing away unused or old coffee. And happily, I've found Double Black Diamond to start my mornings!

I was tired of picking up a limited supply of k-cups from the Discount Department Stores and having them taste a little weak. From the beginning, when your cup starts to brew, you can tell "this is going to be a GOOD cup of coffee". I wasn't disappointed. Great stuff.

review/summary: strong, burnt and bitter
review/text: I typically use my Keurig as a hot water dispenser, running it without kcups because they generally are too weak, even on the small cup setting.<br /><br />So, I'm very much in the market for stronger k cups.<br /><br />I can make medium size cups with this pod, but it's still a bit weak, and still bitter.  Makes a very strong small cup.  Perfect would be 2 pods, one cup, one brewed on short and the other on medium.<br /><br />As for the flavor of the beans, they produce a full bodied, bold and bitter cup.  Not necessarily a bad bitter, as it is pure arabica, however, I personally wouldn't recommend having more than one cup of these a day.  That bold flavor loses it's luster cup after cup, so it's not really a good all-around coffee.<br /><br />It's a good first or second cup of the morning coffee.  It's kind of like a cup of "good new york city coffee" back before the coffee renaissance of the past decade.<br /><br />Buying this in the extra large amount may not be suitable from an individuals' point of view because it's not something you'll want to drink 2+ times a day.

review/text: I love K-Cups coffee.  They are easy and one always has a FRESH cup of coffee in less than a minute.  However, coffee this way can be quite expensive.  I myself use those refillable cups that one can find on amazon.  I have a half dozen of them.  I fill them with grocery store cheap brand and set my Keurig for the 6oz expresso cup.  It makes great strong coffee.  My wife on the other hand is lazy and doesn't want to mess with the two seconds it takes to fill the refillable little baskets.  She loves the Green Mountain Extra bold and as I buy it for her she doesn't care how much it costs.  It's good coffee and keeps my wife of forty years off my back.  I'd pay twice as much for that feature alone.

review/summary: Strong Taste w/o Bitterness
review/text: Coffee is my favorite drug and the first 2 cups in the morning better wake me up. This is one of my favorites to enjoy first thing every day.  It's strong, smooth, and doesn't upset my stomach because it's not bitter. I usually get bored with the same coffee after a while, but this one never lets me down.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Super Dark
review/text: If you want a dark roast that nearly rivals espresso, here's your choice.<br />Don't get me wrong, it's not espresso, but it is a dark, rich, balanced, flavorful roast that I look forward to when I need a pick-me-up some mornings. If you like dark roasts, this is VERY VERY GOOD!

review/summary: Double Diamand Delight
review/text: I found this blend to be among the strongest and best K-cups I have ever tried. It is strong enough for me to brew a regular cup and then use the same Kcup again at the small cup setting to fill up my travel cup.  Never bitter, but very dark, rich and satisfying. I like to mix this with other k-cups such as Jet fuel, Italian roast, etc. If you like strong, non-bitter, dark rich coffee - try this.

review/summary: Awesome brew, strong, bold!
review/text: Every time I get a new Keurig k-cup to try, it just gets better and better most of the time.  This one is no exception.  Green Mountain Double Black Diamond is AWESOMELY bold, and makes a great 6oz. cup. (And it is strong, so you may like an 8oz. brew on this one!) You can tell by shaking the k-cups that these bolder flavors are ground more finely, almost like an espresso.  This really is the best k-cup coffee I've tried so far, just edging out "Dark Magic" because of it's arabica origin.

review/text: I like my coffee bold and strong. I've tried some other bold K-cups but they don't come close to this blend. Double diamond is so rich, dark and bold.<br />I used to love starbucks breakfast blend before they changed to what they currently have.<br />This taste similar in my opinion.

review/summary: Nice strong BOLD coffee
review/text: Nice strong coffee - smooth but does have a bit of acidic taste at the end. My favorite is Coffee People's Donut Shop, and the Double Black Diamond is a bit stronger with a kick at the end. I've tried three cups so far. Of course it's all preference, but I think this is great. I would buy again. Strong but not too strong. Of course I do drink it slowly...this is not one to gulp down! Don't let the reviews scare you - if you're looking for a new bold coffee try the Green Mountain bold sampler pack - good choices in there, including this one!

review/summary: So, so good....
review/text: This is definitely one of my favorites it has a fresh and great coffee taste, it's delicious. This will definitely be a must buy for those that like strong (almost espresso) coffee. If you need some energy and a nice strong kick in the morning this is definitely the coffee for you. I know I do, I live in NYC and have an awful commute in the morning. So, I need lots of caffeine to get through my commute and the rest of the day. I wasn't really getting that from some of my other coffee choices of the k-cups. I just got my machine and I am experimenting with all the extra and extra-extra bold coffees and so far between this one and the Timothy's Parisian Nights. So, so good I love them!! This is very addicting, strong coffee!!! ;o)

review/text: I enjoy a very dark bold coffee. Of all of the k-kups I have tried, this one pleases me most. I like a touch of cream and this one handles it better than any other. It has a big bold taste but without the bitterness I find in other types. The Dark Magic is also good, but not quite as satisfying as this one.<br /><br />If you like a bold cup of coffee, you need to try this one! It is excellent.

review/summary: Strong Bold Taste
review/text: I like strong coffee and this fits the bill. My favorite is Barista's Italian Roast with Starbucks Verona close behind. Green Mountain Double Black Diamond is almost as good as those 2 but less expensive. I will buy this again.<br /><br />To save money, we have been making our own Kcups by reusing the brand cups -- after use, peel the foil top off, try to get all off the edge (but not necessary). Rinse out the used coffee. There is a filter built into the cups. We bought some Kcup lids on Amazon - 100 for about $15. Fill the rinsed out cup with your own favorite coffee, snap on the replacement lid and you are good to go. When placing in cup holder, make sure the little hole on the bottom from first use puncture is at the top and fits back onto the bottom pin - that way you do not get 2 holes in bottom of Kcup. You can resuse the Kcup many times befor it wears out.<br /><br />In the morning I will start off with GM Double Black and then for 2nd or 3rd cup use one we filled. Someday's I splurge and start with Barista Italian Roast.<br /><br />If you like strong, bold coffee, try the Black Magic. It is smooth without much of a bitter after taste. Although, I kind of like that after taste. It is too bold for my wife, so I tell her to reuse the Kcup I just used and make an 8oz cup... makes a good cup of coffee, just not quite as strong... and we get 2 cups out of the one Kcup.

review/summary: Nice replacement for Green Mountain Coffee's Espresso Blend
review/text: Upon trying to replenish my supply of Green Mountain Coffee's Espresso Blend, I found they had discontinued it.  I hesitated to buy Timothy's Espresso Blend (now the only espresso k-cup on the market) due to the reviews but have since tried GMC's Dark Magic and now GMC's Double Black Diamond.  Double Black Diamond doesn't have the flavors the Espresso Blend has but it has a very good flavor on its own.  It has no bitter aftertaste as you would expect with such a strong, extra bold coffee.  Where the Dark Magic was too weak for my daily latte, the Double Black Diamond makes for a very fine latte.  This is my pick as a substitute for GMC's Espresso Blend.<br /><br />Update: I've been drinking this coffee for a few weeks now and have to say, it is great.  It is my new favorite!  Also, bought a couple of Extra Bold Roast k-cup coffee sample packs via Keurig and haven't found any better than GMC Double Black Diamond.

review/summary: Closet thing to French coffee with chicory
review/text: I grew up drinking coffee in New Orleans.  I have been soooo disappointed with all of the K-cup coffees because they are so mild. After reading reviews, I decided to try all the ones that were said to be good, strong coffees.  First I tried Jet Fuel.  It is strong, but no taste.  Then I tried Paul Newmans dark roast.  It was so so, but nothing special.<br />I saw the Big Easy k-cup and thought, this must be it.  It is good. Don't get me wrong.  It is my second choice.  But the winner is  Green Mountain Double Black Diamond! It is really, really good.  If you like your coffee strong and bold with great flavor, this is the one.  I don't care what it costs.  It is worth it.

review/summary: Bold, Rich, Divine!
review/text: In my search for the boldest, richest, darkest blend for Keurig, Double Black Diamond wins hands down. When compared to traditional coffees, it is comparable to Cafe Du Monde. I am actually quite surprised it doesn't have chicory in it. It is bold and rich without being at all bitter. Prior to this coffee, I thought Starbuck's Italian roast was the boldest commercial blend. But, Double Black Diamond makes it look weak in comparison. It brews to an almost jet-black and is very dark and earthy without a hint of bitterness or sweetness. It is very much like an espresso and I suspect it may contain as much caffeine. I am very surprised to find a Keurig blend that is comparable to the best French Market coffees and Italian espressos.
