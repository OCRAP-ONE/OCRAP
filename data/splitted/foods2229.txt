review/text: Just love it.  Absolutely love it.  I definitely will order more.  Yeast packages came in a box of 8-8oz. packages.  I have two very good bread recipes.  I use yeast on a regular basis.

review/summary: Super product
review/text: I keep all of the bags in the fridge and have had no problems with this yeast at all.  It takes a very negligable space in the fridge.  I store the open bag in an old yeast jar from the grocery store.  I use this yeast the same as the really expensive bread machine yeast for making white, wheat, and other breads in my bread machine.  I was a little worried it might not work since one of my cookbooks suggested using more yeast if its not made for bread, but I have not found this necessary.  I will buy this again.  I make almost everything from scratch and have had only good results with this yeast.

review/text: Works really well. And only have to refrigerate after opened. The packaging could be improved given the fact that the yeast are so sensitive to outside temperature. The seal of one of my eight packages is broken when i open the box - I was trying to be extra careful when opening, so I use that one first.

review/summary: Time to order more
review/text: My last order was in Dec. 2006.  I make all of my own bread and I dissolve the yeast according to the manufacturer's temperature recomendation. I open one packet at a time then put it in the freezer in an airtight container along with the other unopened packets.  If I had to buy individual packets of yeast at the grocery store, the yeast would cost more than the flour, thereby doubling the cost of each loaf of bread.  This yeast makes bread affordable and it does what yeast is supposed to do, make the bread rise.<br /><br />This yeast has stood the test of time and deserves five stars.

review/summary: So-so for bread machines (and advice from the manufacturer)
review/text: Based on another review, I purchased this yeast for use in my bread machine.  I don't proof the yeast in advance -- I just put it in as if it were bread machine yeast.  This does work, but with some adjustments.  For instance, a 1.5 lb loaf of bread needs a bit over 1 Tablespoon of this yeast.  It also requires a bit over double amount of the recommended gluten in the recipe.  But once I got this all figured out, it works pretty well!<br /><br />Some things to keep in mind that the manufacturer says on their website:<br /><br />- They store this yeast in refrigeration, even when unopened, and advise us to do the same<br /><br />- 1 Tablespoon of this yeast is equivalent to the little packets that you buy in the grocery store.

review/text: I was looking for bulk yeast and this was the first thing that came up.  I knew I was going to get a lot of yeast but I didn't really stop to think how much yeast 64oz really is.<br /><br />Long story short: a lot!<br /><br />After giving about half of it away I've still got months worth of yeast lurking around my fridge taking up space.<br /><br />On the plus side 8oz bags are a nice workable amount.  Having it packaged up in smaller bits made it easy to give away to friends and makes it easier to store.

review/summary: Works well
review/text: I love baking bread. I'm an experimenter. I don't use recipes and have tried a lot of kinds of flour, many of them from Bob's Red Mill.<br />I don't experiment much with yeast. This is reliable. I keep it in a zipper bag after opening in my fridge and it will last a few months that way for me. It's consistency and reliability is why this is my favorite yeast to use for baking bread.<br />I also use it to make cream soda and in small amounts my sodas aren't too yeasty. I've considered trying a brewer's yeast, but everyone in my family likes my sodas made with this so I'll keep using it.<br />So far, I've been able to use this successfully with just flour/water/oil (it does work a bit slower), with molasses, honey, raw sugar, brown sugar, maple sugar and white sugar in my bread recipes.

review/text: I'm a big fan of the higher end blancos, served chilled with lime, no salt.  However, this blanco was so amazing there was no need for lime, and it would be a shame to use this to make a mixed drink.  I recently compared this to DeLeon's Diamante ($100 for the same amount of tequila) and I'd say that even the DeLeon still could benefit from a little lime, and could possibly improve a mixed drink, but I would sip Corzo Silver by itself any day.  It has just enough flavor and is very smooth.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: My new favorite coffee ...
review/text: I'm kind of picky when it comes to coffee.  I find a lot of coffees to have a bitter taste, almost as if the beans have been scorched or burned on their way to my cup.  Some folks like that; I don't.<br /><br />So I've managed to collect a fairly large variety of ground coffees, always searching for one that yields the "perfect cup."<br /><br />I may have found it with this one.  Newman's Own organic Special Blend has a robust flavor, but with no bitterness at all.  It's smooth and rich tasting, and provides a strong background for whatever other flavorings I choose to use with it (vanilla, hazel nut) or totally alone.<br /><br />I've used it for my early morning wake-up cup, and I've also brewed it up to use in iced coffee.  It works great in both settings.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon is also very good, given the quality.  I'll be purchasing more for sure!

My husband loves Paul Newman so of course we had to try his coffee. I'm glad we did because now were hooked. Unfortunatly we hate that we have to order it because if we run out we are stuck buying a different brand from the store. Guess were spoiled and got used to this coffee, nothing else can compare. Thank you for yet another great product from Newman's Own!!

review/summary: Good -- but no longer organic
review/text: I first bought these at Babies 'R' Us, and the bag was marked USDA Organic. I was thrilled to find that my daughter and I both loved them, that they were healthy, and low-calorie/low-fat. A perfect combo! So I ordered them on Amazon in bulk.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as of today, Amazon still has the wrong ingredients list. What arrived was the new formulation of this product, which is no longer organic. The company now uses the label "all natural" instead, and most of the ingredients are not organic.<br /><br />Excellent customer service on Snikkidy's end; they were forthcoming about the issue and apologized that Amazon hasn't updated the information yet, even though I understand they have no control over that.<br /><br />I will probably continue buying these snacks despite that they're no longer organic. They're very tasty and better for you than most of what's on the market, at least!

They are very light, have a nice crunch to them and are pretty cheesey. Although the cheese flavor tastes more like real cheese then the processed fake cheese taste of cheetos, so they dont taste exactly like cheetos, but we dont mind we actually like these way better. The only negative comment that I have about this product is that once you open the bag they go stale fast.

Ya' know how you feel so guilty when you read labels and then proceed to have just a little more than a serving of something that may not be really all that good for you?? Well, not too worry with these little puff balls. The Nutrition Facts don't read like a death sentence. It's so nice when something good for you tastes like those foods we use to love, but just can't bring ourselves to put in our mouths anymore. Yesterday, I also sampled the Baked Fries, Classic Ketchup (I don't eat ketchup with my fries)and, darned if I didn't come home with a bag. Although my kids are grown, I think these would be a great snack for the little ones.....

review/summary: Actually Gluten-free.  Wooh!
review/text: I always approach a gluten-free label with a certain amount of scepticism.<br /><br />DeBoles Pasta, Bob's Red Mill, Rice Dream, Arrowhead Mills, General Mills Rice and Corn Chex, and Mi-Del Gluten Free cookies have all caused me to get a gluten reaction at one time or another.  (On the other hand, the Whole Foods Bakery cheese biscuits and cupcakes, Heinz Cream of Tomato Soup from Britain, Ian's and Amy's gluten-free frozen entrees, Blue Diamond Pecan, Hazelnut and Almond crackers, Tinkyada pasta, newer Bob's Red Mill Flours (post-2007 when they got the new mill), and Pacific Foods broths and soups that are in my pantry, are gluten-free, and yummy.)<br /><br />These cheese puffs are a welcome addition to the relatively short list of, "tastes good, won't make a celiac sick, kid-friendly items."  They are not expensive, either.<br /><br />Did I mention they're really gluten free?

review/summary: I wish they tasted like Grilled Cheese
review/text: I've been looking for a natural cheese puff that did not have all the additives and preservatives in it to make one's stomach upset.<br /><br />I thought I found the right product with "Snikiddy Snacks Grilled Cheese Puff".<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was wrong.<br /><br />When you eat one, they do taste good. However after eating a few in a row, there is a bad after taste that can upset your stomach.<br /><br />They are also not very cheesy and the product does not resemble the taste of a grilled cheese in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />I'm still looking for the perfect cheese puff, but these will not be on my list.

review/summary: Solid classic blend of fine herbes
review/text: This was the first time we bought this brand. Our usual was the expensive brand that comes in the crock and bought this as a whim to not have more crocks and just refill it.  We did not notice any  major difference and the important herb lavender is part of the blend although less noticable as the crock brand when you smell it. For our typical 'confusion ad lib' cooking style it works well if not better.  All the herbes work together as a blend and nothing standing out above the other. This blend will not take a dish to a heavy lavender note and you will have to supplement for that.<br /><br />Obviously one can easily make your own blend at home.  We just find this way more convenient and consistent.  Plus with two cooks in the house we don't have to argue if the blend was made properly or not.  We have been going through this faster since it is a more universally applicable blend for our cooking. Also mixing this with kosher salt makes a very versatile herb salt.

review/text: I have to admit I haven't actually seen or tasted this fruit. I bought a "3-month club" for my daughter who is in graduate school on the other side of the country. She's on a limited budget and rarely has enough money (or time to shop) for fresh fruits and vegetables. While I would assume this is pricier than buying fruit at the grocery store, she has loved getting this special treat once a month and has said the fruit is delicious. She has asked us to continue sending this to her for another 3 months!

review/summary: Refuting the 2-Star Review.
review/text: Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked "natural"), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track.

review/summary: Came highly recommended by our dogs breeder
review/text: Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Lamb Meal Dry Dog Food came highly recommended by our Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder. The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep.

review/text: To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

review/summary: It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.
review/text: Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like "chicken" or "chicken meal" and  you do not want things like "meat byproduct."  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the "Holistic"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.

review/summary: For a dog with sensitivity to chicken...
review/text: Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is "bulkier," too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change.

review/summary: Great food for a dog with a sensitive stomach
review/text: My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!

It turns out that you can serve much less for the same amount of nutrition as all the other popular brands so 30lb. goes for two months for my 45 lb dog!  I keep ordering online from Amazon and my ordering records show an order every two months.  Shows up in two days delivered! The veterinarian always comments on my dog's healthy coat and leanness. I only wish it could be on the subscription feature so that it would automatically be ordered and worry free, but there are more important things in life to worry about, right!?

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from "itchy butt" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.

review/text: Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.

review/summary: Excellent Quality; my dogs LOVE it!
review/text: I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.

review/summary: Works for My Dog and Me and Try Their New Treats
review/text: My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods. After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or "like" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>. The treats I bought are not yet offered on amazon. They are called Holistic Select Wheat Free Holistix with Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples & Blueberries Natural Biscuits for Dogs. They are easy to break in half for using as rewards.

He eats it on a daily basis - which is great as he was a rescue who previously had human food and I battled the food issue for years before finding this.  Great product!

review/summary: Holistic Select and Amazon Prime = A+
review/text: We have four dogs and they have done very well with the Holistic Select line.  It's a bit more money but if you look at the ingredient list, you'll see why.  Our dogs have not had digestive issues and their skin and coat are healthy. I am also a happy camper for not having to drag a big, bulky and heavy bag from the store to car to home.  The product is priced right and shipped super fast.  Amazon Prime is so worth it especially if you order a lot of stuff online.

review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: After a rash of pet food recalls about seven years ago we went searching for a brand that was not involved in recalls--and that's how we ended up with Holistic Select.  Never a regret, it's an awesome dog food.  And as it turns out, not only has our dog done well, but she thrives on the hypoallergenic duck and oatmeal type.

review/summary: Has solved our dog's alergy and GI tract problems 100%
review/text: Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and "prescription" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it.<br /><br />Then researched Eagle Pack and moved him onto this as it was heavily fed by Northern dog racers with similar breeds to ours.<br />"Eagle Pack" was prior brand name before it changed over to "Holistic Select" - but same product.<br /><br />GI issues went away, and our troubled-eater, barfer, bloody-diarrhea pooch is now healthy, happy, and has a great appetite and energy. Yes, it is more expensive, but if you compare the ingredients they are top notch.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this dry food for solving these issues. My review applies specifically to the Anchovy/Sardine/Salmon recipe.

review/summary: Noticable Weight Gain in My Dog After Only 6 Days of Feeding Her This
review/text: My dog was looking a bit on the thin side, and after ruling out any health issues, the vet suggested that I make changes to her diet. I stopped feeding her the junk they sell at the corner deli and switched to this stuff, and within 6 days there was a visible difference in her body weight. I never thought a dog could gain weight like that in less than a week, but my dog really bulked up and does not look thin at all anymore. It's amazing.

I've never once had a reason to question the integrity of the company or the health benefits from feeding it to my dogs.  Eagle Pack has never recalled any of their foods (even when it seemed like almost every other brand was).  They have a great proof of purchase rewards program.

review/summary: It's a Keeper
review/text: We adopted our dog last summer and have tried various dog foods including the small breed formula from this same company. This is the one that our dog eats the best, and what comes out her other end is the easiest to deal with. No bad breath. Our dog scratches a lot and I was hoping this food would help that, but alas, no.<br /><br />If you sign up at Holistic Select's website they will email you coupons. So far I got one for $5 and one for $3. I don't know how (or if) to use them on amazon so sometimes I buy locally.<br /><br />This is small kibble suitable for small dogs. Don't know about big dogs. The pieces are flattish disks about 3/16" thick and 3/8" or so in diameter. They vary some.

Cured my dogs of ear problems, hot spots and other intestinal problems quickly and my dogs love the taste.  It does cost a bit more, but well worth it when you factor in expensive vet visits and loss of sleep while the poor dog scratches and scratches while you watch helplessly.  Do yourself and your dog a favor and give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Good food for English bulldog
review/text: We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.

review/summary: Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS
review/text: We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.

review/text: My little Shiba just can't handle chicken or grain byproducts. I love the ingredients, I love that my dog is enthusiastic about the food and I love that I can buy it on Amazon.com and have it delivered.<br /><br />The tiny kibble is great for smaller mouths but is on the harder side when it comes to dry. I have used pro-plan in the past and notice the shredded mix has much softer/grainy kibble. I sometimes moisten the food with a little bit of pet-friendly topping.<br /><br />The mix is nutrient and calorie dense. You may have to tweak your volume, depending on what you're switching from.

review/text: I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years, and I have been very pleased!  Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from "chronic" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!  I would recommend this dog food to anyone!

review/summary: Content means less than names
review/text: I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, "Holistic",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or "natural" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?

I was a little worried once I actually saw them because they seem small, like they may have a short "life span;" however, I was surprised to find that they actually hold up for quite awhile. They are sour, but not quite as sour as Sour Patch Kids. They taste good and don't leave that grimy need-to-brush-your-teeth feeling in your mouth that other sugary candies sometimes do. This is a good product for a good price.

review/text: A while ago, I bought a few 30 oz containers of assorted flavor lollipops, but as of the past few months, I've been buying these pouches to refill my container at work (using Subscribe and Save!).  2 main reasons: the pouches have what I (and my coworkers) feel are the best flavors, and secondly, because each pouch has the same number of each flavor, which makes for much more even flavor distribution. One problem I had with the containers was sometimes they would have a disproportionate number of one flavor over another. No problems with the pouches!  Love the flavors, love the mini size (so you can eat one or many), love the lack of artificial ingredients or corn syrup.

review/summary: Yummy Earth Super Sour Pops
review/text: I received my package today, very well packaged 15 pops a bag and 6 colorful bags. The assortment was very well done and u get 4 pops of 3 flavors and 3 of 1 flavor in every bag. Evens out well and I really enjoyed 3 out the 4 Flavors. Very mouth watering pops about the size of a quarter with some TARTness not really (SUPER) sour. But thats why I bought them the chemical sour candy "burns" your tongue and is terrible for your teeth and body. Googly Grape was my least favorite,tasted like grape but Im not sure if cause the sourness but it didnt mix with grape well(this makes sense You never see SOUR grape candy, usually sour apple, sour "any"berry or sour lemon).Would love to try jus regular grape had good flavor.<br /><br />3rd favorite-CHERRY-  Tasted like a black cherry sourness blended decent, mouth watering but just felt like it needed more sweetness the sour was mixed well but just lacked something in that sweet cherry flavor kind of bland needs more sweet/cherry extract?<br /><br />1st and 2nd Favorites- Strawberry Smash and Sour Apple Tart-<br />  Strawberry was by far the biggest favorite of friends and family and myself, whatever ratio the sweet to sour and sour to sweet you've been dreaming about is right here. PERFECT. Strawberry I hide in my room only for myself and special friends. Very nice summer strawberry sweetness with a perfect TARTNESS<br />  Apple was very close 2nd and Still something I reach for out of the 4 flavors. My grandmother said it tasted like a granny smith from her orchard. The smell is heavenly and when I kissed her on the cheek goodbye she said my breath smelled fruity and sweet. She said it the perfect tartness of a Tart apple and the blend on this flavor was done right as well.<br /><br /> I am quitting smoking and I wanted an organic pop so as to not destroy my teeth during quitting with sugar. Well you HAVE to bite them before finishing or u start "eating" bleached paper pulp from the stick. I would buy again once I'm done quitting smoking but for now eating more than to 3 or 4 in a day will burn your tongue or burn your lips if they're chapped. If your quitting smoking I recommend the regular lollipops, not as harsh on the mouth, I will be gifitng a couple pops out of these pouches to kids on halloween coming up. Very good treat but not meant for regular all day lollipopping. Very big hit with my hiking group mouth watering and enjoyed in moderation VERY tasty.

review/text: First of all, I got my items on time so I can't complain. These lollipops are very tasty, sort of sour but not too sour. Very delicious, I can't wait to try the other lollipops from this same brand.

review/text: These hambugers had no taste, I think the box they were shipped in would of had more flavor. Don't waste your money on this product unless you need a hockey puck.

review/summary: It Must Have Been The Roses!
review/text: I purchased this to incorporate into my own Ras El Hanout (along with some Lavender Powder: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015E34L2 , and a number of other ground spices).<br /><br />The floral component of the Ras El Hanout was perfectly accomplished with these two additions [a very little bit goes a LONG way!], and I had plenty left over for use in my experimental perfume-making hobby.<br /><br />The scent of the rose powder is lovely and the taste is not too bitter, with the Rosy 'nose' of the component being greater than the wholly-natural and expected bitterness of it.

review/summary: mustard seed
review/text: I bought this mustard seed to add to my home made summer sausage thinking that it would add some flavor to it but it didn't. this mustard seed has no flavor at all not sure if I need to do something to it before I add it to the sausage or not. I never used mustard seed before so if someone could tell me what I need to do to get some flavor from these seeds I'd be happy.

review/summary: Spice Purchase
review/text: Overall average.  The mustard seed had settled by 35% leaving less than a full bottle.  I also purchased the "no salt" version - not even close to "Mrs. Dash", nutmeg, turmeric (also settled and 20% less by volume, and others.  There was a shipping/handling charge bigger than the spices charge, but no charge for the 2-4 spices ordered.

review/summary: Turr&oacute;ns got me an A+ in Spanish!
review/text: I was doing an oral presentation for my college Spanish class on Christmas in Spain and I wanted something special to give to my classmates.  These Turr&oacute;ns were perfect!  The price was right and they were fresh and crunchy.  The class loved them and my Spanish Professor gave me an A+ on my presentation.  It doesn't get any better than that!

review/summary: Feline fave
review/text: My cat Tama came from Japan, where she apparently became a fanatic about this expensive snack. These large packs arrived promptly at my door and were the best price I've found anywhere. One problem: the flakes in one of the bags were no longer flakes, but were pulverized to a powder. Hence the lower rating.

review/summary: Cat crack!
review/text: My cat doesn't eat fish.  He's strictly a turkey "man", and that's that.  No room for negotiation whatsoever!<br />EXCEPT...he doesn't know this was ever fish!  I'd heard that every cat on earth found these addicting, so I thought I'd do a little behavior modification and introduce the idea of fish with these Bonito flakes. He now loves these, but there's no convincing him it's fish. Seriously, these are so much cheaper than in the pet store, and this particular brand is better than the other one I bought on Amazon.  Much less breakage, and cats like the big, airy, crispy bite that's lost with breakage.  The only reason I can't give it five stars is that it's still really pricey for what it is. I will, however, buy this brand again. Soon
