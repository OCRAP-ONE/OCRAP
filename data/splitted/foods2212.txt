review/summary: Great as an Iced Tea !!!
review/text: I buy this tea not to use hot in my Keurig but just by accident made it in my cup for Ice Tea - it is wonderful !  A nice change from soda.  Fill your glass with ice, brew your k cup & pour in then add sweetener if desired.  I usually use one sweetner packet.  Try it & you may like it too !

review/summary: Tastes great but Amazon's price is very expensive!
review/text: This drink is delicious...better than YooHoo.  Yoohoo has a funny aftertaste...not like it used to be when I was a kid.  Anyway after some calculations Amazon is selling this item almost twice as much than in a grocery store.  I bought mine for $4.29 at Wegman's.  There is 9 boxes in a pack and 3 packs in this listing...roughly $7.00 per pack.<br />Even with the special offer of 40% off the second 3-pack it's still a little over $5.00 per pack.  I'll stick to buying it at the grocery store.

review/text: This is a great value.  My grandson loves chocolate milk.  Be sure you get a box-drink holder though (get one cheap at local Wal-Mart) because you can make a mess squeezing the box.  thanks, Amazon for the good price and quick delivery.... and before anyone asks.... no, amazon doesn't pay me.  I just think a good product and delivery should be applauded.

review/text: Was a little leery of a product labelled as chocolate "drink", but after careful review of the ingredients, found them to be pretty similar. I wasn't able to distinguish ANY difference in taste between the Hershey's Chocolate Milk and Hershey's Chocolate "Drink". There are some minor differences in nutritional ingredient amounts (less protein, carbs, etc.), but nothing that caused me concern.<br /><br />With the reduced cost and only minimally reduced nutritional benefits, this makes a wonderful recovery drink for me after workouts!

review/summary: As Great as the Pure Vanilla
review/text: We as a population are so lucky to have so many different tastes and flavors.  One of those tastes and flavors is Nielsen-Massey Pure Almond Extract.  I is on a par as Nielsen-Massey Pure Vanilla Extract and frankly I cannot tell any difference between the two in terms of quality.  Each has characteristics that make any cooking or baking the best possible.  Sure I can buy imitation flavors and I will see and taste the difference between the real and imitation.  A recent Almond Pound Cake was ingested so fast at a desert fair the folks wanted more.  I have found that any Nielsen-Massey (N-M)flavor is consistently fantastic and never overstated.  Some flavors cannot be detected because they disappear when cooked but not so with N-M.  This set of flavors is a must have when the time comes.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Delicious AND nutritious
review/text: These muffins are delicious, nutritious, and (best for me) very easy to make! Black cherry was not overly sweet and didn't have that "fake" cherry taste.<br /><br />They are choc-full of all those really healthy ingredients that should not taste good together, but they do. They may *seem* pricey, but I've tried creating muffin-like-thingees like this on my own and it wasn't cheap. And it wasn't easy. And they didn't taste this good.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit they don't taste like the muffins grandma made. But these won't contribute to heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, either.<br /><br />These are very filling and can hold you as well as a meal in a pinch.  Very fiberfilled! Since we are on a diet, we take them on trips to curb those crazy eating habits away from home.<br /><br />I've tried both the Splenda & the Xylitol versions and they are equally good.  Splenda is sweeter but Xylitol is slightly more moist.<br /><br />Be sure to let the wet dough "rest" for 10 minutes per the instructions. I suspect this may be the reason one of the other reviewers reported that his muffins were hard as rocks.

review/text: Somehow, this chocolate just really doesn't have much flavor. I'm not even any kind of a chocolate / candy snob, but this stuff just surprised me with how bland it was. I truly think a plain Hershey bar has more flavor. It's not BAD, it's just....nothing. Just vaguely sweet with little bits of almond. Tastes to me like the dark chocolate aspect is most definitely mostly sugar and little cocoa. Doesn't melt in the mouth quickly the way some other bars tend to. I gave it a shot, but I won't buy one again unless it was the last bar on the shelf and I was dying for a chocolate fix or something.

review/summary: Child Friendly Gluten Free Bread!!!!!!!
review/text: We stopped into this cute bakery on a recent trip to San Antonio where it is located.  We bought a loaf of their gluten free white bread for our 8 year old recently diagnosed with Celiacs Disease.  He loves this bread!  When I made him a grilled cheese he said it "tastes just like a real grilled cheese!"  It has a great taste and NO BITTER AFTERTASTE as is commonly the case with other gluten free breads we've tried.  Unfortunately, it is much more expensive(about $2.50 more when buying a single loaf)than the Udi's Gluten Free White Bread we usually buy at our local grocer BUT, in its defense, the loaf is much bigger than an Udi's Gluten Free White Bread loaf (my son calls Udi's toy food sized bread).  A slice of this Little Aussie Bakery White Bread is the closest in size to a regular slice of bread that we have found since he got sick.  I wish we lived in San Antonio because I would love to be able to buy him this bread exclusively but with the expensive price per loaf and expensive shipping ($9.99 for 1 loaf) we just can't afford it:(

Also purchased the Organic Pumpkin as an added supplement that I now add to his regular daily feedings and he's losing weight each month.  Initially weighed in at a hefty 52 pounds, now weighs 46.5 pounds and he's enjoying far more energy, delicious meals and an improved interest in active (interactive) play times.  With his breed having a 10-12 year life expectancy, it's amazing to see how at eight and a half years of age, he's behaving more like a lively puppy again.

These treats come in a little flower shape and a too hard for him to just eat and train. They smell great however and he loves the taste. When i first opened the bag it smelled like fresh apple cookies so I was impressed. But its not the best training treat.

Now that that's out of the way, these apparently healthy vegan treats are hard (brittle might be a better word), have no enticing aroma, and are not appealing to my 2-year-old toy breed. I stupidly bought a bag of every flavor since the reviews were so positive and since vegan dog treats are relatively hard to find (I'm in Florida). Now I have 4-5 bags of these that I can't use.

review/summary: Can Cause Tooth Decay!
review/text: I did not look carefully at the ingredients' list when I ordered these treats. Once they arrived, I noticed they contain molasses which can cause tooth decay so I ended up sending them back. They are a hard, crunchy treat so your dog is definitely going to use the back teeth to chew them where they could get a cavity. While they smell great and contain some healthy ingredients, it just wasn't worth it to me to take that chance. There are other tasty dog treats on the market that I won't have that worry with so I sent them back.

review/text: I didn't look carefully at the ingredient list before I ordered these treats. They contain molasses which can cause tooth decay so I ended up sending them back. They are a hard, crunchy treat so your dog will have to use the back molars to chew them where it would be easy to get a cavity. While they smelled great and have some quality ingredients in them, for me it just wasn't worth taking that chance when there are lots of other great dog treats out there, where I won't have this worry, to get instead.

review/text: I got the blueberry and one other; the puppies love it. Both I and my wife love the smell of it. Wonderful ingredients. Not hard, but does not fall apart or even generate crumbs as the puppies chew it. Makes a gentle but very satisfying crunching noise (I like listening to my puppies crunch things). Easily one of the best puppy biscuits available.

She'll wiggle, jump, shiver and shake until she's had her daily Fruitables.  I can hardly wait to try the other flavors.  I really like that this are all natural and healthy for my pets.

The treats are a little larger than the size of a nickel.  They were made with high quality ingredients.  Free from grains, soy, corn and artificial ingredients and certified organic.  My dogs love these treats and only 9 calories per treat so a few each day will not hurt their waistline.  I am impressed with this product line and of course support any company who produces their products in the USA.  I will definitely purchase more products from the Fruitables line.

review/summary: Awesome treats for your dog!
review/text: Before my boyfriend and I went to get our eight month old Boston Terrier two weeks ago, we bought supplies we would need beforehand. We picked up Fruitables Pumpkin and Banana treats because they were cheap and sounded like simple, good treats (I check ingredients). When I opened up the package, I was amazed at how awesome they smelled - they really smell like they could be "human" cookies! My dog LOVES these treats and it makes training fun for us. They also have the benefit of being good for digestion and are low calorie/high fiber.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />For those who have small dogs who can't eat these - I usually run a treat under the sink faucet for a few seconds to make it softer. You can then break off the "petals" of the flower-shaped treats to make smaller treat bits (which are also great to use for training smaller dogs).

And at just under nine calories each (4 cal broken), they are perfect for my Jack Russel who basically gets a treat for every event in his day. After he potties, whenever he comes in from playing, whenever I come in from outside, pretty much any time the door opens & closes he gets a treat. He loves these and I don't feel bad about giving them to him throughout the day.

review/summary: These smell great, and my dog says they taste good.
review/text: I'm always looking for new dog treats to keep my beagle-daschund and black lab spoiled. And although they aren't very picky about taste, I am picky about ingredients.<br /><br />The Fruitables Pumpkin and Apple treats smell great. The ingredients are simple, they're made in the USA, they contain no animal products or by-products (though that's not true for all of the treats from this company), and they don't contain many of the common allergens found in dog treats (wheat, soy, corn).<br /><br />Be aware that these treats are small (a little too small for my 90-lb lab who doesn't even realize he has eaten something when he gets one of these). And they're hard (my beagle-daschund crunches through them with a little work, but a very small dog might not be able to eat these).<br /><br />Overall, a good treat! I think the best dog treat so far, however, is The Lazy Dog Cookie Co Inc Coconut Carob Chip Pup-squeaks, which are unfortunately out-of-stock right now on Amazon. The Fruitable treats are a close second.

Dog loves them and since he's a puppy, they are a good size treat for him.  NOT a good training treat though...  they are crunchy so they take a bit to chew.  Soft treats are better for training so I intend to try the soft mango treats in this brand.<br /><br />Price is excellent on Amazon - at least 1.50/bag cheaper here than I can get locally.

The pups absolutely love them, and the ingredients are top notch.<br /><br />I ordered these to complement Zuke's Mini Bakes and Mini Naturals as training treats.  I break the little "petals" off, with the occasional "full flower" bonus.<br /><br />My personal opinions regarding the three:<br />Fruitables -> Dogs love 'em and top notch ingredients.  Maybe a bit big for training if you don't break them up.<br />Mini Naturals -> Dogs love 'em and great ingredients.  Perfect size for training, but contain gelatin which I like to limit.  Priced perfectly.<br />Mini Bakes -> Dogs like them.  Good size, great ingredients, but a bit more plain.

review/text: I can't deny that these smell amazing- all the fruitables that I ordered smelled like human-counterpart treats...blueberries, yum.<br /><br />I was excited to give my dog a "real" treat, and I have him one of this and one of another fruitables soft chew. A few hours later, we were shocked at the dog spitting up everything in this stomach- he threw up about 3 times, and then continued to spit up mucous and bile fluid. Gross, and really unfortunate :(<br /><br />I contacted both fruitables and amazon, who both graciously accepted the open bags as returns, and fruitables checked the lot numbers of the bags I had. I guess my dog had a particular sensitivity to something in these, which stinks because I really wanted him to love these nice smelling treats.<br /><br />Hopefully others have better luck with them!

review/text: My lab goes wild for these and I am almost tempted to have a go at some myself, as they smell so great. So far I have resisted the temptation despite the fact that they are filled with healthy ingredients.

review/summary: My pup never turns these down
review/text: My shiba pup loves these. I actually break them up into each pedal for him because he can't figure out how to eat these whole yet. But he loves it and I've been giving these as an after walk treats and they're great for training. I'm really happy with the ingredients in this treat.

review/summary: Treats break into perfect pieces for my pup
review/text: I bought these treats because they looked liked they could break into suitable pieces for my pup.  And they did.  Just by hand you could break it down to each leaf of the flower that the treat is shaped to be.  A 7oz bag comes with about 90 treats at ~9 calories each.  I usually break each one into 3 pieces (2 leaves each) and it's a good size for my 20lb pup.  After reading the ingredients, I was under the impression that they'd be kinda chewy but they're baked and hard/crunchy.  The pup takes about 8-10 seconds to finish each 2 leaf piece which is sometimes a little long when trying to train commands and etc but I just break the treats down even more if I need her to eat faster.  The flavor I bought, Pumpkin and Apple, smells great and they don't leave crumbles in my pocket when we're on the go.<br />One thing I should add though is that if you break the fruitables treats into pieces, you'll notice that they're pretty fibrous.  On several occasions my pup's had to cough/clear her throat after feeding her one of these.  But it's not a big deal she loves these treats.

review/text: My 8 pound Havanese loves these. I literally just got her yesterday but she eats these happily. I read the reviews about how delicious these smelled, and they do seem tempting. The flavors and ingredients are great. I am doing a mostly grain free diet with her so these are perfect. And the size is great for training. I break one up with no problem.

review/summary: Puppy was pleased with these :)
review/text: I bought these for my dad's new black lab puppy for a 'father's day' gift. He LOVES them and as a puppy, we were worried that his stomach would be fussy when eating something new like this. So far, no problems and my father now is on the hunt to find a place that sells these in his area. They are also small enought to be used as a training treat.

They are very cute too - shaped like a flower.  Looks like Fruitables will be a staple snack for my dog.

review/summary: My dog loves these!
review/text: First off, my dog has some major stomach issues. It seems like we're always trying to find good treats for him that won't cause him to get loose stools. This is our grand winner! We started with the pumpkin and apple, and then went to the pumpkin and cranberry and, most recently, the pumpkin and blueberry. He loves all three! Major perks? They are made in the USA, they are all natural, and they smell SO GOOD (my husband tried them and says they also taste good, especially the blueberry)!

review/summary: My puppy goes crazy!!!
review/text: I saw these treats online and was going to order them but I went to my local grocery store and they had them there for a 1.00 cheaper. I brought these home and my cocker spaniel puppy has been going crazy for them ever since. He gobbles them up. He even starts to cry and whine when I open the bag because he wants it so bad. I'm glad its a healthy option for him. He loves the pumpkin/banana ones better then the pumpkin/apple. I haven't tried the others because I know that cockers can be sensitive to allergys. I also saw the chewy ones at the store as well so I will try those and update my review.

review/summary: good smelling, but one of my dogs had an allergic reaction
review/text: My family has four dachshunds and they all gobbled up these treats. One of my dachshunds developed an allergy to these treats after I went through 2 bags. He got hives and this throat swelled up. We caught it fast and got him to the vet. He had to take benadryl  for a few days. He's just fine now, but I can't risk feeding my dogs these treats anymore.<br /><br />Before anyone questions, I know they were these treats because he had one small reaction before the big one. The big reaction was right after I fed one of these treats and  he had no other treats as these were the only ones that I had on hand.

review/summary: One of my favorite treats for my dog!
review/text: Not only are these "low" calorie but they smell absolutely great! The aroma of each treat is significant every time you open the bag.<br /><br />These may be too small for big dogs (labs) and too big for small (chihuahuas). These are about the size of a quarter and about 1/3 inch thick. My dog, Max, is a pit/lab mix. He, sometimes, swallows them whole but will chew them when he takes his time.<br /><br />I love that there are no fillers and they are affordable. Plus I know how many calories I'm giving to Max with these treats.<br />I've bought all of the flavors and they are all great! I can honestly say that these are one of my favorite treats!

review/summary: Great treats, but hard to split into smaller pieces
review/text: These treats are great, and my dog really likes them (although he doesn't like them as much as meat-based treats). The only problem I have is that I've been using them for training my small dog, and will be using them to train the puppy we're getting soon, and they're very difficult to break into smaller pieces. They tend to break unevenly and leave a lot of crumbs.

review/summary: Healthy pet treat
review/text: I have two dogs, a Lab and a Chihuahua.  These were a big success with my Chihuahua and he gets super excited any time he hears the bag so much as move and he wolfs them right down.  But he is a food-obsessed dog and I rarely encounter something he'll turn down.  My Lab doesn't care much for them, but she doesn't like crunchy treats much anymore (she's older).  They are made and sourced in the USA and "free of wheat, corn, soy and artificial ingredients, colors or preservatives."  The ingredients are in this order pumpkin, organic oatmeal, pearled barley, potatoes, oat fiber, canola oil, brown sugar, bananas, cinnamon, natural flavor, vanilla, mixed tocopherols.  The package says under 9 calories per treat, about 90 treats per pouch (so they'll last a long time.)

review/summary: We all wish we could eat a Fruitable.
review/text: It's the best treat ever... for appealing to humans.  Everyone where I work says this is the only dog treat they wish they could eat.  It smells, FABULOUS.  I mean, I've smelled a lot of dog treats.  I promise you, upon opening this bag, you'll go, "Wuhhh?" and take a deeper sniff.<br /><br />These are not always such a sure-fire hit with the dogs, however.  Some really go for them.  It's about 60/40, the haters & the lovers.  I honestly wish more dogs liked these, because they make my training pouch smell SO much better than those stinky chicken & cheese nuggets I'm often stuck handing out.  Honesty, however, compels me to admit I am often more in favor of these treats than the dogs.<br /><br />However; I emphasize that *some* dogs did quite like these.  They're a good fit for Kong stuffing and puzzle toys.  They're not a guarantee, but if your pup likes fruit, he will probably enjoy these.

review/summary: I thought they were bland
review/text: Yes, I did try one. They taste very bland, actually, to me they had very little flavor. But my rabbits and the dog love them. Kind of expensive but if you get them at the $1 per bag rates you are getting a big bargain even with the shipping and handling. I actually ordered some treats from a different business that sells bunny treats and found it was this same product repackaged, a smaller amount in the bag and a bigger price. So I checked Amazon and found that the identical items were sold as doggie treats in a bigger bag and less cost. On top of that nice savings (I don't have a car at the moment so I can't drive to the pet store)the animals fight each other to be first in the handout line. I wish I could get the recipe for them. And, I'd like to buy them in a 5lb bag. Does anyone sell them that way? They'd make a nice doggie Christmas present.

review/text: Can't say enough good things about this product.... We've tried 3 Fruitables varieties - pumpkin/apple, pumpkin/cranberry, and pumpkin/blueberry - and the pooch craves them all. As he has kidney disease, it is very important that his treats are low in protein and fat, and these treats follow the specifications of what we should be feeding him perfectly! As other reviewers have mentioned, they smell so good it's hard to believe they're not meant for human consumption... I haven't had the nerve to actually try one... yet. I would highly recommend them!

She won't eat some of the obvious, more common snacks (sweet potato strips for example) and finding Fruitables has been great!!! They actually stimulate my 16 year olds appetite.  And, they are so inexpensive!!! After spending a fortune at the boutique stores, Fruitables are quite a find.
