review/summary: Excellent training treats - Perfect for my goldendoodle pup
review/text: Zuke's Chicken Flavored Mini treats are perfect for training dogs, especially a puppy in my case.  I picked these treats for my new 8 week old goldendoodle puppy.  She immediately loved them.  Since puppies have such short attention spans and require so much training, I need to use them frequently!  They are very reasonably priced compared to most products found in pet stores and have all natural healthy ingredients.  The small size of these treats allows you to get great use out of them, while giving them to your dog frequently for good behavior.  You won't need to constantly replenish your supply either.

review/summary: good training treats
review/text: Great treats! I tear each one into 10 small pieces for training my 4.5lb 8 week Puggle. The only problem with these treats is that they dry up quickly. Within an hour or so the outside is dry, hard to rip with my fingers, and I imagine not easy for a little puppy.

review/text: These treats are tiny and GREAT for training--low calorie, yet so aromatic that my dog jumps for joy as he smells them. The customer service was great, except they back-ordered one package of the treats, assured me they should be here in a few weeks; I've been waiting a month for the item.

review/text: These are by far the favorite treats of our two dogs and a treat of which they never tire. We keep them in a cannister by the dining room slider so there always handy for a good dog who came when called or allowed me to dry her wet feet.<br />We like that the treats are small and soft also. These make great training treats for one can easily carry a handful in your pocket.<br />As a dog enthusiast who's bought many kinds of treats, I highly recommend Zuke's treats, especially the salmon mini naturals.

review/summary: Wonderful lo calorie training treat
review/text: A pound of training treats at this price is a good deal. I like everything about the treats including the size. They are NOT too tiny for my Great Dane and I can use a lot of them without filling him up and expanding his waist.  He loves the flavor, the smell is strong enough to entice without being offensive. The peanut butter flavor has not upset his sensitive stomach. They arent messy on your hands or in your pockets. They will dry out if left outside the package for any length of time so I usually separate some into a small tupperware type container for home and into small ziploc bags for carrying to classes or on walks. I will sometimes put a handful in my pocket and these actually survive the washing machine (not sure if that is good or bad).

review/summary: Must be Some Sort of Magic!
review/text: We've had our Jack Russell for 13 years. He has never willingly gotten out of the pool before he was darn good a ready. His first sniff of these amazing treats and his nose was glued to my fingers and he was out the pool, across the patio and in the house without a second's hesitation.  He has also always completely destroyed any stuffed squeaker toy he has ever touched in a matter of minutes.  Not with these babies around. One whiff and the toy is forgotten; no fighting, no biting, no stuffing to pick up.  These are magic!  I only wish I'd known about them a decade sooner. Thanks.  If you have a headstrong dog on your hands, buy these treats - all flavors. They'll change your life.

review/text: He really loves these treats more than any other treats out there. He flips backwards just to get these LOL. These are a just a little bigger than a pencil eraser. They are great for training. I like to cut them in half to yield even more. I tried cutting them in quarters but they seem a little too small for my dogs big mouth. They come in a resealable package so that helps to keep them nice and fresh and especially soft. I forgot to close the bag one day and the treats got pretty hard but the dog didn't mind.

review/summary: Great rewards for clicker training
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:42 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have been clicker training Bella, a toy Yorkshire Terrier, for about 3 years.  Now that she has a baby sister (Bleu, a miniature Blue Heeler) I started to look for a new type of treat to help reinforce the training.  When Bella was little I used small pieces of hot dogs but I wanted to switch to something healthier.  Zuke's mini treats seem to work really well.  I use the chicken flavored ones and I am really impressed with both how much the dogs like them and how much they smell like real food.  I thought that I would make this quick video to show the treats (and my dogs) in action.

review/text: My dog loves these!  I've only tried the salmon and peanut butter, I held off on the chicken due to other reviews saying it smells bad.  I prefer the peanut butter by far, the salmon is a bit stinky.  I noticed that my hands as well as my dog smelled fishy after giving him treats and petting for a job well done.  Treat size is perfect although they do tend to dry out if you don't keep them in a well sealed container.

review/text: Let me start by saying my dog weighs 24 lbs but should be 17 lbs. I make this point because she is overweight and will eat anything.I purchased these treats because they are low calorie, all natural and had great reviews. I tried for 3 days but she wouldn't eat even 1 little morsel.Obviously I was disappointed and also shocked like I stated she's 7 years old and will eat anything. Maybe the bag I received was stale but wasted my money and tossed into the garbage.

review/summary: Not up to expectations, more like gelatin than chicken
review/text: Our dogs love chicken so, after reading all of the positive reviews and noting that the first ingredient was chicken, I was really hopeful that these would be their new favorite treat. They sometimes will play with them for a minute but will not eat them and are not the least bit excited about them. They even lost interest in the sound of the treat jar that normally gets them very excited. These treats feel and look more like a wad of gelatin than chicken and have been relegated to the trash bin. They would be a little on the expensive side if they actually were mostly chicken but they are way overpriced for sort of chicken gel wads.<br /><br />While almost everything "tastes like chicken" these treats don't, as evidenced by the fact that our chicken-loving dogs do not like them one bit.

review/summary: would be okay if they didnt get hard after 5 minutes
review/text: I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.

review/summary: LOVE IT - and so do both my dogs, even the picky one!
review/text: Both my dogs love these treats.  They have both tried the salmon and the chicken flavor.  The only reason we didn't try the peanut-butter flavored ones is because they already get peanut butter in their kongs as a treat, so we used salmon and chicken as a "variety."<br /><br />Great for treats in general, and also perfect for training!<br />For training purposes - we actually cut them into fourths (we have a picky yorkie and a puppy who will be a medium sized dog).  At 3.5 calories per treat - cut into FOURTHS - I am happy to give them as many as they need during training sessions without worrying too much about feeding them too many treats and spoiling their mealtime!  Very easy to cut into the right size.  Even after cutting them into fourths, my yorkie and puppy still have to chew a little.  So it's actually a little necessary for us to cut them or else we have to wait too long for them to chew it and swallow before continuing with the training session.  So cutting it makes it a better bite-sized morsel that makes them happy but quick to gobble up.  I'm sure once our puppy gets bigger we will only cut into halves and then not at all later.  But currently he still likes to take a few happy chews of his 1/4-zuke!<br /><br />They are quite odorous (which is probably why the dogs love them so much) - so it maybe takes some time to get used to the first few times you are digging into the treat bag.  But it gets better later  :)  But whatever the dogs like and is safe to eat works for me!

review/summary: Sad to see it go, even the cat was sold!
review/text: When my local pet store started giving out samples of the peanut butter mini's, I knew I was in trouble.  My 90 pound Akita was immediately obsessed with them and I knew we'd have to keep them in stock at all times.  I like the mini's because they're so low in calories, and she likes them so much she doesn't care how big they are.  The squares are great too because you can easily snap them into 4's and make your own mini's.  The funny thing is - my dog's cat totally loves them too!  I threw one on the floor for the dog, and her cat hauled tush to it, devouring it in seconds.  We had a new family game, I'd throw one inbetween them to see who wants it more ...<br /><br />Anyway, the super sad news is that, cat and dog can no longer fight to the zukes mini death.  My dog started having bowel issues - she'd get bloated and gassy, and have diarrhea at least once a day.  I seriously fought for this treat - I researched every dang ingredient in it to disprove of it being the cause and I'm here to tell you,  Zuke's is definitely giving us our money's worth.  But after 48 Zuke's free hours - her digestive disorders vanished completely.  It's not Zuke's fault and I am not at all bad mouthing their product, I still think it's the bomb.com!  I'm only sharing because I couldn't find one other person out there with the same unusual experience.  If it happens(ed) to anyone else, know that I'm jammin' some "Against All Odds" for both of us!

review/text: Our 10 month old mixed breed is a very picky eater. After trying a few different brands of dog treats someone suggested we try Zuke's because of the high protein and natural ingredients. Our puppy loves them!  The treats are small enough that I don't have to worry about breaking them up for training. There is a very strong smell with these treats, but it actually helps because our puppy comes running when I open the bag. I will be buying more flavors in the future.

review/text: My dog Buddy is phickel when it comes to  dog food.  One day he loves the food next day not so much. He loved the RAW DEHYDRATED then no thank you. canned without grain okay for a week then rather not. The ONE constant is Buddy absolutely loves Zuke's mini - chicken and/or Salmon treats;<br />Over all other treats Buddy loves his Zukes.

review/summary: My dog loves them
review/text: My dog loves these treats. I usually get him the chicken but I'm fairly certain he would like any of the flavors. It is true that they dry out easily. You have to be sure to close the ziplock. I usually separate them into several baggies to make them last longer. My dog still eats them even if they are a little hard though.

review/summary: My dog loves these peanut butter treats!
review/text: My dog is a picky eater and will ignore some kinds of treats. However, she consistently and readily works for these peanut butter minis. The treats are quite smelly and break pretty easily into two. However, they tend to crumble if they become even slightly dry. On the whole, I would highly recommend Zuke's minis because they're the right size and have the right flavors to get my dog's attention!

I give my dog these bones as a treat once or twice a week, and he always perks up when he sees me pulling one out of the pack for him, and that's a treat for me!

review/summary: Totally too expensive
review/text: This review isn't for oats in general but in this particular posting for them. The price on this is outrageous. While there is no difference in oats in general (Quaker is just the same as any store brand) I understand if one must have Quaker; however, this is not the venue in which to do it. These oats are so overpriced as to be offensive. The same size box sells for $7 at Sam's. As one poster recommended, you would be better off buying them at the supermarket than on here. Better yet, just go to Sam's and pay less than half!

review/summary: a fine choice for breakfast--or whenever
review/text: Quaker Oats may not be the most exciting thing I could review, but it's so incredibly good for your health that I decided to submit this review anyway. Oatmeal has apparently been around in one form or another for goodness knows how long; and the Quaker Oats brand of oatmeal is probably the best you can buy.<br /><br />The oatmeal is easy to make; you can make it on the stovetop with either milk or water (water is healthier); alternatively you can prepare it in the microwave as I do. There are instructions for stovetop cooking on the packaging. If you want to make it in the microwave, pour a serving (1/2 cup dry) into a bowl, add some water until you're satisfied with the amount of water in the bowl and just pop it into the microwave. I find that 2 � minutes in the microwave makes a great hot breakfast that's very healthy for me; and that's doubly important for me as I am on a very strict diet. I must lower my weight and cholesterol to avoid even more health problems that I already have. Sigh.<br /><br />The oatmeal has a slight amount of fat; the total fat is 3 grams per serving. There is no cholesterol; and there's no sodium which makes this a better choice than Cheerios if you're watching your sodium intake. The dietary fiber is relatively high; there are 4 grams of dietary fiber per serving.<br /><br />If you have any questions about just how much oatmeal you need in your own specific diet, ask your doctor. Sometimes eating extra oatmeal--for example, having two portions instead of one every morning--doesn't necessarily mean you're getting twice the value of this product. Again, please ask your doctor or nutritionist to be sure.<br /><br />In addition, the containers usually last a little over a year--look at the packaging for the expiration date and eat the oatmeal before that time.<br /><br />Overall, this oatmeal by Quaker Oats is just about the healthiest choice for your daily breakfast or any other time you wish to eat it.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: EPIC BOX OF OATMEAL
review/text: I woke up one morning and thought to myself "I should order a giant box of oatmeal."  I scoured the internet, near and far.  Lowe and behold, Amazon had exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />If you like Quaker Oats instant oatmeal, then you'll love this box of oats.  There's a grand total of 9lbs in here.  It's really more oats than you will know what to do with.<br /><br />There are two bags inside so once you've finished 4.5lbs of oatmeal, you can take a break without the other 4.5lbs getting gross on you.  This is a particularly good thing because sometimes an enormous box of oatmeal is just too much for one person to consume steadily.

review/text: We have been using the Quaker oats for over 10 years as a breakfast source, for making oatmeal raisin cookie, and for making granola. These are undoubtedly the best oats. Just make it on stove-top in early morning, put some dates or raisins and little bit of honey. It is great taste. Good for health as well as for filling the stomach!

review/text: What else could you possibly eat that is so cheap to buy plus it's great for your health as well, especially if you have to deal with cholesterol issues? I cook these oats in a little water for just a few minutes and then top them with milk and a little sugar. Some folks use brown sugar, or even cinnamon, which is terrific too.<br /><br />But I will *never* buy generic or store-brand oats because it was above and beyond the call of duty for this fine company to use Barbara Bush's image on the front of the box, one of the great First Ladies of the 20th Century, as an American likeness to represent this long-renowned food product. I salute them!<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: great texture for baking, no pesticide worries
review/text: Our home is filled with cries for "muffins, muffins, muffins!" every Saturday morning. I love to cook but I don't bake, so I rely on the box variety of lemon-poppy seed, cinnamon and pumpkin spiced. But, I do try to prepare healthy meals and have learned that flaxseeds are easy to hide in food while adding fiber, omega-3 fats, and lignans (natural estrogen-like chemical; also active antioxidant). When cooked, flaxseeds seem to enhance flavor and add a great texture while reducing the recommended amount of cooking oil.<br /><br />Organic products are crops that are grown in an environment that has been free of pesticides for at least three years. Pesticides effect the food chain above and below the water and can be transferred to your body by ingesting produce and animals that rely on grains such as cattle and chicken. The FDA doesn't require testing of these chemicals in the human body so no one knows if they are causing harm.

review/summary: Good as spread, Not for cooking
review/text: I was looking for a mascarpone that I could use just for toast and jam. Found this brand in a Fresh Market grocery store and decided to give it a try - seeing as the label said "cream cheese" instead of just "mascarpone cheese". Definitely not as sweet as I usually expect mascarpone cheese to be, but it works well as a spread - just on its own. The taste is very light and creamy. I really would not try to use this in cooking or baking because the consistency is not really what mascarpone should be like.

review/summary: Strange, chemically bitter aftertaste and aroma
review/text: I just tried to use this cheese to make tiramisu. Upon mixing the mascarpone in with the egg yolk/sugar mixture, I was surprised by the strong, strange smell that appeared. It took me a while to figure out, but the smell (and upon tasting, the horrid taste.. kind of a chemically bitterness left over after you've swallowed)was coming from the mascarpone. I thought that maybe one of the containers had spoiled, so I tasted the cheese from each container separately, and it turned out that is how they all tasted. The expiration date on each container was March 29th. I used them on March 5th. I don't know if I just got a bad batch, but my experience with this cheese has been sub-optimal.

review/summary: bonsai semi-novice
review/text: The tree came in great condition, healthy and alive.  To add on some of the other comments:<p>-Of course it doesn't come looking like a mature, trained bonsai tree.  It's a 39 dollar tree!!  It won't be trained for that cost!!!!! A fully trained tree takes years and much care to create the illusion of an old, natural tree.  I recommend getting a book and reading up a little before buying.  For the price, this tree is a bargain!!<p>-As far as I can tell, the styrofoam peanuts are the only way to really protect the tree in transit.  Yes, they're a pain to unpack (took 10 minutes) but it's worth protecting the tree.  However, if you noticed, they use corn-starch based foam and they dissolve in water.  They're not environmentally unfriendly.  They're not petro-carbon based polymer.  They're perfectly safe and if you don't want to throw them away, pour them in a bucket of water and pour the water on your lawn.  It may even have some fertilizing properties.

review/text: I heard of this flavor and was happy to find them here. I was excited to try them. Maybe it was the hype, maybe I expected too much from the Spam flavor, but they fell short of expectations. They're not bad, but you'd probably never guess they're spam flavored. They tasted like roasted macadamia nuts, salted with a hint of smokiness. Maybe the flavor would be more pronounced if I ate more than a couple at a time. I would buy these again, maybe for a holiday basket for the spam lovers in my life, more for the novelty rather than the actual taste.

Every dog has different tastes, digestion, and allergies (as noted by the misleading 2-star review of this product).

Prairie must have put out a bad batch of it to the point where it should have been recalled (I found many bad reviews after the fact).  It smelled terrible upon opening the bag, and my dog turned her nose away from it.  I won't begin to tell you what she is normally willing to eat.  I've had to switch brands, and I doubt I will be returning to Prairie in the future.  Amazon responded beautifully to my concerns, I just wish they had known about the bad batch up front so it wouldn't have been sent in the first place.

review/summary: PERFECT Single  Serve  Size!!  Great for kids at COLLEGE too!
review/text: In contrast to the one star review here, I love these little cans of bean dip!  Same great product that's sold in the chip aisle at the supermarket. They are perfect for a single serving size and doubly perfect for my sons away at college.  Great for a grab and go snack too! For the sake of comparison, the size regularly found at the supermarket is a 9oz.can (3-1/2"diameter)and these minis are just over 3oz. (1-1/2" diameter). Both have a pull-top so no need for a can opener either...just be extra careful with the sharp metal edges!!!

review/text: I ordered (8/24/12) the Ranch Dressing through Amazon.  I was so irritated to learn, upon receipt, that the expiration date is Novemer 27, 2012.  There is no way that I will use 80 ounces of dressing in less than three months.  I'm angry that Amazon would even stock, and ship, dressing that is so close to being expired.  Angie did refund me.  THANKS ANGIE!!! But, stil, I'm mad that I had to even go through all this for Ranch Dressing.  Disappointed with Amazon, really DISAPPOINTED!!!!

review/text: I confess, I did not buy this from Amazon, but instead found these at HomeGoods. Priced at $5.99 @ HomeGoods, I was willing to give a try to something made in the USA and not China. My dogs absolutely love them. They are very soft, so you can easily divide it into smaller pieces for training. Not like Jerky at all even though that is the name, they are small narrow round rolls approx 5" in length. Good ingredients but a bit pricey here with the shipping.

review/summary: Good product, awful price.
review/text: Since I just didn't have time to run to the stores, I only trusted my best friend, Amazon.com, to bring me the baby foods. The packaging and portion of each varieties was good, and the quality of Gerber baby food deserves no complaint. However, I was confused with the description, "18 Pack", as I thought it was 18 Pack of 2 tubs! What it contained was only 9 pack of 2-tub packages, and normally, I buy the 2-tub Gerbers for only a little more than a dollar at local stores. If I bought them at a local market, I would have paid slightly more than $11. I realized I paid almost $20 a box for these, and I even bought 2 boxes. This was the first product ever I regret buying from Amazon.com after several years of good patronage!

The variety was not all that good either...I didn't want to have to make a trip to the grocery store when we got there so I shipped everything through amazon ahead of time.  Seeing what I paid for and the lack of variety, I should have just made the trip to the store.  I thought it was 18 double packs...it isn't, it is 18 total packs of food.

review/summary: Gerber's fruits are cooked
review/text: I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?

review/summary: good product
review/text: I wanted a sugar, artificial color, and aspartame free gum. Spry provided. I'm a heavy chewer and buying gum in blister packs costs a fortune so I was happy to find a gum that came in bulk. The flavor is a nice fruity one, but it does fade fast, which doesn't really bother me that much. My biggest issue is the texture. I ordered both the fresh fruit and the green tea flavor (really does taste like sweet tea, for a little while). I'll chew a piece of gum for ages so long as it doesn't loose texture. The green tea flavor keeps texture well, the fresh fruit flavor gets soft and slimy fairly fast.

review/summary: Might have taste, but that also comes from artificial flavoring.
review/text: I usually buy Spry gum at Whole Foods Market, in the single packs (to avoid the TiO2). There are quite a few flavors of Spry offered there, with Fresh Fruit not being one of them.  I was walking through a nutrition store the other day, and this flavor caught my eye.  Seeing as I enjoyed their other flavors, I picked this one up. As I starting chewing it, I realized it had a banana flavor, somewhat like Juicy Fruit. I checked the ingredients to see what else was added, and low and behold : "banana and pineapple (artificial flavorings)."  Somewhat of a disappointment, seeing as Spry is usually a reliable brand. It is my fault for not checking the ingredients, but I would not recommend this gum. I now see why my local Whole Foods will not carry this flavor.

review/text: The claim is that this gum will decrease cavities and mouth disease. I have no idea if that is true. I do know that it tastes very good and your mouth feels better after. Having said that I have two negative comments. First, the gum does not last very long. You are lucky if you get a couple of minutes of chewing before it starts falling apart. Second, I think this is one of those things you need to get used to. If I start chewing it regularly I actually will get sores. I think you need to work your system up to it slowly.

The competitive Xyloburst 100% xylitol gum are 1.5 grams each, 1.0 grams xylitol.<br /><br />Sweetener in this gum is apparently 100% xylitol, as opposed to Trident "sugarless" "with xylitol" where I can not find any explicit indication, but probably has far less Xylitol, and perhaps much more aspartame.<br /><br />It seems that simply holding 1/2 teaspoon of xylitol in the mouth as long as possible leads to far higher peak concentration of xylitol to saturate those bacteria, holding far longer than chewing gum, as I can't stop swallowing when chewing these small chewing gum, such that peak concentration of xylitol is far lower in mouth with gum.

Spry caught my eye because of the xylitol so I first tried a multi-flavor sampler pack.  That did not disappoint and I've just recently finished off my 600pc Spry Fresh Fruit container.  I wasn't a big fan of the other flavors, but that's okay because this one is good enough to keep me chewing happily for another year or more.

That is why I gave it a four star instead of five.  When I want to give someone a sample, this creates a problem.

review/text: Don't be fooled by the "600 count" marketing: the gum pieces are very small, to the point that I just consider there to be 300 pieces that come in half-piece chunks.  As the other reviewers say, the flavor disappears very quickly and unsatisfactorily.  Also, the package came destroyed, which means that I only had ~200 usable pieces of gum, since the rest had fallen out.  It can, however, get the job done if you have nothing else, hence the second star.<br /><br />I would suggest getting Trident instead, which is the same flavor and also contains xylitol: it's cheaper, you get more pieces of gum, and they're better.  Don't waste your time with Spry.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Trident-Tropical-Sugarless-18-Piece-Packages/dp/B001IZ431I/

review/summary: Great product; TERRIBLE shipping by Amazon
review/text: This stuff tastes great as a dip and also as a sauce.  HOWEVER, the people at Amazon do not know how to ship glass containers.  I ordered this and another jarred item by the same company.  The order consisted of 4 jars of each product.  Shipment arrived with 4 jars in one bubble wrap pocket; 4 in another...BUT they put nothing between the jars within the pocket so they were free to crash against each other, which is exactly what happened.  Within one pocket wrap, 1 jar was broken; within the other pocket, 2 jars were broken. WHAT A MESS, not to mention a waste of money because you get no financial relief for poorly wrapped food items.  I contacted Amazon to tell them of this incident via their designated link for shipping problems.  I have heard nothing from them, not even an acknowledgement of my complaint.<br /><br />Yes, I saw a previous review about poor packageing, but assumed Amazon had learned something from that customer's experience and improved their shipping practices; but I was wrong.  So...Great product, but don't buy from Amazon.

review/summary: Wonderful Appetizer Choice
review/text: Being a big fan of both eggplant and bell pepper, this product sounded intriguing. When I tried it, I was amazed that the flavors of both were well represented. In other words...YUM! LaPiana provides an excellent balance of flavor in a smooth spread. Another nice thing about it: the packaging is attractive enough to include a jar or two in gift baskets--if you can give them up.

review/summary: Good Snack, No Health Food Here!
review/text: This is what it is, salty, tasty and not health food. When you have little bites like this its easy to eat too much of it and get salt overload but the flavor was good and seemed a good quality. I froze the rest and it freezes well.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Tropicana has gone the way of others in reducing the real juice in their product and adding flavor enhancers hidden under the words "Natural Flavors" which means the additions of a vegetable extract called glutamic acid. This extract is bad news for your body. This allows them to add more water and less juice. Buy another brand. The apple juice flavor is weak at best.
