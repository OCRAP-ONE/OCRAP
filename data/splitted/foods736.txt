review/text: We love these animal crackers.  The texture is nice and crunchy, and the flavor is awesome.  My husband loves them so much that he doesn't even mind taking a "kid snack" to work.:-)<br />I've also found that if we get a box that's been damaged and broken up - the crumbs make an awesome pie crust!

review/summary: Really tasty cookies despite confusing reviews
review/text: I'm not sure if there was a bad batch of these sent out in 2011 or something, but the bag I bought for my son on 5/27/12 was really quite good. If you're familiar with the Nature Valley Oat and Honey granola bars, the oatmeal Barbara's Snackimals taste almost exactly like those, only they're much neater to eat and easier to chew since they're thinner and smaller. Yes, the cookies have a tendency to break, but they taste *great*. My son (2 1/2) loved them, and even his two cousins (6 and 2 1/2), who get more sugary treats than he did, helped to demolish the bag. All the adults were a bit jealous, I think--the Snackimals were much tastier than our potato chips . . .

I had quite a few bags left and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them! He is now asking for more. LOL So I am going to try some of the other flavors.

review/text: The Barbara's snackimals are an unexpected surprise.<br />These cookies come in a 2 servings per bag package at 2.25oz each which in perspective is more mass than a 99cent bag of chips at Subway et al. So relatively satisfying portion if eating as intended, 1 bag at a time.<br /><br />Delicious oaty flavor, tasting of molasses and vanilla, 2 of their few ingredients, these cookies are crispy.  Yet they chew down to goo just like the old-fangled animal crackers with the carnival packaging.<br /><br />I feel good about buying them, relatively snacking, and I feel good about consuming them, again, relatively speaking.<br />Recommended in all ways, no drawbacks that I have discovered yet.

This is my first time to try the Barbara's Bakery brand. Can't wait to try other varieties.

review/text: Being a natural, somewhat healthy cookie, I expected a carob-y cardboard flavor.  Not so!  While you can see very small specks of chocolate, I think most of the chocolate flavor comes from the pale brown swirls throughout the cookie.  The chocolate is far more flavorful than you would imagine.  They are simply wonderful, cute little cookies.

review/text: These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the "snack-size" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes. You'd expect it to be the other way around.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Good quality product, but the flavor is not what I had hoped
review/text: First, this is a good quality product: they use quality ingredients and the crackers have a nice "animal cracker" crunchy texture. Flavor is such a subjective thing that I hate to down-rate a high quality product too much just on that basis. But I won't be ordering any more of these.<br /><br />My oldest son says they don't have enough cinnamon to achieve a strong cinnamon flavor, but too much to achieve just a hint of cinnamon flavor. I think they actually have the right amount of cinnamon, but aren't quite sweet enough, especially on the exterior. They just come across a little bit bland. I know a lot of people say that is just because people are used to over-sweetened foods, but I think the chocolate chip flavor Snackimals have just the right amount of sweetness. In any case, my kids don't like them - but they do like the chocolate chip flavor.

Ingredients are quite good and per bag price is very reasonable--even more so on auto-delivery.  Large 2+ ounce single servings are quite satisfying when you want something slightly sweet and crunchy with only 120 calories and modest fat content. The only change we have made to our auto-delivery schedule is to have them shipped more frequently.

review/text: I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.

These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.

review/text: This review comes with a mild warning: Moxie is a decidedly acquired taste.<br /><br />I was introduced to this soda when I was about 7 years old, by a friend of my parents', and I'm sure I wasn't at all taken with it at the time; but I felt compelled on subsequent visits to request that 'Jack' give me another glass of the stuff. Over time, it became one of the foremost memories of growing up, and is now a big part of my Yankeeism. I search it out when I go home for visits; crow triumphantly if I find it in a chain grocery; and feel a little more happy and at home if I manage to have any in my abode out here, where nobody has even heard of it.<br /><br />I did a little research on it before writing this, and discovered that it was first developed (apparently without fizz) in 1876, modified later on as a bubbly soda, and heavily promoted in New England with the "Make Mine Moxie!" advertisement. As I said, it's an acquired taste; with a base of gentian root, it's rather like the Guinness Stout of colas, thick and dark, with a bitter undertaste that the novice might not care for at all. The adventurous and those looking for new soft-drink experiences will find it very different from Coke, while it remains a cola of sorts. Once you have been hooked, however, nothing else will quite fill the place of it. A friend shipped some out for me this year, and it was the best present I had under my tree.

review/summary: Acquired taste
review/text: I am a soda fan, and I order unique sodas from all over the place. I just love to try the neat regional sodas that you just can't get anywhere but a limited area. Moxie fits that bill, as it might not be found in the local grocery. Having heard about America's longest continually produced soda from 1884 for many years, I finally determined to try one. They say it takes nerve to drink a Moxie. I learned you can throw all of your normal conceptions of soda out the window when it comes to the taste of Moxie.<br /><br />It has less carbonation than most sodas, so some people think it goes flat fast. It is just that is has less fizz to begin with, and that is OK since too much fizz actually masks the flavor in many sodas. It also has much less sugar than most sodas, only 25 grams per 8 ounce serving rather than the 40 plus grams of most sodas. The flavor is spice, as in pepper - not Dr Pepper but peppery. It has a strong hot bite to it that some people say reminds them of medicine. It has a strong aftertaste. And that aftertaste stays with you for awhile, which is good if you like the flavor. I like Moxie better when I first taste it in my mouth as that is when the sweet part hits you, (it seems at first like Mr. Pibb) rather than a few seconds after I drink it until you get used to it. The taste is unusual enough that I hear New Englanders pride themselves on their ability to get used to the taste and like it. It is definitely an acquired taste. I myself noted that it tasted better the second day than the first, and the next day and so forth. Of course this is how we learn to like the taste of things like coffee. It is very dark like a cola, and it has caffeine. Today it is owned by Monarch in Atlanta, Georgia now. For another unusual but delicious regional soda at Amazon, try Cheerwine.

review/summary: It's become my favorite
review/text: I was surprised to find Moxie at our local Walmart (upstate NY) and decided to take a chance on a 12-pack.  The first taste was a bit bland, however by the end of the first can, I found myself really liking the taste.  It's a bit like root beer mixed with cola and just a bit sweet.  What started out as a "oh what the heck" purchase has turned out to be my favorite soft drink and now I check the shelves every trip to Wally World for a re-supply.

The snack size bags range from 3/4 oz to 1-1/4 oz. The assortment includes Regular, BBQ, Sour Cream & Onion, Salt & Vinegar, Crab and Kettle Classic potato chips, Thin pretzels, Cheese Curls, White Cheddar popcorn and Party Mix<br /><br />I am very glad to see this.Its no longer a wait and see what you get purchase.However you do still get more of some types than others.A very good product but the dates usually range from 4 to 8 weeks.Could be longer but still a great price and the few that I have eaten after the past best by date I could tell no difference.I hope these stay on site for sale because they have become a regular purchase for me.

review/text: I ordered this because my husband is from Pennsylvania, which seems like to only place I can find Utz's chips. The only reason this rate 4 stars for our family is because we only seemed to have gotten one bag of the nacho chips, few of the plain or kettle cooked chips, and a TON of the regular bbq or salt and vinegar chips. If it had an even number of bags per product, we could enjoy this more. But overall these are the chips my hubby and kids love.

review/text: I wasn't a fan of this "variety" pack. Only 1 or 2 bags of my favorites, and over 10 bags of BBQ. Granted, 3 different kinds of BBQ, but they all tasted the same to me and I didn't like any of them. Also included were 3 bags of pork rinds which I also don't eat. Ended up giving away over half of the case to friends. Waste of money for me, won't be ordering this pack again.

review/text: Ordered this for my boyfriend for his birthday as he is from Baltimore and missing UTZ chips as they are not sold in California.  Shipped in a very good manner for chips, all were in solid condition.  Great mixed selection as well, not too many of one flavour and he was happy with all the flavours, especialy the Crab Chips!  I like everything they have to offer as well since UTZ seems to have fresher, healtheir chips.  You cannot feel the oil all over your hands when you are done eating these!  Will order again later this year I am sure when we run out.

review/summary: bad value for product
review/text: I ordered the mix and match 60 item pack that was on sale expecting to get a decent size package and a reasonable value. Instead I got snacks that were priced at .25 per package suitable for vending machine use and of less face value than the purchase price. Even Amazon's free shipping can't offset the overpricing and if you order direct from UTZ the shipping doubles that overpriced amount.<br />Definitely not worth the price particularly when local retailers sell the same brand product at 4-5 times the size for under a dollar.<br />This multipack is in my opinion just UTZ's way of maximizing unwarranted profits from unknowing online customers. Seriously, 'buy direct from us for double the price anywhere else' just doesn't work for me.<br />They have just informed me by email that they will stop putting in the marked packages - so you won't know what the retail value is of what you are buying.  You are better off, in my opinion, buying this product in the store, if you must have it, or out of a vending machine than from Amazon or even direct from UTZ.

Paprika just adds a lot of color and good mild pepper taste.  The Durkee is nice and fresh.

review/text: This is really good quality paprika. It has the deep red color you look for when garnishing things like deviled eggs, and a fresh sweet pepper taste.<br /><br />Paprika is essential for for rubs and seasoning in barbecuing. And if you do a lot of it, you'll appreciate having it on hand in quantity like this.<br /><br />It's also great on roasts, in stews and soups, and with dozens of other things.<br /><br />It's interesting how many people see paprika and think "hot pepper," but paprika isn't hot at all. It adds a nice touch of sweet pepper flavor, not hot.

review/text: We LOVE the peanut butter puffins, but the chocolate peanut butter puffins are just not as good.  It's not that the chocolate parts are not chocolately enough, they are for a natural cereal.  It's just that they are small and kind of stale-tasting.  I don't know if it's because it's bulk packaging or what.  It doesn't take the family long to burn through a box so I know they haven't been sitting around my house...either way, I think I'll stick to the peanut butter puffins.  They are delicious!

review/text: I've always loved peanut butter and chocolate cereals, but they tending to be ridiculously sweet. I grew up eating Reese's cereal. I've been buying Barbara's Peanut Butter Puffins for years, but I had never seen the pb and chocolate until recently. They're great! Their sweetness is akin to Kix, I'd say, but with a much better flavor (being more of a dessert combination of flavors). I'm not sure what the other reviewers saw when they wrote their review, but Amazon actually has them for a very good price, especially with subscribe and save.

review/text: I'm obsessed with the (original) Peanut Butter Puffins from Barbara's Bakery, but for some reason this PB & Chocolate variety is NOT the same. Not only are the puffins pieces smaller, but the flavor itself is lacking. Both the PB and Chocolate pieces are very BLAND and the cereal lacks an essential saltiness found in PB flavored products.<br />The only good thing I can say about this variety is that it IS just as crunchy as the original Peanut Butter Puffins. ...but that's about it.<br /><br />Bottom line: I wouldn't buy it again.

review/summary: Tasty option for gluten/dairy-free
review/text: Recently I was forced to be on a gluten and dairy free diet for a few months.  I have two young children and I'm busy and finding quick, relatively tasty and easy gluten and dairy free options is tough.  I LOVE Thai food but never harbored any false notions that this would taste remotely authentic (when was the last time you tasted something out of a package that tasted authentic - or even remotely good, for that matter)?  Also, I tend to stick with whole foods and avoid packaged/processed foods (no matter how healthy) as much as possible.  Anyway, I was surprised that I enjoyed this. (I still eat them and I'm off the restricted diet.) Salty, yes (but I love salty foods).  And you have to have a microwave that can adjust it's power to 20% (most do these days). And they talk about the noodles "fluffing up" which mine never did. Lastly, it isn't cheap and it is definitely a small meal.  But, at the end of the day, it's a tasty option for those who can't have gluten or dairy products.  (It's actually vegan, too!)

review/text: Most of Dr. McDougall's stuff is OK.  It's convenience food so I never have high expectations.  However, this is an exception. I made this using the boiling water method.  This is the same method I used for his other products.  I let the product sit for 6 minutes.  Stirred it up and tasted it.<br /><br />Oh my God it was so nasty.  I let sit some more.  Still nasty.  Honestly I couldn't eat it.  It tasted so bad, to me, that I just threw it out.<br /><br />I've tried a couple other of his Asian Entrees and they are not too bad. But, they are NOT entrees, not by any stretch of the imagination.  It's a 1/2 container of noodles and whatever powdered stuff is added.<br /><br />Beware when ordering the Asian Entrees.  The only one that tasted like I would eat it again is the Thai Peanut Noodle.  The Soy Ginger Noodle is just passable.  I don't think I will be wasting any more money on the other Asian Entree varieties.

review/summary: Way too much sodium for a Dr. McDougal product
review/text: As of this review, I've also tried Taste of Thai, Thai Kitchen and Thai Pavilion versions. For a Dr. McDougal product, the amount of sodium is inexcusable. Taste of Thai was the lowest in sodium (and best tasting of all, by far) clocking in at just 320 mg. Next in the sodium ladder is Thai Kitchen at 650 mg., then Thai Pavilion at 810 mg. The Dr. McDougal version, which the label says has 480 mg. is for a very small serving size, less than half a serving compared to all the others. So, multiply the McDougal version by 2 to get the real comparative sodium and you're at 960 mg. Like I said, inexcusable and from supposedly a "healthy" product. All I can say is watch your blood pressure folks.

review/text: I've tried a couple of other Dr. McDougall entrees that were pretty good for fast food in a cup where you just add boiling water.  But this one really misses the mark.  First, the mushy little noodles don't taste anything like Pad Thai.  It looks and tastes like some brown gravy-ish thing, not particularly terrible but not particularly great either.  When I first opened the cup and saw less than 2 inches of noodles on the bottom, I thought, "Wow, these things must really expand a lot to fill the cup!"  But after adding the powdered sauce packet, pouring in the boiling water, and letting it sit for about 5 minutes....nope, still about 2 inches of noodles and that was it!  Way overpriced for just under $2 per cup.  I think Dr. McDougall needs to go back to the test kitchen on this one.

review/summary: WARNING: very little food
review/text: I followed the microwave directions precisely. To be more precise, I followed the microwave directions on the outside cheapboard package. The directions on the styrofoamish cup were different.<br /><br />This product is in a standard cup, the kind you add water to and heat in the microwave. But the food, prepared, only takes up about half of the cup. Specifically, you will be getting about two inches of food.<br /><br />Two inches of food... for 200 calories!! If you pop an Amy's Bistro Burger between two slices of Udi's bread and add a bunch of healthy condiments (lettuce, tomato, ketchup), you will have eaten 50 more calories and have had an actual meal. It is deceptive that this product uses the word "entree" in the title. It isn't really even a snack.<br /><br />It does, however, taste good, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. It is rather a bit spicy and has a strong aftertaste. But it is good. There is just not enough of it to justify the price or the calories.

review/summary: OK Pad Thai
review/text: Dr. McDougall is famous for his diet, as well as his health program at the St. Helena Hospital. He has his own line of health food products, which I've enjoyed since my college days. He's locally based out of the Bay Area, in Santa Rosa. His Asian entrees are a delightful addition. They're healthier than mainstream Ramen noodles, that are usually loaded with sodium, MSG, and other goodies.<br /><br />The Pad Thai entree is deliciously spicy... I put some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO">Huy Fong, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> on it, and made it even more fiery!<br /><br />There's one major drawback.. there's not much in it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N8QJUE">Annie Chun's Pad Thai Noodle Bowl, 9.1-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a> has much more, and Annie Chun is based out of nearby San Rafael. Dr. McDougall's is just what the doctor ordered!

review/summary: My Dog Loves This Food
review/text: I have a 12 year old golden retriever.  I have been feeding him Happy Hips treats for almost a year hoping the glucosamine helps with his arthritis.  He eats the treats like crazy.  I like the fact they are apple, banana, chicken and sweet potato.  They are healthier than store bought treats.  I have the same hope for the chicken & oats dry dog food. This dog food came the other day, I cut the bag open to dump it into a plastic tub and by mistake I tipped it over a little and some of it went scattered all over the floor.  Well, my dog with the arthrtis jumped right up and cleaned up the floor in no time, tried sticking his head in the bag and then wagged his tale licking my face.  If this is as good as the treats, I know it will help with his arthritis.  Amazon is the cheapest I have found for this food, plus the free shipping is a bonus.  I bought mine when Amazon had a 20 percent promotion so it was an added bonus.  Thanks Dogswell and Amazon.

review/text: Because of allergies to wheat and corn I decided to give Dogswell products a try. This is the first dry dog food my dogs will eat without adding gravy or meat or veggies or leftovers and they do so eagerly. It smells good enough for me to eat and they haven't scratched since they started on this product. Amazon's price is cheaper than I can get locally so not only is the food good, it's a bargain at that. I love you Amazon!

A healthy 15 year old with the expected stiff hips and a romping 9 year old who has dry joints (who doesn't?).  They both love the taste and I'm happy not to have to crunch up the supplements into their food everyday.  I love the healthy ingredients and lack of fillers, I believe that is why my dogs live long lives. I put it on auto ship!  Yay! No more trips for the forgotten dog food!!  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Hooked On Happy Hips
review/text: It's simple really, My dog is a very picky eater, not to mention she's allergic to so many things. We tried a lot of the name brand dog foods out there (Iams, Avoderm, Science Diet). Nothing worked, so then one night when she was out of food I went to the store and grabbed two small bags of dog food. Happy Hips was one of them. She immediately wanted to smell the bag right after opening it (which she never did before), and as soon as we put it in her bowl she devoured it. With all of the dog food we had previously given her we always had to mix it with something just to get her to eat it, that wasn't the case with Happy Hips, she ate it dry the first night and is still eating it dry 2 months later. She always got bored with the other dog food, after a couple weeks she would stop eating and/or put her nose up to it. She doesn't do that with Happy Hips. She absolutely loves it. Plus it's all natural and made in the U.S.A. You pay more for it, but it's well worth it. If you have never given this to your dog, it may be best to start them off with 4 pound bag or find somewhere you can get a free sample. But I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has a dog. I have also found that Amazon is so far the cheapest place to buy this dog food, and when I buy it, I get the free shipping as well.

review/summary: Nookie 'n' Hips
review/text: I first found this product about a year ago through their free "mini-bag" giveaway. Nookie, my malamute, is a large dog that is susceptible to hip issues. I first had switched her over to the Happy Hips formula and saw that she walked without a limb for the first time in over a year. This took about six months, but was noticeable after about 4 months of eating Happy Hips. I was so pleased with the outcome that I transitioned my smaller, older dog to Happy Hips. My little dog, Steeler, was having back issues as she is getting older. After about 6 months eating Happy Hips, she is out running around like a puppy...she is now 13 years old. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a pet with joint problems or may have those issues later down the road.

review/summary: This food really made a difference in my dog's joint health/pain
review/text: My dog was 8+yrs old when I first bought Happy Hips by Dr. Dogswell for him to try - within a week my dog went from stumbling and walking slow, and occasionally buckling in the front shoulders during tight turns, to frisking like the younger dog he used to be - no buckling, back to a trotting gait, and no evidence of pain!  I've kept him on the food for the past two years, occasionally mixing in other food for variety - but this stuff really made a difference for my dog, so I'm swearing by it and recommending it to others.  I had been supplementing his previous food (Pedigree) with expensive pills that promised improved joint health, and they never seemed to do anything.  Now my dog is just primarily eating the Dr. Dogswell food (no supplements, but occasional mixing in of Newman's Own or Rachel Ray's food for variety) and he's still doing great.

More importantly though, my old dog who was getting a little lame has suddenly gotten frisky again since starting on this chow. We have also noticed that the terrible flatulence he had daily is gone too. To be fair, at the same time I switched his wet food to Harmony Foods, so that may also be a factor. I am extremely happy with this food and will continue to buy it.

review/summary: Happy Hips Dog Food
review/text: My dog is very picky about her food and she has a lot of itching problems.  We have been told many time that her skin problems may have something to do with her diet.  We have tried many types of food, but this one seems to work best.  She really likes it and, although itching problem hasn't gone away, it does seem a little better. I am no health food expert, but based on what I am told by some Vets, this is a healthy product.  Final assessment: The extra cost of this food is worth the benefits of her eating more regularly; that she is eating a healthier food; and her itching seems to be somewhat relieved.  Also, I like having the bag delivered to my house at no charge in 2 days.  Schlepping big bag of dog food from the pet store  to my house is a pain.

review/summary: My Juvie, Standing With Comfort, at Last!
review/text: I was looking for dog food from Amazon.com so I wouldn't have to drive so far when I noticed this Happy Hips dog food.  I take care of my daughter's dog.  She lives in an apartment with her cat and couldn't take this sweet chow mix home with her when as a stray she entered her work place and make a bee line right to my daughter.  We are all dog people and so she asked me to take in another stray.  Soon after our little Juvie began to drag herself around.  We took her into the vets and her hips are really out of whack.  There was nothing we could do or afford.  She seemed happy but very inactive.  After I began feeding her the Happy Hip, which she loves, she began standing more and even playing with the new puppy.  I began feeding my other dog (he is two years old now), mixing the old food with the Happy Hips.  He will eat all the Happy Hips and leave the old food until I admonish him to finish his dinner.  Both dogs are really happy with Happy Hips.

review/summary: My dog enjoys it and it helps her hips.
review/text: My dog was diagnosed with hip dysplasia as a 6-month old puppy.  The vet said it was the worst case he'd seen in a puppy her age and we were told that she wouldn't be able to walk by the time she was three if we didn't have an expensive surgery done.  I've tried various supplements and foods over the years and although she may sway a bit when walking and tire easily she's now 8 years old and we frequently go on short hikes together.<br /><br />I started feeding her Happy Hips about 4 months ago.  Since that time I've cut out any other supplements and paid close attention to how she does.  She readily eats the food and doesn't gorge herself when eating.  She seems to have more energy and stamina now.  I don't want to push her too hard but last weekend I took her on a 4 mile hike over aggressive terrain, much more than we normally do, she led the pack the whole way and even jumped in the truck quickly when we were done.  In the past I've had to lift her into the truck at the end of any hikes.  She spent the rest of the day sleeping but the next day was up and going again.  Overall I'm very impressed with my dog's health and since this has been her food over the last several months it has to be a factor in how she's doing.  I originally was going to rate this 4 stars but really have not complaints at all and my pup is doing great so I upped it to 5 stars.<br /><br />As a side note I read reviews online before feeding my dog this food and found that it is rated well by a few independent review sites.

review/summary: This Food is Absolutely Fantastic
review/text: My overweight little girl not only got down to a healthy size; but was cured of her lameness thanks to this food. Several years ago, she began walking on three legs.  The leg pulled to her body didn't seem to cause her any acute pain--she just didn't want to use it.  Vets and specialists armed with x-rays and other tests conferred and couldn't decide what was wrong with her.  A $7000 surgery was suggested; but I tried this food fist (coupled with Happy Hips chicken jerky treats).  After SIX months of being lame, within three weeks she was walking on all four legs and never had the problem again.  She has a shiny coat, bright eyes and lots of energy (she's nine years old).<br /><br />I would be a wreck if this ever went off the market.<br /><br />Also of note, this food seems super-healthy: no by-products, no fillers, no yucky things.  It seems as whole and healthy as you can get whilst using a manufactured dry food.  And even better, it has all her favorite table foods to eat--blueberries, chicken, sweet potatoes, apples, carrots, etc.<br /><br />There's a serving suggestion on the back of the package.  My dog is about 10 pounds and I feed her 1/2 cup of food a day.  (1/4 cup in the a.m. and 1/4 cup in the p.m.).  When she's super active (or seems terribly hungry), I give her more.  Also remember I supplement her diet with Happy Hips chicken jerky treats and the occasional raw fruit or vegetable when I'm cooking.  In short, a 4-pound bag lasts her three weeks to a month (if you're wondering how much to order on the subscription plan).<br /><br />Let me know if you have questions.

This food was new at our grocery store and I thought I'd give it a try.  She loves it!!!  This is the first 'dry'  dog food she eats without any extras ( fruit, veggies, meats etc)  Yesterday, the first day, she ate approx 4 cups of this food, typically she doesn't eat that much.  Well, let's see if that was a fluke, this morning she ate another 2 cups.  This food isn't really dry, it's a bit moist.  It smells great.  I can't believe our dog is eating it, much less so much of it.  I plan on getting the larger size bag from Amazon and trying some of the treats.

review/text: I've complained about the expiration dates when ordering from amzaon. This had the same problem. While the ingredients look decent, even though it has chicken meal, my dog was not thrilled with this food at all. She's 9 yrs old and I thought the Glucosamine would be beneficial to her. So even though the dog food is going to expire in 4 months, I've ended up having to give it away to someone else as she just looks at the food and back at me like "Really you expect me to eat this" I will say that she is a very picky eater. So it maybe great for others, just not for my dog.

review/text: I had my dog on this food until he developed an infection in his anal glands. My vet told me not to use this food anymore because it is made in china and the glucosamine in the Happy Hips formula provides no benefit to my dog because the amount of glucosamine is too small and its not a high quality. He had us switch to Royal Canin<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00068K2OK">Royal Canin Dry Dog Food, Giant Breed Adult 28 Formula, 35-Pound Bag</a> - so far our dog is doing really well with this food, firmer stool, loves to eat it, etc. And for the glucosamine/chondroitin/MSM we are using Dasaquin<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MCVGEA">Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM for Large Dogs - 150 Tablets</a> which is a pharmaceutical grade supplement, same manufactorer makes a supplement for human consumption as well.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor- buy a solid supplement and a dog food that is not produced in China.

Some days I would write obsessive lists of every single bite he ate trying to make sure he was getting enough calories, and then we discovered these breakfast bars. They are pretty pricey, but for a gluten free product they are surprisingly soft and don't have the terribly gritty texture and my son absolutely LOVES them! Obviously they aren't comparable to regular breakfast bars, but when compared to other gluten free products available, these are really good. They are portable, don't need to be heated or cooled, taste decent, and have totally saved my sanity.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: My 5 y.o daughter loves these. Pricey, but these are so good for on the go snacks! They taste great, too. They are a little thicker than Nutra-Grain bars, but after going 8 months w/o them, my daughter doesn't know the difference. We always have these on hand for car trips or feild trips.

review/summary: better than average for gluten free bars
review/text: Glutino breakfast bars are much better in taste and quality of ingredients than many similar products for gluten free diets. They are easy to carry if you are not sure of finding safe food away from home.
