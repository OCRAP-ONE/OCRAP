review/text: I'm a new tea drinker and this product is simply a delight. When I open the pouch I always first smell the aroma and smile thinking about the spearmint, the plum, and other fruity flavors I'm about to enjoy. And this tea truly lives up to its claim by supporting the digestive system. It is a "must have" for me and I have shared it with many others. Truly a delight!

review/summary: Delicious, refreshing green tea with unique light taste!
review/text: I am absolutely addicted to this tea! I tried it after reading the rave reviews here and now I drink about 4 cups a day. It has a unique fruity and light spearmint flavor thanks to natural flavors of passion fruit, plum, and spearmint. Other herbs include kombucha and lemongrass. The caffeinated version gave me headaches - I assume from the caffeine - so I was relieved to see Yogi offers a decaf version, too!<br /><br />I found other green teas too "grassy" and bitter tasting, but I find this combination refreshing and light. I have also shed a few pounds since I started drinking this tea, which I believe is due to the metabolism-boosting effects of green tea. I can't credit the tea alone - I work out a lot and just ran a half marathon - but I am convinced it helped!

review/text: I love this tea!  I was not a "tea" person before I tried it.  I liked tea, but it could not replace my 2-4 cups of coffee every day.  Until someone gave me one to try.  I have been off coffee and do not miss it.  I love that it aids in digestion, so it gives me an excuse to have some after dinner.  I have had both regular and decafe.  I think the regular has slightly more flavor, but I like both.  It is much much cheaper to get it from amazon, then my local healthfood store.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014D71O">Yogi Tea - Green Tea Kombucha With Chinese H, 16 bag</a>

review/text: I purchased this because I have a sensitivity to caffeine and wanted a tea to drink at night.  This tea kept me up for hours in the night all three times I tried it.  Why try 3 times?  I had a caffeinated beverage in the morning on 2 occasions and wanted to see if I had the same results in my ability to sleep with or without the caffeine in the morning.  It made no difference to me.<br /><br />I can have minimal caffeine before 2 pm and sleep that night.<br /><br />The flavor is good and I like this tea.  I just will have to find a herbal tea for drinking at night.

It is a great price here.<br /><br />Update 6/2/12 - I did order this box set and Amazon DID send me the right one, the decaf.

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: Kombucha is traditionally a combination of bacteria and yeast that is theoretically supposed to help balance the flora in your intestinal tract.  While Yogi teas tea box does not make these claims, they also fail to tell buyers that their Kombucha tea contains both bacteria and yeast.  They claim that the strains of bacteria and yeast are safe, however they stated to me that their product contains Brewer's yeast which is known to aggravate even cause yeast infections in those prone to systemic yeast infections.  They claim that the yeast is killed in the Brewing process, but one can not be sure of this and if you are prone to systemic yeast infections, I would highly recommend that you avoid this product.  They have already had one law suit filed against them by a woman who is convinced that their product caused her yeast infection.

review/text: I ordered  Yogi Green Tea Kombucha Decaf but I was sent the one with caffeine. This was my first time to order this tea after drinking it a relative's house. The packing slip showed that it was decaf, so I did not really examine the box before opening. After drinking the tea and having sleepless nights and fast heartbeats I checked the box and found that the tea had caffeine. I have a health problem which is made worse by caffeine. I would advise everyone to be careful and examine the contents of the box before consuming it.

Can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />I will say though...if your dog is a gulper, please make sure you watch them while they eat/chew.

His teeth were extremely dirty with what seemed like plaque or whatever it was on his teeth that I could not get rid of by brushing his teeth.  I thought I would need the vet to professionally clean his teeth.  I was amazed as to how his teeth became pearly white after a few of these greenies not to mention that his breath did not have a nasty smell either.  I give these to my 2 year old pup as well.  Her teeth have never been as dirty as my 8 year old's but at least her breath is fresher too.<br /><br />5 STARS ALL THE WAY!

review/summary: Go away bad doggy breath!
review/text: My dogs don't have terribly stinky breath and I have Greenies to thank for it. I've tried the knock-off products and to be honest they don't seem as well made, plus  my dogs actually seem less excited about them.<br /><br />I ended up buying the large Greenies (pkg of 8) for two reasons. One, the price-point seemed right and two, I have two dogs (60+ lb catahoula leopard dog and a 10 lb terrier mix) and its easy to break the large Greenie into two portions for them. One packages last us about 1 month (1-2 Greenies / week).<br /><br />Our dogs really do love these things. If we present them with the option of a Greenie versus some other treat (say a bone) they invariably take the Greenie.

review/summary: deadly
review/text: 1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006<br /><br />I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a "busy ball". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it.

review/text: About four years ago I went on a Bloody Mary rampage.  I was determined to find the best and boy did I.  I tried bloody mary's from every where.  Homemade to bar to fine dinning restaurants.  I even bought numerous books on the subject and ordered every premix I could find. I finally ran across this mix at a small beer brewer in St Augustine, FL...I instantly knew it was unbeatable in flavor, freshness, and spice.  I figured it was homemade, so I asked how they made it.  The bartender laughed and pulled out a large bottle of Demitris Original....It was love at first sight.  He said it was simple just mix it will good quality tomato juice an presto perfect bloody mary...I couldn't believe it.  So I ordered me a half gallon.  I think at that time that was the smallest they had available for the public.  Instantly perfect Bloody Mary.  Since then I've began to understand why it was impossible to get a perfect bloody mary from the premixes.  After the tomato juice is added the mixture becomes unstable.  Even if you mix up a big batch of this stuff you should use it up in a couple days or it want taste as good.  Remember a little goes a long way.  This stuff is supper concentrated.

If you put it on top of a cup of tea the center gets all gooey and delicious. It is very hard for me to eat just one of these. I recommend them to EVERYONE!!!<br />- Laura

review/text: I discovered Stroopwafels on one of my visits to Amsterdam and fell in love with them.  It's been 6 years since I've been there and I haven't had once since.  At least until today when my shipment of these Stroopwafels came.  They are as delicious as I remember them being in Amsterdam.  Place one on top a hot cup of tea for a few minutes and you're going to be in for a real treat.<br /><br />I can honestly say these are indeed authentic.  Grab em while you can!

review/summary: HORRIBLE!!!!!
review/text: I wish I could give this food ZERO stars! It doesn't even deserve 1 star. I switched from wellness core to this food because I read an OLD review and critique of this food BEFORE P&G bought them. No grain, great limited ingredients, no red flag ingredients, all american product. However, since P&G(heartless, money grubbing, animal testing company that has a track record of ruining every quality pet food brand they buy) bought them they must have changed, at the very least, the quality of ingredients. My cat DOES NOT have a sensitive stomach/GI tract and has never had a reaction to any new food Ive given him. Two days after he started eating this his coat started feeling very coarse and he started having the WORST diarrhea and litterbox odor that filled my entire house. I feed him an entire bag of this stuff and instead of gradually getting better, his problems continually got worse. Towards the bottom of the bag it got to the point that his feces was so liquid, it would drip behind him through two rooms of the house! Gross I know, but I think others need to know how bad his problems were before they think of feeding this food to their babies. He is now on Orijen kibble and a frozen raw diet and the problems stopped the day after I switched him off this food. I believe at one time this was a quality food made by a quality company, but this is not the case anymore. Sad, but I think this food is now along the same lines as crud like meow mix and purina.

review/summary: My Cat Likes EVO Herring & Salmon
review/text: Our cat had a weight problem for years.  Many so-called "high quality" foods did not help her.  Switching to EVO, led to her losing her extra weight, so that she can now jump a foot or two, whereas previously, she could not jump.  Note that the analysis lists protein as 50%.  This is higher than many other "high quality" foods.  Our cat loves this food, but she does not eat too much of it (in an extended several day taste test, she rejected another "high-quality" food, and chose EVO).  Note: this company (Natura) has been purchased by Procter and Gamble.

review/summary: Evo dry food - Herring and Salmon formula
review/text: Both of my cats are doing very well now that we switched to this food.  Their coats are healthy and they have lots of energy.  One was suddenly sick a few months ago and blood tests by the vet revealed a possible food allergy.  He was lethargic, losing weight and looked very weak.  The vet recommended switching to a high quality food, and my local pet store owner offered this food as a very good but still affordable option.  The cats had been eating poultry, so it took them about a week of transition to warm up to the fish, but they come running ever since we completed the switch!  I love that it's grain free and it has no extra fillers or unnecessary junk in it.  We also switched their wet food, but to Weruva, not Evo. (which is equally well-received and recommended)

This product <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00371V2V0">NTRA EVO HERR/SLM CAT 5/6.6#</a>, had me understanding that I would be getting 5 packages of 6.6# of food. I have gotten 1. The list price is 249.27. It for 27.99. What a deal until I only got 1/6.6# bag. That is not a savings, its a rip off. There is no way that 1 bag is listed for 249.00 and other heavier bags i found was less the price. I'm sure the food is excellent, but my cats will never find out. unless they send me 4 more bags or will stay full for the next month on 1/6.6# bag of chow.

review/summary: A great healthy food- my cats love it
review/text: I stopped buying grocery store cat food after several experiences that happened nearly simultaneously: I learned what is contained in them (what is actually in fish meal, for example).  I learned about other additives- that are not food- and how they effect an animals organs.  I learned about the recall of foods from China killing pets nationwide, if not worldwide.  I learned about the national recall lists of pet foods and all kinds of foods and products published online everyday of the week.  So I made the switch to organics with ingredients labels that will make you smile instead of shutter.  These foods are more expensive, but you love your pets so you'll be buying peace of mind and their continued health.

review/text: Finally I've found a kibble which is grain-free, full of healthy and ingredients AND appealing to the cats. They used to sneak dry food in an attempt to convince me that "cats cannot eat dry food and live"--a ploy which never worked on me--but they eat EVO often in preference to canned food.

review/text: I recently adopted two kitties from a shelter, one of them on a grain-free diet already. The shelter gave me dry food to take home for them but they both wouldn't touch it. One of my kitties would only eat canned food but she kept throwing up. I was very concerned and decided to go to a natural pet food's store where I purchased Evo, hoping it would work for my kitties. They both love it and neither has thrown up since they started eating it. I'm very pleased and relieved...Their fur looks great as well... Highly recommend...

review/summary: Happy Cats & No More Vomit
review/text: So we have tried, it seems, a fair share of cat foods:  Healthy Kitchen, Wellness Core, Solid Gold, Spot's Stew, Before Grain, Wysong, Castor & Pollux, etc.  Regardless of which food we were feeding, my eldest cat would throw up.  Depending upon which food it was, she would throw up maybe a couple of times a week, with others, once a day (C&P was the absolute worst for this).  The vet told us that sometimes its just something cats do, and that most likely there was nothing that could be done about it.  Hmph!<br /><br />So we tried EVO.  Both of my cats loved it right away and refused to eat another kibble of the food they had been eating.  I was concerned that they'd both have runny stools due to the immediate switching of foods and not mixing it with the old brand, but no.  And their poos don't stink either.  My barfer hasn't tossed her cookies ONCE since switching to EVO.  Glorious days!<br /><br />She also is no longer bloated.  Both of my cats fur has improved dramatically AND they are both far more playful and sleep a lot less throughout the day.  Their eyes are sparkling.<br /><br />In short, I am amazed by this food and the magnitude of positive changes that it has affected in my cats.  Thank you.

Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness.  I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.<br /><br />These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure.  Absolutely more than worth worth the little price, this stuff should be standard in every home, along with plumbing.<br /><br />And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you.

review/text: I use this in my banquet kitchen for so many dishes.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and a pinch of heat.  If you toss chicken wings in it, you will have some great bar food in your own home!  Another idea: combine Sweet Chili sauce, heavy mayonnaise, granulated garlic, finely chopped parsely, ginger powder, and splash of siracha - this will give you a delicious sweet chili aoli perfect for burgers, sandwiches, egrolls, potstickers, fries, fish, or even chicken.  Like I said - it is good by itself, but serves as a great base for other things (from salad dressing to marinade).  Buy this sauce in bulk as you will find youself using it on everything!

review/text: Once in a while you just want a spicy different flavor. Sometimes when I have a lightly seasoned or plain piece of beef or chicken, I put some Sweet Chili Sauce on my rice. Wow that perks up the whole plate. Other times I cook the meat without seasoning and add what every flavor I'm in the mood for when I reheat it. I've kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problem.<br /><br />If you have never tried this, the sauce is thicker than Heinz Ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you. Another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving.

review/text: The sauce was just fine. However, I can't resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy, in the hope that someone might be able to convince Amazon next time. The sauce comes in a pack of 2, but one bottle was broken. Yep, you guessed it, Amazon sent me a new pack of two, and asked me to return the unbroken original. It's only cost me a little time, but how much it's going to cost Amazon to ship and process that returned bottle, your guess is as good as mine. Is it REALLY beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle?

review/text: Here's a tiny consolation: easy Thai barbecued chicken! Cut your usual fryer in quarters, cook it slowly over charcoal or quickly in a hot oven, and then brush it generously with "sweet chili sauce" and cook it just a few minutes more. Most authentic with 'sticky' rice but also delicious with brown or red rice.<br /><br />In Thailand, people squat over hibachi-sized braziers on the sidewalks and sell portion of this sort of barbecued chicken. Sometimes they trot alongside inter-city buses as they pull into stations, and sell chicken through the windows. Don't be squeamish! This is a treat you'll remember. The same sauce will enhance the flavor of any fowl from blackbird to condor or whooping crane.

Since then, (about 5 yrs ago) my mother, friends, and I have all used this sauce on fried chicken wings, grilled and sauteed chicken, pork, spring/egg rolls, and even sushi!  I keep the large 25 oz bottle in my fridge year-round, and this is the best brand I've used thus far.  Not too hot for those not accustomed to very spicy foods, but is mostly sweet.

review/summary: best sauce in the world!
review/text: This is without doubt the finest sweet chilli [sic] sauce in the world.  I use it with hot or cold dishes, including chicken, venison or roast beasts.  It is superb seasoning for a plain rice, quinoa, bulghour or cous-cous.  Sweet, hot and authentic.  I buy 2 of the larger bottles at a time, refrigerate the open one and save the back-up as insurance.  Could not run my varied menus without this great red elixir!

review/text: I first tasted this sauce when I was visiting in Alaska.  It was served with fish tacos, and was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered it from Amazon.  It's available for a reasonable price, and is wonderful with fish, pork and chicken.  I haven't tried it on beef, but not sure if it would be good or not.  It's also terrific on vegetables.  I highly recommend this product!

I discovered it while at a pei wei someone had left a bottle of this laying out and I quick snapped a picture, took it to amazon and found it. It is great on pretty much everything, as previous users say.  I was also in a Thai restaurant the other night and they used the same sauce on an amazing salad.  Try this on a do it yourself salad consisting of sliced mangos, lettuce, onions, and red peppers.  Drench those ingredients in this stuff and everyone will think your a master chef.

review/summary: Highly Addicting!
review/text: I did not purchase this product off of Amazon. I purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store, and I must say it's one of the most addicting sauces I have ever had! I'm a pretty picky eater, and a vegetarian at that, so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. This sauce is ALMOST perfect. It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear "skin" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce. I don't care where or how, just buy it. You'll fall in love!

review/text: I was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews, but it's nothing special. For my taste, it's way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough (even my kids agree). It reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. But if you're more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking.

review/summary: I loved it
review/text: I popped some last night and I love this popcorn. If you like large poofy kernels then this is not for you, but I like small kernel popcorns too, and this one was light and a little crunchy and had good flavor. I think the selling point of this type is that the hulls shatter when it pops ("hullless"), so that you don't get the big painful pieces of hard popcorn hull in your teeth like with larger varieties. I think the popcorn kernels have to be small to be hullless.<br /><br />If you have an air popper and find that small kernel popcorns fly out of it, you could try a different cooking method - I just pop mine in a saucepan on the stove (with a little bit of vegetable oil, and a lid to keep it from flying out), there are also air poppers that don't let the popcorn fly out, or I've seen a microwave bowl that's like air popping but with the microwave as a heat source (but no added oil or anything, like air popping), or some people even just use a paper bag in the microwave (I think with this method they use a little oil too). There are many ways to cook popcorn, and instructions are pretty easy to find on the internet if you need them.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: This popcorn has hulls, which I don't care for. It's not labeled as hulless, so it's not deceptive. I just thought for the price it would be - my bad. I only use the whilry pop popper, so this review is relevant to that method only. It produces somewhat light, crispy popcorn of fairly large size with a real popcorn taste. I did think it would pop larger though. It's good for the coated popcorns I like to make. It's not the best I've tasted though. Fireworks makes some delicious, hulless varieties that have spoiled me, I'm afraid. The company ships fairly fast, and the shipping cost is what I'd expect it to be. I'm ruined by Amazon Prime though, so to pay any shipping at all is a drawback; that being said, for this quality popcorn plus the S&H cost, I won't buy it again - simple as that - and for no other reason than that.

review/text: My wife says that I can cook two things - omelettes and popcorn...with popcorn being my best. We have always used popcorn from the grocery store but the Amish Country Lady Finger Popcorn is so far superior to the store bought. The flavor was so good you did not have to use butter and it was a delight to eat, both in taste and texture. The husk of the corn seemed to disappear and left almost nothing that you had to dig out from between you teeth. I give this product FIVE STARS. I look forward to trying the other style of popcorn they offer.

review/text: Even "no hull" popcorn has hulls.  It has to so it can contain the moisture in the kernel and cause the popcorn to POP.  "No hull" popcorn has a hull that shatters when the popcorn pops so the hull isn't as noticeable.  There's no guarantee that every hull will shatter into "invisible" pieces.  So ALL popcorn varieties have a hull.  With some varieties you just don't notice it as much.

It hasn't got enough weight  to stay in the popper long enough to pop. That same quality - lightness - is actually what makes it good popcorn otherwise. I recommend it for stove top popping in a deep saucepan with a lid.

review/text: I was interested with the fact that this popcorn is supposed to pop with less hull. However, I read that the popcorn also pops smaller as a consequence. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I placed the order, but I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />The kernels pop to about the size of a penny on average, which is smaller than what I'm used to. However, I wind up just eating handfuls of it anyway. The hulls are in fact definitely less pervasive, which is a huge plus. Hulls and old maids are a huge turn me off for me from regular popcorn.<br /><br />I use an elecrtic oil based popper. There are always some unpopped or barely popped kernels. However, this is the first type of kernel I've tried with this popper, so I'm not sure which is at fault. Even still, some old maids are to be expected with any popcorn. Most of it pops fine.

review/text: This popcorn is excellent. My husband and I love the taste and we don't mind eating several pieces at a time to make up for the tiny size. I rarely have any hulls when eating this, but when I do, they don't get stuck in my teeth. However, I could see why these would never work for an air popper. They are far too light and would never stay in the chamber long enough to pop. If you have a stovetop or electric popper (like I have) this is definitely worth a try.
