review/summary: A very good fun.
review/text: I loved it. Tim Burton made a great movie with a simple story, a great imagination and cool actors(Winona Ryder is VERY young in this one:) and I couldn't imagine Alec Baldwin with such sense of humour. Michael Keaton is sensational and the FX, 15 years old are still very correct. Beetlejuice is a very funny character and you can't wait for the moment when finally he becomes free to act. Just say BEETLEJUICE three times and have a great laugh.

review/summary: Wacky and original
review/text: Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's 2nd film after Pee Wee's Big Adventure and it's his most popular next to Batman. A lot of films such as Monkey Bone have tried to copy it's strange originality and have failed. It wasn't the best reviewed movie when it came out but that's because critics most likely didn't know what to think about it.<p>  It has fun effects, a wacky and energetic performance by Michael Keaton and an original plot. After all these years there's still nothing quite like Beetle Juice. I mean what other movie has giant sand worms that eat dead people ?

review/text: Tim Burton is a guy Hollywood should honor every day. He's one of the few who agree to stay in the system and direct personal movies for the majors.<p>And his personal world is something very special. Things have a soul or, at least, come to life under Burton's camera. <p>Beetlejuice is one of the first efforts of Tim Burton and it's already great. There's a style, a signature, a world , details which reveal an authentic creator.<p>It's possible you will hate this world but you will not have losed two hours, I guarantee you. Come and see what can be created with a camera and a little brain. <p>A DVD I'm proud to have in my collection.

review/summary: Love This Movie!
review/text: This movie is a very odd movie but I love it because it doesn't follow that Hollywood way to make a movie.  This movie stars Winona Ryder who plays Lydia Deitz, who is very sad and depressed.  The movie is about a couple who dies and a new family moves into the house and the couple doesn't want them there because the mother wants to redecorate the house.  this movie has an all-star cast Geena Davis, Alec baldwin, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey jones, and many others.  This movie was released the 30th of March 1988.  The DVD I think could have been so much better and they could have included deleted scenes and bloopers because you know there has to be some.

review/summary: A movie to "literally die for!!!"
review/text: Beetlejuice is not a movie that you can't watch under . . . 5,000 times! It is one of the funiest movies ever made, mixing a strange reality to the story, along with a romance between Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. The funny thing about this story is  the strange world between the living and the dead, and the recently deceased handbook, ha. You have to wait in your house for 125 years, while haunting the people that come in, and trying not to break your cover, and in the story, that is why hauntings take place. Tim Burton did an excellent job, and you have to see this movie.

review/summary: Say it once, say it twice, third time's the charm!
review/text: When this movie first came out about fifteen years ago, my father owned a video store and every Wednesday night was "Beetlejuice" night. I'm older now, obviously, but I still cannot get enough of this movie. <p>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara Maitland, two Connecticut yuppies who die prematurely in a car wreck. Within a couple weeks, their home is overrun by an ultra-trendy New York City family, Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter, Lydia (played respectively by Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want their house back, and attempt to scare the Deetz's out of the house by wearing sheets and even by possessing them over dinner, making them sing and dance to Harry Belafonte's "Day O." Those attempts fail and enter Michael Keaton as Betelguese, "the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist." The movie is dark without being scary and funny without being ridiculous. <p>In my opinion, one of the real gems in this film is the late Sylvia Sidney as Juno, Your Case Worker. Sidney was pushing eighty when this film was made, but turns in a great performance as the embittered equivalent of an afterlife social worker. Love how the smoke from her ever-present cigarette comes out of the slit in her throat. <p>If you've never seen this movie, see it. If you have seen it but don't own it on DVD, get it. The picture quality is better than ever.

review/summary: Off-color, Irreverent  Hilarity
review/text: I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

I give the movie itself 5 stars; it's a wonderful example of Tim Burton's energy and style.<p>This DVD has no extras worth mentioning.  No deleted scenes, no featurettes, not even a lousy commentary track!  To make it even worse, the film has been CUT DOWN from the theatrical release!  I have never seen a DVD release before where you get LESS than was originally presented in theaters.<p>My advice is to save your money until somebody figures out that when a movie is released on DVD, it needs to live up to the capabilities of the medium, and should always provide more material than was originally released, not less.

review/text: Just to let you know, this movie is one of my personal favorite ghost movies. That said, I feel I need to tell you some details about this terrible DVD. The packaging is fine, nothing great, but it works. The picture and sound quality are good and make it a good cinematic experience. However, the menu is complete trash, the extras are EXTREMELY embarassing, and to play the movie you actually have to click on scene selections and click on the first chapter because there is no PLAY button! What's the problem here? As I recall, this film is on AFI's top 100 funniest movies ever made, so don't you think they could make a better DVD than this garbage? I am so sick and tired of these movie companies getting away with selling us trash.<p>This double sided disk is no good. Pick what format you want the first time you watch it, and stick with that side the whole time...because if you switch each time, both sides get scratched! Personally, I think fullscreen is for idiots who think they're getting the whole picture when they're not. You people put no actual thought into making DVDs, you just slap some crap together and think its fine. No, it's not fine! Clean up your acts!

review/summary: Five Star Movie, No Star DVD
review/text: This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of.<br /><br />Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing. Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of "production notes" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.<br /><br />All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more. If you're a Beetlejuice fan, wait for the inevitable Criterion Collection or Special Edition remaster.

review/text: I won't go into detail about the movie itself, which has been reviewed in much greater detail and much better than I can do at the moment (it is one of my all time favorite movies - 5 stars).  I'd like to focus on the DVD for a moment.<br /><br />This DVD was released in June, 1997, a scant three months after the initial rollout of the DVD format.  As such, the inadequate menus and lack of functionality reflect a company just learning its way around the capabilities of the format.  The early releases have standard menu designs (with the Warner Logo), standard extras (cast & crew, production notes, trailer (sometimes)), and are usually double-sided with a widescreen format on one side and a fullscreen format on the other.  This was all quite adequate for 1997, but....<br /><br />In 2006, Beetlejuice seems to have been forgotten by Warner.  In a time when so many movies have "Special", "Extra Special", "Extra-Extra Special Extended", and "Ultimate" editions, this is one movie which has missed the bandwagon.  What's it going to take, Warner?  A bio-exorcist??<br /><br />BEETLEJUICE<br /><br />BEETLEJUICE<br /><br />BEETLEJ....  SPECIAL EDITION, PLEASE!!

Michael Keaton does a great job as the oh-so-disgusting Beetlejuice, and the rest of the cast plays their roles just as well. The film's plot is just plain weird, but they pulled it off. Couple gets into car accident, dies, tries to figure out how to still live in their house while being dead, and a new family moves in. Should they haunt them? Should they be seen? How do both families coexist, especially with the daughter (Winona Ryder) able to see the ghosts who thought they were in the clear? And why is Beetlejuice always there to crash the party? The movie had a quick pace, funny dialogue and plenty of memorable visuals.

review/summary: Really gets those juices flowing...
review/text: Maybe the definitive Burton film (or maybe more like a tie with `Edward Scissorhands'), `Beetlejuice' is a perfect representation of what Tim Burton is all about.  It is loud and boisterous and at the same time dark and edgy.  The film very much looks and feels like almost everything that comes out of the Burton factory, yet it is surprisingly fresh in a way.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that it is one of his earlier works and so the colors and graphics are not as crisp, which adds an almost gothic layer to the films feel.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it is the mere fact that Michael Keaton gives the best performance in any Burton film; ever.<br /><br />The film follows Adam and Barbara as they learn to cope with life after death.  Yes, a horrific car accident leaves Adam and Barbara dead yet confined to their home.  The problem is that their impatient neighbor takes no time in selling their home to an eccentric family that does not meet with their approval.  Determined to remove these people from their home they enlist the help of a `bio-exorcist' to do the trick, but they get far more than they bargained for when Beetlejuice comes on the scene.<br /><br />The film has been labeled as `pointless fun' by most of my friends, and to an extent I have to agree.  Many would claim the film is not pointless, for it teaches lessons of acceptance and friendship, and I guess loyalty and respect, but really, are we concerned with any of that?<br /><br />The acting is really good here, and it elevates the film from `pointless' to `pointless fun'.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis (complete with those alien eyes she had popping in `The Fly') are absolutely amazing as the dead couple, Adam and Barbara.  Catherine O'Hara is marvelous, award worthy even, as the insanely annoying Delia, and Jeffery Jones knows just how to compliment her as Charles.  Winona Ryder is effectively weird as their daughter Lydia.<br /><br />This film belongs to Keaton though, in what may very well be his finest performance, ever.  There is a fine line to be ridden between hilariously on-point and drastically over-the-top; especially when you are dealing with a typically campy performance.  As Beetlejuice, Keaton finds that line and rides it well, delivering an all over the place comedic performance that never feels `too much', even though it probably is.  He understands how to make his characters insanity justifiably funny and makes him an iconic character.  Everyone knows who Beetlejuice is, even if you haven't seen the movie.<br /><br />In the end I can recommend this movie because it does the trick.  It's sweet and charming in that Tim Burton style, complete with edge and creeps and hilarious thrills.  It looks better than his new stuff because it still has a level of grit, and while it is not as good as `Edward Scissorhands' (his best movie, ever) it is definitely a film that every fan needs to see.

review/text: I thought this was a really good movie! Since it's a film by Tim Burton, you get a dark, depressing feel, and Danny Elfman music, and stripes. Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, and Winona Ryder all did a perfect job! Michael Keaton is hilarious and awesome as Beetlejuice! Adam and Barbara Maitland die in a car crash, they are given a rule book to go by on how to be dead. The Deetz family moves in, but Adam and Barbara want them out. Somehow, they're hot gothic daughter, Lydia can see them. They become friends, but they still want to scare them out. They seek the help of Beetlejuice, who is extremely obnoxious, and a bio-exorcist who tries to help Adam and Barbara, but he's too scary and obnoxious to leave and stop. The Deetz's bring Adam and Barbara back from the dead, but Lydia doesn't want them to because it'll torture them. Desperately, she asks Beetlejuice to help. If you love gothic comedy, you'll love BEETLEJUICE!!!

review/summary: Heads off, I mean up, Beetlejuice fans!  New DVDs due out in September, details here
review/text: Beetlejuice is coming back to DVD in a newly remastered 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, in both standard definition and Blu-ray, on September 16th, 2008.  The extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series ("Skeletons in the Closet," "Spooky Boo-tique," "A-Ha!"), and for the Blu-ray version an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but don't count on it.  The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the specs for the sound haven't been announced.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat Song" ("Day-O"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />If you don't have the old, not-so-great DVD, the new release might be worth waiting for.  Amazon has a page to pre-order the new standard DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AGXEAG">here</a>.

review/summary: Beetlejuice - Tim Burton's Masterpiece
review/text: When the world didn't know who Tim Burton was, it must have been quite a shock to realise his genius first. This larger than life, colorful, yet dark, very funny, bizarre tale broke into the cinemas, and changed the face of storytelling as we knew it forever. Tim Burton was born, and a whole new dimension of dreams, imagination broke free. Movie was never the same again. And thank Tim Burton for that! You cannot do anything but enjoy this crazy story about a ghost, about the importance of life and love, friendship, and all this covered in an unbelievable cloak.

review/summary: TIM BURTON MADE A FUNNY GHOSTS TALE.
review/text: *** 1/2 stars rating for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. This movie was one of the biggest surprises in 1988, it revolutionized the visual effects field, established Tim Burton as a director with a huge imagination, put Winona Ryder on the map, and helped Burton & Michael Keaton to be signed by Warner Bros. to film their strongest 1989 project: &quot;Batman&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a very funny ghosts tale with a lot of creativity and imagination, the characters are easy to love, the situations are funny and bizarre at the same time, all this translates into a very entertaining movie.<br /><br /> There are several memorable scenes in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, among them a possession scene at the tune of Harry Belafonte's &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, another is the one on which Adam & Barbara (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis respectively) are taken to the underworld offices.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a good option to see the gorgeous Winona Ryder in one of her key roles, to see the creativity of Tim Burton at his best, and to see a very funny supernatural comedy.

review/summary: Just plain fun!
review/text: I recently saw the DVD 5.1 version of this film and it is excellent. The picture quality is, excuse the pun, picture perfect. The sound is very good on the surround but not much on dialog separation if any at all. But Alec Baldwin makes up for the rest. I have always told my partner that Alec would be the only guy in the world that i would leave him for.  I know it would never happen but each time i watch this movie my fantasy runs wild just like the movie itself.  This is just pure fun, pure entertainment, no thinking involved, no serious plot, no hardship, non racist, non potical just pure fun.  Get  it,,,,,you won't be disappointed.  If anything get it for Alec,,,,they don't get any hotter than him.

review/summary: A Afterlife Success
review/text: Many movies, have dealt with the figure of death and the dead, from the Good angel clarence in &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; to Brad Pitt's abysmal turn as Death himself in &quot;Meet Joe Black.&quot; However, Tim Burton has presented the world with the most interestng look at the dead with Beetlejuice. In the first moments of the movie, Barbara and Adam Maitland go to town, And die in the oddest possible way. They return to thier house, and find them selves confined to it's premises. Thier leaving sends them to a strange desert world Populated by multi-layered sandworms.  Eventually, they find that they are dead, and must remain in their home for 128 years, which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the family of NYC artisans that moves in and remodels the place. After consulting with thier &quot;caseworker&quot; Juno,(Sylvia Sidney at her chain-smoking best) they hire a bio-exorcist,Betelguese (pronouced &quot;BeetleJuice,&quot; hence the title) who agrees to help. Unfortunately for the Maitlands, Beetlejuice is an extremely PO'ed demon who refuses to return to the underworld. The visuals and special effects of this movie are completely stunning, and Micheal Keaton gives a performance that must have been a blast to play. Beetlejuice is a beer swilling,cussing,moral-majority's worst nightmare with superpowers, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is one of Tim Burton's Best works, and something he should be proud of.

review/summary: They got more than they expected for out in the country
review/text: When Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam(Alec Baldwin) Maitland move out into the country, they have rest and relaxation on their mind. Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) fancies herself an artist, but husband Charles (Jeffery Jones) just wants to relax in the country after having survived stressful city life. Both he and gothic daughter Lydia (Winnona Ryder) are the most likeable ones in this family.<br /><br />After their own attempts at the supernatural fail, the Maitlands call up Beetlejuice, a disgruntled former bureaucrat for the living impaired. Because their caseworker will not help them get rid of the Detzes, the Maitlands soon turn to Beetlejuice for assistance. The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big. During the supernatural ceremony he puts on an attitude of being in charge 'until something goes wrong'. Since it's likely that he was reading this ceremony as he went along, Otho had not known what he was doing. In other films, this would be dangerous for everybody within a close radius, but Beetlejuice comes to save the day.<br /><br />Michael Keaton steals the show as a fast/smooth-talking demon. He's not an angel, but you definitely want him on your side when the chips are down. The only thing he is really scared of is sandworms (in the otherworld). Keaton would later continue to work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.<br /><br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note. The Maitlands and the Detzes end up living together in the same house and Lydia actually gets along with the former couple.

review/summary: Wild, Crazy Fun With Ghosts
review/text: Well, we already knew Tim Burton has a delightfully warped sense of humor, didn't we? So it came as no surprise to me that this movie was both warped and hilariously funny.<br /><br />Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a charming young couple that live in a large old house on the edge of a small town. They love each other very much, very playful and fun together, and have just settled in for three weeks of vacation to work on their hobby: a scale model of the entire town. It's really good, too. Also, apparently they renovated the old house themselves.<br /><br />One day they went into town to get some supplies for the model and on the way home, went through a covered bridge. That is, through the side of the covered bridge into the river. They found themselves back at home, but eventually realized that they had died and were now haunting the place. That would be OK, except that their neighbor, a real estate agent, promptly sold the place to the Deetz, a severely dysfunctional family from the city. In no time at all, the wife has thrown out all the comfortable old things Adam and Barbara had, and put in horrible modern junk based on the dreadful tastes of her friend, an interior decorator. Also on her own sculptures, which are arguably the ugliest things you have ever seen produced by anyone over the age of five.<br /><br />The only redeeming aspect of the Deetz family is their teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). She dresses in black, is very morbid, but also is the only one able to see Adam and Barbara. And she is in sympathy with their assessment of her step-mother's horrible taste. Also horrible attitude.<br /><br />They don't quite know what to do, but when they returned to the house after the accident (actually, I think it was after the funeral), they found a book titled "Guidebook for the Recently Deceased." They tried to read it, but there was no index, and it didn't seem to make a lot of sense to them. They did manage to draw a door through to a bureaucratic nightmare where they were told to talk to their caseworker. Turns out their caseworker is an abrupt, shriveled old woman who smokes constantly and the smoke seeps out through a large slash in her neck. She warns them not to contact Beetlejuice, who used to be her assistant but "went out on his own." He had left an advertisement in their handbook, and for good measure, managed to put one on their TV.<br /><br />Still, when Lydia reads their handbook and does all she can to help them, they still haven't gotten rid of the Deetz family. In desperation, they call on Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton). You have to say his name three times to call him, which suggestions that he is a demon. Actually, I think the suggestion is also made that he's an alien. It's hard to be sure.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the movie are Beetlejuice's attempts to frighten the Deetz away: or at least the parents. He likes Lydia, and in fact wants her to marry him.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of inside-joke type references throughout, especially in the underworld bureaucracy. It's a very Tim Burton sort of film altogether.

review/summary: TIM BURTON'S FANTASY WORLD IS ALIVE
review/text: Michael Keaton's portrayal of the ultimate fun-loving ghoolie Beetlejuice is fantastic.  While his portrayal in Burton's BATMAN of the lead character is dark and brooding, Beetlejuice lets loose all inhibitions and the actor plays it to the hilt.  The supporting cast is wonderful and Burton's story and direction superb.  Maybe not for young children under 12, as it does have a decidely dark side and some scary ghoolies, it is great family fare and good fun.

review/summary: Awesome movie, not very "deluxe" dvd
review/text: I must agree with the few people who complained that this dvd was lacking in special features and whatnot. However, if you have never seen the movie at all, or enjoyed the movie but do not already have a copy, it's still a good buy. It's a great movie, no matter how it's presented on the dvd, and you do get a few episodes of the cartoon as well. I watched Beetlejuice as a kid, both the movie and the cartoons, so I probably would've bought it even if it was a poorly recorded VHS :) In short, don't expect it to be "deluxe", but I definitely recommend buying it (unless you already have a standard version of it).<br /><br />As for the movie itself, if you've never seen it, it's basically a ghost story that is purposely presented in a cheesy manner to be funny. If you're familiar with Tim Burton at all, you'll know he tends to stray from the norm. Don't expect to be scared; that's not what this movie is about. It's basically about a nice couple of ghosts who try to scare away the family who lives in their house, but the family isn't scared; in fact, they invite other people over and try to show off the ghosts - so the ghost couple hires a... rather disgusting guy to help them out, and things pretty much go downhill from there. Definitely and old 80s classic.

review/summary: Best Tim Burton film. He should just stick to this format.
review/text: In beetlejuice I was entirely sucked into this dream like film. The afterlife was a complete quirk, and if it hadn't been accredited to, I would have known already who had directed it. It felt like Batman in it's tone, in its wet darkness, and then the cubistic art world of the urban. I always feel like I'm drawn into the mind of a deeply rooted "pure abstract" painters mind. I love the demensions of his creativity. He takes risks also, something I don't see enough of in his latest works. I always feel like it's halloween after watching this film. In fact it's a sort of tradition to watch this film, along with "a nightmare before christmas", around halloween time. Nothing gets me into the mode better. An ecclectic scare, with a foolishness appropriate enough to remind you of the cartoon.

review/summary: Tim Burton's Best
review/text: This is Tim Burton's best work, well this and Edward Scissorhands are his best work closely followed by Ed Wood and Big Fish.  This movie is witty, imaginiative and a little gory at times but not too gory.  This movie seems to get funnier the more you watch it.  Michael Keaton proves himself in this that he can be one of the funniest comedians if he tries.  He portray's Betelguise really good.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are great in this too.  The dvd is good.  The picture and sound is clear and crisp, but my only thing is that the menu in this dvd is HORRIBLE.  It doesn't even have a play button for it.  Come on Warner, you can do better then this.  Special Features are average considering this was one of the first dvd's to come out.  Warning: Keep kids under the age of 4 years old or younger away from this movie.  It's to bad and violent.  It even has the f word in it.  But that's why it isn't rated G like other kids movies you can watch with them instead.  This is the movie that really started Tim Burton's career.  I mean, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure was good but this was way better ny far.  I recommend this to any Tim Burton fan, or evwn if your not a big fan of his work, you'll still love this movie.

review/text: This is one of my favorite movies (and, now that I've purchased it, one of my kids' favorites, too!). This movie is so hilariously cheesy it's irresistable. The soundtrack is great, and the kids always jump up to dance along with the characters at the dinner scene. While some of the lines border on awful, the actors are (usually) believable... and who wouldn't mind watching a young Alec Baldwin (remember? back when he was a hottie?). This movie is a classic and a great addition to any movie library (if for nothing else than historical value).

review/summary: It's Just So Gross!
review/text: I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.  Now I realize that it does have a plot, and a very good one.  I don't recall any other movie where ghosts have trouble trying to scare living people out of a house and have to hire another ghost who claims to be an expert.  However, after this set-up happens, THAT'S when the movie becomes a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.<br /><br />Whenever someone mentions Beetlejuice, I think of nothing else but all the weird stuff that's in it.  For instance, when the ghosts try to leave the house, they wind up in some crazy desert place where giant sandworms threaten to eat them.  The movie doesn't do a great job of explaining where this place is, but I think it's the planet Saturn.  Needless to say, since the ghosts can't leave their house, it definitely motivates them to scare away the living people moving in (a bunch of weirdos by the way, so that provides some extra incentive)<br /><br />Then there's the lost souls room, the guy stretching out his head to look like some sort of chicken, the shrimp cocktail turning into hands, Beetlejuice living in a model of the city, the chalk-drawn door opening up to a portal, and the moving art statues.  This movie is just flat-out bizarre.  There's so much that's packed into it.<br /><br />But its kind of a downer that the afterlife is shown as some kind of overly-administrative going to and fro, where you have to read a handbook, wait in an office, talk to a case worker, and do all other kinds of boring things.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  I work in a funeral home, and this movie STILL grosses me out.  Walking dead folks are all over the place.  Some sawn in half, others flattened by a truck, and Beetlejuice himself looks to have some kind of mild skin decomposition.  But by far the scene that's hardest to stomach is the seance.  The ghosts are summoned in their wedding outfits only to grow older and older until they start to fall apart.  I should be thankful that they weren't shown as green and bloated throughout the whole movie, since drowning's the thing that killed them.<br /><br />This is one of the most original and disgusting films you'll ever see.  I think everybody should see it once, just to see how bizarrely creative it is.  Obviously a whole heck of a lot of work went into it.  Beetlejuice himself made me laugh quite a bit, with lines like, "Attention K-Mart shoppers!" but he sure did gross me out a lot too.<br /><br />I kind of wish Burton would have stayed away from the Halloween type movies and did more stuff like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  I've been wanting to see Big Fish for a while, but I heard its not very good.

review/summary: Light-hearted fantasy diversion
review/text: A haunting movie in which everything is played for laughs.<br /><br />There are no serious moments, deep introspections, revelations, life reviews, insights into life's purpose, etc. It is a non-stop gimmicks, special effects, sight gags, visual fluff suitable for the younger set.<br /><br />The hero and heroine drown together in a car accident, discover they are dead and back in their dearly beloved house. They can't leave because there are monsters outside. Their peace in interrupted by the new owners who decide to redo the place in a ridiculous gaudy style. They notice an unexpected book "The Handbook for the recently deceased." on the nightstand which serves as their guide to their new situation. Through it they discover how to reach their "caseworker" and an obnoxious haunter named Beetlejuice<br /><br />who might be able to help them remove the new occupants. Everything they try fails to work and in the end they accept the new owners. The owner's daughter becomes closer to them than her step-parents providing the child they always wanted and couldn't have. Other than the idea that they can not see themselves in a mirror and that the new owners cannot see them (except the daugthter), there is little we learn about the afterlife here. We see a couple brief scenes of the caseworker's office which can only be described as depressing. Worst movie I have seen in a long time.

review/summary: Great Movie...But NOT Given DELUXE Treatment
review/text: Why oh why do studios stamp "Deluxe Edition" on movies and then provide nothing to make it worthy of that title??????  I absolutely LOVE the movie Beetlejuice, and just about anything else Tim Burton has done.  The Blu-ray version of this movie looks and sounds better than any version I've seen before.  The colors are sharp and the sound is greatly improved over other DVD iterations I have seen before.  The movie comes with a nice slipcover featuring the cover art in lenticular motion.  That's about the only really special feature you are going to get on this disc.  With it being the 20th Anniv. of this film, I thought that surely something would have been included about the making of the film, but there is NOTHING.  There is no commentary track, no making of doc., no interviews with the cast.......NOTHING.  Oh you do get 3 episodes of the Beetlejuice cartoon.....yaawwwwnn and the original theatrical trailer.  I'm not complaining too much, because I do love this movie, and it is worth the price just to see it in High Definition.  It just ticks me off a little when studios stamp the "Deluxe Edition" on the cover, when there is nothing Deluxe about it.

review/summary: Burton's true debut!
review/text: At the time of its release in 1988, 'Beetlejuice' was a huge hit. Although it does seem a little dated now, it still has some wonderful visual jokes (especially the characters in the waiting room). The laughs begin with the main characters' deaths after only 10 minutes. They look expectantly at a little dog who is balancing their car on a plank of wood over the edge of a bridge. He tip-toes off and they fall to their deaths. The film is full of satirical vignettes e.g. the after-life is managed by a number of desk clerks who have condemned themselves to an eternity as civil servants because they committed suicide. The Deetz's interior designer Otho is unafraid of all the ghoulish horrors that surround him, but yet finds himself in his most frighteneing moment when Betelguise removes his designer suit to reveal a 70's pastel leisure suit and he runs in terror.<p>Apparently director Tim Burton loved making the film as Warners stayed off his back for most of it, so he had greater freedom to improvise with the actors and the story. Half-way through its making, he didn't know how it was going to end. The stop-motion techniques might look a little dated but Burton was a big fan of Godzilla as a child.

review/summary: Fabulous Comedic Fanasy Directed by a Master
review/text: Beetlejuice is an awe-inspiring wonderfully amusing comedic romp that explores the incredible possibilities of the after-life and the boundaries of the absurd. Telling the tale of a recently dead married couple that suddenly gets led into the chaotic world of the supernatural. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) discover many of the conflicting rather human imperfections that haunt the lives of the living also plague the afterlife as well.<p>Unlike some film projects that seemed to be blindly assigned to dispassionate filmmakers for commercial reasons, Beetlejuice's plot and bizarre subject matter remarkably complemented Burton's unusually macabre artistic sensibilities extraordinarily well. Created by the unbelievably brilliant guidance of imaginative film director, Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). The film's uniquely creative landscape was a culmination of essentially all of the abundant irony and outlandish yet human behaviors that have graced the body of Burton's work.<p>Augmented by deviously energetic performances from Glenn Shadix, Jeffrey Jones, Winona Ryder, Catherine O' Hara, Geena Davis, and Alec Baldwin, the film bustles with uninhibited brilliant hilarity that persistently pushes the film to a level of almost affable euphoria. Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels. Though comedy is usually considered to be unable or undeserving of deep critical analysis, Beetlejuice is an undeniably inspired concept that has been flawlessly transferred to film. One of the most outstanding comedies of the 1980's. <p>As for the film's DVD package, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, an isolated Danny Elfman musical track, and the choice to watch the film in anamorphic widescreen or Pan and Scan. Hopefully Beetlejuice will eventually be graced with a special edition. We can always hope.

review/text: I have the DVD, and added the Blue-Ray.  A very good movie.  It is very re-watchable. It's also a good opportunity to view some famous actors in much younger days.  A much younger Alec Baldwin is hardly recognizable. Michael Keaton really isn't recognizable due to the makeup used, even though he played a great part.  Wynona Ryder plays a great part as always.  Gina Davis and Catherine O'Hara played their parts well.  Although the PQ was very good, I really didn't see any appreciable improvement in the PQ or Audio, over the earlier DVD.  I have a 5.1 system, with Polk Speakers.<br /><br />There is only one disc. There was no paper insert. The separate audio soundtrack (on the same Blue-Ray disc), failed to play on my Panasonic BD60 (with all firmware updates). Everything else played.  If you have the DVD, I don't see any benefit in getting the Blue-Ray.  I guess that's why the price dropped to close to single digits.  I'm really starting to question the benefits of Blue-Ray over DVDs.  In most Blue-Ray movies, I've watched, extras, present on earlier releases, have been removed.  I thought that was a major selling point in the Blue-Ray movement.

review/summary: Some early details about the new 20th Anniversary Beetlejuice DVD due out on September 16th, 2008
review/text: Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat Song" ("Day-O"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />This new release is being marketed as the 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition.  It will be newly remastered, but the extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series ("Skeletons in the Closet," "Spooky Boo-tique," "A-Ha!"), a music-only track, and the trailer.  The cartoons are about 11 minutes each.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but usually that doesn't happen.  I've subtracted one star for the poor features in a "deluxe" anniversary edition; if they announce more features I may up my rating.  The best thing is likely to be the remastering, which is needed, since the older DVD wasn't all the great.  Looking forward to that.

review/summary: Tim Burton Goes All Out in His Second Feature Film!
review/text: Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

review/text: Really, this is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and you know what? I loved it with all my heart. Tim Burton knew what he was doing, aparently, because this film is unbelievably entertaining. The dialogue is clever, the story is wonderful and the characters make the film shine. Winona Rider is marvelous as the troubled gothic teenager who wears black and veils to the dinner table. Her mother is a power woman designer who turns the house into a Tim Burton Dream land where all sorts of goodies can happen, especially with a little tampering from a few ghosts. This film also has a great score from Danny Elfman who worked with him previously on Batman and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. After this the director/composer duo have never split up and togehter they create magic for everyone to see and love.

review/summary: Remains one of my favorites
review/text: Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.

review/summary: A little gross, a lot of fun
review/text: Michael Keaton was already on his way to being a major star when he played the ghost with the most in "Beetlejuice." His performance in the title role simply solidified his status as one of Hollywood's brightest comedy stars.<p>Now, years later, this film still generates the same belly laughs that it did when it was first released. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis have fun in their roles as husband and wife who are surprised to find themselves dead, but they are merely window-dressing for Keaton's centerpiece. The only complaint here is that there are a few too many gross-out gags, but that is something which has come to define many of director Tim Burton's films. Still, the movie is a lot of fun from beginning to end, and it's worth considering adding it to your video collection.

review/summary: Some early details about the new Blu-ray DVD due out September 16th, 2008
review/text: Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat Song" ("Day-O"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />The extras announced are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series ("Skeletons in the Closet," "Spooky Boo-tique," "A-Ha!"), a music-only track, the trailer and, according to the press release but not the Warners Brothers web page for this DVD, an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  The cartoons are about 11 minutes each.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but that would be unusual and I wouldn't count on it.  Five-star movie, three-star extras.<br /><br />The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the complete specs for the sound haven't been announced.  There will be sound and subtitles in several languages, including Spanish.  The old standard DVD isn't all that great in terms of video quality, so the best thing about this new release is likely to be improved image and sound.

review/summary: It's Funny To Think The Titular Character Is Only In The Movie Less Than Twenty Minutes
review/text: Beetlejuice is a movie I consider to be one of Tim Burton's best movies. I also consider it to be one of those kind of movies that could have come out only in the 80s (much like Labyrinth starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />Beetlejuice deals with a recently deceased married couple, the Maitlands, who finds themselves essentially "trapped" in their former house for the next century or so. Unfortunately, this means living with the house's new owners, the Deetz. The Maitlands don't mind Deetz daughter Lydia played by Winona Ryder so much but her much more obnoxious parents and want to scare them away from the house. Their case worker tells them only one thing: to NEVER even think about recruiting her former assistant Beetlejuice. Unfortunately, they manage to resist for a while before giving in and Beetlejuice causes nothing but problems.<br /><br />It's definitely a work by Tim Burton. His ever-present "uniqueness" and charm is there. Beetlejuice is a fun 80s movie and a very fun watch period. the acting by everyone involved in the movie is great (especially Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice). The make-up for the necessary characters were well done and the "afterlife" set designs and make-up there were great. I loved the make-up and designs in the afterlife scenes.<br /><br />The movie itself is great and I would have given it five stars. The blu-ray as a whole leaves a little to be desired. It's one of those DVDs or blurays that pretty much leaps right into the movie. No title screen, scene selection, anything. This was a bit annoying since I had to manually go skip through the whole movie to get back to where I left off the night before. There's a small handful of special features that you may or may not be interested in. The special features are only three episodes of the cartoon series (of which I watched as a kid) and an audio track. The special features it does have really aren't that bad, I would have just liked to have had more. Like some sort of commentary, deleted scenes, or something.<br /><br />All in all, five stars for movie itself and three for the blu-ray (averaging four stars).

review/summary: "Please, they're dead. It's a little late to be neurotic."
review/text: Oh, snap, that's right, Alec Baldwin once upon a time was svelte, as so documented in BEETLEJUICE, the 1988 film that - along with CLEAN AND SOBER - made a case for Michael Keaton having a streak dark and dangerous enough to qualify him for the then upcoming Batman role.<br /><br />It can be tough when you're newly shuffled off that mortal coil, tough when the shelf life exceeds the expiration date. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Baldwin and Geena Davis) - a young couple in love - are freshly minted ghosts who find themselves confined to their quaint New England home, and they seem content enough with their new sitch. But when a family of obnoxious artsy-fartsy New Yorkers move into their house and threatens to annihilate their peace of mind, the Maitlands may have no recourse but to contract that shady freelance "bio-exorcist" Betelgeuse. Certainly, the Handbook for the Recently Deceased isn't much help. Adam and Barbara's irascible case worker Juno - who is supposed to ease them into the afterlife - worsens things by remarking that the Maitlands must spend 125 years on Earth in their house before they can move on. Anyway, it's a delectable twist, this meek and retiring ghostly couple being haunted - and bullied - by the living. BEETLEJUICE, as if you didn't know, is a hugely entertaining supernatural comedy. Harry Belafonte's catchy calypso music simply acts as a bonus.<br /><br />The Maitlands' bridge to the living is Winona Ryder's appealingly strange little goth girl, Lydia Deetz. Lydia is pretty much the only "house guest" that Adam and Barbara can tolerate and they, in turn, become surrogate parents to Lydia whose real parents (a shrill Catherine O'Hara, a distracted Jeffrey Jones), let's face it, tend to neglect her to bits. Lydia demonstrates an unnatural awareness of the ghostly Maitlands, and it's her curiosity which helps propel a major plot point - namely, Betelgeuse's getting his hooks into the Maitlands. Adam and Barbara prove to be too mild-mannered and just too nice to put a proper fright into the Deetzes - their idea of scaring the mortals is to possess them and make them dance to Harry Belafonte. Conversely, Betelgeuse embodies equal traits of perversity and meanness and he right away cows the Deetzes; the Deetzes' family friend, Otto, especially has it coming. But then we learn that Betelgeuse has his own nasty end game in mind, with no one but the Maitlands and the spunky little girl, Lydia, to thwart him. As likable as Baldwin and Davis are, Michael Keaton's awesomely manic, joke-a-second performance fuels the movie. He injects just enough demonic chops to come across as a sinister adversary.<br /><br />Director Tim Burton put Hollywood on notice with PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, and BEETLEJUICE only expanded his street creds. BEETLEJUICE exhibits Burton's bag of tricks - the distinctive style, the touch of artistic creativity, that smidge of the surreal and the fantastic. There's a lot of visual treats, ranging from the storybook look of the Maitland home to the bizarre architecture of the offices of the supernatural underworld. The dazzlingly inventive sight gags add to the film's offbeat humor. That waiting room is almost as diverting as the Star Wars cantina in terms of ambiance and their inhabitants. All in all, BEETLEJUICE is an astonishing, demented spin on the classic ghost story. Exorcism has never been more fun... or backwards.<br /><br />So this DVD is The 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition and offers these paltry bonus features:<br /><br />- 3 BEETLEJUICE Cartoon Episodes: "A-Ha!", "Skeletons in the Closet," & "Spooky Boo-tique"<br />- the option to watch the film in Music-Only Track<br />- Theatrical Trailers for BEETLEJUICE and PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE

review/summary: It's show time!
review/text: Of all the movies that Tim Burton did, there are three names that come out a lot during discussions. Of course his two Batmans, then his masterpiece Edward Scissorhands,  but most of all his excellent comedy Beetlejuice. Why's that? Because as a society where we usually consider the after-life as a dark and depressing world, Tim Burton presents death in a different perspective. He represents it as an extremely funny world where people become ghosts stuck in their own houses and are haunted by the living, a world where death is a huge bureaucracy, and a world where there are bio-exorcists, like the one and only Mr. Beetlejuice. Although this is a movie where the main characters are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, and they do an excellent job as a recently dead-couple, it's Michael Keaton who deserves the spotlight. For each time he appears on the screen, he just makes you laugh with his funny one-liners (excellent improvisation from Michael Keaton) and his perfect interactions with his co-stars such as Sylvia Sidney, Winona Ryder, Glenn Shaddix, Jeffrey Jones, and Catherine O`Hara, all future collaborators during Tim Burton`s career. Everyone, and I mean everyone, delivers a perfect performance.<br /><br />Not only that it is a movie that has excellent visual effects, both traditional and with the computer. Also, I loved how they were able to integrate gorgeous stop-motion animations during the movie. They were well integrated in the movie and are a proof that this kind of animation can really bring great possibilities to a movie, though there are certain limits to it of course. But hey, that also counts for CGI too.<br /><br />Finally, a great cheer to Danny Elfman, whose soundtrack really gave him the popularity and respect he deserved. A great idea from the makers of this DVD to integrate the soundtrack as a separate audio track.<br /><br />In the end, a great classic that should be listened over and over again and being considered a classic of modern american cinema.

review/summary: The ghost with the most
review/text: After 20 years, this oddball dark comedy hasn't lost its irreverent impact. Up-and-coming director Tim Burton's playfully twisted visual style runs rampant through this movie, saturating nearly every frame. It even turns actor Michael Keaton into sort of a vile living cartoon, the one & only Beetlejuice, a manic bio-exorcist with sinister agendas. The film also boosted the resumes of terrific talents like Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara (here as an annoying trendy couple transplanted from New York to a small Connecticut town). The film helped maked stars of Geena Davis & Alec Baldwin (as the kind, hapless ghostly couple) and Winona Ryder (as the ex-New Yorker's death-obsessed daughter, Lydia). But this is really Keaton's movie all the way, in spite of a good cast.<br />The art direction, make-up & special effects have Burton's distinctive stamp all over them.<br />I was slightly disappointed that this 20th Anniversary Edition didn't have at least interviews or a making-of featurette (although it includes a handful of the delightful "Beetlejuice" animated episodes).<br />However, it's a little offbeat comedy that's achieved cult status over the years (all you have to do is view it to figure out why). Just don't say the title three times!

If I had to choose between warner spending money and time on a better transfer or more extra content, I would choose the better transfer.  After all, how many times are you going to watch behind the scenes material or a commentary?  It's been twenty years since this film was released, so it would be difficult for Tim Burton or anyone involved in the film to remember enough material for a commentary or even for short featurettes.  I'd rather have no commentary than a bad one.  This comes with a CD sampler of the soundtrack which is a nice addition.  I could care less about the episodes of the animated series even though I watched it as a kid.  My favorite aspect of this release is seeing the detail on the stop-motion puppets, the surreal set design, and Oscar winning makeup.  I can't recommend this enough.

review/summary: ONE OF THE BEST GHOST STORIES I KNOW.....
review/text: Here is a movie that is top notch in a lot of ways. It's a great family movie. Some may not agree, but I say it is. Adults will understand it more but kids will love the colorful creatures, even though several aspects of the film will fly right over their heads. Tim Burton really hit the button here on his unique style of filmaking, and really never did it better, even with the number of great films he's waxed his style all over through the years.<br /><br />The story starts with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as "The Recently Deceased."  They have to learn how to be ghosts, and it's not easy. That is why there is a department dedicated to helping their cause, however, it is as backed up as an inner city welfare office. This is why sleazy swindlers such as the title character come around, dedicated to taking advantage of their delicate situation.<br /><br />When our ghosts discover that they have to share their small town dream home, with some living artsy-fart aristocrats, it's more then they can bare. SO, as most ghosts would do in this situation, they decide to scare the new tennants away. However, their obvious inexperience proves as a pitfall. Especially since these a*holes get a kick out of it, and start using them as party favors. Enter Michael Keaton as Beedle Geuss (He needs somebody to pronounce his name right).  The couple, desperate, go against the wishes of the department and hire him, to give the new tennants a proper scare. Although they soon realize that they may have gotten in too far over their heads with this ghoul.<br /><br />Lydia, played by Winonna Ryder, is the disillusioned daughter of the artsys and she somehow naturally communicates with the dead, and becomes a friend to the couple. Naturally she becomes the prime target for Beetlejuice also (If I was a sleazy ghoul, I would be all over her too!) and thats when things get ugly. But don't worry too much, because in the end everyone figures out how to compromise, and dance around the house to the tune of Shake Senora. The comedic icing of the whole demented cake.<br /><br />This movie works just as well as a comedy, as it does a terrific ghost story. The effects are great, and a symbol to what made Tim Burton so cool early in his career (who can forget those claymation sand serpents?) The score is perfectly creepy, and this thing is just an all around great movie. Good stuff for the Halloween film fest peeps. I pull it out all the time!

review/summary: Great, Classic Dark Comedy
review/text: It's a great movie which represent what is very typical of the eigthies both in clothing and style throughout all of the 'living world' scenes.  Beetejuice's character is wodnerfully played -- it's hard to watch him and imagine him as Batman as well because he really gets into this character.  It's kind of a dark, inside-kind-of-joke, movie where you really need to listen to the main character speak because he says so much under his breath, but in-hindsight the second time around, he's much more funny than I remember.

review/summary: "I'm the ghost with the most babe"
review/text: This is an early film in Tim Burton's career,shortly after Pee Wee's Big Adventure where you get to see his off humor,art and design poured into the film.This is a Tim Burton classic hands down and I love the humor put into the story(spoken or not).Some strong four letter metephores are thrown upon occassion in some of the dialog,so parents beware if you have little ones watching.Other than that,you have an entertaining story of a young couple who die sudenly and are thrown into the world of the dead without a clue of how,why and what to do?Pathetic attempts are made to scare and rid their home of an undesireable yuppie family.In desperation(even after being warned) they decide to employ the gifts and tallents of Beettlejuice,and it turns out they get more than they bargined for.I only wish there was more screen time with Michael keaton/Beettlejuice,it is damn funny.While the living mingle with the dead in an effort to make a circus of their "paranormal hosts" Beetlejuice is put into action again by Lydia to save them.So,"say it once,say it twice...third time is the charm!"Experience Beettlejuice for yourself,and if you are a Tim Burton fan or new to his films,you are in for a real treat.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: I feel in love with this movie when it first came out, years later I am the parent and decided to puchase this movie so my children can enjoy it as well.<br /><br />My son loves this movie, Michael Keton does a wonderful job of portraying the off humor Beetlejuice, Alex Baldwin and Geena Davis does a great job of being the plain Jane/John couple who dies and have not crossed over. Outstanding job to Winona Ryder as Lydia, the misunderstood teen ager who no one appears to understand.<br /><br />I give this movie two thumbs up, one scene in particular that still cracks me up is when they brought back the couple, Alex's character begins to speak and his jaw falls off... not to forget the beloved scene when Beetlejuice is sitting next to the Witch Doctor and steals his number, the head shrinking scene is just too funny for words.

review/summary: A Tim Burton Classic!
review/text: Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as a very convincing couple with great chemistry), are dead. Now they can't leave their sprawling New England home. Good thing they've got the "Handbook for the Newly Deceased" to help guide them on their way through the beuracratic world of the dead.<br /><br />They've got a problem. A new living family (Cahterine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder) is inhabiting their house. Worse than that, they're remodeling the place. What's a pair of ghosts to do? When they can't scare them out, they call on the help of the famous Bio-Exorcist: Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton in his best role ever).<br /><br />What results is a mixture of dark comedy and sweet special effects (for the late 80's at least) set in front of stunningly imaginative and interesting scene design.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a classic, and if you haven't seen it yet, now's your chance. Since this is an old DVD there really aren't many special features. Just a lot of written "Notes" on the film, but even those are pretty cool.

review/summary: It's SHOWTIME!!!
review/text: That quote "And it keeps getting funnier every single time I see it" will be put to good use, because that is what you'll say when you watch this movie again and again. What is there to say about Tim Burton? He can't stop with the good movies!<br /><br />This has to be up there in at least the top 20 of the best comedies of all time. It's twisted, but very very funny. I swear to you, if you watch this film, you will get one laugh. Probably more if you give it a chance.<br /><br />And of course, Beetlejuice is now one of the most famous charactors in movie history. Way to go, Tim!

review/text: Classic Tim Burton, Micheal Keaton at his best, and the movie that introduced me to Winona Ryder. I love it.  I wish I knew what the impetus was for this twisted take on the afterlife.  It was hilarious when I was 10 and 17 years later I still thoroughly enjoy it.

review/text: I used to want to recommend this to anyone a while ago, and I still do! Beetlejuice is the kind of film that I sometimes like to watch more than once in a row. It used to be my favorite movie and I still very much enjoy it!! This IS the kind of movie where you have to watch out who sees it, but I do not think it's scary at all and  it is a classic.

review/summary: Beetlejuice is a greatmovie, but they cheated you on the dvd
review/text: Just to warn you. when in trying to trick you in the widescreen format, the company made a mistake by also including the full screen version with it.  i compared the widescreen and the full screen. and the full screen seems to comtain more picture at the top and bottom.  which must mean, that all they did was take the full screen version, cut off the top a bottom slightly and call it widescreen.  which is strange because i would expect it to be easier just to make the theatrical version than to carefully edit the full screen and rip many people off.

review/summary: Bettlejuice...Bettlejuice...BETTLEJUICE!
review/text: What happens when you say his name three times? Michael Keaten stars in this comedy about two couples that live in an old two story house.  While coming back from a supply store, the couple suddenly get caught inside of a  &quot;broken-up&quot; bridge and then just before they start to tumble down  into the lake, a board catches them.  But just when they've got their hopes  up, and small dog steps on the board and the car starts to slide off the  bridge and into the lake waters.  A few minutes later...<p>They find  themselves back into their home, they find that somehow somehad light the  fireplace, as if done by magic.  From then on, they find a weird-looking  dead guy known as Bettlejuice.  The only way they can get him for help is  to call him by his name three times and he will appear at their survice.  But they soon wish that they have never called his name, because  Bettlejuice was once a troublemaker but he is the only one who can save  them, on the account that they said his name three times.  They can't leave  their houses or else they will find theirselves in another world with giant  sandworms.  This is a stellar comedy that you should see! Michael Keaton is  awesome as he plays the leading role of Bettlejuice.
