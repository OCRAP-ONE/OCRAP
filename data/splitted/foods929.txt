review/summary: Beautiful, delicious and fragrant
review/text: Jasmine tea has been one of my favorites for decades, and I've probably tried every brand. There's just something about the flowery fragrance of jasmine steaming your face as you sip that makes break time special.<br /><br />Harney & Son's Dragon Pearl Jasmine tea comes in a pretty metal tin, and the 20 attractive tea bags make the process of steeping the tea a pleasant ritual.  Pour hot water over the bag, and watch the little pearls unfurl into petals.  Wait for that first hint of jasmine scent to waft up to your nose. The flavor of the tea is just like the scent - light and flowery.  I like mine without sweetening, but a teaspoon of apple blossom honey would compliment the tea perfectly.<br /><br />This is a very nice tea, and one I savor often.

review/summary: BEWARE, this tea is addicting
review/text: A few years ago, my mom and sister went to china, and the best thing they were able to bring back was a tin of chinese dragon pearl jasmine tea; or just plain "Jasmine tea" as it was called there. I loved it right away, and bribed my sister $20 for the last bit of tea before it ran out. after a long, fustrating search, I found this tea here on amazon, and decided to give it a try. I'm really glad I did, because this tea is an almost EXACT duplicate of what they brought back, except this time the tea came in fancy silky packets, and the writing on the tin was in english, not mandarin.it's got the same delicate aroma, and is the perfect cup of tea after dinner, or just to relax and unwind. If you've never tried this type of tea, you should, even my non tea drinking friends LOVE this tea, and always ask for it when they come over.

review/text: Intersting tea. I wasnt sure what they meant by "pearls" but when I received the tea, and put it in the water, the leaves are shaped like little pearls and they fill out and turn into whole leaves in the water. Kinda cool, I like that. This is NOT like Hedleys Jasmin green tea, no Jasmin green tea is. I dont know what it is about that brand, but they are out of business now, it was the most exceptional green tea Ive ever tasted, its like sipping jasmin perfume.<br /><br />However this tea, comes in second, I guess.<br /><br />But its not worth how expesive it is, not worth the money

review/summary: Interesting novelty flavor
review/text: I got these because they were super cheap at the local Big Lots.  After trying a 4 pack, I went back for more.<br /><br />This is not quite a carbonated coffee.  The color is lighter colored than coffee, which is a tip off that it's coffee flavored rather than actual coffee.  It tastes like coffee, but mildly sweet and mellow.  The carbonation is the novelty, and it works well.<br /><br />About two thirds of my friends who tried this liked it.  One compared it to bottled Starbucks frappuccino (Java Pop is not heavy like frappuccino).  It is a sweet coffee flavored novelty, and I can see the similarities.  Friends who like one seem to like the other, even though the beverages are very different.<br /><br />This would be a good option for a novelty drink at a party where guests like coffee.

review/text: I've tried all the different flavors of bars that Fiber One offers and these are definitely my favorite. The caramel flavor is light and sweet and the fiber in these bars (a whopping 9g!) makes them a very filling snack or a quick meal on the go! I typically enjoy these in the afternoon to carry me through between lunch and dinner but have eaten them for breakfast on occasion as well and they keep me satisfied until lunch. Fiber is one of the hardest things for me to get enough of (25-35g is recommended daily) and these bars definitely help! Some people have reported digestive upset when eating these but I've never had a problem with them. I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Quite Pleasant alternative to Flax-meal but has a brief learning curve.  We're sold!
review/text: Updated 9/7/12: The product being sold as White Chia Seed by Nutiva "CHIA seed" is a new variety of Salvia Hispanica seed selected by growers to produce only white seeds.  It is just as good for you as the nurtitional powerhouse  that is marketed as "Black Chia" which has become a common offering as a health food as well as the seeds that grow furry looking Chia pets!.  White Chia Seeds come from the the same species of plant, just a different cultivar.  The Protein, oil and fatty acid profiles are basically the same  as any black Chia grown in the same climate.  there is no appreciable difference.  The white or light color of these seeds make them easier to incorporate into smoothies and porridges when you add them to water to form the filling and nutritious gel that is described on the back of the package.  I don't mind the Gel form and find it helpful and filling when added to a banana-berry smoothie with only a little bit of agave syrup for sweetener.  The gel holds up well and I don't get that unpleasant bitter taste I associate with flax-seed or Flax meal.  So I'm already thrilled with the White Chia as a substitute for Flax & will be using the 15% Subscribe & Save option to make this an even better buy for my family in the future.<br /><br />Where I see this being even more useful is lightly dry-toasted and added to salads or atop cold cereal and we've had some success with that.  My husband has also been adding the toasted White Chia to a snack mix he makes of grated bittersweet chocolate, All-Bran cereal and a variety of Chex cereals for what he calls his "sweet snack" of the day.  Since it's a dry mixture with just a little bit of Cinnamon and allspice added, it doesn't gel up once it's toasted and it adds more fiber to an already better snack choice.  The other possible benefit is that when using the gel as a thickener insteadof wheat flour Rue, you can feed the suaces and gravies to Celiac patients since there is no Gluten in Salvia Hspanica seeds.  Another Win/Win!<br /><br />I was quite curious about the so-called "White Chia"  and it took me some extra research to finally peg the source as being this new cultivar and not a similar but different species because Nutiva doesn't list the species on the label as do other sellers of White Chia.  In the process I learned a great deal about just how healthy this product is!  Nutritionally speaking, it's main benefits seem to be from the soluble plant-based fiber and the small amounts of protein and Omega-3 you get with each recommended serving of 1 Tbsp.  I would suggest starting slowly before you increase your daily intake any higher becuase you will have an increase in bowel frequency , volume (larger) and texture (softer) the more of this you eat.  For most of us, this is a desired outcome and why we choose to add a supplement like Chia or Flax to our diets but for people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Diverticulitis or other Bowel disorders, please discuss this with either your Gastroenterologist or regular Primary Care Physician before adding to your diet.  You might have some sudden changes that you can't predict.  For healthy people, just take it slowly until you find the correct amount to keep you regular, and also provide that feeling of stomach fullness that the Chia Gel can provide.<br /><br />Even if you have chronic health problems, don't turn away from Chia Seeds out of fear!  There are good books and resources that can guide you if you wish to try and work this into a healthy eating plan.  For example, many diabetics use Chia Gel to help them feel full.  This book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605296759">Diabetes Without Drugs: The 5-Step Program to Control Blood Sugar Naturally and Prevent Diabetes Complications</a>, has a good recipe for a filling Almond bread using Chia seeds of either color.  Another good book about Chia seeds and their possible benefits is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0816524882">Chia: Rediscovering a Forgotten Crop of the Aztecs</a>.  Remember, however, to always clear the addition of a new fiber source with your doctor , in the event that fiber has been a problem for you in the past.  Also, Diabetics should always test-drive new foods by checking their blood sugar before and after consuming itthe new food, at the intervals your educator recommends or what you have come to know is your impact time. The Calories per serving are 60 with calories from fat coming in at 20, sugars 0 but total Carbs at 5 grams.  I would treat this as both a source of fat and fiber and adjust accordingly.<br /><br />Our overall experience with this has been great and I will update this after we have been consuming this regularly for a few more months.  The cost is comperable to Flaxmeal and yet the product is gentler on the digestive system and has no bad fatertaste.  We love it!  It's been a good experience and one we might not have chosen over our Flaxmeal from thelocal Trader Joe's had it not been for the ease of ordering via Amazon.  I hope Nutiva expands their offerings thru Amazon.<br /><br />Now that we've been using White Chia for a while, we have stopped using the strong tasting flax meal completely and now use White Chia in its place.  We're very happy with the products ease of use and  the many foods to which it can be easily added for extra nutritional benefits.  We love it  and we're sold on it!

review/summary: The Mayan word "chiabaan" means "strengthening"
review/text: Chia seeds (Salvia columbaria) have been a staple food in my vegan kitchen for many, many years, but I had never before tried white chia seeds, so I was quite excited to be able to sample <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054TWQMM">Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, 14-Ounce, 2-Count Pouches</a> through the Amazon Vine.  I am utterly delighted with this product!<br /><br />Just as an interesting aside, the genus name of "Salvia" for chia is derived from the Latin "salvere,"  meaning "to save."  The Mayan word "chiabaan" from which chia gets its common name means "strengthening."  So you can understand how these tiny seeds get their reputation for packing an astonishing nutritional punch.  Chia seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and have long been considered an energy tonic.  The native peoples of the Americas have used chia since ancient times for endurance and also to treat constipation.<br /><br />There is apparently no difference in nutrition between black or white chia seeds but the lighter colored white chia seeds are preferable in recipes where the food presentation is enhanced by their more neutral coloring.<br /><br />Having gone raw vegan some years back, chia seeds are very popular with me (as are flax seeds) for substituting the grains in my dehydrated raw crackers, breads and sweet treats.  I use chia seeds as I use flax seeds, or in combination with flax seeds, for the same mucilaginous effect of being "sticky" enough to hold together when dehydrated, making a very reasonable and tasty facsimile of  a cracker, bread or sweet treat.<br /><br />Chia seeds, especially these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054TWQMM">Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, 14-Ounce, 2-Count Pouches</a>, make a wonderful pudding that reminds me of tapioca pudding.  I also sprinkle 2 tablespoons of chia seeds over my sprouted buckwheat cereal and the thickening effect of the chia when I add liquid transforms my cereal into a very appealing, very nourishing porridge.  For added nutrition in my smoothies I also add 2 tablespoons of chia seeds.<br /><br />I am very pleased with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054TWQMM">Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, 14-Ounce, 2-Count Pouches</a> and look forward to devising more creative culinary applications for this delicious, certified organic product of Mexico in my raw vegan kitchen.  Of course chia seeds are not confined to the raw or vegetarian kitchens alone.  Every diet should include these mightily nourishing, antioxidant and fiber rich seeds.  The ancient Aztec and Mayan peoples revered these seeds... and perhaps we modern people should too!

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: I wanted to try these for the great benefits I have read about. As a vegetarian, I don't get my Omega-3's from any fish source, so I normally depend on Flax seeds. I have read that Chia seeds contain an even higher amount of Omega-3. . I mix 2 tablespoons with a small glass of orange juice and drink it down. You have to drink it quickly, because they absorbe the liquid quickly, and become very thick in no time. I love the idea of this happening in my intestines, and the benefit there was definitely obvious, so as a fiber source, I also highly recommend them. I even tried them as an egg substitute, something I had also read was possible, and in banana bread, they worked out just fine. I love that they are ready to use, Flax seeds have to be ground, so Chia seeds are really perfect to take on trips.I will definitely continue to buy and use these.

These chia seeds have been fantastic for adding nutrients to our smoothies and we've even made a nice  tapioca substitute with nothing more than these seeds stirred into cream with a little stevia & left to sit in the fridge for about an hour. We've made gravy by adding chia seeds to the pan drippings with a little cream and using the immersion blender. Also used them to thicken up the sauce for Beef Stroganoff. These are very versatile and since they're all fiber, they're basically a 0 carb food!

review/summary: A little less nutty
review/text: Chia seeds are high in omega-3's, protein, fiber and antioxidants and are easy to add to foods and smoothies, very similar to flax seed. The white chia is definitely less noticeable in foods; the dark chia has a nutty quality. There are some websites that claim white chia is superior to black chia, but they are actually very similar in terms of composition. If you eat them dry, they are slightly crunchy. Adding water makes a gel - so it's a good way to add omegas and fiber to a smoothie for a small calorie tradeoff. I've also used them in chocolate chip oatmeal cookies to add nutritional value for no change in taste or texture.<br /><br />The bag is easy to reseal and is a sturdy bag. It is a little awkward to store in the cabinet because it is wider at the bottom.<br /><br />While chia are purported to be a superfood, I haven't sprouted a good aura, found myself fighting crime, or run any marathons since trying these, but will be purchasing it again. It's an easy, quick, painless nutritional boost to add to my foods.

review/summary: Not Your Chia Pet Food
review/text: For those who associate Chia with the green-haired, clay pets, this is something very different - FOOD!  Chia seeds are small and nutty.  They are quite tasty and equally important, packed with nutrition.  High in omega-3 fatty acids, protein, fiber, and anti-oxidants, chia seeds are great for you.  Unlike larger seeds, which need to be ground the extract their nutrition (otherwise known as the what goes in, what comes out effect), chia seeds can be added to any food.  They are quite versatile, and can be put in breads, muffins, oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, you name.<br />However, what is unusual about Chia seeds is the texture when added to any liquid (juice, yogurt, etc.  The seeds have an outer later that swells into a chewy gelatinous globule in about 10-15 minutes.  It adds quite a unique and fun mouthfeel to these foods.<br />Chia seeds have many uses, and you will have fun exploring all the different ways to use them in cooking.

review/text: I've been using the Nutiva Organic Chia Seeds as part of my daily routine for the last 4 months and I've been happy with the results. Much like peanuts, Chia Seeds helps decrease your food intake and make you feel more full. I create a gel by adding a couple tablespoons to a 12 oz glass of warm water and refrigerate after stirring the contents twice within 15 minutes. I add a couple teaspoons of the gel to my morning oatmeal and to yogurt in the evenings. They give you a bit more energy and I notice I don't have to hit the caffeine like I had in the past. And they're full of fiber and Omega-3's which are both essential for your health. I definitely feel better since taking them. I have lost some weight, have increased my good cholesterol count, lowered my blood pressure, and feel more alert during the day. I highly recommend this product to anyone because they do improve your overall health and they're WAY cheaper here on Amazon than at the local GNC.

review/summary: Good addition to smoothies - does help with energy for endurance sports
review/text: I first heard about chia seeds when reading the book "Born to Run," which (among other things) told how the Tarahumara Indians - with their great super distance runners - relied on the seed for sustained energy.  I read more more about these tiny seeds, and was struck by what a decent source of omega-3 fatty acids (the "good" fats in foods such as salmon), fiber, and even protein.  I tried some by basically tossing them into a blender as part of yogurt/milk/berry smoothies, and they mixed in well, though the black chia seeds ended up leaving a lot of small specks in smoothies, while making them  a bit thicker.<br /><br />Anyway, it was nice to try these white seeds out in that they mix in well with smoothies, without giving them a gritty appearance.  I do think the claims associated with chia seeds have some truth in terms  of helping with energy -- I do a fair number of races (10 miles and over) and find it is good to drink a smoothie with a tablespoon or or chia seeds a couple of hours before the race.  It may be the fiber and the fact that the seeds soak up liquid (presumably after being consumed) but adding them to a smoothie before a race really does increase energy over the course of the race, I assume by slowing digestion and release of sugar.<br /><br />As far as this product is concerned, I do like the light color of these seeds and believe the packaging is very good here - bags are a not too large and seal easily.<br /><br />Product and packaging come highly recommended - 5 stars!

review/summary: Boost Your Health with Super Food Chia Seeds
review/text: I started changing over my eating habits by adding one new Paleo recipe a week and one new health food every two weeks. I started by adding Magnesium Citrate since I was magnesium deficient. Just by taking the recommended daily allowance I felt my body respond with new energy, my insomnia disappeared, and there is no sluggishness when I go to the bathroom.<br /><br />I started drinking smoothies for breakfast - deep chocolate whey protein powder, bananas and almond or soy milk.  I wanted to add more Omega-3 and fiber to my diet. Adding Nutiva chia seeds to meals is a quick and easy nutritional boost.<br /><br />You can find recipes on the Nutiva package and on their web site. Here are a few recipes to get you started:<br /><br />WAYS TO EAT CHIA SEEDS:<br /><br />- Lightly roast 2-3 teaspoons to put in soups, stews, salads, nut butters, tartar sauce, marinades, salad dressings or mayo<br /><br />- Grind 2 teaspoons to add to bread and muffin mixes<br /><br />- Create a gel (1 tablespoon to eight ounces of water let sit for 15 minutes) that can be added (2-3 teaspoons) to juice and smoothies. The gel lasts in the fridge for up to two weeks<br /><br />IMPORTANT REMINDERS:<br /><br />- Most people will think of the Chia Pet, but those seeds are not food grade and should not be eaten.<br /><br />- Make sure that the chia seeds you eat are organic and pesticide free. White or black, the seeds have the same nutritional value.<br /><br />- These chia seeds hold up to ten times their weight in water and help clear toxins from your body. It is very important that you drink your eight glasses of water a day. If not, you will look like you are retaining water.<br /><br />- Chia seeds also lower blood pressure and help to control your blood sugar level. If you are on medication for high blood pressure or diabetes, be sure to talk to your doctor before taking these seeds daily. Then monitor your pressure and progress each day.<br /><br />- Bestselling author and skin doctor Nicholas Perricone, MD says "Chia delivers more Omega-3 than flax or fish, satisfying skin's craving for moisture. Omega-3 is the world's most perfect anti-inflammatory featuring DHA and EPA."<br /><br />I encourage everyone to give these organic chia seeds a try. I will be ordering them on a regular basis.

Looking to find an egg replacement for recipes, and having had mixed results with flax seed which sometimes alters the taste, I set out to try the chia in as many different recipes as possible. The recipes ranged from cookies to muffins and cupcakes, breads to pancakes, and they've all turned out terrific; the seeds worked just as well as eggs and I feel better about it. In place of 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of chia seed with 2-3 tablespoons of water, soaked for 15-20 minutes, worked out best in my baking experience. They are also great in homemade granola bars, tossed into both cold and hot cereals, and in smoothies or juices. The versatility of the "superfood" the Aztecs and Mayans revered is amazing. The nutritional benefits, which are many, of chia seeds can be found by an internet search, but a some of them include: omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, protein, essential minerals, and rare antioxidants.  I'm sold and I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054TWQMM">Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, 14-Ounce, 2-Count Pouches</a> without reservation. You can be sure I'll always have this stocked in my pantry.

review/summary: A little goes a very long way.
review/text: This was my first "taste" of chia seeds.  I've read that the sprouts are tasty and very nutritous, but I've not tried that, yet.<br />Actually, Chia seeds have no discernible taste.  Unlike flax, they are not grainy or gritty, but a bit softer, which I see as a good thing.<br />I mix them in oatmeal, add to smoothies, mix into granola (or into baked granola bars) and mix into Larabar-type concoctions.<br />Because they are softer than flax, they integrate nicely and don't reuire grinding, which is a time saver.<br />The color (white) is especially nice because you don't "see" them mixed with other ingredients (read: your kids won't be suspicious).<br />If you're currently using flax or dark-colored chia, I highly recommend giving these a try.

review/summary: Worked well as an egg replacer in my gluten free baked goods.
review/text: I decided to give Nutiva Chia Seeds a try when they were offered to me by Amazon Vine to review.<br /><br />First, I used them in my smoothies.  I normally use ground flax seed, but was pleased to find that these chia seeds have over twice the amount of omega 3 fatty acids in them than flax seed.  I ground them in my coffee grinder, resulting in a creamier smoothie.  I'm not supposed to eat small seeds due to a recent diverticulitis attack, and eating them ground has not bothered me. It also seemed to me that they were milder in taste than the flax seeds I had been using.<br /><br />Next, I decided to try it as an egg replacer in my gluten free baked goods.  Performance-wise, I could not tell the difference between chia and flax seed.  Because of the added nutrition, I will continue to use chia in baking, alone or mixed with ground flax.  I recently read a blog post that chia seed could also cut out the need for guar gum and xanthan gum in gluten free baked goods.  I'm going to try that next and see if I can adjust some of my recipes.  I'd rather not have to use the gums because they're expensive and they also bother a lot of people.  I'll post the results of my "experiments" and let you know how it goes!<br /><br />Update:  I decided to go ahead and try the chia without grinding.  I've been eating them that way for a couple of months now and haven't had any problems with diverticulitis. My favorite recipe is to fill a pint jar with Silk or SoDelicious coconut milk, add a packet of Stevita Supreme, a teaspoon of real vanilla extract (Tone's is GF)and add three tablespoons of whole chia seeds.  Mix well and set in the fridge for 1/2 hour.  Remove and stir well again.  Return to fridge for a few hours or overnight. Stir again before eating.  Tastes just like tapioca pudding to me!

review/summary: Nothing I'd crave, but not bad
review/text: These little seeds are supposedly very nutritious, so eating them has a reward besides the taste or how filling they are.  They actually taste okay; not as tasty as sunflower seeds, but not bad and they are easy to add to a lot of things.  I found that I was slightly allergic to them and everytime I ate them, my sinuses would start draining like crazy and I'd begin coughing, so they aren't something I'll be continuing to eat.  But for most people, that wouldn't be a problem. You can even use them to grow sprouts if you'd prefer something more veggie-like.  Those who grow the sprouts say that they make tiny little sprouts, but good to eat.  I grew a "chia pet" years ago, but don't remember what the sprouts looked like.  I do remember that they sprouted easily, so that shouldn't be a problem for would-be sprout-growers.

review/summary: What's Not To Love??
review/text: Before I saw this product here on Amazon, if anyone mentioned "chia" I would think of those chia pets where you applied the seeds, watered and grew "hair" on your "pet".<br /><br />I can't BELIEVE what an easy way this is to add goodness to your diet! You literally can mix this with anything. I've had it in yogurt, in soup, pudding, oatmeal, smoothies, etc, etc. It makes me feel good to know that I'm doing something that can benefit my health.<br /><br />I have added this to my drop biscuit recipe and to banana bread. Both were extra moist and with both I was able to cut back the amount of butter/margarine in the recipes and the flavor didn't really change at all which I think is a good thing.<br /><br />I am a perpetual dieter and one thing I did notice for myself was that when adding this to various foods, I did seem to feel full longer than if I didn't add it. Also, my husband has type II diabetes and this is hasn't spiked his blood sugar because it's got protein and fiber and fiber acts like "brakes" for sugar/carbs so they absorb more slowly into the bloodstream and you don't get the blood sugar spikes or at the very least, it doesn't spike so high. So far, despite the holiday season and his "cheating" on his diabetic diet, his blood sugar numbers are actually better than this time last year - I'm not giving all the credit for that to this product but I think it's probably helping at least a bit.<br /><br />I just don't see a downside to this product. It's organic, easy to use and according to what I've read, it's good for you. I will continue to experiment with this and will absolutely be buying it again.

review/summary: These are GREAT!
review/text: I had visions of "Chia Pets" when ordering these, but based on reported nutritional value, we got some anyway.<br /><br />While there is little taste - particularly in smoothies for example, the texture does exactly what the product packaging says it will do - thicken up fairly rapidly.<br /><br />I don't know what else can be said about this product, other than it is a particularly great smoothie ingredient.  There are other possible uses, and they seem very reasonable now that we've actually used the chia seeds, we just happen to prefer to use it with smoothies.<br /><br />The one negative is the price - nearly $10.00 per pound seems a bit steep, even for organic seeds.  Still, a little goes a long way.

review/summary: Adds a nice texture to oatmeal
review/text: Chia Seeds are kind of weird.  You can put them in ANYTHING.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, my husband immediately tried them in all sorts of things, and has continued to experiment throughout.  Dry?  Gets stuck in your teeth.  He drinks them in chocolate milk when he gets home from a bike ride.  My daughter tried them in apple juice ("They're kind of like frogs eggs, Mom.").  One of my coworkers mixes them with water and then substitutes half the oil in certain baking recipes.<br /><br />For myself, I like them in oatmeal.  I add 2 tablespoons to my regular preparation, and a little extra water.  They give the oatmeal a little more texture.<br /><br />I have not noticed any appreciable health effects, and the chia seeds in oatmeal don't seem to make the fullness effect last any longer than if it was plain, but they're kind of cool.<br /><br />I like having weird grains and things in my pantry. If you're the kind of person who doesn't shy away from things like quinoa and jicama, then chia seeds are for you.

review/summary: A True Superfood
review/text: I have been wanting to try chia seeds since I read that they were a great source of energy and protein for pre-workout meals. They are also a Mayan superfood containing protein, anti-oxidants, and fiber. Well, I wasn't disappointed. These things taste great and gave me a quick energy boost. You can add them to salads, soups, smoothies, or any liquid. Mixing Chia seeds with water will make a quick energizing paste, that is great for a quick snack or an early morning, or pre-workout meal.<br /><br />They don't really have a strong flavor, but they absorb the flavor of the food they are mixed with creating a healthy, rich tasting treat. These seeds are great in smoothies or juices. I added some to a peach tea and it was a delicious energizing snack, instead of just a drink. All of the fiber made me feel full, without feeling stuffed. They are also supposed to be an aid to digestion and cleansing.<br /><br />The quality of these white chia seeds is exceptional. They are amazing little round seeds that plump up when soaked in water. They are easy to eat and are full of health benefits. The dried seeds are smooth and round and would also be great for making silk eye pillows, but then we wouldn't be getting the amazing health benefits.

review/summary: Tiny but nutritious
review/text: Like many other people, I used to associate Chia seeds with the terracotta Chia pets.  The first time I heard of these seeds being consumed as a health food was in Dr. Oz's show. Nutiva white Chia seeds are USDA organic approved and come in a resealable pouch. If you are like me and don't intend to eat more than a teaspoon of seeds a day, then the Nutiva's 14 oz. bag will last you for a while.<br /><br />Chia seeds can be added to almost any dish because the seeds taste quite neutral although when my mother boiled them in water, I thought they had a very slightly "fish oil" flavor.  I usually mix the tiny seeds in my oatmeal or sprinkle them on the peanut butter spread on my sandwich. Sometimes, I eat them by themselves with a bit of sugar.  I simply soaked them in warm water for about 10 minutes until they start to acquire a gel consistency.  My mother took to these seeds from the very first day.  She liked the smoothness of the gel, which makes for easy swallowing, and thought it would be great as a thick soup if we threw in some beef and chopped Chinese green onions.  That gave me the idea that Chia seeds could be good for elderly people who have trouble chewing. But then, I read that older adults who take blood thinners and/or medication to control their hypertension should not eat the seeds in great quantities because the combination of the medication and the seeds might increase the risk of bleeding and/or might cause a sudden drop in blood pressure.<br /><br />But eating Chia seeds in moderation brings many benefits for most people. Chia seeds are a great source of antioxidants, calcium, protein, boron, and Omega 3-fatty acids; and I like the fact that Nutiva's seeds are organic which means I'm not consuming harmful chemicals along with the seeds.  I haven't been eating Chia seeds long enough to attest to their weight loss and endurance qualities, but they're nutritious and are an easy ingredient to use so I'm happy to incorporate them in my diet.

review/summary: Extra nutrition for a vegan diet (or any diet!)
review/text: Being vegan, I look for quality nutrition from pretty interesting sources.  I blend smoothies very often (thanks to the book Green for Life for giving me many recipes to play with).  Usually I blend up greens, bananas, strawberries, and add flax oil, hemp protein, and nutritional yeast.  Adding a tablespoon of these seeds adds quite a nice dose of nutrition.<br /><br />Most seeds and nuts are high on fat, and these are no exception (50% fat by volume).  But for most diets the pros outweigh the amount of fat.  Plus, a little healthy fat is necessary in a balanced diet.<br /><br />They taste great.  Very mild.  They are great for baking, topping oatmeal or cereal, putting in a cup of almond milk, adding to smoothies (of course), or just eating raw.  You can also soak them in water for a bit to make a nice paste (which is a good way to use it in baking recipes also).<br /><br />The packaging is nice.  There is not a ton of wasted space, the seeds fill the entire bag.  They are USDA organic.<br /><br />I highly recommend them as a source of alternative nutrition, especially for vegetarians and vegans, but for anyone really.

review/text: I had never experienced Chia seeds so when I got a chance to sample them, I took it. What fun! They are small crunchy seeds with a pleasant, nutty, grain taste. I experimented with mixing them with various liquids to make chia pudding. The texture reminds me a lot of tapioca pudding. There are 60 calories in a tablespoon, but you can mix this with 8 oz. of water, make the pudding, which keeps up to two weeks in the fridge and add it to jelly and jam to reduce the calories from sugar and boost the nutritional value. I have found a new favorite supper food.

review/summary: White Chia
review/text: Chia seeds are considered a "Superfood," which means that they contain a very high density of nutrients. Chia provides you with complete protein, ALL essential amino acids, as well as essential vitamins and trace minerals. A great antioxidant source, chia provides high levels of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and flavanol glycosides. These are all polyphenols that maintain proper function of bodily organs and tissues and that protect against cancer and cardiovascular disease through the removal of damaging free radicals. Chia is a phenomenal whole food for any diet.<br /><br />I'd purchased chia seeds in the past and they normally came as a mixture of light and dark seeds. I figured I would try these white chia seeds in order to see if there was any difference in taste and/or nutritional value. White chia seeds appear to have slightly less fat than the standard chia mixture (3g to 4.5g). Other values are essentially the same, such dietary fiber, carbs and protein, but white chia has more potassium at 60mg per serving. I was not able to decipher any distinguishable difference in taste between these white chia seeds and the darker ones I'd had in the past.<br /><br />I usually add these seeds to oatmeal, but other options include smoothies, yogurt or even baked goods. What I have yet to try is soaking the seeds in water, which creates a "gel" that can essentially be added to any recipe.

review/summary: nicely packaged, convenient dietery supplement
review/text: I received two pouches of Nutiva Organic White Chia seeds to test and review, and it is my first experience with Chia (ingesting that is; have made Chia pets before, lol). First off, I do like the way the seeds are packaged--the pouches are made of very tough material and the resealable zip-lock on top really does work easily and consistantly. It stands up nicely because the bottom of the pouch is wider. I find it easy to store in my fridge. The second thing I noticed is that the seeds are nice and clean looking. I have read some reviews about other Chia seeds and some have disappointed because of debris in the package. Not so with this product; the pack is full of clean, uniform small white seeds with darker centers. The proof they say, is in the pudding, but so far I have not made pudding, but have been drinking it straight mixed in a large glass of water. I am following the recommendation of mixing two Tablespoons with water, letting it set for a few minutes and drinking it down. The mixture does quickly become gelationous, but is tolerable to drink. However, I don't advise letting it sit for more than about 10 minutes because it continues to gel until the texture becomes, for me, too hard to swallow. I do believe it contributes to a sense of fullness, and I think the fiber has been helping with regularity. So far I have not lost any weight. I also think that my blood sugar is more stabilized because I do not feel hungry for a long time (by which I don't mean empty, but rather weak and shakey). My energy level has been decent. It has not cured my lupus, as I am still running a low grade fever. I will continue to use this product and update my progress. There is lots of good information in some of the other reviews, as well as recipe ideas, so I am going to try some of those, too.<br /><br />Good luck, and I hope it helps you, too!

review/summary: Subtle Taste with Big Nutrition
review/text: Finally, I have found a nutritious superfood that doesn't have an overpowering taste. In fact, it expertly blends with whatever you add it to, making it a wise purchase for anyone who wants the flexibility of adding a healthy "boost" to diverse foods.<br /><br />I love this for sneaking in extra nutrition for the kids.  Even my pickiest eater can't tell when I stir it into her soup since the color of these white chia seeds is a pale beige and the grain isn't really gritty.  It turns into a type of gel after being soaked in liquid for 5-10 minutes. This makes it a valuable ingredient in my pantry, because it's so easy to add to any menu.<br /><br />From the back of this pouch, I learned that chia seeds were regarded by the ancient Aztec and Mayan people as vital nourishment. In one tablespoon, these raw, organic white chia seeds contain 3 grams of Omega-3 fats, with the same amount of protein, 60 mg potassium, and 5 grams each of total carbs and dietary fiber. Calcium content per tablespoon is 8%, Iron 6% and Magnesium 10%, respectively.<br /><br />I really feel that I stumbled upon a pleasant surprise with this product.  At last, I can stop buying supplements for my kids that they continually complain about, regarding taste.<br /><br />I can now just add a sprinkle of practically untraceable nutrition to their food daily, with the confidence that their minds and bodies are being fed in an amazing way.

review/summary: I liked the seeds
review/text: Many claims are made regarding the health benefits of these 1 mm (0.039 inches) seeds from central and southern Mexico and Guatemala. A 52 year-old Indian won the 100 mile run in California in 19 hours and 37 minutes. He said he was able to complete the run with such high speed because he ate Chia seeds before and during the race. The seeds are said to be gluten free, the highest source of omega-3, contains minerals, phosphorous, manganese, calcium, potassium, sodium, fatty acids, and they keep the body hydrated because they absorb a large amount of water. It is also said that the seeds can last 4 or 5 years, even unrefrigerated.<br /><br />The seeds can be eaten raw. They can be placed in water or fruit juices, left for 15 minutes until they become gelatinous and then drunk; the seeds, however, are not dissolved in the liquid. (The name Chia means oily, probably referring to how the seeds becomes gelatinous.) They can also be placed raw on top of fruits or cereals, or baked in cakes, breads, or biscuits.<br /><br /> I tried them in the drinks and on top of fruits and I liked them. I put a heaping tablespoon in each. They added a slight grainy taste, which I think added to the flavor.

review/text: It is what it is but I've noticed some differences between the white and the black.  I don't know if it's psychological but I swear the white ones fluff up more in water and there is less crunch in the final bite.  For those who are experienced in Chia seeds will know exactly what crunch I'm talking about.  I would say it's 99.9% white.

review/summary: White chia seeds vs black
review/text: I've purchased chia seeds before (black) and they came with a sample of the white variety.  I don't think it makes a difference, but I did like using the white ones better.  I was just about finished with the black kind when this was offered.  I don't use them like many people.  I just mix a tablespoon of these and some ground flax in a little water every morning and drink it.  Not a very pleasant experience.  Not much taste, but the slurry feels terrible.  They get stuck between your teeth no matter how I try to swallow without chewing.  Chia seeds want to stick to everything once you wet them.  Cleaning glasses, bowls, etc after using them takes extra work.  I have not soaked them overnight and added to smoothies or anything, so maybe that minimizes the mess a bit.<br /><br />Having said all that, I will use them as a thickening agent in soups.  Smart people out there can probably use them countless ways.  I swallow them for their protein content and to promote a healthy digestive tract.  I definitely like the fact that they are organic.  And to me, the white ones are just more appealing.  Nutiva provides high quality ingredients.

review/summary: Convenient Little Health Boost
review/text: What I really like about this product is that it's so easy to just use a little bit in foods that you were going to eat anyway. I've been putting ground flax seeds in my oatmeal for a while and this can very nicely fulfill a similar purpose. It's actually a little more convenient than flax, because you need to worry about whether flax seeds are ground while this can just go right in. They're basically just a really easy way to add some extra nutrition without making any big changes to the taste of something that you were going to eat anyway.<br /><br />I found the packaging of these particular seeds to be very nicely done and convenient to use. I really have no complaints at all about the product. The particular package I've been using was given to me for the purpose of trying out and reviewing it, but I will likely purchase more in the future.

review/text: I have been using black chia seeds for a while now. I add them to my food for the nutritional value. Chia seeds are high in Omega-3, protein and fiber. There really is not much difference between black chia seeds and white chia seeds (besides the color).<br /><br />I use chia seeds now instead of flax seeds because they don't alter the food as much as the ground flax seeds do. I like that chia seeds can be used whole. They don't need to be ground to release their nutritional benefits. You can add chia seeds to almost anything you eat. They can even be added to foods that are baked or cooked. They add no flavor.<br /><br />The one thing I don't like about chia seeds, especially black chia seeds, is that they can get stuck in your teeth. Not a pretty site.<br /><br />Chia seeds do not need to be refrigerated. These chia seeds are a product of Mexico and they are labeled USDA organic.

review/summary: Healthy Goodness--Superfood We Should All Include
review/text: I've been eating chia seeds for years, ever since I read the book Born To Run.  They are a traditional food of the Tarahumara Native Americans of Mexico and help keep them satisfied when they run long distances.  They are a powerhouse of nutrition and can keep you going for a long time.  I put them in my homemade granola when I make a big batch every two weeks and occasionlly I make a somewhat traditional chia drink.  I mix a tablespoon or two into a glass of water with some lemon or lime juice and a little sugar or other sweetener and leave it to sit for a few minutes, to make a gel.  It's a bit weird, but they don't affect the flavor.  They produce a mucilagenous gel that actually has a very interesting mouth feel.<br /><br />These chia seeds resemble other chia seeds that I have purchased over the years.  I can't see any difference in taste.  They appear to be fresh and the packaging is sturdy.  Chia is a source for a lot of different vitamins and minerals and even some omega-threes.  We can all stand to have more raw nuts and seeds in our diets, given how nutritious they are, so I like to add these whenever I think about it.  A good product.  I'd buy again.

review/summary: Nutritious and Versatile
review/text: The health benefits of chia seed has been widely reported.  For example, like flax seed, they contain omega-3 fatty acids,and unlike flax, there's no need to grind them to break the outer coat.  (It's also said the form of omega-3 found in both flax and chia isn't as valuable as that found in fish oil, but you may not car if you're a vegetarian, and for that matter, it doesn't have to be the best possible form of the nutrient for it to be worth eating.) Chia is also a good source of soluble fiber, which is known to promote digestive health and lower cholesterol, like the fiber in oatmeal, apples, and psyllium (the last of which, the main ingredient in Metamucil, isn't the kind of thing most people enjoy consuming.) Mixed with water, chia turns into a gel, but you don't have to mix it with water to receive the benefits--it will turn into a gel in your digestive tract regardless of how you eat it.<br /><br />I use them in smoothies, in yoghurt, in baked goods, and sprinkled on salads. They don't have much flavor, but then again, they also don't get in the way of the flavor what you're eating them with.  A simple way to boost your intake of soluble fiber and omega-3.  This particular brand is organic, which I appreciate.  Otherwise, chia is chia.

review/summary: Marginally tastier than flax seeds
review/text: I don't like the hydrated (gooey) chia seeds, but dry (on cereal) they have a bit of chewiness, like smaller kiwi fruit seeds and I prefer them to flax seeds. In hot drinks, some tend to stick to the cup (not a good thing!)<br /><br />I can't verify the health benefits, though I think that by absorbing liquids in my stomach they may decrease my appetite and thereby my weight (which is a very good thing for the vast number of us who are overweight!).<br /><br />I haven't noticed more energy and am unlikely to morph into a Tarahumara long-distance runner. They must not eat them dry, and those who do need to ensure drinking plenty of liquids.

review/summary: This vegan loves her some Chia
review/text: I've been vegan for a few years, and have been on the Chia bandwagon for about 18 months.  (In fact, last year I gave a bag to each of my sibs & cousins for xmas, which met with mixed reviews...)  Chia seeds are easy to sprinkle on or in almost anything (and don't have to be ground like flax seeds do), they are high in fiber and rich in omega-3's, and they are said to reduce both blood pressure and blood sugar.  They are 20% protein, and also high in iron, potassium, magnesium, and more.  They are said to be a 'superfood' of the Aztecs and Mayans because of the long-term sustained energy they provide.<br /><br />Chia seeds have a faint nutty taste that most people - even my teenagers and their friends - like.  I put a few teaspoons in my smoothies, in my baking, and in my tofu scrambles.  I also like to toast them up with sesame seeds and poppy seeds and use the mixture (in a shaker) as a garnish or condiment at the table.  Yum!<br /><br />This was my first experience with white Chia seeds.  I can discern no difference between the white and the (more common) black Chia seeds.  Both have a slight thickening response.  Both can be sprinkled on or in anything.  Both have only the very faintest flavor.  And by my reading both have the same nutritional benefits.  I guess white is better if you are trying to trick little kids into eating something healthy in their oatmeal or eggs.  The white are a little more expensive - I'm not sure why.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Try Chia seeds- you don't need to be a vegan to appreciate the amazing nutritional benefits.  If white seeds are more appetizing to you, these will be great.  Enjoy!

review/summary: A Different Choice for this Family
review/text: I will admit, we are not the key market group for this product.  Stops at the health food stores are rare in our household.  We aren't vegan or vegetarian as many people who have reviewed seem to be, but we are always looking at ways to add nutrition and health to our diets.  I found a recipe for a pudding with the chia seeds and started from there.  It was delicious.  Very similar to tapioca.  My kids LOVED it.  We also tried it to thicken smoothies..also tasty.<br /><br />I'm still finding new uses for these chia seeds as I am a novice at this.  I also have not tried any other brands, so I can't compare this to similar products.  I can say that everything I have tried it with, has worked and was tasty.

review/summary: Very easy to consume
review/text: I selected these white chia seeds from the Vine program because I was curious to find out whether they were different than the black chia seeds.  My husband and I added chia seeds to our diet about a year ago after reading about their health benefits. When not making smoothies, we simply soak them in water for 30 minutes or more and then squeeze some fresh lime into the glass, along with a little sweetener (such as agave nectar).  The white seeds are more "attractive" and disappear into foods more easily due to their color.  They also seem to be slightly smaller and less gritty than the black ones.  For anyone who would like to try chia seeds for the first time, I'd recommend these.  However, because they are significantly more expensive than the black ones (that I buy in bulk on Amazon), I probably won't purchase the white ones again.

review/summary: Weird but effective
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that I have a lot of texture issues with food. And the chia seed in liquid looks and feels like frog eggs. So I was hesitant to try these. But having done so, I'm a fan. Yes, they are kinda slimy, but we're not talking okra levels of slime, and even I was able to swallow them. I actually like them better mixed in with other things (smoothies, baked goods) than taken as a beverage. I find them to have no discernible taste.<br /><br />But the reason I'm a fan is for the health benefits, namely the fiber boost. It is a most excellent replacement for psyllium, not only because of the higher fiber content (the chia seeds have 5.5. g of fiber per tablespoon, while the psyllium has 3 grams per tablespoon). The chia seeds also provide other nutrients that psyllium doesn't have, such as protein and small amounts of certain vitamins. If you're not used to a fiber-rich food, start using the chia in small amounts and work up to the full recommended serving size. I'm pretty pleased that this particular brand is organic, too. I will be buying these when my current supply runs out.

review/summary: Super healthy seeds
review/text: I've been wanting to try chia seeds for a while after hearing they're high in omega-3's, tryptophan, fiber and antioxidants. So far I've found them to be a great addition to my diet and easy to add to all sorts of foods. They're very small; much smaller than sesame seeds, a little crunchy if eaten dry and don't have a distinct flavor, which makes them perfect for adding to any kind of food, juices or recipes for extra nutrition without changing the flavor of things. When they're soaked in water or any liquid, they take on a gel-like consistency. I like mixing them into shakes, smoothies or sprinkling them on cereal and salads for added crunch. They're also good on yogurt and can be added to muffins and other baked goods. The two 14 oz. bags are a nice size and will last a while depending on how you use them. Great product! I'll definitely be a repeat buyer.

review/text: I admit... I picked these from the Vine list entirely because of curiosity.  Chia seeds?  What the heck are those?<br /><br />I'll let the prospective customer do the research on the details, but all I figure you need to know is that they are tiny seeds that are extremely nutritious with many different purposes.<br /><br />Mainly so far I have been using them as an egg substitute and a little something to throw into soups, yogurt, whatever is cooking that wouldn't be opposed to some seeds.  They have no strong taste, but add some great texture and apparently amazing nutrition.  As an egg substitute? This is the only one I have tried that WORKS.<br /><br />I'm searching for new ways to use them, but even in my so-far limited experience I am highly impressed.

review/summary: Fantastic Nutrition
review/text: Chia seeds are one of the most nutritious things on earth. But they can be difficult to incorporate into the typical person's diet. Try this trick: add a couple tablespoons of Chia seeds to a health smoothy. After blending let it sit for a half hour or so in the refrigerator. The ground Chia seeds will thicken and add a pleasing, slightly jell-like consistency. It won't change the taste but will add tons of essential fats, minerals and vitamins.<br /><br />These white chia seeds seem to blend slightly better than the normal black or brown ones. 100% recommended to anybody concerned with increasing the nutritional profile of the food they eat.

review/text: These have a nice, mild flavor, and the texture, when cooked with other foods, blends right in, in fact my kids haven't even been able to tell I've been adding these to scrambled eggs and casseroles.<br />It's an excellent, sneaky way to get extra fiber and vitamins into your family, even the pickiest eater didn't notice.<br />I think it adds to the recipes and makes them taste better, even if no one else has realized there's an extra ingredient.<br />I'm a big fan of "stealth health," I've been known to tell my kids that bits of fruit in a muffin was actually bits of candy, so this has worked out really well for me.<br />It only takes a little bit, one tablespoon in a single serving adds 20% of the daily allowance of fiber, 3g of protein, 6% iron, 8% calcium and 10% magnesium. That's pretty nutrient-dense.<br />Pretty soon I'll 'fess up that I've been adding chia seeds to our scrambled eggs, buffalo chicken rice, tuna mac, and other dishes, and I'll point out that no one can say they don't like them, because they never even noticed it was there.<br />Stealth health, you gotta do what you can to get healthy foods into your kids!

review/summary: White and mild
review/text: These are light, crunchy little chia seeds. They are mild in flavor and texture. When you soak them in some water, they turn into Chia 'tapioca', which means they have a bit of a jelly coating. This makes it very hard for me to eat strait, but added to smoothies and other such products they are very edible indeed! Chia is a superfood. It has all your essential amino acids, and lots of protein and fiber. If you are looking to add chia to your diet, this is a good starting point.

review/summary: Interesting Fiber Source
review/text: I have to say this is a much harder item to review than I thought it would be.  I couldn't find another chia product locally for comparison, for one thing, and I've never eaten chia before, only watered it on a "chia pet".  But as I'm in the midst of a major overhaul of my diet, it seemed an appropriate food product to try.<br /><br />I will admit I didn't not try the cereal recipe on the back of the package, mostly because it requires additional Nutiva products that I don't have on hand.  Given the slightly crunchy texture even after soaking, I also didn't add it to my nutritional shakes.  Instead, I added the seeds to my fresh-cooked rolled oats/ground flax seed/random fresh fruit daily breakfast.<br /><br />The seeds come out of the package nice and white and consistent in size and shape, which makes it an appealing add-on.  Instructions call for the seeds to be soaked in warm water for 10 minutes prior to consumption, so I experimented with pre-soaking and various cooking times in the microwave with and without the pre-soak.  The best bet seemed to be to add the raw seeds to the raw oats and raw ground flax, add a bit more water than normal as the seeds tend to soak it up, then nuke for 3 minutes on 50% in a 1000 kw (that's a very small) microwave.  That left a bit of crunch all around while still making the seeds soft enough to eat and digest.<br /><br />The fiber level makes this a great dietary addition, especially for those just starting a high-fiber cholesterol-lowering regimen.  It's not as high as ground flax seed, which can be a plus if you tend to be sensitive to changes in fiber intake.  The combination of a tablespoon of Chia and a tablespoon of flax (that's about half the usual amount of flax) with 1/3 cup of thick-cut rolled oats was really nice both in texture and flavor.  The Chia is a tad sweeter than the nutty flavor of the flax.<br /><br />Quality control on the product appears to be excellent and the zip-lock package is good enough, though it lost its zip pretty quickly.  I didn't find any artifacts of the processing in the package, which is always a plus and not always a given.  I'm going to continue to use this product, and I can honestly recommend it to my fellow cholesterol-battlers as a tasty fiber option.

review/summary: Really Glad I Tried Them Out
review/text: I first heard about Chia seeds from a co-worker and the first thing I though of what the Chia Pet. But the more I researched them, the better they sounded. Full of Omega 3 fatty acids, protein, fiber, and oil, these are the better than flax seeds, which you have to grind to get to the nutrients. They also hold a lot of water, which I was hoping would help me with hydration.<br /><br />The seeds are so small that you can add them to oatmeal, muffins, etc and not notice them. I really like the Chia jello. If you soak one tablespoon of seeds in water, they make a gel. I've drank the jello in mixed plan water and added it to tea or juice. I did find that if you put them in a mixture of grape juice and water they don't soak up much liquid.<br /><br />I noticed that if you drink this plain, I felt a little dehydrated. So I drank more water then felt bloated. I've learned you don't need much more than a tablespoon mixed in water. Any more and it gets overwhelming. What I like to do is drink my jello after eating breakfast. I stay full longer. It's been helping me by controlling my hunger for my dieting.<br /><br />The only drawbacks I've noticed is that they don't really help me with the hydration. They don't soak up as much water in a grape juice water mixture. And they cost about $11 for a 14-ounce bag. I find that a bit pricey but on the other hand, you are just using about one tablespoon a day, which comes out to about 28 days use out of one bag.<br /><br />In the end, I'm glad that I heard about Chia seeds and got to try them from the Vine Program. This is one thing that I'm going to be sure that I keep in stock.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: The almighty chia, but in a color that's easier to hide
review/text: So, I recently read the book Born to Run and was intrigued by the almost-magical properties that were attributed to this superfood, the chia seed. Even before reading that book I had some tucked away in my pantry because I had heard they were good for me, but that really caused me to start incorporating them into more of our meals.<br /><br />Chia seeds are loaded with omega's and protein and all kinds of good stuff. I've been using them any place that I would use flax seed, or flax seed meal: sprinkled on oatmeal, a couple tablespoons in a breakfast smoothie, or mixed in with homemade granola bars for added nutritional benefits. You can even use them as an egg substitute when you're baking by mixing 1/4 cup of water with 1 tsp ground chia seeds (just grind them in a coffee grinder). I am a huge fan of tapioca pudding and you can use these seeds to make a faux tapioca by soaking some of them in coconut milk and then mixing in some frozen blueberries and a little stevia to sweeten. SO good. If you google 'ways to use chia seeds' you will find dozens of ideas.<br /><br />This particular brand of chia seeds is well-priced and excellent quality. I love this 'white' version of the chia seeds because they are easier to hide in my kids' food! They aren't actually white, more of a light gray-taupe, but certainly less conspicuous than traditional black chia seeds.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again, although I think my two-bag supply from my last order will probably last me a while. Give them a try!

review/text: These seeds have a really mild taste. They don't taste like anything, really. I've sprinkled them on cereal and in yogurts, but I really prefer making my own chia fresca.  The seeds are very small and have the crunchy texture of raspberry seeds, which I don't like, so I find it easier to soak them and drink them. For a really quick chia fresca, you can simply soak a tablespoon of the seeds in a mixture of juice and water for fifteen minutes or even overnight. Just stir or shake them up a few times to reduce clumping. The seeds get very soft and soak up a lot of liquid, which reminds me of pulpy juice. I find that a lot easier to get them down, but you may prefer eating them dry! I haven't tried baking with them yet, but it seems like they would work better than flaxseed (my main go-to) as an egg replacer.

This chia-seed product is no less impressive, and I really like the packaging: recloseable bag plus a base that stands up on the countertop while you scoop it.<br /><br />Stirring a tablespoon of the seeds into oatmeal or a beverage of your choice (I tried cranberry-pomegranate juice) and allowing it to sit for a minute or two allows the seeds to soften and release their mucilaginous coating. I did not notice any alteration in taste of the juice or oatmeal when stirring in chia. They are pretty tasteless so you can put them into anything. They are divine sprinkled over just-out-of-the-oven cheese toast because they help add to that delicious crunch that perfectly made cheese toast has.<br /><br />Chia seeds have numerous health benefits, including having a higher level of omega-3 fatty acids than flax seeds while storing for long periods of time without going rancid like flax seeds do. Just google "chia health benefits" online and you'll find reams of information.<br /><br />These are the same type of seed that is used with Chia Pets. I've never had a Chia Pet, which grows chia-seed "hair," but there are good directions online for growing chia year-round as a microgreen using sprouting and wheatgrass-growing techniques. I'm interested in this use of Nutiva's chia seeds so we can get a little more fresh greens into us, but I haven't tried it yet. There are plenty of seeds in these two pouches to grow a lot of chia greens!<br /><br />Try them. You'll like them.

review/summary: Husband loves these
review/text: My husband eats oatmeal and fruit every morning at work. He took a bag of the Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds to work and puts 2 tsp. in his cereal every morning. He says it thickens his oatmeal just right. He loves it because he knows it is even more healthy with the seeds added.<br />The first thing he did when he opened the package was take out some seeds and before I could stop him, he ate them! Big mistake! Lol He said they tasted terrible. He won't make that mistake again. However they are great used in cooking. We are pleased with this product very much.

review/summary: Works Better Than I Expected
review/text: I'd read the stories about mountain trekkers who survived long days and grueling climbs on a handful of chia seeds, and I'd read about the nutritional value of chia.  Frankly, I was skeptical, but willing to try it to see for myself.  I'm no longer a skeptic.<br /><br />I stirred my two tablespoons of chia into fresh-squeezed juices of apple and pomegranate, rather than simply dropping it into water.  It was delightful, and although I had not blended it into a smoothy, the seeds were so small that they did not have any taste I could notice.<br /><br />The juice was good, the seeds not much of anything except creating a kind of gel, so why did I become a fan?  Something in this mundane drink really resonated with my body chemistry.  My energy level exploded -- even more the second than the first day.  Wow!<br /><br />Will it work as well for you?  I cannot say, but if you think your body needs a boost, I'd give it a try before I used the expensive energy drink.  I'm surely glad I did.<br /><br />FIVE STARS!

review/summary: Healthy But Limited Usage For Me
review/text: These tiny seeds really pack it in: Omega 3 fatty acid, protein, fiber, and rare antioxidants. But for me, there aren't enough ways to use them that I like.<br /><br />The most popular use for these seems to be to mix the seeds with water and make a gel. I'm not a fan of gelatinous textures so this has no allure for me. It also seems they would do the same for anything they were mixed into. They are also too small to eat from the bag, as they get stuck in my teeth. While I am glad I had the chance to try them, I won't be purchasing them.<br /><br />So why the five-star rating? The seeds are everything they claim to be. Just because I don't like them doesn't mean this is a bad product, and they don't deserve to be down-rated for that.

review/summary: OMG, the yummiest all time new, favorite, healthy treat. Check this recipe!
review/text: I have tried chia seeds before, but not quite sure what to do them. I never really knew what to do with them other than soaking in water and waiting for them grow on my Chia Pet, LMOA!!!<br /><br />I haverecently tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T80BYE">Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna, 15-Ounce (Pack of 2)</a> and then found this GREAT recipe with Chia seeds with the Manna. (BTW, the Coconut Manna is a delicious, nutritious "whole-food" that is completely yummy too!) Here is my own rendition of this great breakfast treat:<br /><br />Take 1 cup of POM juice(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YQ4SYW">Pomegranate Juice 6 X 16 Ounce Case</a>)and mix in 2 Tablespoon Chia and Hemp Seeds. Put it in a nice, toasty warm place (like your oven at 100 degrees or even better a food dehydrator). Put your jar of Manna in the toasty place at the same time. Leave them in there for 30 minutes - 2 hours. Stir-up you Manna and nuts, and then add a tablespoon of the best honey you can find. Add 1 tablespoon of Manna and enjoy this wonderful, healthy breakfast treat. (Make sure to stir your Manna well to mix in the oil and the coconut powder.) You can add in a chopped banana to enhance the experience.

review/summary: Just as good as the "black" chia seeds I eat
review/text: About six months ago I got turned on to adding chia seeds to my oatmeal and have been using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CGTN1I">Navitas Naturals Chia Seeds Aztec Superfood, 16 Ounce Pouch</a>.<br /><br />Chia seeds have no taste to me so they can be added to oatmeal, drinks, etc. without alterating the flavor of the food.  I use mine in oatmeal only.  They expand when added to liquid and become gelatinous.<br /><br />I tried these white chia seeds from Nutiva and they are no different in their taste, texture, or expansion ability compared to the ones I use now.  They are really not white, instead they are a pale sandy color with some brown ones thrown in.  This makes it easier to disguise in foods because the color is lighter.  The only difference besides the color between these "white" chia seeds and the black ones I eat periodically is the nutrition.<br /><br />According to the package, a serving size is one tablespoon at 60 calories with 25 from fat for these white chia seeds.  Calcium is 8%, Magnesium 10% and Iron 6% with 3 grams of protein, 5 grams of fiber and 2.5 grams of Omega 3s.  However, according to the package on the Navitas black chia seeds I also eat, a serving size is two tablespoons at 70 calories, 40 from fat. Calcium is 10% and Vitiman C is 4% with 3 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber but the package dosn't make any claims about the quantity of Omega 3s.<br /><br />To me, these chia seeds are as excellent as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CGTN1I">Navitas Naturals Chia Seeds Aztec Superfood, 16 Ounce Pouch</a> although these white chia seeds are easier to disguise in food. I would definitely purchase either product and would base my future purchases on its use and price.

review/summary: Love my CHIA....works perfectly in smoothies and salad dressing... so pleased with the product
review/text: UPDATE 6/6/12 : I have now been using this product for 6 months. I find it to be superior to other chia products I have purchased in the past.. I place the seeds in a lunch time smoothie nearly everyday.. It thickens the smoothie and I get the wonderful health benifits from it at the same time.. I will be and ongoing user.. of this product.. I recently learned to use this in making salad dressings thicker .. again adding nice omega 3's to the blend for even more health benefits..<br /><br />I have recently started a more healthy life style that includes consuming lots of good fruits and veggies.. my mid day meal is a large green smoothie that I added these chia seeds.. wow..  Super  addition to the meal..<br /><br /> Then found that if I made a chia gel  adding the seeds to water and wait for an hour until  gel forms  I am adding that to my own home made Almond milk.. What  a HUGE difference with the mouth feel and nutrition.. Increasing the protein as well as  fiber of my Almond Milk.. I am learning all the wonderful ways to use this product as a egg replacment in muffin baking..<br />Why has it taken me this long to find out about these great little seeds ???<br /><br />So with this great addition of chia seeds, I am on to a more healthful lifestyle .<br /><br />I was pleased to see 2 huge 14 ou. bags of White Chia seeds in my package... with CURRENT FRESHNESS DATES clearly labeled ... as well as expiration dates... My product is less than 6 weeks since picking.. Super FRESH... It is packed in a resealable package but I will be moving it into a air tight container for long term and daily use..<br /><br /> AND PROMINENTLY LABELED........NON GMO ...HURRAY.... I love that....<br /><br />will be repurchasing this product for sure.

review/summary: Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds
review/text: These chia seeds seem to be of very good quality and have a very nice, neutral flavor that is slightly nutty when eaten. Like all raw chia seeds they do swell and stick when wet which makes a gel that can be added to recipes. They are relatively high in calories making them good for a high energy snack.

They are filled with all sorts of good stuff - just google "chia seeds" and you will find out how great they are for you. This is the stuff that superman eats to get his super powers (just kidding)... but seriously, this is a great product and Nutiva has fashionably packaged it, seperating the white seeds into a reclosable bag, so that you can use them for baking, smoothies, puddings, or just by themselves. I HIGHLY recommend this product if you want to work on getting healthier.

Healthy & tastes good, too!.<br /><br />These seeds add a nice extra crunch to your salads. They take up the dressing and taste nice. Try toasting the seeds for extra flavour and crispiness in salads. Added nutrition can be tasty & interesting, not a punishment.  Can sprinkle these on in place of croutons.<br /><br />A good weight loss supplement as well.

review/text: Until few days ago, I hadnt heard of chia seeds and now I see that this product from Aztecs is better than the best like salmon for omega 3 fatty acids. Well its hard to know if all of that is true, we have to take the experts word for it. As a product, I first tried a tbsp of it in a glass of cold water. Let it absorb some water. I gulped some water down and hey they are harmless. If the thought of letting gelly stuff go down your throat sounds difficult, go on take a bite, you will find that it is much like a skinny sesame seed. Even if it acts like a placebo, our body will self induce the goodness we think we are feeding it. I will try to make a chia pet and also have the seeds in my oatmeal and report more observations.

review/summary: Teddy Graham's Competition
review/text: I wanted to try these as a slightly healthier alternative to Teddy Grahams.  These are organic and have a few less ingredients.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />With three flavors of "bunnies" you get a medley that is kind of nice.  However, only the chocolate ones have enough flavor to even compare to a Teddy Graham.  The chocolate chip has a very, very mild chocolate flavor, but isn't too bad.  The honey flavor is pretty bland.  Honey Teddy Grahams have more flavor, so I'd choose them over plain honey bunnies.<br /><br />TEXTURE:<br />These bunnies get stale very fast.  Seal them up well, or you'll have bad tasting bunnies.  Fresh, they're crispy and crunchy and a great size for on-the-go snacking or sitting at your computer with a cup of coffee and these little cookies.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION<br />I do like the organic factor.  However, they're generally a little more money than their competing Teddies, and I like Teddy flavor better.  It's up to you and your taste buds, but I would at least recommend trying the bunnies.  I buy them when they're on sale for cheaper than Teddies.

review/text: Ok, I have to say, the packaging did draw me in... I mean, how could the little hippy bunny flashing you a peace sign steer you wrong?  So I picked up the box...organic, I like that, 8 grams of sugar, I can live with that, no trans or saturated fats, 20% calcium, 2 grams of fiber, and I can have 28 little cookies (a combo of chocolate, honey & chocolate chip) for 130 calories.  So, the bunnies and I went home together....<br /><br />These are my favorite little cookies when I want something sweet but don't want to obliterate all the good eating that I did all day.  Yeah, they are a cookie, but I felt good that I could eat organic and that there were no additives or preservatives.  I like to keep mine in the fridge where they stay nice and cold and crunchy and just wait for me to pair it with a glass of milk.<br /><br />Great snack for the little ones as well as those of us who are young at heart!

review/summary: Delicious and great for kids!
review/text: In my ongoing effort to provide healthy snacks to the children in my son's class (he goes to a public elementary school), I try various organic finger foods. One of the things that has boggled my mind is the amount of graham crackers that contain trans fat- and they are marketed as healthy! When I saw these, I was pleasantly surprised- I didn't imagine I'd see an organic AND trans fat free graham cracker product.<br /><br />Not only are these free of trans fats AND high fructose corn syrup (which is typical of organic products, thankfully) but they are absolutely delicious. I love snacking on them and the kids in my son's class loved them! I went ahead and used the subscribe-and-save feature for this product and now his class has a steady supply of healthy and yummy snacks. :)

review/summary: Mylar balloon flavored graham crackers.
review/text: I am a fan of this brand, but was extremely disappointed when I tried the Bunny Graham Friends. I noticed immediately upon opening the brand new box that there was a strange odor. I proceeded to open the metallic bag, and almost instantly correlated the smell with that of a mylar balloon (those metallic helium balloons). Sadly, the graham snacks were impregnated with the smell and taste as well. I'm all for "green" packaging and such, and realize the hidden dangers of plastic packaging, but surely there is another way to package these without ruining the flavor or earth. I will, however, continue to buy the macaroni and other products from this line, but I will never waste my money on this item again.

review/summary: Bunny Grahams
review/text: These bunny shaped graham snacks are really good. They are made from whole grain, are all natural, and are a good source of calcium - 20% RDA per serving. All three flavors in this pack, the honey, chocolate and chocolate chip, are delicious.

review/summary: Taste and smell horrible
review/text: I've tried these before and liked them  buty the boxes I received smelled and tasted rotten or sort of like how paint smells. I think this batch has gone bad or something. And I'm disappointed that I wasted my money. These are going in the garbage it's not safe to eat. So gross.

review/summary: No one liked these.
review/text: All my children are vegetarian, and have been there entire life. I thought these snacks would be a good choice. It is hard to find varieties of foods for kids that don't have junk in them. I gave mymiddle daughter these as a snack for school. When she got home I asked why she had not eaten them. She said "I don't like them mommy. " I then tried them and was like yuck. I felt bad that my kids tried them. I then made it a joke letting others try them and seeing their reactions. So far NO ONE has liked them.

review/summary: Best Ever
review/text: These little tasty bunnies are guilt free! They are the best low calorie healthy snack. They are mostly organic, and melt in your mouth! However, make sure the dates are not expired! No preservatives to keep them fresh. They are very difficult to find in stores, but AMAZON always has them!

review/summary: Awesome kid snack
review/text: My two toddler boys LOVE all the Annie's Bunnies (Friends, individuals, cheddar, and gummies).  They are super yummy and are a smart snack choice as they are all-natural.  I LOVE Amazon, but can buy Annies' cheaper in the large box at Target, and in individual bags at Costco.

review/text: These Bunny Grahams taste terrible. I really hoped my kids would love them because they are organic, but I couldn't even eat them. We threw them all away. They taste like cardboard and also smell like cardboard. I don't know what everyone else is trying and why their reviews are so positive but these are TERRIBLE.

review/summary: Unique in flavor, albeit tasty
review/text: This product was attractive to me as it is somewhat lower in fat (that is, relative to most of the Asian or Sub-continent "meals ready to eat"). While the package states "masala", it actually has its own distinctive, tasty flavor. I'm just not enough of an expert on any of the authentic cusines to say where this one belongs.  It does belong on our pantry shelf though! It may not have enough spice for some.

review/summary: Tasty and quick
review/text: Surprisingly good for a prepared Indian dish.  The tofu disappears into the spices, as it should, providing texture but not asserting itself in the mix.  There is a little heat -- eaten by itself instead of on rice or bread, this might count as medium (heat) spiciness.  The rest of the flavors are very good, and the ease of preparation can hardly be beaten.  I dump the contents into a bowl to microwave, though the pouch itself is designed to be microwavable.  It gets extra credit for having a good balance of fat, carbs, fiber, and protein.  Sodium level seems about average for a pre-prepared entree.

review/summary: Good, more of a meal than most TB Entrees
review/text: For easy, ready to heat Indian food, the Tasty Bite "Entrees" are almost all good.  This one is thicker and has chunks of ingredients, where most are soupy and good only as a sauce.  I find all the flavors spicy enough, and a bit salty, although probably no more than average for prepared foods.  I serve them over rice, potatoes, chick peas and/or spinach.
