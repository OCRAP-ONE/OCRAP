review/summary: good if you are not allergic to chamomile
review/text: Yogi Tea's Woman's Moon Cycle tea could be a lifesaver for you, as it has for so many reviewers here. Personally, I don't like the flavor very much, and for me I find that it doesn't mitigate my symptoms much, either. Your Mileage May Vary, naturally. For a long time I was having a cup every morning, thinking of it as a daily tune-up; maybe I built up a tolerance...? I ran out of the Woman's Moon Cycle and started relying just on the Yogi's Ginseng tea, which includes Dong Quai but not the raspberry leaf that is supposed to be such a help for women (I have a horse-owning friend who says it works on mares, too!!), and I haven't noticed much difference in how I feel.<br /><br />Finally, some people may not realize that they are allergic to chamomile. It's a common traditional "relax and sooth" ingredient, and is in a lot of teas (it's also what Peter Rabbit's mother gave him after his adventures with Mr. McGregor!). For the people who felt nauseated using this tea, or find it has a laxative effect, that may be an allergic reaction.<br /><br />I would love to find something that really does help with the water retention and the hyper-sensitive emotions that come at different times in my cycle. For me, this tea is not it. Blessings on all of you who get such benefit from it!

review/summary: I like it but my body hate it
review/text: The first time i had it I was put off by the aroma of the ginger. I hate ginger but the tea had a good, spicy taste. The downside? My cycle had been normal up until this point but after drinking it this month my period is 4 days early :( and I'm not happy about it. Parsley is an emmanogague and is the last ingredient on the list. Vitex can also mess up the cycles when they are normal. With a sensitive body I guess the parsley combined with the other herbs caused me to ovulate earlier in my cycle thus bringing down an earlier period. It took years to make my cycles normal and I was using this to manage the PMS and pain I get associated with my moon. Will not be using again :( 3stars for the sake of someone else's luck with it because I know I'm out of the ordinary.

review/text: This herbal tea is huge aid in reducing symptoms of pms.  I started using this years ago and was buying it from the local health food store for about five dollars per box.  I used it a week before my cycle and then every day during.  It made an immediate and very noticeable improvement.  My husband bought it for me when I started running low.  He noticed that I wasn't the witch I used to be when I drank the tea.  I make sure to keep this stuff on hand all of the time now.  Another thing I also drink is fresh lemon balm tea which also helps very much.

review/text: My PMS has gradually worsened over the last several years to the point where I really only have one good week a month. I was desperate for something to help control mood swings, breast tenderness, etc. and make me feel normal again or at least not so grouchy. This tea has done it! My breast tenderness is nearly gone and I feel normal, happy, and am a more pleasant wife to my dear husband! We both are very happy with this tea. (I drink 2 cups per day two weeks prior to my period and increase it for the week prior).

review/summary: This tea keeps me from bloating....awesome tea!!!
review/text: I am doing my natural thing and not buying any overcounter medications and I am not on any presc. meds. I know when I use to be on my period I used to take a motrin or midol. I had headaches and bad cramps, the medication did take some pain away but not all you know it just suppress the pain.<br /><br />Well, ladies I have came across this tea, and I have to tell you, it took all my pain away. I know everyone's body is different so it might worked differently for others, but I know for me it worked. I know my body and I feel a difference no bloating. I loved it some much I ordered the 6 boxes. As for my husband he couldn't understand why I needed that much tea but it would be for his sake if I kept the tea in the house or all hell will break loose. For me the tea me had going to the bathroom, fleshing my system out, the way midol or pamprin would do but without the medication.<br /><br />So if you want to try something natural for pms or cramps I say buy one box and try it out, it is so worth it. I know I drink like 3 cups of day a couple days before my period and when I am on my period. I love this tea!! Enjoy!!

review/summary: A must have during your moon cycle!
review/text: Really works! This is a well researched and well balanced combination of herbs. The key ingredients are red raspberry leaf (amazing), dong quai and vitex - all great women herbs. Also included is calming chamomile and warming cinnamon & ginger. You might need to use 2 tea bags and drink fairly frequently but its indespensable. Its also worth exploring their plain <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3SFK">Yogi Woman's Raspberry Leaf, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> - not as tasty but very powerful.

review/summary: Tea works wonders, but I hate the smell & taste
review/text: I ordered this tea to help with bad periods. I have painful cramps and I feel very prone to migraines throughout the week of my period. I recently drank about 2 teas a day during the week of my period, and it really helped. I can tell when I feel prone to migraines, my head/scalp, neck and left eye feel a certain way and I can just feel I need to be careful or I'll get one. I always feel very close to getting a migraine during the week of my period. Drinking the 2 cups of this tea each day this week has done wonders, it greatly diminished or totally got rid of my pre-migraine symptoms, and I had virtually no cramps as well. The only drawback is I really dislike the taste of the tea and the smell. I think it's the fennel in it. So I just try to chug it down and eat something afterwards to remove the taste.

If I don't take this tea I'm irritable, have severe mood swings, cramps and sometimes even fever during the days leading up to my cycle. Taking this tea daily 1 1/2 weeks before my scheduled time eliminates the moods, the headache/fever, the cramps, everything! It also helps in the cleansing process itself. No side effects and no harm to your system make this tea a MUST. I'm buying another box :)

review/text: I discovered this product a couple of years ago and I've been hooked.  I get the worst cramps every month, so bad that I have to take advil even though I hate taking anything for pain.<br /><br />As long as I start drinking this tea 3-4 days before my period, all is good!  My period arrives on time and the pain is gone or tolerable enough that I don't have to take advil.  I go through a whole box that time of the month b/c you have to drink it all day for a few days before/during your period to make sure you stay ahead of the pain.<br /><br />If you get horrible PMS, bloating, cramps or headaches before/during your period, I highly recommend you try this product before taking pain killers.

review/summary: Cramps be gone
review/text: I am not a fan of tea. I do not normally drink the stuff, any flavor, any type, for any symptom. BUT, I am now a believer. This tea is amazing. I suffer from severe cramps (Yes, I do cry because of it.. I even sometimes ask my sister to punch me in the stomach so that it would take away from the pain!). I have tried prescription pain medication and birth control to alleviate my pain. The prescription pain meds always made me sleepy (which is terrible while I'm at work, or need to drive) and for personal reasons I am not on birth control at the moment. When I wasn't taking either, I would take between 6-10 ibuprofen each day for the first 2 days of my cycle. Don't get me wrong, I still have to take it, but not nearly as much. So far, I have only drank the tea during the cycle, usually about 5 bags each day. I have done this for the past 3 months. But, I am going to start drinking it throughout the month... I'm hoping it will help the initial monstrous pain I get when my cycle decides to surprise me.<br />Also - you can't beat the subscribe and save price. I was paying $30+tax (for 6 boxes) before I found it here!

review/text: As I write this, I am doubled over with pain and so nauseated I can barely keep from throwing up.  I am on my third cup of tea.  Yesterday I had four, and before that I had two, then two again on the day before that.  So I can say with absolute assurance that it does not work for me.  Please don't waste your money on this product if you have debilitating cramps each month, because this tea will not so much as "take off the edge."  It seems only those women who are lucky enough to have "minor aches and pains" each month will find relief from their symptoms with this tea.

review/summary: It Doesn't Get Much Better
review/text: As a long-time green tea (and coffee) drinker, I was much pleased with this Genmaicha Tea.  The brown rice is roasted sufficiently and in sufficient quantity to give a nice balance to the green tea, both sharpening the flavor while sweetening it a bit.  But don't get confused: it is not a "sweet" tea.  The brown rice gives the tea a sense of "hops" as one would find in a quality brown beer.  If you are a fan of the style of Genmaicha tea, I heartily recommend trying this brand.  I'll be back for more!

review/summary: My review of this product
review/text: Butter finger candy bars are a time honored classic. Other than snickers, there is no better tasting candy bar IMO. You really can't go wrong whenever you order your favorite candy via Amazon. The main reason people buy foodstuff like this on the web is to buy in bulk and perhaps save yourself a little money. You can also save on gas because buying like this keeps you from making repeated, short trips to the local, around the corner convenience store in search of your favorite candy bar. Amazon is always good and I did save a few bucks by buying two cartons. I actually purchased these for my mother and not myself so she should have enough to last her for awhile.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment I had with this is the seller took too long to get the item to me via FedEX. They should have shipped USPS. Only use FedEX and UPS for expedited shipping. If you wanna keep the shipping charges down to a min. and get the item AQAP, always ship USPS.

review/text: Was craving these as the vending machine downstairs at work only stocks them occasionally. Wish they were sold in stores. So had to resort to finding them on Amazon. They arrived quickly and in great condition. Hopefully I can make them last over a month before I'm forced to reorder more. Nom nom nom.

review/summary: Not bad at all...
review/text: With the apparent demise of Red Bull cola (or at least reduced availability..) I've been looking for an alternative with similar taste, and I was hoping Flatt cola would be a reasonable replacement.  On a whim, I ordered the 16-pack.<br />Well, it honestly exceeded my expectations. Nice crisp, lightly spicy flavor, great design on the can & packaging, and good energy supplement content. If you're looking for a Coke or Pepsi clone, this isn't it.. but if you want something that tastes unique with the added benefit of an energy drink, give it a try.  Highly recommended.

review/text: The product is great.  It gives you a boost and is very smooth tasting, unlike some energy colas.  It actually has less of a syrup taste than I am used to, but that is definitely not a bad thing.  The one and only negative aspect is the size of the can.  At 8.5 ounces, it is gone within minutes.  But, I guess they marketed it that way so that you will buy more.  Not a bad strategy from a marketing standpoint.

review/summary: FLATT broke without the substance
review/text: A decent product though the price is extremely high for 16 cans shaped like the smallest cans of Red Bull (a fairly overpriced and overhyped energy drink) and relatively speaking has similar quantities of caffeine vs a regular can of Coke if you are only getting 2/3rds liquid volume.<br /><br />This cola drink is $1.50 each can and the lack of info on it sort of was of concern, and that it is a small 8.4 ounce can.<br /><br />For awhile I was getting good deals on Red Bull Cola. This was a result of people in America discovering that Red Bull Cola contained de-alkalyzed (the alkaline being "cocaine" extracted) coca leaves, they stopped buying it--or at least--Red Bull stopped selling it on the market. In fact to most people's ignorance all Coca Cola still has a small(er) amount of de-alkalyzed coca leaves (though they will vehemently deny this, just like they denied ever producing Fanta Orange so that the embargos of cola bean (and coca leaves) from South America would not impede their sale of product to Nazi Germany, and so that they could also advertise for the Nazi Jugen.) Anyway the drug supply ran out and I was getting itchy for some substance; maybe the drinks had hints of alkaline after all and I wasn't feeling it with this one.<br /><br />Decent and it reminds me of the same spirit from Howling Monkey Cola; I was also a little dissapointed that Rockstar Cola wasn't being produced in mass quantities and seems to have stopped.

review/text: When I first tried this product, I wasn't thrilled...the sauce was a bit gritty and clumpy...and REALLY strong.<br /><br />But I've found the solution.  Add extra dairy substitute (I use unsweetened rice milk) to thin the sauce out a bit and stir CONSTANTLY to prevent clumping.  Add 1/2 a bag of frozen peas to the pasta when cooking...and then once it's completed...refrigerate it overnight, and microwave the next day.  That is the secret.  The sauce has time to rest and becomes creamy and develop a mild, cheesy flavor.  I really recommend this!

review/summary: Excellent for children and adults with dairy allergies!
review/text: My son is highly dairy allergic and this is the ideal way for him to eat "mac and cheese", while the other kids at daycare eat the original version. We use unsweeted rice milk and the recipe works perfectly. To bolster the nutritional content, although it is already a healthy product, add any kind of frozen vegetables to the cooking water when you make the shells. Our whole family has gone to a very low level of dairy consumption because of my son's allergy, so we don't eat many cheese products and aren't comparing this to Kraft or Annie's (we've never even tried them). If you eat it hoping it will taste just like what you are used to, you may be disappointed. This product has a lot of flavor, is healthy, and has a nice consistency. We have all come to enjoy it. I feel so fortunate that there are products like this and like Sunbutter (another favorite) that give kids who have allergies similar choices for common "kid foods". Plus,the company is also very Earth-friendly and there is no better price that I have found than this one!

review/text: We've been making and using the macaroni and chreese products for years. The Shells & Chreese is our favorite. When my kids were teens, they could make this for themselves. Now that my son is at college, I send him a case of these at least once a semester, because he can make these easily at school. When I make it, I add a bit extra milk and a small amount (1/2 - 1 teaspoon) of Earth Balance margarine for flavor. This is easy to make and tastes great. Very convenient.

review/summary: I'm addicted to this stuff
review/text: I don't eat dairy, so I miss out on the convenience of certain pasta meals that often come in blue boxes. They may be not super nutritious, but they're easy comfort food, and this is a great alternative. Okay, so Chreese doesn't really taste like cheese. But it does taste very good in its own right. The flavor is sort of a nutritional yeasty, garlicky, salty yumminess.  Maybe it's because I really like nutritional yeast, or because it's been years since I had real cheese, but whatever the reason, I LOVE Chreese. I also love that this product isn't too shabby in the nutritional department, with 14 grams of protein and 7 grams of fiber per serving, plus B12 (25% RDV), and iron (15%). Definitely worth trying if you avoid dairy.  There is an equally delicious version made with whole wheat pasta if you want a bit more fiber (or prefer your noodles elbow-shaped): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZEO6">Road's End Organics Mac & Chreese, Organic, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Easy to prepare, good texture and filling
review/text: I love this product.  After making my homemade versions of mac and cheese-less sauces and coming up with mediocre results and spending more time in the kitchen than I wanted to spend, this product is a dream come true.  My son is 11 and once he latches onto something he likes it's hard to convince him to change to something else.  At his age health reasons are no motivation to avoid dairy.  We're both lactose intolerant but can 'get away with' some dairy.  I'm vegan, but he'll still eat some dairy cheese pizza and mac and cheese on ocassion.  I continually try to come up with alturnatives, but when the cheese versons are so quick and easy and frankly taste better, it's a constant battle.  Until we found this product.  He claims it's as good if not better than the cheese versions (Amy's or Trader Joe's) and actually likes that it's creamier and more filling than those cheese-based brands.  I don't know how the reviewers (with fewer stars) prepaired theirs, but we used Almond Breeze unsweetened milk and put a little more than the recommended amount of 1/2 cup, maybe 3/4 cup, and it made it smoother and less sticky.  Using a wire wisk might help too, to mix the sauce before adding the pasta.  Then we added alttle sea salt and pepper and some Vegan Grated Topping by Galaxy Nutritional Foods.  Yum.  My son can prepare it himself and I can feel good about the ingredients.<br />I'm happily ordering a new case of 12 boxes...  Oh, and they're also extremely lightweight and convenient to toss in your bag and take along with you when you travel to visit non-veg family.

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: I'm vegan and have been craving some yummy mac n cheese for some time. After reading such good reviews about Amy's frozen vegan mac n cheese, I couldn't wait to get my hands on some. However, when I finally did try it I was pretty disappointed in the artificial taste and ooey gooey (in a bad way) texture. This is coming from someone who normally likes Daiya cheese. WTH?<br /><br />A week or so later, I saw this Mac & Chreese at my local Wholefoods and despite feeling really skeptical after my last experience, I bought some.<br /><br />For the milk, I used plain, unsweetened almond milk and a bit of earth balance butter and an extra special ingredient, mustard! Just a little gives a very cheddary taste. I was surprised! It seemed a bit garlicy, but I didn't mind, I like garlic! I'm craving it again right now. Next time I might try it baked with extra cheese and bread crumbs.<br /><br />As for the texture, it was pretty spot on for me. Very cheesy. Also, it's WAY cheaper than Amy's icky mac. Yay!

review/summary: LOVE IT
review/text: I am vegan and although I don't crave other types of cheese, I absolutely LOVE this mac 'n cheese alternative.  I highly recommend adding more soy/rice milk than the 1/4 cup the package instructs you to add... I use at least twice that, plus a little melted Earth Balance, and I stir vigorously with a whisk (as with any powdered sauce, this is critical to avoid clumping).  It's important to let the sauce cook until it turns yellow - if it's still peachy in color, it's not done.  Anyway, aside from needing more liquid than the box calls for, this is pretty  much perfect as is.  I sometimes add a bit of salt, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's great with frozen veggies added.  I add broccoli or peas.  It's healthy and natural and so easy to make, I eat this for lunch with my 10-month old son all the time - he loves to eat it and to hear the sauce squishing in his little fingers.  :-)  Btw, I ate this CONSTANTLY when I was pregnant - a super easy protein source which I could fatten up by adding extra Earth Balance if I was craving fat.  I'm not sure omnivores would be impressed by this product, but if you're vegan or allergic to dairy, give it a shot.  I can't get enough of it!  I'm on the Amazon subscription service now!!!

review/summary: Excellent Cheese Alternative for the Dairy Allergic  or Vegan
review/text: If you are used to macaroni and cheese, this product is not for you, but if you have a dairy allergy or are vegan and long for a cheese substitute - this fits the bill.  The sauce is a cheese-like consistency but does not contain milk protein of any kind.  It is based on nutritional yeast.  The taste is different from cheese but quite good.  If you have allergies in the family, or are vegan this is a quick and tasty meal.<br /><br />Road's End also makes some gluten free varieties and the chreese sauce mix is sold separately.

review/summary: So-so
review/text: I'm a vegan and have prepared a couple different homemade "mac and cheeze" recipes at home, and all of them ended up in the trash. I saw this at Whole Foods today and thought I'd give it a shot. Those who say it has a very strange odor and/or taste probably aren't familiar with nutritional yeast, which is one of the main ingredients and what makes it so strong-smelling. I added about 3/4 cup unsweetened plain soy milk and 1 1/2 tablespoons of organic Smart Balance (lower calorie earth balance, also vegan). I cooked the sauce in a separate sauce pan and added it to the drained pasta after it had cooked and thickened a bit. I also added maybe 1/2 teaspoon of mustard. Sauce was very creamy, but not big on flavor really. I ended up adding salt, cayenne pepper, and after all else failed, threw in maybe 1/3 cup of pepperjack daiya (don't usually buy that stuff either so it was lucky I did today!). After the addition of a little Daiya it was really good. It was relatively cheap for being a vegan cheeze product, I think like $2.00 or so. I will probably buy it from time to time, but I can't give something that came in a box a 5 star review when I had to add so much to it (and change the cooking instructions!) This is probably great for vegan/extremely lactose intolerant kids who haven't ever really had the Kraft stuff. Definitely better than the real thing nutritionally (well maybe not after I was done with it...).

I use almond milk in mine to make the sauce I pour a little in over medium heat and stir the cheeze mix until it has broken up and creates a thick sauce.  Then I add the pasta back in stir it up and the last item I add is a little Daiya cheeze mix it up really good and you have oh so cheezy mac and cheeze.

If you've never had nutritional yeast, give it a try!!

review/summary: Much Better Than I Thought It Would Be!
review/text: I recently became a Vegan, and I am trying to stay away from soy products.  I absolutely love macaroni and cheese, and thanks to the new Vegan 'cheese' DAIYA [...]) I am so glad I can have it.  But unless I have time to melt the DAIYA myself with butter, plain rice milk, yadda yadda, I wished I could just whip it up quick like in my old Annie's macaroni and cheese days.  Well, went to Whole Foods a few days ago and happened to notice this stuff on the shelf.  Reading the ingredients, i was glad to see it did not contain soy, and some of the ingredients were similar to what is in DAIYA.  I bought 2 boxes and eagerly awaited trying it.  So, made it tonight with 1/2 cup organic plain Rice Dream, and 1 TB soy-free Earth Balance spread.  My husband spit it out.  But he is FAR from being a vegetarian or a vegan, so take it with a grain of salt, lol.  However, my three little mac and cheese addicts (meaning my 3 little boys age 3, 5, and 7), loved it.  By the time I served myself some, it was cold so I put it on a paper plate and zapped it for 50 seconds.  Well, guess what?  Zapping it made the sauce thicken into a rich texture (without zapping it was thin/watery), and I LOVED LOVED LOVED it.  It even tasted kinda like a light cheddar cheese!  I still prefer DAIYA over any vegan cheese alternative out there, BUT this company's version of 'cheese' is a close second.  I will definitely buy more!!

review/text: The most distinct thing about this product is the odor of the cheese sauce.  Mixing it with my favorite soy based milk, it had a very strong smell to it; and frankly the smell wasn't a very good one.  But, not being one to waste food, I was set on trying it anyways.<br /><br />The taste...  is unique.  It's nowhere near as strong as the smell was, but it does make an impression.  I really don't have the words to describe what exactly the taste is, but I can understand how people would spit it out if they tasted it.  I wouldn't label it disgusting, but I didn't find the taste to be all that good.  I did eat the entire box, and will eventually eat the other 11 boxes, but I probably won't be ordering anymore of this brand.

review/summary: Very good if you prepare it well!!
review/text: I've prepared it a few ways.. and it's been great to blah.  But if I prepare it the great way it's consistantly great!  I mix 1/2 cup of unsweetened almond milk with the powder package in a seperate small pot and make sure it's well mixed together with a whisk.  Once the shells are ready, drained and rinsed I pour them in and blend it with the sauce well.  I also add about 1.5 tablespoons of earth balance vegan buttery stick and heat it on medium-low for about 2 minutes till the sauce is thick enough it sticks to the shells well but not too thick.<br /><br />Anyways, whenever I make it that way it's a hit!<br /><br />I tried it with unsweetened almond milk, original rice milk and coconut milk beverage and the unsweetened almond was best by far.  & the vegan buttery stick makes it more creamy.

review/text: I am well-versed in all things dairy-free. I eat tons of dairy replacements, most of them quite good substitutes. This is by far the worst tasting substitute I've had. It doesn't come close to replicating any kind of cheesy flavor. It's a bit like peppery cardboard and smells like vomit.<br />Use your dairy free budget and "splurge" on the Amy's frozen Vegan Mac & Chreeze. MUCH better.

review/text: I recently admitted to myself that I'm lactose intolerant, but I don't want to completely give up on mac and cheese in a box. I found this at Whole Foods and decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />The pasta itself is good. I like the tiny shells. And I got the sauce to its proper consistency. It looks very appetizing when done right. However, it tastes disgustingly bland. There's no cheese flavor whatsoever. It's like liquified garlicky cardboard mixed in with pasta. I feel like throwing it up, even though there's technically nothing in it my body can't tolerate. Ugh.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QTZ2RS">Green Mountain Southern Sweet Perfect Iced Tea, 22-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a><br /><br />I'm a TRUE Georgia Girl!! I know how sweet southern ice tea should taste. Well this Chick is no longer in Dixie. I've been searching for the perfect sweet tea for the past 5 yrs. Anyone who has made southern sweet tea the old school way, knows that it takes a lot of time to get the consistency just right. Once that's done the tea goes fast, thus the cycle continues. This tea is awesome!! Keurig makes it easy! Just keep in mind the K-cup is not REALLY sweet. Southerners call the tea itself "SWEET" not because of the suger but because of a particular taste. (This is a hard point to get across if you are not accustomed to drinking many different sweet teas down south) I use a glass pitcher, fill a fourth of the pitcher with sugar, then fill the entire pitcher with hot boiling water. Stir with a long spoon...(careful it will be HOT) until the water is completely clear. It's what we call a SIMPLE SYRUP down south. Before you brew your K-Cup, drop a splash of simple syurp in your glass or over your ice. The Sweet Perfect Ice Tea will then truely be PERFECT! FYI: If you live up north like I do and crave ice tea all year round...You'd better stock up on your K-cups by end of summer. The company considers the GREEN MOUNTAIN SOUTHERN SWEET PERFECT ICE TEA a seasonal item, (the NERVE!!) making them almost impossible to get in the winter and tripple the cost!!!! Enjoy!!!

review/summary: can never have enough of this
review/text: This beverage has just the right amount of sweetness and taste.  It's not overbearing like most bottled teas and it is probably better for you than traditional soft drinks.<br /><br />Here three quick tips to keep in mind for best results.<br />1.  Put plenty of ice in your glass before brewing<br />2.  Be sure and stir the tea before drinking<br />3.  You may want to add a bit of ice after brewing<br /><br />As with any beverage you will have to experiment with different amounts of ice to find the amount that works best for you.<br /><br />A quick note about Amazon's wonderful customer service.  I recently ordered some of this tea and the box was all bent and some of the k-cups were slightly damaged.  I contacted Amazon customer service via email and with in less than one hour they emailed me back.  They told me to keep the tea and refunded my money.<br /><br />thanks Amazon

review/text: This is an excellent tea.  However, if you are expecting the delicious, "put me in a diabetic coma" southern-style sweet tea, this isn't quite it. It's sweet, but not southern-sweet.  That is easily rectified by a splash or two of simple syrup and voila!  It becomes the sweet tea we love.  What I do like about this tea is that it meets the taste demographics of both those who simply want a sweetened iced tea, and with a little addition, a delicious southern-style sweet tea.  Great job to those who designed this one.

review/summary: Sweet and lightly spicy iced tea for k-cup summers
review/text: Is this an authentic Southern sweet tea. No. And, so what? Green Mountain/Celestial Seasonings K-cups are a delicious summer beverage for Keurig owners.<br /><br />My wife purchased a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B40 Elite Gourmet</a> last Christmas. I was reluctant at first to switch from our stainless steel French press but we have now tried more than a dozen coffee blends. The wide range of roasts and flavors available are impressive.<br /><br />This is our first iced tea k-cup. Following the directions produces a strong glass of black tea over crushed ice with just a hint of spice (although the only flavored ingredients listed are evaporated cane juice and black tea). I find I like the tea even better if I let the mixture sit for five minutes before I start to drink it.<br /><br />One serving is 70 calories and contains caffeine. The exact ingredients are: evaporated cane juice, black tea, rebiana (sweetner from stevia) and tricalcium phosphate (a natural free flow agent). Personally, I don't add more sugar (not necessary) but I garnished a glass with fresh lemon.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars<br /><br />Green Mountain/Celestial Seasonings also offers k-cup iced teas - specially designed to brew directly over ice - in the following flavors:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DWYXPU">Sweet Peach Black Perfect Iced Tea</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DWYXSC">Sweet Lemon Black Perfect Iced Tea</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036SNKZ0">Sweetened Raspberry Perfect Iced Tea</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M60630">Black Unsweetened Perfect Iced Tea</a><br /><br />BTW: During the summer, I drink mainly unsweetened ice tea, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ATZOAQ">House Mugicha</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017SZTR8">Ito En Golden Oolong</a> but when the mood hits me, I'll look for a sweet tea. Until I found Celestial Seasonings k-cup, I favored <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RBQ0ZA">Sweet Leaf Tea, Original Sweet Tea</a>. I recommend all of these iced teas.

I love iced tea and Keurig, but I usually like a less sweet tea, so I have to admit to being skeptical when I popped that Celestial Seasonings Southern Sweet Tea K-Cup into my Keurig.  I needn't have worried!  I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the iced tea this brews.  I used the 6 oz setting to get a stronger tea flavor, and this K-Cup delivered exactly that.  It has a nice strong black tea flavor, and it is lightly sweet, not at all overpoweringly sweet like I was expecting.  Pop a slice of lemon in there and you've got the perfect glass of sweet iced tea in less than a minute!

review/text: *SAMPLE SUPPLIED BY MANUFACTURER*<br /><br />This is the better deal at 86 cents per glass(including shipping)  as opposed to the packages offering less quantities.<br /><br />This product is a robust tea with just enough sweetness to keep most people happy.  Oddly enough the taste is almost that of a honey being used to sweeten the tea instead of refined sugar.  Rich  tea flavor and bold enough to withstand the watering down that can sometimes seems to happen when you use the Keuring for making iced products.<br /><br />I love this product. I've been down south and have had true 'southern sweet tea' and this comes close.  As a matter of fact the tea I used to get down in Georgia and Tennessee was somewhat too sweet for my taste.  I used to have to cut it with some unsweetened to keep my taste buds happy.<br /><br />You may be able to find this elsewhere for less but I've been finding that those places are usually sold out during the height of the summer and don't carry the iced teas in the winter.  With Amazon it seems that you may be assured to be able to get it whenever you're craving it.

review/text: This tea tastes pretty good. As a tea lover I think it could be a little stronger, as it doesn't have a very strong flavor (though I do use my cups twice to fill a small pitcher). It is sweetened with sugar (18g per k-cup, I think) and stevia. I'm not a big fan of artificial sweeteners but I'd much rather it be stevia than another toxic chemical sweetener. There is no foreign after taste, which makes it more agreeable. If you like sweet iced tea and you are willing to use stevia, I recommend this product.

I lived in the south for a period of time and I've certainly tasted sweeter.  Its more a half sweet tea, half unsweet tea but it makes just the perfect combination tea that is just right.  It does seem to brew all the sweetness first though, so it needs a good stirring before you drink. . my only recommendation.  Overall though, this makes a perfect refreshing glass of sweet iced tea!

review/text: We go through a pitcher of sweet tea in our house a day, three meals a day; it's a staple to our diet. I say that to mean we're quite the connoisseur of sweet tea.<br /><br />With that, I wasn't overly impressed at first. The cane sugar gives it a unique taste but I still found it weak. BUT... I did accidently stumble upon - if I let it steep in the cup after it's made for maybe 10 minutes, it's profoundly different (and better)!<br /><br />I won't be rushing out to buy these but I was curious as to their quality... not bad for an "instant" sweet tea.

review/summary: Delicious Tea - hot or cold
review/text: I purchased this for my teenage daughter - the sweet tea expert at our house. She LOVES it. Even though it is actually to make ice tea with, she makes it as a hot tea. She loves to have it if she is ill or cranky. It is a very soothing tea and tastes great. I also like it as a hot tea. It is pretty much a perfect beverage.

review/summary: Not so perfect...
review/text: This doesn't taste much like the Southern sweet tea I'm used to, and I live in Georgia.  I wouldn't say I totally hate it though, I'll probably finish these and as long as I start a cup thinking I'm getting a sweetened iced tea, instead of a Southern sweet tea, I'll be satisfied with it.

review/summary: Very weak Ice Tea
review/text: This tea gets diluted out by the ice and ends up very weak.  Not good at all as an iced tea.  Great as a hot tea though.

review/summary: adult son loves this tea
review/text: My son uses about 2 boxes a month of this sweetened iced tea k-cups.  Since he's hard to buy for, we purchased a couple boxes for Christmas.  They arrived quickly and securely packaged.

review/summary: not that sweet....
review/text: I love southern style sweet tea, so I was pretty excited to try the Kcup.  It really isn't what I would consider "southern style" like what is served here in Virginia, but it is still pretty good.  If you really want the southern style extra sweetener is probably needed!

review/summary: Perfect Iced Tea
review/text: I love this tea with a slice of lemon on top of the ice before brewing.<br />Sugar is in the cup which is the perfect amount of sweetness for me.

review/text: Not too sweet and very tasty. May not be sweet enough for true fans of "Southern Sweet Tea", but tastes fresh and brisk.

review/summary: These are amazing!
review/text: I love these K Cups so much. They are perfect for me. I like tea sweet but not too sweet. They are perfect. I brew them on the 6 or 8oz option over ice and they turn out great. I tried being cheap and brewing over it again but that just made the second glass taste like watered down iced tea. So I just make it regular now. I highly recommend these to anyone who likes their tea sweet and wants it quick!!
