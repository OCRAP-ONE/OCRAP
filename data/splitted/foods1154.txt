review/summary: Unbelievable SBC, what's in your heads?.  BRING BACK CLASSIC HENRY'S BLEND NOW!
review/text: Well this review is as much to inform.  Henry's Blend is indeed gone, replaced by "Level Four" that states on the package "Henry's Blend."  It is NOT Henry's Blend.  It is similar in that it does not have a bitter flavor and there is no aftertaste and is smooth, but it has lost all of the nutty character that made this medium dark roast coffee my staple. I have no idea how I will replace the classic Henry's Blend, everything I try is a reminder of how great the old stuff was.  Fortunately I have 12 bags from an "auction site."  After that, I just don't know.  This is a classic "circling the drain" move.  Seattle's Best will either go back and consolidate product lines the right way, or they will be gone by this time next year. They have lost my business until they bring back "Classic" Henry's Blend.  If anyone has found a good alternative, I would love to hear from you!  Good luck fellow "Classic Henry's Blend" lovers!

review/summary: I (Used to) Drink WAY Too Much of This Coffee
review/text: EDITED 01/2011 TO ADD: Henry's Blend is no more. This new teal-bag number 4 coffee may be presented as being the same 'balanced roast' that Henry's blend was, with nothing more than a fab new presentation... but don't be fooled. It's not just the bag that's changed: This stuff tastes like little more than brown water. YUCK!<br /><br />Original review (no longer applicable) follows:<br /><br />I originally bought Henry's Blend a few years back because it had a cat on it. They've since removed the cat, which is a shame because suckers for cat-promotions on coffee would totally pass this up as just another coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm rather picky about my coffees. Previous to Henry's Blend I'd only truly enjoy something from our local bean roasters. I loathe Starbucks (tastes burnt to me), the other common brands all end up tasting watery and bland, but Henry's blend is just right - somewhere in the middle. It isn't too strong, it isn't too mild, and it has that stink that my mom calls the 'cat pee smell' (ironically) but not in a really intense way. More like mellow cat pee smelling.<br /><br />Anyway, I've tried others in the past few years but not one has had the right balance, and so back to Henry's blend I go. Its only drawback is that, at the rate I drink it, it's an awfully pricey habit to take up.

review/summary: Goodbye Henry. You will be missed.  :(
review/text: I have been a loyal fan of SBC since it was Stewart Brothers Coffee waaay back. For the longest time Henry's Blend has been a staple in our home. Unfortunately, since corporate brass decided that a good thing needed changing, this replacement doesn't do Henry justice. We gave Level 4 a try and disliked it from the start. After going back and buying an original Henry's Blend and pouring coffee grounds out side by side next to the Level 4, there was a noticeable difference in color, texture and aroma. Sad to say, but I will have to find another roaster of our beloved beans.<br />After hearing other stories like this with the other Levels and the disappearace of trusted blends, it makes me wonder if corporate is purposely trying to kill off SBC or create a media fiasco like Coca-Cola did with "New Coke" in the 80's. Who knows.<br />Goodbye Henry. You will be missed.  :(

review/summary: Henry's Blend? Where?
review/text: Seattle's Best has obviously been taken over by idiots. That's the only explanation for this new change in product look and taste. Are they trying to market coffee to grade school children? The new product presentation in bright colored, ugly bags with huge numbers on them is so unsophisticated and juvenile that it boggles the mind as to how this piece of rubbish got rubber-stamped by any executive who loves coffee. Coffee drinkers don't appreciate this kind of flashy, cheap looking product packaging and still they've tried to keep their original customers by stamping a tiny little reminder of "Like Henry's Blend" on the bag. Well that just rubs salt into the wound because the taste also seems to have been tampered with. I predict that this will go the same way as the Tropicana OJ fiasco and that they'll lose sales to the point that they'll be forced to bring back their far more sophisticated packaging and blends. Luckily, I have plenty of local roasters selling coffee that I can turn to and not feel ashamed for buying such a pathetic looking product. Henry's Blend, in the traditional red bag was a sophisticated, gourmet coffee and that sadly no longer exists.

review/summary: Good, Strong, Coffee
review/text: Seattle's best numbering system is honest.  I like stronger coffee so I've tried the 3, 4, and 5.  The number 3 is coffee, regular strength normal everyday coffee.  It's a good flavor, not acidic, smooth flavorful, coffee. The number 4 is strong coffee, same basic flavor as the number 3, just stronger.  It's like using a full pot worth of grounds and only brewing three quarters of a pot.  My favorite is the number 5.  Number 5 is different.  Number 5 is extremely strong flavor!  Do not use a normal amount of grounds to brew a pot, unless you're really stubborn, you'll dump the pot.  It is good though, if you use about half the normal amount of grounds you get some very tasty coffee that you can actually drink.  I bought three packs of number 3 and 4 for work.  I brought in a bag of number 5 once, but that was a big mistake.  You see not everyone understands how to brew number 5 and I had some unhappy co-workers including one that spit a mouthful at his computer screen.  Yes, it's funny now, but it wasn't then.

review/text: Sea Best is my favorite brand of coffee, which I discovered around 1999 while visiting Seattle.  At the time, I had to buy it in Seattle because it wasn't available elsewhere.  Now, I can buy it on Amazon!  I personally prefer it to Starbucks, which is more readily available.  Henry's Blend is a good medium "weight" coffee.  Not too strong, not too weak.  With Prime 2 day shipping, you can have your coffee very quickly as well.  I ordered this Thursday night and had it on my doorstep via FedEx Saturday at 9am.

review/summary: Great Handy Item and for Food Storage short term.
review/text: We eat a Lot of Mexican and I like to keep a fully stocked kitchen and plan my meals on a whim.  So having this on hand is Great because it is such a fast simple side item and also a great ingredient in so many recipes.<br /><br />I was leery of buying this size, since I had never tired this before, but am so glad I did!  As soon as I opened the bag the aroma was amazing.  I did not realize these were seasoned black beans !!!!<br /><br />Well, I made made some and right my kids said "that smells amazing".  Use it in wraps, in casseroles, as a side dish, diluted as a soup, etc.  I will no longer be purchasing canned black beans unless I need them whole for a salad.  This is my replacement for both canned whole black beans and canned re-fried black beans.<br /><br />Now, the food storage part.  Obviously this is not a long term item (15+ years), nor is it packed as one.  It come in a plastic bag in a cardboard box.  I saved my old pasta sauce and pickle jars, and after washing and drying them, I store dry items like this in them.  I make a label  and tape it on.  I also copy the Expiration date onto the label.  This keeps the product nice and dry, better than plastic storage containers.<br /><br />Now if I want to really keep it fresh, I take half the box and pop it into a mylar bag and seal it with an oxy pack.  But I would still not save that for longer than three years - tops.<br /><br />But for the convenience and knowing its an item I have on hand for slightly long term storage - this can't be beat!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E4YAOC">20 - 1 Gallon Size (10"x14") Mylar Bags for Long Term Food Storage</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E4TT98">20 - 1 Gallon (10"x14") Mylar Bags & 20 - 300cc OxyFree Oxygen Absorbers For Dried Dehydrated and Long Term Food Storage</a>

review/summary: Good Cookies But I Still Prefer Mallomars and Pinwheels
review/text: I bought a box ( of 12 boxes, I guess that is only shipment that Amazon can send of these cookies ) of these cookies 2 weeks from Amaaon and guess what, NOW THEY"RE ALL GONE!  I think I ate 3 boxes of thse cookies and gave the rest away and sold a few.  My impression overall of these cookies is that they are very, very well made, the chocolate alone is decandent, the shell is crisp but can be crispier, but they DEFINITELY add TOO MUCH SUGAR IN THESE COOKIES and for that rason I prefer Mallomars to these cookies, which are the closest cookies in comparison to these.  Mallomars look like Whippets and but they have a crispier shell, the chocolate is not as good cos it's not so rich and dark, but the cookie base is more solid and the marshmallow is not so sugary.  When you eat a Whippet the overall first taste you experience on your palette is a rush of sugar, but with Mallomars you taste the marshmallowy goodness with the sugar.<br />  Pinwheels, a marshmallow cookie that is larger, richer, darker and better overall than both Whippets and Mallomars, have a chocolate coating that is not as good as Whippets but the cookie baase is chocolate, it is more solid and the marshmallow is understated.  I don't know if in Montreal, Quebec or wherever in Quebec they love these cookies ( on the package it says they are " Quebec's favorite cookie! ) they LOVE SUGAR but overally my impression is good of these, they defintely did grow on me after I eat maybe two boxes, but I will never buy them again, not one package and definitely not 12, they are just way to sugary for me since my local grocery stores carries PInwheels year round and Mallomars when they're in season there is no need to buy them again.  I heartily reccomend that you spend your hard-earned money on Pinwheels rather than these, if you're a sugar-concious American who apprciates a good cookie.

review/summary: a mini Moon Pie with a French Canadian accent
review/text: These are everything that a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA38ZY">Mallomar</a> should be, or at least what I remembered them to be. Unfortunately, what they say is true: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0848806832">You Can't Go Home Again</a>. My recent attempt to enjoy childhood again through Mallomars was an unmitigated disaster. The concoctions were dried-out and disgusting, looking like Phoenician testicles and tasting just as bad.<br /><br />Whippets on the other hand were a pleasant surprise from the very first box, and every subsequent box--now sold at my local Safeway, believe it or not--is a gustatory delight. It's like a mini <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00152PNJK">Moon Pie</a>. And these really do look as good in person as on the box.

Curiously, all three (Whippets, Mallomars, Pinwheels) are manufactured in Canada. I might have to move there to conduct further research.

review/summary: wonderful!!
review/text: I know this is called "milk chocolate" but it is much different from a Hershey bar. Don't get me wrong those are good, too, but these are different. Like the difference between a good song and a symphony!<br /><br />This chocolate has a wonderful snap, a deep almost sweet/spicy/smoky/bitter flavor and wonderful smooth texture as it melts in your mouth. Almost a cross between a semi-sweet and a milk (but more on the milk side.) If you like dark chocolate, like I do, you will indeed like these. If you favor mild, milk chocolate, these push you a little further into chocolate heaven..I think you will like it there!<br /><br />If you have ever smelled wonderful chocolate cake or brownies baking, (and are sometimes disappointed that they don't taste as good as they smell) this replicates that aromatic experience into a intoxicating flavor. You will continue to experience the flavor even after you swallow. Very hard to resist these...I had to eat another chunk just to finish this review!

review/summary: Very nice chocolate
review/text: I really like this chocolate, at 41% it contains just a touch more cocao than most mid-range milk chocolate bars. Because of that, it's a little more bitter and a little stronger chocolate flavor, but still creamy enough and sweet enough to be milk chocolate. It has a nice snap when you break a cool bar, and it takes a moment to warm up enough to start melting on your tongue. When I eat good chocolate, I let the first bite dissolve on my tongue to better appreciate the scent, flavor and smoothness of it.<br />This one is very smooth, it has a touch of lecithin which helps make for a smoother chocolate. The rest of the ingredients are cocao, milk, sugar, cocoa butter,, and vanilla.<br />The flavor is very nicely chocolate. The wrapper says that there is a caramel flavor to it, but for me it tasted more toasty with a rich liqueur finish. The vanilla was barely noticeable but it did serve nicely as balance. It makes for a bar that's rich without being too rich and it's just a touch bitter like a good semi-sweet chocolate.<br />I gave a piece to my dad who really seems to think chocolate is a food group and he was less enthused. He likes it well enough, but thought it was just a little too bitter and prefers the lower cocoa/higher milk and sugar bars made by other chocolatiers. He said "It's good, not great, but good."

review/summary: The best nonstick cooking spray
review/text: I've used many cooking sprays and this refined coconut oil is the absolute best.  I use it religiously for eggs and omelets and they slide right off my stainless skillet.  The coconut is refined so that it is stable in high heat unlike olive and other oils that are not safe to use in high heat.<br />Coconut oil has a buttery taste which I like too.  I highly recommend this cooking spray.<br />I will also note that this spray is not like the coconut oil in the jar.  I've tried that too for my eggs and it does not work as well for a nonstick coating.  The spray is definitely different.

review/summary: great to have coconut oil as a spray
review/text: I love this product and it's wonderful to have coconut oil in a spray can. I use it for everything that I want a spray oil for. I'm a huge coconut oil fan so this product was just made for me!<br /><br />The only reason I give it four stars is because the very first can stopped working after a few days. The spray push button seemed to "tip over" and would not dispense any oil, even though you could tell the cannister was clearly still about 95% full. That was a bummer since it's not cheap. I tried all sorts of things to get it spraying again without any success.<br /><br />Finally I broke down and began using the second can, and so far no issues with that. But I do subtract one star because of the defective mechanism which implies poorly made. If it happened to me perhaps it's happened to others as well.

review/summary: Coconut Spray purchased on Amazon
review/text: I paid over $13.00 at local health/nutrition store for 1 can of spray.  I was very happy to find it for much less on Amazon.  It is still way more that spray Olive oil, but worth it in my opinion.  I think that it is much better for your health (please read up on all of the benefits of coconut oil) and it is better to use for higher heats than other oils.

I was very excited to get the package and as soon as I opened the bottle I was really taken with the smell, its great!  I can't do a side by side test of the different extracts, but I made some cookies and pancakes with these, and they were delicious.  I am very satisfied with the quality of this vanilla.  Also the people at JR are very friendly people and enclosed a nice note so it feels good buying from them.

I can also confirm what the other person said about being "mushy," but I much prefer the texture of these to the regular gummies.  I would describe them as softer and tender.  But if you like the harder, more chewy version, you might not like these.<br /><br />I read in another spot someone complaining because they are yellowish instead of clear like they seem in the picture.  They are indeed slightly yellow (very pale) and not clear. So, if you are buying them as a decoration, beware!<br /><br />The only problem I have with them is not eating the entire bag in one sitting.

There is no smelly oil or sauce dripping from the can as you try to open it.  The ingredients speak for themselves.  While my cats are usually on an organic raw diet, this canned cat food works as a substitute when I am in between orders, or as a quick fix when I am just too tired to mix and dish out the raw.  While they love their raw food, sometimes I almost think they are hoping it is "Avoderm for dinner".

My work makes it difficult to eat between 9am and 2pm (the time I'd normally eat the majority of my calories).  This cereal gets me through without making me feel overly full or bloated (unlike, say, grapenuts or oatmeal).  And then there's all the benefits of flax and fiber.  My 3 year old likes it.  Even my husband likes it and he's very adverse to "health foods".  I'm a big fan.  I just wish I could buy it in larger bulk.

review/summary: Gift That Was Loved
review/text: My father-in-law loves these particular candies,Rademaker Hopjes that are made in Holland, and has had trouble finding them in town because the place he had always bought them could no longer get them, so I went on-line and found them here. It seemed to be the best amount for the money. He was happy when I surprised him with them. The only problem is now he will continually bother me to order him more.

review/text: Trying to be more adventerous in everything I do, I gave Veri Peri sauce a whirl. Friends had tried it and raved. Because it is an emulsion, it can be used as a marinade which adds a whole dimension to foods like chicken and pork. And , an added plus, spicy foods rev up digestion so I've actually lost a few pounds...coincidence? Anyway, you will not be disappointed...try it!!

review/text: I use hot sauce on everything and try most hot sauces..but I don't like too too hot. This hot sauce has a kick but also adds a good taste to whatever you're eating. It's really flavorful and doesn't taste like your average hot sauce. Great on things like eggs, pasta, pizza, meat, rice.. I put it on everything! Sooo good. If you like hotter, my brother gets the hot one and loves that too.

review/summary: What were they thinking?
review/text: My son has been enjoying Beechnut fruits and veggies since 6 months old, and I've been perfectly happy with them.  I got some of the other combinations on a whim when he was ten months old to try out.  One of them was this Country Breakfast mix.<br /><br />My son, normally not a picky eater, took one bite and refused adamantly to eat more.  At first we took his behavior for simple stubbornness and tried every trick we knew to get him to eat, but as the hour ticked on and neither his father nor I could make headway, we both tried the food ourselves.<br /><br />After that we threw out the jar and opened up some peach puree as an apology to my son.  The country breakfast tastes terrible.  I don't mean it tastes just odd or bland. It tastes like dirty dishwater that has sat for several days.  I can't believe we were trying to feed our son that!  So, we'll not be getting anymore of that particular mix--though I'm happy enough with Beechnut product for their standard fruit and veggie mixes.<br /><br />Please be aware that you probably don't want to order this in bulk unless you're sure your child already likes it and will eat it.  Otherwise it will be a waste of your money.<br /><br />Happy eating! ^_^ Shanshad

review/summary: "WOW"
review/text: I have over the years ordered many brands of Biscotti from Amazon.com as it is my source for many items I can't find near my home.  When I saw the cobination of "CHERRY/CHOCOLATE/AMARETTO" Biscotti I was naturaly intriged and ordered three of the 9 oz boxes.  They arrived early and I headed right to the K-cup coffee maker for a strong Italian Roast to go with my newly found Biscotti.  It was love at first bite with delightful flavor's.  I have traveled all over Europe and throughout the Italian country side.  I have eaten every kind of Biscotti there is (I think) but, there is one that stands alone in quality/flavor/taste combinations and that is Bella's Home-Baked Biscotti.  As I said I ordered three 9oz containers and they were gone in a matter of a few days.  I liked this combination so well I ordered ten more containers with five being other flavors offered but, I am sure I will settle for just the one with cherries as my first choice of their offerings.  If you love Biscotti as I do or even if you want to try it out for the first time try Bella's with a good strong roast coffee and you will be back for more.  I have to offer kudos to Amazon.com for offering so many choices of everything and ensuring that the complete experience is rated A-1

review/summary: This is an excellent ham
review/text: I purchased this on Dec 21 for a New Years arrival. It arrived on Dec 23. Off to a good start. I served this hm on New Years day to 8 people. They all loved it. One of them asked for Burger's Smokehouse contact info so she could order one next time. It was flavorful, not too salty, moist and tender.<br />What I did was wrap it up in foil like the instructions said and baked at 325. I then removed it from the oven, cut off the skin and fat and glazed it under the broiler.<br />Don't let the fact that it comes with it's skin and fat intact scare you off. This ham is delicious and the fat cap helps keep it moist. It made excellent fried ham for breakfast the next day and great ham sandwiches for lunch.<br />One clue to a quality ham is when you cut open the wrapper, a bunch of juice doesn't leak out which tells the consumer that this ham didn't have water added like many do. There are so many grades to ham that most people aren't aware of. They go in order of quality as follows:<br />Ham<br />Ham with natural juices<br />Ham with water added<br />Ham and water product<br /><br />For special occasions, most people want one of the two highest grades which are not easy to find in your local grocery store.<br />This "city ham" is one with natural juices but it certainly comes very close in quality to the higher grade "ham".<br />This is one of the best hams I've had.

review/text: I first recieved this as a gift from my sister who knew that I was on the hunt for the old "Bubs Daddy" bubble gum.  I found out that the Bubs Daddy recipe was purchased by the Super Bubble company and my sister found the gum on Amazon.<br />It tastes EXACTLY as I remember it tasting as a kid.  Its a strong (not overly strong) grape taste and the flavor lasts longer than most bubble gums.<br />After my niece had some of my gum, I bought her a box as a gift.  It arrived WELL before it was promised, its packaged well and the gum tastes great.<br />If you or anyone in your life is a grape-aholic like me, they will love this gum!  Once again, Amazon comes through with a hard-to-find product!

review/summary: NO LICORICE
review/text: The descripton promises all sorts of flavors.  True, what is there is pretty good.  But I bought this for my daughter's family in May.  Her husband loves licorice.  A sample package they bought in Las Vegas had the licorice flavor included, but in 5 lbs of taffy - there was not a single piece of licorice in this order!  She was very disappointed, and therefore, so was I.  I can understand now why a 2-lb bag of licorice is suggested as a purchase to accompany this.  But 7 lbs???  That's what it would be to buy both.  Well, eventually I did buy the 2 lb bag of licorice, but not from this seller.  Also, this product does not have the Taffy Town tags that the sample from Las Vegas, and also the 2-lb bag I purchased, have on the candy wrappers.  I don't know what that is all about.

review/text: For many years would order salt water taffy from Shrivers in Ocean City, NJ. Great stuff but the cost of shipping and the product is putting them out of reach in terms of total cost. Salt water taffy from Taffy Town is pretty good stuff the flavors are similar to Shrivers.
