review/summary: My parrots LOVE Harrison's
review/text: I swear by Harrison's bird foods, including this birdie bread. Add a banana mashed up to the mix and your birdies will LOVE this bread. You will also see a huge difference in their feather quality and their colors will become more vibrant after a few months of using Harrison's. Their health will improve drastically too. I have fed my birds on Harrison's since they were babies. When mixing this birdie bread, I use the SUNSHINE FACTOR (palm oil) instead of regular oil. Try Harrison's other foods and treats. You won't regret it. Yes, it is more expensive, but well worth the money if you care about the health of your pet bird or parrot.

review/summary: My bird loves this stuff!
review/text: My quaker is a big fan of this bread. He goes for this before he goes for seed ball treats or fruit even. Plus, since switching him to Harrison's fine food, his feather plucking has greatly diminished. Hopefully the bread will continue work as a good "treat" and also help keep his system balanced like the regular Harrison food.<br /><br />Additionally, the package was easy to follow and the bread was super easy/quick to whip up. Only 3 additional ingredients were needed (veggie oil, water, 2 eggs. I just wish the package made a little more than one loaf (using a loaf cake pan, the bread only rose about half the way up to the top of the pan) since I'm planning on freezing it anyway.<br /><br />All in all, a great product!

review/summary: Order from correct Seller/Vendor to get ReaLemon brand
review/text: I ordered & received exactly what I wanted, which was the "ReaLemon" brand lemon juice packets.  To ensure you get the right one, you need to order from the correct seller/vendor.  That seller is "Great Gifts For You To Give".<br /><br />I mention this because some reviews indicate people received a different brand/product then expected.  I think this happens because people simply click "add to cart" when ordering the product. Instead of doing that, look for & click on the link that shows other sellers.  This will read something like "2 new from $8.49".  There you will find the seller mentioned above.  The overall cost is a few dollars more, but if you want the "ReaLemon" brand, I recommend ordering from that vendor.<br /><br />Note: I did not try ordering from the Amazon default seller, so I do not know for sure what brand you will/would get if you order that way.  Hope this review helps.

review/text: As expressed by previous reviews, I was also misled by the product picture showing a ReaLemon packet.  I received the brand name "Serve-A-Lemon".<br />The product brand is correctly identified in the title (Serve-A-Lemon) but the picture reflects a ReaLemon product.  I imagine reviews would not be complaints if the received product was not a cheaper and lower quality brand.  Amazon should fix this issue because it is deceptive.  Other customers have expressed their dissatisfaction in their reviews.  Come on Amazon!!!  Maybe this is why your sales figures are not to your expectations (Wall Street Journal, 08 August 2012).

review/summary: Juice everywhere, not just in the packets
review/text: I received my packets of off-brand lemon juice today, and immediately upon opening I thought it was strange the packets seemed to be sticking to each other. Then I noticed a brown speckled pattern on the sticky ones. Yep, lemon juice everywhere. Now I have 200 packets that I need to individually wash to get the sticky off of so I can carry them around.<br /><br />It would not be so bad if the pictures and description of this product were not an all out falsification. Please look at other reviews for more mention of this. The fact that the packaging of the actual product is so inferior that they can't maintain their seal in a box with plenty of breathing room shows how cheaply this stuff is produced. I cannot recommend this product. I wish I could because this is the only prime eligible packeted lemon juice on Amazon as I write this, and none of my local stores carry this.<br /><br />If you don't mind giving your product a bath upon arrival, and are fine with lemon juice that isn't RealLemon, then I'm sure you will be happy with this product, otherwise look elsewhere.

review/text: This Lemon juice is used by one of our local resturants for use in iced tea!!  We can't find in our local grocery stores.  MOST of the people here (in South Carolina) love lemon in iced tea.  These indivial packages gives the BEST lemon flavor to iced tea.  This juice beats a tiny slice of lemon served by most resturants.  It is such a wonderful thing to order it on the web since we cannot get it locally.  These packages are so handy to carry in your handbag, that way no matter where we eat, we have our wonderful Lemon Juice with us and therefore can enjoy our iced tea, just as if we were dining at home!!!If you have never tried it, you will love it too.  For folks who drink water at resturants. add a package of this lemon juice with a package of sugar or sweetner ---- instant lemonade~~  Try it you will love it as we do.

I imagine you've tried the little lemon juice packets like these before, so you know what you're getting. That being said, it has really improved my life having these around! I keep them at home, in my purse and at the office. I buy a lot of teas, but had a few that I didn't drink much because they needed a little something. A hint of lemon was it. Now, when I get an iced tea somewhere, I don't have to ask first if they have lemon (that over-rated, ubiquitous coffee shop never does). Also, studies have shown that you absorb several times more antioxidants from green tea that has lemon added!

review/text: Saw this new cereal at the grocery store for the first time yesterday and decided to try it.  I have found Kashi cereals to be of high quality in the past (as well as being healthy), so I had high hopes.  I just had my first bowl, and I am sorry to say that my high hopes have been dashed--at least in one major way.<br /><br />The cereal is a nice size (small bite-size), and has a nice crunch, not over-sweet, but the "kiss of berry flavor" the box promises ends up tasting like berry-scented candles, perfume or bubblebath. VERY fake-tasting. Eesh.<br /><br />Unless my tastebuds get used to the fake-tasting berry flavor, I expect this to be the last box I ever buy.  Too bad, because I liked everything about it EXCEPT the fake berry taste.

review/summary: Lower Fat Than Diet Alternatives
review/text: I can't believe no one has ever written a review for this. I first tried this dressing when I was taking the diet class at my local Curves for Women. I was looking for something low in fat and carbs that did not taste like it was diet. This one, not in the diet section, had lower fat (2g per 2 TBSP) and carbs (4g per 2 TBSP) than most of the dressings with the word "diet" or "low carb" on the labels. It tastes absolutely wonderful, works great to spice up a sandwich wrap, and if you like things a little creamier, mixes nicely with mayonnaise. Everyone I have served it to wonders why they've never seen it, and I'm thinking it may partly be due to it's non-availability at Wal-Mart. I get it at my local Kroger, so if you shop at any Kroger affiliates (Smith's, Ralph's, etc.) you should be able to find it. Otherwise, I'm glad to see it's available here at Amazon.

Until now I have only been able to find the 21 oz. can of blueberry pie filling locally and that has always been to much for one cheesecake.  The 12 oz. size is just the right amount to top a standard cheesecake and it contains small tasty blueberries, NOT the huge ones found in most pie filling.  It's delicious....I am going to try the rasberry next.  Price averages out about the same ounce for ounce with the larger can.  Exceptional taste & value delivered right to your door.

review/text: Every year my daughters and I make hundreds (possibly thousands) of Christmas cookies. We make several batches of Kolachky cookies, with apricot and raspberry filling. My father, who is 87 years old loves blueberry. So we went in search of blueberry filling. It is not available in Chicago. We searched everywhere. Our grocery store, even tried to order it. Our results were disappointing. So, based on a tip, I checked out Amazon. We were able to order it by the case. I have not opened the case yet...it's not time for cookies yet. However, I expect the filling to have the same fresh, bright taste that other Solo fillings have. Thank you Amazon.

They are only 1.5 years old, so the effects of keeping the cats healthy may not be obvious, but they are both calm-tempered, gentle and friendly overall.  No major shedding, stool is generally in good shape, and they are enegetic.<br /><br />PS  I know the stuff is expensive, but I have had cats and dogs both in the past.  Often, when they get into their senior years, they begin to their physical constraints.  I have seen organic food do wonders for cats who are older and therefore I decided to use organic food for my cats from their kittenhood.

review/summary: Organix from the start.
review/text: with two new kittens there were all options available.  having had finicky cats in the past i knew initiating a good diet was important and i didn't want to go with a standard cheap food of questionable origin and nutritional value.  organic would be an important factor.  so would flavor. when the kittens were weened i put Organix out, both the canned formula (mixed with whole milk, at first), and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCOZ4S">Castor & Pollux Organix Adult & Kitten Feline Formula, Chicken, Brown Rice & Flax Dry Cat Food, 6-Pound Bag</a>.  they took to the two products right away and have tripled in size in the first month.<br /><br />they are bright-eyed, strong, athletic, lean, with shiny coats.  and adorable.  they eat sensibly, and often, from both the wet and the dry.  i know Organix costs more than 9-Lives or Friskies, but i am certain that these kittens will not suffer some of the expensive effects a poor diet creates.<br /><br />having organic cat/kitten food as an option is a relatively new phenomenon in the mass market.  the choice, for me, was between a product like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIUYA">Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Dry Formula, 3-Pound Bags (Pack of 2)</a> and Castor & Pollux.  i went with C&P for two reasons: Newman's Own doesn't offer a kitten formula and, C&P is an oregon-based business.<br /><br />enjoy your kitties!<br /><br />Five Stars

review/summary: Great product but lousy packaging QC
review/text: My cats love this wet food, but I was disappointed with the integrity of the box in which it was sent. A corner of the case of 24 cans was damaged, and two cans arrived opened (smooshed) because of the damage. It wasn't UPS who damaged it; the Amazon box that the case was in was fine. It was the plastic-wrapped case that was damaged before they UPS'd it to me. You'd think that Amazon would have better quality control and not send loyal customers damaged products (Okay, they shouldn't send ANYONE damaged products, but you know what I mean!). I didn't return it because that's such a hassle and my cats already waited a few days for the wet food to arrive. I will probably reorder when this case is eaten and see if the next case arrives damaged.<br /><br />I bought this type of wet food because one of my cats seems to have a sensitive stomach. (If we don't feed him on time, he pukes up water/foam. And he's had a little blood in his bowel movements for a while. Yes, he's had a full blood panel, is worm-free, etc. The vet couldn't come up with anything wrong with him so she said "sensitive stomach.") We had him on Taste of the Wild dry food, and it didn't help. We had him on Purina EN dry and that seemed to work for him, but I didn't like the ingredients. Plus I read that cats with sensitive stomachs might fare better on wet food. So, I bought this and if he gets worse, I'll update my review, but so far, so good. :)

review/summary: Something Seriously Wrong with This Stuff
review/text: We have five cats and I was sick of paying for the more expensive stuff, so I ordered this (and their dry food) because there were discounts on it.<br /><br />To a cat, not one of them would eat this stuff. Now all of these cats were feral, some still don't let us pet them and stay outside. And to a cat, they all hated it.<br /><br />So I first tried to put Fancy Feast on top of it. They carefully avoided this stuff and picked out the Fancy Feast. When I thoroughly mixed them, they just left it.<br /><br />I finally put it outside, and whatever cat ate it threw up two times outside.<br /><br />I had mixed it with tuna fish and the oil. Cats got sick on that too, when they don't get sick on plain tuna.<br /><br />This stuff has no juices, which, if anyone knows cats, that's the first thing they lick off of food.<br /><br />I don't know how you screw up the ingredients they say are in this food. I suspect that this is NOT organic chicken, organic vegetables, etc. I think it is some Chinese-made horror product.<br /><br />Cats are pretty good about knowing what is good for them and what isn't. If dead mice and birds don't kill them but this stuff makes them sick, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT.<br /><br />Don't order this stuff!<br /><br />P.S. We were totally out of food and I put it out last night (since we still have cans of the junk around). Some cat puked the dry food that he ate afterward in order to try to settle his stomach. These cats don't get sick ordinarily.

review/text: I first tasted this bouillon when I was in the hospital in December.  I was hospitalized for dehydration after surgical complications.  I had been unable to eat any solid food.  When the nurse brought in this hot broth, it was like pure ambrosia!  The aroma is delightful.  The bouillon reconstitutes into a savory, rich broth - not watery or flavorless.  I was unable to find it at stores around here so found it on Amazon!  YAY!!  I have since used not only as a wonderful beverage, but in soups, gravies and cooking.  It adds wonderful flavor and dimension to my cooking.  This will be the ONLY bouillon I will be using from now on.  You will love this product!

review/summary: uncleat quantity
review/text: We have used the product for years but can no longer get it locally.<br />The problem was with the description which says it comes as 8 count, 1.13 oz box.  Apparently what this means is a box ontains 8 packets which is true.  However, the way it is worded I expected to receive 24 boxes as I had ordered quantity of three.  3x8=24.  I received only three boxes at a cost of $26.97 which means Ipaid $8.99 for one box of 8 packets.  One box of 8 packets can be purchased ANYWHERE including Amazon for between $2.00 and $3.00.  This order is being returned for refund.<br />If the price is actually $8.99 for one box, the description should read " Price $8.99, quantity, one box of 8 packets.  Of course if it actually said that, they would never sell any at all.  It is my opinion that the correct price is 8 boxes of 8 packets each for $8.99.  That makes a lot more sense but that is just my opinion.

In the past, I had always made risottos from carnaroli or aborio, but I liked their vialone nano so much that I was going to get another 4-pack.  Risotto should be served al dente so that the slightly firm texture of the rice is still there.  It makes a significant difference in enjoying risotto.  I made one tonight with asparagus tips and shiitakes using their rice and it was excellent.

review/summary: This Company Makes Very Good Cookies
review/text: First, I want to share that I've tried several of the cookies produced by this brand, and they are all excellent; so I think you can feel safe trying any of them.  They taste like "real" cookies, with no weird "tree-hugger" after-tastes or other abnormalities.  (I'm a tree-hugger, but the first to admit that many health-food products can taste pretty odd!)<br /><br />Many of us grew up enjoying this type of cookie (a plain, bland base cookie with fudgy bottom and stripes on the top).  It's a surprisingly difficult combination to get just right.  Over the years, brands I used to enjoy have weakened and cheaped out on their product, to the point that I no longer have any interest in purchasing any of their cookies.<br /><br />I recently tried these, and was very happy with them.  They remind me of how this type of cookie used to be.  The balance between the rather bland but still appealing base against the darkish chocolate icing is great.  Very satisfying cookies as well; which is always a plus!

review/summary: Subtle, Mild, Enjoyable Green Tea
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Zen Green Tea with Lemongrass & Spearmint has a subtle, mild, light green tea taste, not bitter at all. I don't taste any of the additional flavors Tazo puts into this tea; maybe my palate isn't developed to this point. However, it still is one of their better teas, and has less of an artificial taste than the others I've tried. Maybe the flavorings are just too mild in this tea, but when it comes to flavorings, I prefer them this way; I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. It is not a strong green tea, so it would definitely appeal to people who enjoy herbal infusions and milder teas.<br /><br />The ingredients in Zen are: green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint, lemongrass, and natural flavors. Zen contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "an enlightening blend of the finest green teas and rare herbs available in this world." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Zen as "smooth, lemony, earthy, refreshing". Tazo describes the aroma as "lemon, mint". The web site also says, "Select pan-fired green tea from Zhejiang province in China, artfully combined with lemongrass, spearmint and a hint of lemon essence. Zen's distinct green tea flavor accented with lemon and mint is impossible to express in words. Best simply to experience its sweet, lingering aftertaste." I don't taste the lemon or the mint or the sweetness; still, it is a nice green tea. It is relaxing and enjoyable to drink.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: When I used to work at the campus pub, one of the most requested items was this tea.  It started with one or two people having colds, needing a tea, and all we happened to have on hand was the Tazo.  What a smart decision by our managers to purchase this product!  It caught on like nothing else had there!  Soon, we were serving more tea than beer!  <p>From a personal standpoint, however, I can attest to its flavor and qualities.  It is the best tea I have ever had the pleasure to drink myself.  The Zen flavor is no exception.  I would highly recommend that you try out all of them (or at least as many as you can) and decide on your own personal Tazo, as the myriad of blends can be a bit overwhelming.  Zen is probably the best green tea I have tried, though.  It's one of my personal favorites.<p>The price really is a bargain.  I've compared in grocery stores and you're better off buying the 6 count dispenser (144 bags in total).  Trust me, you will definitely drink that much tea.  During the summer months, it makes a truly unique and exceptionally tasty iced tea as well and in the winter with a little honey and lemon, it's a perfect suppressant of cold symptons (I would still claim there is no CURE for a cold yet).  Drink in good health and enjoy!

review/summary: Very good seeds, but beware if you have milk allergies
review/text: Let it be said that these are really delicious sunflower seeds.  The flavor is very strong and the seeds are quite large.  But there are three things to consider when buying these:<br /><br />1.  Milk is listed as one of the ingredients.  If you are lactose intolerant or allergic to milk products, you should stay away from these.  I'm not sure why milk is an ingredient in pickle-flavored sunflower seeds, but so be it.<br /><br />2.  A conspicuous amount of non-seed material often makes it into each bag.  These include stems and other parts of sunflower plants.  So even though you might think you are putting a handful of seeds in your mouth, sometimes you will find yourself spitting out foreign (plant) objects.<br /><br />3.  Sometimes the seeds get stuck together in clumps of four or five because of how much coating there is on each seed.<br /><br />Having said all this, these sunflower seeds are very tasty.  But they will also make your tongue raw because of all the seasoning.

review/text: I have met people who are in love with pickles, most times I could care less if a hamburger has them or not, and on rare occasions, maybe 4 times out of the year I might include a dill spear with a meal, but when it comes to sunflower seeds, and BiGS being the best, the best of them to me are the Dill Pickle flavor. I just can't run out of these things, I buy them by the case.

review/summary: addicting in a good way
review/text: My son plays ball. So seeds are around the field. When I came across dill pickle I thought, I'm not a real pickle lover but what the heck, give em a try. Wow, best flavor of all and best brand for this flavor. Take a big hand full, stuff em between the cheek and gums on one side,this is where you get the first big flavor explosion, be aware of the siliva attach, take caution not to drool in public,move one seed at a time into the splitting position (front teeth here) others may differ, spit the shell, store the seed on the other side untill you have a few to chew. As others have said, yes they are the best, they are addicting, the rough up your mouth but if you seed through it your mouth will toughen up. Yes there are stems and odd plant matter but thats no biggy. The clumps of seeds stuck together are a find worth showing off to fellow seeders, like a bonus burst of flavor. When the bag is empty, don't forget the bonus, the dill dust in the bottom is worth fighting for, tip the bag up and tap it out on your toungue. The grand finally of flavor. I grabbed four bags off the rack the other day, my son said, dad you took four bags! I said I know, thats all they have!!

review/summary: Totally addicted to these Dill Pickle Sunflower Seeds
review/text: The first Dill pickle sunflower seeds I ever tried was a brand called Zack 's.  They were completely addictive and the BEST I've ever had.  They discontinued the Zack's brand, so I've been actively searching for a substitute.  I've tried the Frito Lay, David and BIGS brands to compare.  I have to say that for me, the BIGS brand is by far the best, hands down!  Thanks to BIGS, I am once again actively feeding my addiction to dill pickle sunflower seeds.<br /><br />I LOVE pickles!  I prefer a kosher dill over straight dill and really like the Vlasic and Claussen brands the best.  So, BIGS being a Vlasic pickle flavor really worked for me.  I think these seeds have a ton of kosher dill flavor.  The other brands taste more like a lighter straight dill flavor.  I'd personally rather eat straight sunflower seeds than eat the other two brands.  I also think that the BIGS brand have larger seeds than the other two (particularly David's....I've always thought David's seeds were too small).<br /><br />If you like Kosher Dill pickles and sunflower seeds, I don't think there's anyway you could be disappointed with these seeds.  They are awesome!! They run $1.99/bag at our local Racetrac, so the price on Amazon saves you a few bucks!

review/summary: Pickleriffic!
review/text: So you call yourself a sunflower seed fan, yet your seed of choice is a couple of sleeves of that "other" brand that you pick up for a buck? Shame on you. Let those folks make potato chips. They're good at it. For sunflower seeds, make the move to Bigs seeds and your taste buds will thank you. These are delicious, very flavorful seeds. The quality, consistency, and flavor of these seeds beats anything else I've tried. I'm awaiting the arrival of a variety of other flavors to try, but until then, the dill pickle flavor is a good sign of what's to come. It seems that other brands I've tried have a fair amount of "bad" seeds in them... the ones you spit out in disgust. These, however, are quality and I've yet to encounter that problem. If you want a salty, well-seasoned seed snack, go with these. Do it!

review/text: BIGS sunflower seeds are not sold in my area, but one grocery store had a freestanding (one-time) display of them.  I tried them and they were HUGE!!  I mean, other companies' shells were about the size of the BIGS seeds!  I have been ordering them by the case via Amazon since then and still love them, but have to admit they aren't as huge as they used to be.  My favorites are dill, bacon and ranch - the 'hot' buffalo style isn't even warm in my book.

review/text: I first tried these seeds when one of my teammates on my Sunday league Baseball team had a bag. I was hooked instantly. I ordered a pack of 12 from Amazon and brought a bunch to share with the team the following week. I have to say, at least, 15 of the 22 guys on the team consistently have these at the games now.<br /><br />These seeds are noticeably larger than other brands (i.e. David and Frito Lay). Also, these are the only Dill Pickle flavored seeds I've ever had (and I've tried 'em all, being a huge fan of Dill Pickles) that ACTUALLY taste like pickles. It's uncanny. The people at Bigs deserve a medal for this.<br /><br />Now, I'm a lifelong fan/customer. I just ordered my second case not too long ago and I anticipate having to order a 3rd in a few weeks. A++++ product!

review/text: I love Jello Custard but haven't been able to find it in any grocery stores lately.  I had friends around the country searching their stores too!  One wrote to Jello to ask why it's so hard to find.  She was told that Jello was no longer selling the Custard mix in stores because customers don't like taking the time to stir it until it reaches the boiling point. They do, however, sell it on their site to restaurants, etc in bulk.  I went on their site to order some.  The price was good but the shipping was outrageous so I didn't fill the order.<br /><br />I looked on Amazon and it showed they were out of it. Stupidly, I thought this meant that they wouldn't be getting anymore in.  A week later, another friend told me it was back in stock on Amazon!!!  I order a case of 24 at an excellent price (less than $1 a box - I was paying $2+ in grocery stores).  Then, by simply buying an item worth $5, I got FREE shipping.  I needed a new spatula so I bought that!<br /><br />The best part is, when it arrived I looked on the box to see if there were microwave instructions.  There were!!!  I now make it in a microwave in about 8 minutes.  It says to stir it but you don't really have to.<br /><br />Thank you AMAZON for caring one of my favorite foods!!!

Needless to say, I bought all that they had on the shelf at the time - something like 16 boxes. To my dismay, when I had used all that I had found and returned to buy some more ... I was nearly heartbroken! Then one day I was tooling around online and decided to "google-in" Jello custard, and low-and-behold Amazon came up. I opened an account, bought a case at an excelent price, and now I am going to sign up as a "frequent-buyer" and get an additional %15 off, plus free shipping. I want to be buried with at least one box, because it is so fabulous. I highly reccomend the purchase through Amazon.

review/summary: Treasure of a Find!
review/text: This is one of the best desert puddings available. With the addition of an egg yolk, as the package directions suggests, the pudding tastes exactly like the best home made custard. I can't imagine why someone would think the few minutes required to stir it until it boils isn't worth the time for this special treat. I have missed this product for over several years, since it disappeared from grocery shelves.  What a wonderful surprise to discover it available on-line from Amazon.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  You are providing a service that the local "mom and pop" grocery used to do but the big, or even "Giant" mega "open 24 hours" stores can't because the corporate computer won't OK the order.  Thanks for preserving goodness and keeping us from being totally possessed by the Great Mediocrity".

review/text: Amazon to the rescue! Jell-O Cook & Serve Americana Egg Custard has been missing from store shelves for years. Now that it's back, I'm going to be able to dig out all those old recipes and bring back some memories from way back when.<br /><br />I'll never understand why big companies withdraw some of their best items from store shelves and disappoint so many consumers. But, right now, we're going to take the opportunity to stock up!<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Really, really, really good
review/text: I got an unexplainable hankering for custard over Thanksgiving while I was visiting relatives and went online to browse.  From the reviews of this product here and elsewhere it is (a) awesome, and (b) impossible to find.  So I was stunned when we made a quick grocery dash to a very small Food Lion store near very small La Follette, TN and there were dozens of boxes of it.  I bought four and cooked them up in one large pot.  That's eight cups of milk that you have to stir constantly over medium heat until it hits a robust, rolling boil and stays there for a short while.<br /><br />Yes, you DO have to cook it, and NO, a microwave won't do.  Was I bored?  OMG, yes.  Does it give new meaning to "watching water boil?"  Oh yes, very much so.  Was it worth it?  Oh yes!<br /><br />Per some other reviews here on AMZN, I also bought some ground nutmeg and some prepared coconut and toasted some of the coconut on a cookie sheet (takes no time; watch carefully to keep it from burning).  When the mixture had boiled for a short time, I poured roughly equal amounts it into two bowls.  I sprinkled generous amounts of ground nutmeg on both.  Then I added the toasted coconut to one of them.  Most of the coconut sank, which worked out just fine.  Then I put both bowls on the screened porch (it was pretty cool that day) for several hours.  Eventually, I put both of them in the refrigerator.<br /><br />Result: the non-coconut version tastes like restaurant-quality custard.  Let it set up overnight for proper consistency, but you can enjoy a preview bowl after it has cooled in the fridge for a few hours.  Berries, sauces, dark chocolate chips...you could go anywhere with this.<br /><br />The coconut-enhanced version, topped with light Cool-Whip (or another whipped-cream-esque topping if you have a problem with Cool-Whip) tastes like a coconut cream pie without crust.  Really.  You should try this.

review/summary: Anyone have old Flan recipe from Amer Egg Custard box???
review/text: The American Egg Custard had a recipe for flan on the box. When they quit printing the<br />recipe, I lost my copy. I called the company several years later and they no longer had<br />the recipe, either, since the were selling the boxes of flan. I prefer the original recipe on their box to the pre-boxed "flan". Does anyone have the recipe (probably from 15 or 20 years ago).
