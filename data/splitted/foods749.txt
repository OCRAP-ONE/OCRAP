review/summary: BERRYMINT
review/text: This flavour of metromint was as excellent quality as any of the others, but I did not enjoy the taste as much as, say, the Spearmint. You are better off trying to find a small pack or single serving before buying a whole case... as I did. My personal favourite is the chocolatemint. Enjoy!

review/summary: Not As Excited...
review/text: ...about this water as everyone else. To me, it tastes a bit like unsweetened mouthwash. I guess I was just expecting something different. I've only tried the Spearmint so far, and I've noticed in another review that this one is not a favorite...a bit scared to try the others though in that I'm not very enthusiastic about my first one...

review/summary: Spearmint Metromint - A Winner!
review/text: I first tried Metromint when I visited my daughter in Spokane Washington around 6 years ago. I am from Kansas so when I got back home I tried to find it in stores near me. I first found it in Overland Park by accident at a store across from the college I attended. I was so happy. I would buy a dozen at a time. I then found it in Topeka, which is closer to me. I still have to drive 60 miles to pick some up but I do not care. I really, really like the Spearmint flavor. It is so cool and refreshing. When it is ice cold, it almost takes your breath away. I LOVE IT!

I highly recommend this product if you are a fan of unsweetened beverages and mint.

review/text: This water is amazing! I heard about it about a year ago from a friend who was trying to lose weight but was struggling with a severe craving for chocolate almost every day. He shared a little of his chocolate mint water with me and I was hooked. It's fantastic that it's available on amazon now... this flavor always sells out at the markets near me because it's so delicious. This is the healthy way to brighten up your day with a little chocolate! Plus, the mint makes metromint water extra refreshing! So good!!

I would take a bottle of metromimt with me to work everyday during the summer and it would keep me cool and fresh all day.

I would recommend metromimt to everyone and have already gotten many friends and family to start drinking it. A+ material here.

Cherrymint is my favorite, but can be hard to find. I also love Spearmint, Orangemint, and Chocolatemint. Recently tried Berrymint and it's pretty good for something different. I'm not a fan of Peppermint or Lemonmint, they are just a little too minty for me.

review/text: I found this water for the first time at the Philadelphia Airport and bought a bottle for a long flight across the country. As soon as I tried it I wished I had bought a few! I wanted to cut out sugary drinks from my diet and get to drinking more water, but have SUCH a sweet tooth. This was the perfect drink! You're still getting the benefits of drinking water, but with a little bit of sweetness to it. Very satisfying. Even my husband, who has no tolerance for artifical flavors and was born without a sweet tooth, loved it. Glad to see Amazon has it readily available now. I'm hooked. Absolute favorite drink!

review/summary: Lemony Goodness
review/text: Let me start this off by saying that at 24 years old, I still had to force myself to drink water rather than juices, sodas and the like.  That being said, after finding metromint, I have that problem no more.  While I enjoy many of the flavors of metromint, Lemon is by far my favorite.  When I do drink water, it has to be as cold as possible.  With metromint, that kick of mint tricks me into thinking it is cold even if it's room temperature.  Due to this, I keep bottles of it everywhere!  Although some places run it on sale frequently, for me I find it cheapest and easiest to purchase on Amazon, especially if you are a prime member.  I also highly recommend the spearmint, chocolate, and peppermint.

I then proceeded to go back and buy the remaining stock they had left in the store. I can not describe how refreshing this water can be...let's just say if you were to bottle a stream in the arctic...that would be kind close. Unfortunately, the reason for the sale in the grocery was because they discontinued carrying the product and it has been hard to find ever since then. It is good to see Amazon at least knows a good product when they taste one!

I absolutely LOVED every sip!  So much so, I went back and bought every bottle on the shelf!  It has since disappeared permanently from all major stores in my area, so I am estastic to see it here on Amazon!  I stocked up before a week long trip to Lake Havasu, and all my girls and I enjoyed the variety of flavors (see Peppermint, Spearmint, and Good Berry Mint) instead of Gatorade and juice drinks!  The girls never missed the sugar and we didn't have any crazy sugar crashes in the afternoon.<br /><br />If you add lemon to your water, this is a great refreshing change and the mint is the perfect compliment!!!<br /><br />BEST SERVED ICE COLD

Definitely a 5-star product and I will be buying more!!

review/summary: A very quick addict
review/text: A dear friend sent me a sample case of MetroMint, and I was a little skeptical. Minty water? Eh.<br />I took a sip, and it was interesting. Took another, and it started to grow on me.  The non-mint flavor (chocolate, cherry, etc) is so subtle, really more of an aftertaste. And the mint is light and refreshing. It makes my whole mouth feel fresh and cool, and I can feel it tingling all the way down into my stomach.<br /><br />MetroMint definitely tastes different (to me, better) when refrigerated. It subdues the mint a little and allows the supporting flavor to shine through more strongly. After finishing that gift sample case, I was hooked. MetroMint has been in my fridge every since. I've tried going back to Propel, and Propel has become to sweet and cloying for me. The lightness of MetroMint is absolutely fantastic.

review/summary: Wow! I can give up Caribou once in a while!
review/text: My sis was just here from Ohio.  I live in the boonies.  She left a Spearmint which I took along in case I ran out of Iced Coffee when I went to my mowing job.  I couldn't believe how refreshing it was - lukewarm!  Checking the website - HyVee is s'pose to carry it.  I have a request for them!  I will give up some coffee in the hot summer for this! Til then - checking funds - I need to order this!<br /><br />CONTRARY to the comment about toothpaste ...  Wonder if they got it from the seller who "made their own" and put it in empty Metro bottles?  (Serious - see the review under the Peppermint flavor!)

review/summary: Very refreshing!
review/text: I got my first bottle at the health food store so that I could try it out. I don't drink products with fruit or any kind of sweetener or added acids, so this was perfect. I love the taste of Spearmint. Yes, it tastes like Spearmint gum, which is my favorite gum flavor. But the flavor is not so strong that it is overwhelming. Just refreshing. I prefer it over peppermint.<br /><br />My daughter loves it too and is going to quit chewing gum (it gives her the sniffles) and start drinking this water.<br /><br />Even better it's offered on Amazon Prime. Prime is perfect for us, because our nearest health food store is an hour away. Now I can get it in a couple of days and save the gasoline and sales tax. Perfect!<br /><br />I'll be buying a bunch of this. Love it!

review/summary: great product, but beware of seller!
review/text: I love this water.  It's the only water I drink.  I don't like the bland taste of regular water, but I realize we need to drink as much water as possible.  Metromint tastes great and finally enabled me to enjoy drinking water.  HOWEVER, for the first time I bought Metromint from somewhere other than Whole Foods at Amazon and the seller made their own water with a mint taste and poured it into old Metromint bottles.  I couldn't believe it!  Someone actually made their own water with mint and went through the trouble of putting it into old Metromint bottles and sold them on Amazon.  Fortunately I got my money back but beware!!!

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I started buying this product from my local grocery store at $2 per bottle. Every time i'd go, they would end up being out of it, though. So I have since participated in Amazon's subscribe and save and it's fantastic. I get 12 of these bottles delivered right to my door for about $6 cheaper than I would get them if I drove to the grocery store.<br /><br />As for the product itself.. it's not like your typical flavored water. I really enjoy the minty lemon flavor. I mostly only drink water, but sometimes crave something with flavor, so Metromint Lemonmint does that job for me well.<br /><br />The rest of the flavors that I have tried are just okay for the most part. Spearmint is really good as well.

review/summary: Great product, great price
review/text: I want to get my dog off of grain-based and mystery protein foods but didnt know where to start. I researched a lot of brands on the web and decided on this one for several reasons: USA made, all USA meat products, no grains, no mystery or questionable protein or fat products, and reasonable price. I wondered about the sweet potato but decided to go with it because I read that they have vitamins and enzymes beneficial to dogs.<br /><br />Overall I think this a great dog food but before I say what I like about it, I'll say up front the one thing I don't like about it: it has pork in it. It's not the main ingredient though. Maybe I overlooked it in the description on Amazon. When I read "pork" on the label I freaked. My dog had gotten sick eating a treat made of pork so I was worried. I know some dogs can't handle it, but I decided to try it once.<br /><br />I mixed it 1 part to 4 parts of his regular food to start and slowly increased over a week. The kibble is small and he's a big dog so I thought he may not like it. He really did like it at first and never got sick from the pork, so I thought all was OK.  But when I got to 100% Hi Tek, he stopped eating it. The ony way he will eat it now is to add 1 part of his old Benefil. As long as there's a little bit in his bowl, he won't spit out the Hi Tek. So I may be stuck with that small bit of grain and meat refuse in his food in order to improve his diet.<br /><br />Since eating this product, my dog no longer passes gas throughout the day, only on rare occasion.  His stool is more compact and he goes less often. Since he weighs 80 pounds, this is greatly appreciated! And you just can't beat the price. Now that I know he will eat it, I'll be buying the larger bags which are even more economical.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about this product, give it a try in this smaller bag size. At this price, you won't be risking much if your pet just refuses to eat it.

review/summary: light on flavor, big on energy
review/text: The flavor of this tea is very light, even though I steeped it a very long time. It's just a little bit chocolate and only very slightly sweet. I add a packet of stevia and a little bit of almond-coconut milk and THAT makes it tastes a bit more like dessert.<br /><br />It absolutely does give a nice, even release of energy. I never crash and, even if I have a cup in the afternoon, it doesn't keep me so riled up that I can't sleep. I really like it for that reason.<br /><br />I'd love to see a chocolate spice flavor from this brand. I think it would help make it a little more favorful!

review/summary: Wow Your Table with Basmati Rice!
review/text: I am from northern California just north of a region that is dedicated to the growing of rice.  Our family got turned on to Basmati long grain rice about fifteen years ago when a restaurant in San Francisco served us Basmati rice. This rice has a flavor all its own which makes it a joyful part of our meals at least once a week.  I add this rice to most of my soup recipes along with steel cut barley. This is good for our diets...but the taste of the soups is just plain wonderful.  I try to buy it in bulk so that I don't run out. This bulk size is good now for just the two of us.  If our children were still at home I would be buying in the larger sizes.  By, the way, I bought my very good rice cooker here at Amazon.

review/summary: Better Than Expected
review/text: I actually got this rice by mistake (Amazons).  I have never ordered pre-cooked rice (parboiled) and had not expected it to be as good as it is.  It cooks up light and fluffy and actually has a nice, subtle flavor not unlike my favorite jasmine variety. I cook rice daily and am happy to have been introduced to this, which makes it a "happy accident", so to speak.  Also, this rice is lower on the glycemic index than other basmati rices I've had, so it works out for those of us who are carb-watching.

review/summary: Best for the little ones...
review/text: After reading a number of confusing reviews that highlight LARGE discrepancies in sugars, organics and nutrition contents, I decided to investigate for myself.<br /><br />I compared Earth's Best Apple snack bars (my little guy's favorite) with Health Valley Apple Cobble cereal bars and Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Apple Cinnamon.<br /><br />Packaging:<br /><br />Earth's Best snack bars are KID-sized. Only 19g.<br /><br />The other two are 37g each.<br /><br />As most parents know, having things in smaller packages is handy because kids often don't eat all of what you give them. So unless you always remember to carry extra baggies or storage containers around, Earth's Best has the no-waste edge.<br /><br />***For the rest of this review, the numbers I give for Earth's best are based on a doubling of serving size from 19g to 38g so as to be on relative equal footing with the other two bars***<br /><br />Sugars:<br /><br />Nutri-Grain (NG): 12g<br /><br />Health Valley (HV): 16g<br /><br />Earth's Best (E'sB): 18g<br /><br />So, yes, Earth's best does have the highest sugar content of the three, but that's assuming your child will eat the whole 37/38g worth of bar.<br /><br />Mine won't.<br /><br />And, if you consider the source of the sugars (which, believe it or not, matters to some people), Health Valley and Earth's Best derive theirs primarily from evaporated can juice, honey, and the apple itself.<br /><br />Nutri-Grain lists high-fructose corn syrup and plain ol' sugar almost a dozen ingredients before you actually see 'apple puree' listed.<br /><br />One final sugar note, when ANY kind of fruit is reduced to a concentrate, its level of sugar (fructose) becomes concentrated as well. That's why it may take a whole apple to equal the same amount of sugar found in a couple of tablespoons of the concentrated apple found in a  processed snack.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Just a reminder, what's listed first on the ingredients label is what the product contains the most of, and so on down to the bottom.<br /><br />If you think your child is eating an apple snack bar, then apple should be the first thing list, not near the last.<br /><br />Organics:<br /><br />Read the labels thoroughly.<br /><br />Healthy Vally claims 70% organic.<br /><br />Earth's Best claims made with Organic Whole Wheat.<br /><br />Neither of these items claims to be 'ORGANIC' in its entirety. So don't be miffed if you see the word and think it means the whole product only to find out it doesn't.<br /><br />Other Nutrition consideration:<br /><br />Fiber: This is the one truly weak point of Earth's Best. It list NONE. The other two each list 3g. Now, I'm not 100% certain that 0g for the E'sB 19g serving also means 0g for a double serving, but it's safe to assume that it would still be less than 1g.<br /><br />Vitamins: E'sB wins this one. Narrowly beating out Nutri-grain with added Zinc, Iron, Thiamin and Folic Acid, though a tad less on Riboflavin and Niacin.<br /><br />Health Valley has modest amounts of vitamins, but nothing to compare with the other two.<br /><br />This said, if you're the kind of parent who is truly concerned about a well-balanced diet, you know that the value of vitamins from these sources isn't as good as getting them from fresh fruits and vegetables, so don't bank on these bars as a multivitamin alternative.<br /><br />Sodium:<br /><br />NG: 110mg<br /><br />HV: 85mg<br /><br />E'sB: 90mg (45mg/19g)<br /><br />Protein:<br /><br />At the 37/38g serving size, all offer 2g.<br /><br />Total carbs:<br /><br />NG: 24g (8%)<br /><br />HV: 27g (9%)<br /><br />E'sB: 28g (9%)...but 14g/19g serving size<br /><br />Calories:<br /><br />NG: 120<br /><br />HV: 130<br /><br />E'sB: 140...70/19g serving size<br /><br />And an added note on calories: kids are active little things and hardly want to sit to eat or do anything to take away from their play/work.<br /><br />While I do prefer to give my little guy as much 'fresh' stuff as possible (and I give him a fair amount), he fills up on it, but burns through the energy (i.e. calories) quickly and is loathe to pause long to eat again.<br /><br />This said, when you can find a SMALL, tasty supplemental snack that's relatively healthy and also packs on the calories for your little one, then you often stick with it.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />If cost is the most important factor when choosing a cereal bar, then, yes, Nutri-Grain is likely your best bet.<br /><br />If convenience of size and nutritional content drive you (despite cost), then Earth's Best is definitely the way to go.<br /><br />Health Valley has it's taste merits, but lacks in other ways.<br /><br />I 100% believe of the value of paying a little more for Earth's Best smaller bars because it provides a compact, calorie and nutrient rich snack that is fairly healthy.

All Earth's Best products that are organic will have that word below their logo, this does not. We were disappointed to see these marketed as organic on this website but then noticed the legal disclaimer that Amazon will not be held responsible if the information on the site does not accurately describe the product. If you are looking for good, healthy cereal bars for kids, these are an excellent choice. But if you want a 100% organic cereal bar, keep shopping.

review/text: I love these bars! Bought them in Florida for a healthy snack for my 13 month old while on vacation - and for me too! They are a perfect size for him to eat but I made the mistake of letting him hold it (he's more than capable) but all he wants to do is squish it between his fingers. And then lick his fingers. So as long as I hold it and feed it to him, these are great - same price as in the stores too. Came here to buy on Amazon because I can't find it in my local stores!

review/text: These Apple bars are stickier, messier and thinner compared to some of the other EB bars. The thinness causes the bar to crumble apart easily just by opening the individual package. I have found myself scraping the pieces from the floor, chair or car seat. I'll be "sticking" with the strawberry and cherry. They don't have this problem and they are slightly thicker.

review/summary: Good snack for school
review/text: This is a good healthy option for a snack. Our daughter likes them, but doesn't constantly ask for them either.  They are also nut free, which means I can send them to her school for snacks and lunch.  It can be hard to find good nut free products, so I have a standing order on these.

review/summary: Great taste, a bit mushy and messy though
review/text: As a mom I love these but more importantly my 3 year old LOVES these! They taste yummy (yes I've had them), are a good size for my daughter to hold and aren't loaded with sugar in my opinion. The only downside is that they're sorta soft and mushy and fall apart easily. If you throw them in your bag for on the go be prepared for mushy, messy snacks. Overall I like them but they're not as solid as the adult variety.

review/summary: Even mom and dad find it yummy
review/text: I like the way each bar is packed individually. Hubby gave 2 bars to my 2.5 year old son today, served in a wide and shallow plastic bowl just in case the crumbs fell everywhere.  The snack bar fits in his tiny hand perfectly. It's not too thick, so biting it is almost effortless. He absolutely loves it. He was too busy to answer my question "is it good?" by showing me thumbs up while his mouth was busy chewing, LOL. Hubby and I love its taste as well. It's slightly sweet and sour, pretty appetizing. Surprisingly, my son left very little crumbs in his bowl at the end of his snack time. The reason I rate it 4-star because I was hoping it's crunchy outside and soft inside. Well, it's probably messier if it's crunchy. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends.

review/summary: Not just for kids!! Great for adults too!!
review/text: I don't have kids -- I'm the one who LOVES these bars!! Unlike a lot other power bars (Cliff, Luna, Balance), the sugar level is actually lower, the vitamins and minerals are just as high or higher, and the calories are WAY Way lower (just 70 calories each, compared to 210-280 for the others). AND to top it off, I find them more filling as well. They really are fabulous for carrying a snack in your purse or book-bag. Sometimes I eat a couple for lunch, and am really satisfied. makes a great late-night snack too. Two thumbs way up!! :)<br />PS: I've had both the strawberry and the apple -- both are really great. They actually taste like real natural fruit preserves, not like sugary jam some other bars tend to taste like.

Plus I find the Earth's Best foods and snacks to have more nutrients in them than other popular brands at a reasonable price.  My 16 month old likes a baby yogurt and one of these for lunch when we're on the go, plus he never grows tired of them. Perfect for travel.

review/summary: My kids love them & no high fructose corn syrup!
review/text: This review is one of the few I've written without acting sampling said product personally -- that would involve me wrangling a bar away from my 2 or 4 1/2 year old long enough for a bite. These bars are almost a win-win for our family - the kids adore the "Grover Bars" (similar to the "Big Bird Bars"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ER1ENQ">Earth's Best Sunny Days Snack Bars, Apple, 5.3-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a>) and I've actually found a portable, healthy snack. Go ahead, look at every other packaged breakfast- or cereal-type bar in the grocery store. Every one of 'em has high fructose corn syrup. Apparently, manufacturers think you have to sweeten the heck out of anything to sell to kids.<br />(That said, I am NOT a health food nazi. I just would like to establish some healthy habits in my kids, and somehow steamed broccoli is not the best kids snack for the car.) So, I rate these 5 stars, and say "almost" a win-win. They're still quite pricey per bar, but the Amazon price is excellent. Also, the serving size is pretty small - but I do not consider that to be a negative.<br />I would like to try the other flavors of the Earth's Best bars, but they do not seem to have the Sesame Street characters, and that is a big point with my 2 year old. Not only are the furry characters on the front of each box, but each individually wrapped bar features a picture of Grover, too.

review/text: I'm pumping at work and looked for a product to increase or maintain milk production. I started drinking this tea and thought perhaps it was working. It had a decent taste once I added the sugar. Unfortunately I noticed that my daughter started having really painful gas at night when I nursed at home. I couldn't figure out what had changed til I recalled the other reviews of this product. I stopped drinking the tea and her painful gas stopped. oh well, it was worth a shot!

review/text: I got this because I was worried about not having enough milk for my son.  I was able to see the effects of the tea within 24 hours!  I went from pumping 3 oz per breast every pumping session to getting 3.5 on day one, and 4 on day two!  My son hasn't had any issues with this addition to my diet either.<br /><br />I was also worried about the flavor, because I don't like fennel, but I can hardly taste it.  You can smell it when it is brewing, but the flavor is very tasty, I just add some sugar.  I looked at all of the different teas for nursing moms and picked this one because it looked like it would taste the best, and I am glad I ordered it!  I would recommend this to any mother looking to boost her supply.

It works very well for nursing mom's. I found when I breastfed to have 2-3 cups of this tea a day. I had other supply issues so that is why I drank 2-3 cups. I'm not sure of the recommended amount to have but it was a great tea to drink regardless of nursing!

My only problem, one that I took care of myself, was that one of the sugar bags seemed to have a box blade cut on the package causing some of the sugar to be spilled into the shipping container.  Since there wasn't a huge amount missing from the bag, I simply transfered the contents to a sealable bag of my own.  I thought it better to do that than try shipping the item one single piece back.  Otherwise, I'm completely happy with my purchase.
