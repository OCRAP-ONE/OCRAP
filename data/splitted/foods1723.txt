review/summary: maple syrup
review/text: Love this.  Always bought grade A before but was enticed into try grade B when a review of baked bacon brushed with grade B honey far more flavorful.  That was true but I use it on a lot more, frech toast, pancakes and other things.  Very flavorful.  Quick delivery.

review/summary: Maple Syrup
review/text: I have used pure maple syrup for several years, but didn't realize the difference between Grade A and Grade B syrup.  This is the best tasting maple syrup I have ever had and I definitely recommend it and plan to purchase it again.  Even my son who usually only wants the flavored pancake syrups from the grocery store loved this one.  Very tasty syrup!

For the uninformed, Grade B is neither worse nor better than Grade A - just different. Grade B is darker and has a stronger "maple flavor" - making it better for cooking, ice cream, etc. It is also perfectly excellent on pancakes and waffles.

review/summary: These crackers are crackin'
review/text: I love the fragrance of rosemary, and these crackers are filled with it. They have the shape and texture of saltines but are so much more interesting and flavorful. I'm sure they are delicious with cheese, but I am vegan and eat them plain--delicious.  I first purchased them in Alexandria, Virginia, and they became a staple in our home. We moved to Portland last year and I've been unable to find them locally, so I sent to Amazon for a case. It seemed like huge supply to fit in the pantry, but they are disappearing fast--and the packaging keeps them fresh.

review/text: First, this is not a review of the seller but the sauce. My husband bought this at the grocery store to try. I'm not a fan of hot sauces but he offered me a bite of chicken tender with this sauce on it. Oh my goodness was it good. Not hot at all, just that low smoky chipotle flavor followed by warmth. The taste was amazing. I immediately started mentally thinking of things I could put this stuff on (after begging for another bite of chicken with it on there), tacos being my first thought.<br /><br />I picked more up at the grocery store for $2.59 a bottle, much cheaper than the $4+ a bottle being charged here.<br /><br />Additional note: If you like to dip chicken tenders in ranch dressing, try putting some of this sauce on the tender first, then dipping in ranch. Tastebud heaven!!

review/summary: No longer mild
review/text: Breakfast blend is no longer the mild coffee flavor that I have come to enjoy for the past few years. It is now a medium coffee with noticeable burnt flavor along with some bitterness. I don't know why Starbucks messed with a good thing but after reading that their new line of blonde coffees offers no taste at all I will now be forced into looking for a new mild blend of coffee. I bought mine from target with the new packaging that says medium. I hope Starbucks returns to the original formula that made Breakfast blend so good.

review/summary: Great coffee, the perfect blend. Wake up to Starbucks flavor in your home!.
review/text: This is by far one of the best breakfast blends, I have tried.  The beans chosen are a perfect meld, with a low acidity.  Starbuck's did their job right in selecting beans for their taste rather than supply.  A typical pattern in many coffee house brands is to throw together a low grade more plentiful bean with a few mid to high range beans and then pawn it off as a quality brew at a higher price.  This often results in a coffee blend without taste.  Starbucks, however, did their taste test on this blend and came out with a true winner.<br />The beans are roasted much lighter than your typical Starbucks type beyond french roast, this also helps in creating a coffee that is less acidic.  Yet while lightly roasted the beans have been roasted enough so that the oils will be released when put through a drip maker or coffee press, a problem usually encountered with lighter roast.  Their is a defint natural sweetness in the beans that are enhanced with the use of fat free milk, the lactose sugar of the milk bean the only additional sweetener need.  A full fat milk or cream would mask the complexity of the sutler flavors here and leave you with coffee that is on the taste par with any store brand stale canned bean type.<br />This coffee's blend and flavor would make it great choice for a hearty comforting breakfast of bacon and eggs where the flavor of the foods are enhanced by a milder coffee that leaves the food as the star and not an attention grabbing bitter coffee.

review/text: I have been ordering the three pack of regular Breakfast Blend for some time now, but Amazon sent the MEDIUM Breakfast Blend on my last order.  I tried to make sure I ordered the right one, and did, but they sent the MEDIUM anyway.  Quick tip:  the MEDIUM blend is absolutely awful.  Don't waste your money on this one if you're a regular Breakfast Blend lover.  The real/original Breakfast Blend is smooth and mellow with no bitterness and great taste.  This MEDIUM takes more like the institutional Maxwell House.  I won't be ordering this again.

review/text: I should preface this by saying that I am not a coffee snob.  I used to drink instant coffee and have only recently begun making "real" coffee in a drip machine.  I decided to try a couple different types to see what I liked.  My dislike of this Starbucks variety might be exacerbated by the fact that the coffee I tried just before this one (Lavazza Qualita Rossa) was so good.  In comparison, this blend has a very harsh and bitter taste.  I won't be buying this again and wish I hadn't purchased a three-pack.

review/summary: Ok Coffee, lacks the Starbuck's "Flair"
review/text: Rating coffee is hard as it's like rating a piece of art - highly subjective. As background, I love the strength of Starbucks coffee as compared to Dunkin, Eight O'Clock, Pete's, and Target Brand. The issue here is that I thought I was getting the House blend (Starbucks changed their packaging) and I got the Breakfast blend. Now this was my error, so I thought I should try it. It was rather weak and had little character. Wasn't full bodied at all. Seemed like the bottom fell out of this blend. For my tastes, I had to add more coffee and just to bring this to where it was somewhat bearable.<br /><br />Now, there may be those who like this type and they would give it 5/5, for me, the 3/5 resulted from the loss of flavor and character. Not that it was milder, it just didn't taste good to me. I've tried the whole Starbucks spectrum of coffee and while I may not like the french roast, I can taste the "flair" associated with it. This was different. Like making clam chowder with 1% milk, something's missing.

review/text: I purchased this from my local market and boy, am I sorry to have done that.  This particular Starbuck's blend is awful to say the least.  I knew it wasn't going to end well when I opened the bag and was nearly overcome by the nasty aroma.  To me, coffee is supposed to smell good as well as taste good.<br /><br />I decided that maybe my nose was deceiving me.  So I brewed a couple of cups worth (I make my coffee at night for the next day) and waited thinking that perhaps it would taste better than it smelled.  Once it finished brewing, I took a sip of it black.  UGH!  I thought maybe sugar will help.  NOPE.  My next trick was to add vanilla flavored creamer.  NADDA!<br /><br />It seems as if this is a smokey blend.  The taste is very heavy and not at all appealing to me.  I think I expected a lighter, smoke free and perhaps more tangy flavor.<br /><br />Now I have to try to give this away....(sigh)

review/summary: Best Cakes On the Planet!
review/text: I had been going to Grand Cayman for years and always saw these cakes, in a little gold box, always thinking how good can a cake that's been sitting in a box be?  In July 2010, we were there and walked into a store that had a sample of each flavor of the Tortuga Caribbean Rum Cake.  Needless to say, I tried every flavor and went back for more.  These were the most tasty, and moist cakes I had ever had in my life!  Now, they're my "go to gift", and I send them to friends and family.  Everyone loves them...and thus, the cycle continues!<br /><br />Thank you Grand Cayman for producing a little slice of heaven, right here on earth!

review/summary: Overpriced!
review/text: Way overpriced for a 16 oz. cake. I'm a baker so for me this is just okay. When I bake, it's butter, eggs, sugar, flour, etc. There are too many artificial ingredients in this cake, making it taste processed. Just get yourself a good pound cake or yellow cake recipe (please, no boxed cake mix), and make a rum syrup. That's it. Let it soak, soak, soak and you'll have a better and more natural tasting cake. The up side though, it's cheaper to purchase on Amazon than direct from the Tortuga factory.

review/text: I first purchased a very small Tortuga coconut rum cake in Cozumel. I wasn't sure that I would like it. However, after trying the small one, I wished I had purchased a larger one.  I thought I would have to reorder the product from Mexico, but found it online at Amazon.com.  The cake is moist, with a nice blend of coconut & rum.  It's very delicious.

review/text: This is the one of the best cakes in box. I really mean it. It is vacuum sealed and very fresh tasting. You can smell and certainly taste the rum, but the flavor is smooth and has the perfect sweetness - not too much, not too little. I used to make gift baskets that included one of the small cakes in it and both men and women would always ask where to get it. My husband and I share a mini cake and treat it as a special treat, rather than hogging down the whole thing.

Both were too "rummy"...rum overpowered the taste of everything else to the point that it was distasteful.<br /><br />I had hoped to order some more rum cakes to serve to guests or use as a "hostess" gift.  Am I glad I got this for a taste-test...I would have been very embarrassed!!

review/summary: Good Product but Did Not Work for my Dog
review/text: I love that Halo has wholesome ingredients but it did not agree with my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy. I gradually introduced Halo mixing it with his previous food (cheap, very unhealthy Beneful)over the span of a month and his stools were consistently soft. Every once in awhile he would have a "normal" stool but for the most part either had soft stools and occasional liquid diarrhea. I kept him on the food for 3 months, hoping that his system would get used to it but never did. I encourage anyone else who is trying new foods and their dog's stool does not become normal within a couple of weeks to change foods because the ongoing soft stools led to another issue for my dog.<br /><br />Because he had soft stools for a long time we went to the vet to get him tested for worms, other potential issues and the results came back normal except for his anal glands. Apparently a dog's individual scent comes from the glands on their butt (that is why dogs sniff each other there). The scent is in a brown liquid that comes out of the anal glands on their butt every time they defecate. However, if they have soft stool on a regular basis, that liquid is not pushed out by an otherwise normal stool and the glands can become backed up/clogged causing all kinds of other issues that if not taken care of could need surgery. A sign that your dog might be clogged is if they scooch their butt on the floor. Thankfully his was not to the point of needing surgery and the vet was easily able to get the liquid out (which some of it had dried up and formed hard chunks that caused pain and irritation). I only mention this in case this information could be potentially helpful to any of my fellow pet parents. :)<br /><br />After trying Halo, Wellness, Organix, boiled chicken and rice, plain ground beef and rice (all high quality foods), I decided to try him on a hypoallergenic food and he has had consistently normal stools on a regular basis ever since!!! We suspect that he may have had stomach irritation with the meats chicken and beef.<br />The food that I currently have him on is Nature's Variety Instinct Duck & Turkey meal formula. He doesn't like the taste of the food as much as the others so we mix each meal with a small amount of natures variety instinct canned duck formula and he loves it. Although canned foods can be just as high quality as dry foods as far as quality ingredients go, they can cause tarter build-up on the teeth more quickly if you are not brushing the dogs teeth on a regular basis.<br /><br />Since Nature's Variety brand is considered hypoallergenic we introduced him to the salmon formula (mixing a very small amount in with his duck food) and it caused soft stool so if your dog has a sensitive stomach...try duck!

Comes in a resealable foil bag to help preserve freshness.

review/text: It mystifies me as to why grocery store managers in much of the US won't order this product. A local Safeway stocked them one year, and it was practically a floor fight to get them. People drove from store to store just to buy Mallomars. Given all the junk they stock that never sells, why the prejudice against making money? I'm grateful that we can buy them on-line, but BEWARE THE POSTAGE CHARGE (in fine print in the upper right). Even with it, it works out to about 65 cents/cookie, an okay price for one of the greatest taste treats of all time. BTW, mine have always arrived within a week or so, and very fresh. In fact, I think I'll go have one right now.<br />  ((one ....who am I kidding))

The gloss of the chocolate was not there it was a pale color, it looked like it had been frozen before. I ate one and the taste was about the same. Out of 54 pieces, my wife and I were able to eat 5 total before we realized that my child (9) ate the rest. They must have been great, but the look was not right.

review/summary: Crunchy delights
review/text: My first encounter with these darling little treats was while watching Everyday Italian on the Food Network starring Giada De Laurentiis, my favorite chef of the past few years. She crumbled them into deserts, coffees, made pumpkin ravioli with it, baked amaretti apples and always praised their magical taste. Upon finally purchasing a box myself I was blown away by the hypnotic and addictive taste of marzipan in these little gems.<br /><br />Amaretti Cookies are packed as a pair, wrapped in wax paper with Italian writing and insignias, praising its originality. They are two small crackling cookies per wrapper and they are a crunchy shell of delight. The taste is strangely addictive, after having a few I couldn't stop thinking about them! I have even purchased three more boxes two days after getting the first one. They taste like the holidays, spicy and lusciously laden with almonds and crispy sugary goodness with a tiny tang of bitterness of the almond. They flavor is royal and time stopping, on busy days, one bite of this cookie and I am transfixed into magical fields of luxurious old world taste that has been popular to Italians for years.<br /><br />Incredibly aromatic crispy almond cookies that are a luscious addiction to coffee, tea or wine and are great for cooking and baking with.

OK ..first have an adult present....you spread it out on a table and flatten the wrapper, then wrap it in a cylinder shape, then stand it on one end on the table or a plate....now THIS is the FUN part!!!.. you make a wish!!!  ..you light the top of the paper, with a match preferably..now wait till it burns down to the bottom( it will not create A HUGE FIRE)..and when the flame hits the bottom a reaction between flame & air happens, it will start to travel UP!!..and if your ash hits the ceiling..your wish comes trues!!..NO ONE believes me but the Italians always do this after expresso!...now if you have HIGH ceilings..don't fret..try it again on a lower ceiling..I have done this 100s of times..nothing will go on fire..and you are there ,NOT WALKING AWAY from the flame that goes very quickly..so much fun!<br /><br />GOOD LUCK ON YOUR WISHES!!<br /><br />TONY(NYC)

review/summary: Outstanding Espesso
review/text: Illy really got it right. I have tried the E.S.E pods from Illy and others. The taste of the IperEspresso Capsules is superior. The Creama is outstanding. I also have a Jura Z5 super automatic and it can't match the taste of IperEspresso even using Illy whole beans. The Illy IperEspresso machines are very simple to use and to clean. The downside is the capsules are expensive, about 75 cents a shot compared to 50 cent a shot from the super-automatic. But, using the Amazon's new subscription service the cost has dropped to about 63 cent a shot. If you like the taste of Illy coffee this is one of the best ways to enjoy it.

review/text: The espresso is perfect, same if not better than what you get from ordinary coffee shops, and at 75 cents per shot, it is much cheaper than coffee shops. And if you take advantage of some of the promotions  by Illy,  the machine cost significantly less compared to machines that makes comparable espresso. If you love espresso, this is a steal! The only wish i have is that illy allowed compatible capsules of other brands.<br /><br />What I don't understand is the $19.74 "original" price listed by Amazon while Illyusa.com  sells them at [...]. That said, with free shipping, you still get a good deal from Amazon.

review/summary: Good espresso as one can expect from Illy
review/text: Great tasting espesso from a single serve machine.<br />I had 2 other Nespresso machines (my first single serve espresso machines), but found myself making milk based drinks from the FrancisFrancis X7 a lot more often with the Illy Medium roast.<br />Many might say they prefer the Dark roast for stronger taste, but I found the Medium roast is most balanced and rounded in flavor in the few options Illy offers.<br />It's one of those "I can live with just this one" type of espresso for me.<br />It's light at first but will eventually grow on you making it an everyday ritual.<br /><br />Comparing to the Nespresso capsules, although Nespresso have many flavors, none of them IMO can compare to the refined taste of Illy capsules.<br />Sure, Nespresso got some great capsules, but the only one I really like is one of the specail editions that came in a blue capsule they sell a year ago.<br />For me, the Illy Medium roast is something I can like any day.

review/summary: illy iperEspresso Capsules Medium Roast, 21 Count Tin
review/text: With the Francis x8 and these capsules you get a nice shot of espresso with thick crema. The only reason I give it 3 instead of 5 stars is due to the price. Each capsule costs more than $0.75. I think you get a better deal with Lavazza Gran Crema ese pods which tastes better to me. If you buy the Lavazza pods 150 for about $50 from Amazon each pod costs less than half of the Illy capsules. The pods can be used with many machines including the Handpresso while the capsules can be only used with some of the Illy machines.

review/summary: Wonderfully rich and decadent chocolates -- Very High Quality
review/text: The Godiva kiosk closed in our local mall.  I was very disappointed, because my family expects a selection of Godiva chocolates for Christmas, Easter and birthdays.  However, they have their favorites, and unfortunately when ordering Godiva off-line, you have no choice but to purchase assortments over which the consumer has no input.  They are selected and pre-packaged for you.  So I was looking for other candy companies which might sell chocolates which approximated my family's favorite items, without having to buy extra candies they might not like.  Enter this wonderful collection by Leonidas of Hazelnut and Almond praline-filled milk chocolate confections.<br /><br />These are fantastically excellent chocolates -- just as good as, or better, than the Godiva signature oysters which my family loves. They arrived protected in styrofoam by overnight shipping. I will definitely be dealing with this seller again. I am very impressed and pleased by the chocolate and the high quality of the product.  And the taste?  Just heavenly.

They are very rich and I can't have more than one or two a day, but it's awesome.<br /><br />If you've never tried Leonidas Chocolates or have always thought other chocolates were just as good (Godiva, etc...) then I highly recommend Leonidas Assortment Product (see link below) to try the various styles and chocolates offered.<br /><br />I promise you wont' be sorry and you'll love the service of this company as well!!!<br /><br />Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment

review/text: These chocolates are such a great find! I was looking for a special type of hazelnut chocolate called gianduja. I searched for it and found this perfect selection! It is the smoothest, creamiest hazelnut chocolate I have found. A little on the pricey side but TOTALLY WORTH IT! People I know who aren't that crazy about chocolate or hazelnut chocolate specifically have LOVED it and wanted more! I bought some during the Christmas season and shared it (out of holiday spirit) but kind of wish I had saved more for myself!

review/summary: Exactly what I wanted.
review/text: I drink a lot of green tea every day (4-6 pots) and this is a really wonderful representation of Earl Grey green.  The citrus tones of Earl Grey are very subtlety paired with the tea leaves and for the price, I really do not think there is a better value out there.  The packaging is great and seals air tight every time so your tea is protected and this is very important since a lot of this teas flavor is contained in the aromatics.  I would recommend this to anyone regardless of preference, though it is great for newcomers to tea, because you cannot help but appreciate things that are done well, and this is one of them.<br /><br />P.S. Be sure not to over-brew this tea or scorch it with hot water or you will lose the subtlety of the Earl Grey flavors.  Don't take your water past 160 and then let it steep for only a few minutes.
