review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Cookies So Far
review/text: I recently began a gluten-free diet and have tried about 10 different types of cookies and bars, i even attempted to make some from scratch which ended in the garbage leaving me very frustrated. I couldn't handle the texture and taste of the rice flour or the mixes i purchased. I was about to give up on finding a good wheat cookie substitute and decided to try these, even though the packaging did not make them look appetizing at all.  To my surprise these cookies tasted like the real thing.  I am very happy and will continue purchasing these from now on whenever i feel like i need a treat and will not feel sorry for myself any more. Thanks Pamela!!

review/text: THESE GINGERSNAPS ARE TRULY GINGERSNAPS.  I LIKE THE CRISPY, HARD TEXTURE, THEY HOLD UP IN DUNKING IN HOT LIQUID.  I ALSO LOVE THE CHOCOLATE CHIP BITES TOO!  THIS ALSO SATIFIES MY COOKIE CRAVING.  SINCE THERE IS NO GLUTEN IN THE FLOURS I USE TO MAKE COOKIES, THEY FALL APART, TOO TENDER!  BUT THESE ARE JUST RIGHT FOR ME.  THIS CUTS DOWN ON THE NEED TO TAKE SO MUCH TIME TO MAKE MY OWN COOKIES.  SO, WHAT CAN I SAY, THANK YOU FOR THESE GLUTEN FREE COOKIES.

review/summary: Great chocolate chip cookies
review/text: Pamela's Chocolate Chip Mini Cookies are wonderful to keep on hand. I am working a lot of over time and don't have time to bake. I take 2 or 3 of these in my lunch and/or dinner. I get my "chocolate" and "sugar fix" with no work and no fuss. When I have time, I love to bake my own cookies, but Pamela's fits the bill for me at this time.

review/summary: Fair
review/text: If you like a fairly strong ginger cookies, these are great.  They snap, they are spicy.  They are a tad sweet, and I find that of Pamela's  Simplebites line, judging on mouth feel alone, these are the most obviously gluten-free.  They aren't silty like some gluten-free products, but they do leave behind a slightly chalky residue.

review/summary: Quite good
review/text: While not as good as Pamela's Chocolate Chunk mix, these ready-made treats are tasty.  They are a bit sweeter than they are chocolate, which is a turn off for me, though the dough has a rich vanilla flavor.  They would be much better made with dark chocolate.  If you're looking for a ready-made chocolate chip cookie that's gluten-free this one's the best there is.

review/summary: INCREDIBLE FLAVOR, BUT.....
review/text: I purchased these along with Pamela's gingersnaps. The ginger snaps were not that great to me: too sweet and sandy tasting. The extreme chocolate mini cookies were delicious! The flavor was extra-chocolately (I love dark, slightly bitter chocolate, so for me, I was in chocolate heaven) and I COULD NOT STOP EATING THEM: ate one entire bag in less than an hour....YIKES....:-) With this said, I could not give this product a 5-star rating, because I noticed the next day that my stomach was burning very much.  I don't know for certain if the culprit are the cookies, but my diet was not different aside from the cookies, which admittedly was an overindulgence on my part, so perhaps this is why my stomach was on fire. I have eaten overindulged in other foods which have not given me the same result as these. Also, they were a little too crumbly and dry,(sandy) but the taste was so spectacular that these cookies earned additional points; otherwise, I would have rated them 2 stars. So, for those with sensitive stomaches be forewarned, you may experience burning, esp. if eaten in excess. After nearing the end of the bag of these cookies, I noticed that I became satieted with the flavor/taste. I don't know if this means that I won't feel the need to eat the entire bag of the next bag. If I do, I will try my best not to eat more than 10/12 cookies a day. And, finally, these cookies also stuck to my teeth. I had to rinse with an anti-cavity rinse (twice), floss, and brush my teeth (twice) with toothpaste.

review/text: I feel like I have tried all of the gluten-free chocolate chip cookies on the market, and these are the clear front-runners for me.  Njoy Life usually has wonderful stuff, but their chocolate chip cookies don't hold a candle to these.  These are also better than Pamela's shortbread chocolate chip cookies and her chocolate chocolate chip cookies.  I saw someone compared them to Chips Ahoy, and I would agree with that.  Whoever said that you can't taste the chocolate chips must not have tried many other GF chocolate chip cookies, because there are many worse tasting ones out there.

My advice is find a store that carries them and pay the extra money. It's worth it.

review/summary: Finally, a GF ginger snap!
review/text: Okay, so they aren't as chewy as the wheat version of a ginger molasses cookie.  They don't quite *snap* like the wheat version of ginger snaps.  Like a lot of gluten-free cookies, they're more crumbly than chewy.  On the other hand, they do give a good kick of that ginger taste I have missed since I have began avoiding wheat years ago.  I also like that these don't have corn in the ingredients list- just rice and tapioca for flour.  So many of the GF alternatives use corn flour, which might work for Celiacs but doesn't always work for those of us who have intolerances that include corn.  I am pretty keen on the idea that I could pulverize these in the food processor and use them for a graham cracker crust.  I think they'd be phenomenal in a trifle or as a pressed crumb layer of a layered cookie.  I've been pretty happy with the Pamela's line of GF products, and this one did not let me down.  This product is going on my permanent Amazon shopping list.

review/summary: Gingery and crunchy!
review/text: Great cookies - small enough to pop an entire one into your mouth, but if you want to be more decorous, it won't burst into crumbs when you bite through it. Great ginger taste - I couldn't distinguish between this and regular ginger snaps.

review/summary: NOT MY FAVORITE
review/text: I was expecting something a little more snappy and a little less sandy. The flavor was okay (I personally love strong ginger flavors, which I am yet to find) however, they were too sweet for my tastes. I don't know, but it seems like Americans have a strong taste for excess sugar. It would have been better if there was less sugar and more spice, as well as less sandiness and more snappiness, imho. For those who like chocolate, try the extreme chocolate cookies, but be careful as they may cause burning of the stomache; esp. if many are eaten. Not my favorite Pamela's product.

review/text: This Ginger Snap would be my favorite cookie even if I weren't gluten intolerant and could eat<br />any type of cookie I wanted. The perfect amount of crunch...better than the Pamela's full sized<br />ginger snap which is a bit soggy, but more gingery...<br /><br />Crumbled it's great for a pie crust..but generally I just eat a few after dinner with coffee or tea.<br /><br />I've made mini ice cream sandwiches for my grandkids..I put<br />softened ice cream between two cookies, roll sides in mini chocolate chips, then put the little sandwiches back in the freezer. Good for adults who want portion control or tiny treats without going overboard.. I've made mini s'mores with them too... Once the package of cookies has been opened, I keep them in my refrigerator.  Keeps them crunchy and fresh tasting.

review/text: I think these are the best gluten-free cookies I've tried. The other Pamela's mini cookies are also very good.  There is a recipe on the back for a cookie crust for desserts. I tried the ginger snap crust and it was a little too much ginger for the delicate tasting filling.  Next time I'll try using less crumbs and sprinkle a little for topping. Haven't tried the chocolate cookies for a dessert crust yet - I ate my 6-bag case too fast!

A great natural cook that you can taste all the flavorful ingredients.<br /><br /> My 8 year old said his first cookie put wings on his head and he flew up to heaven they were so good.<br /><br />Needless to say they are awesome. The perfect crunch cookie that is my whole family's new favorite.<br /><br />If you like molasses cookies or gingerbread you will love these.<br /><br /> Do not know about the other reviewer, but mine did snap.

Perfect.<br /><br />They're so decadent, even my cookieholic self is sated with only two.<br /><br />I bought my bag at a store, so maybe I got a fresher batch than some of the other reviewers. I found nothing to complain about here texturally. This is not "pretty good for gluten-free", this is fan-freakin-tastic.  Finding these delights has made my life just a little bit better.

review/summary: Autism Diet Cookie
review/text: Medical studies have demonstrated that autistic children are more receptive to their therapy when on a strict gluten free diet.  The problem is that children love to eat tasty chocolaty 'junk' food things.  So how to satisfy their taste buds and maintain a gluten free diet?  Alot of the gluten free stuff out there is non-palatable.<br /><br />After MUCH trial and error we discovered this delicious chocolate chip cookie.  We performed a blind taste test with all the Dream Factory tribe and this cookie stood at the top of the cookie heap.  Flavorful crunchy.  Microwaving for about 20 sec softens them up and brings out their chocolate flavor even more.  Their small size (2" dia) is perfect for little hands.<br /><br />Did you notice on the bags cover;  the cookie on top to the right.  The configuration of the chips makes a sad face.. . .  Look.<br /><br />Pamelas also makes a great pancack mix.

review/summary: I can have cookies, and be gluten free! YAY!
review/text: I actually bought these at a local natural/health food market. They were insanely expensive and I wish I would have tried amazon first! Still, I LOVE these cookies, I got the EXTREME chocolate mini cookies and they're delicious! Even my kids like them and they can be fairly picky. They're loving getting to try all of my "new gluten-free things!", and I may be moving them gluten-free as well.<br /><br />These cookies have a wonderful flavor, texture, and crunch. I find myself happy with just 2-4 of them, instead of just wanting to devour the entire package considering the small size of the cookies. Size wise they remind me of the chocolate chip cookies you can get in that mixed pack of grandma cookies? I think that's what they are, they have the frosted animal cookies, and those chocolate chip ones. Anyway, they're smaller cookies, good flavor, good crunch, gluten-free and great price here at amazon. What more can you really ask for anymore? ;)

I noticed the other 2 varieties were available through Amazon and are still reasonably priced, and this one is available through Nutricity.  Please make this variety available again through Amazon.

review/text: Now that my doctor & I have decided that a gluten-free diet would be a help with some GI difficulties, the adventure to find healthy snacks that won't cause any  problems has begun. The first item I've added to my list of new favorite treats are these Pamela's mini ginger snaps (or should I say snapz!) There really crunchy, just the way I like a cookie and very flavorful. They're great with a coffee or the traditional cold glass of milk. These are, indeed, among the best ginger snaps of any sort, gluten-free or otherwise, that you are likely to find. Delicious anytime!

review/summary: Pamela's Ginger Snapz - 4 out of 5.
review/text: I am allergic to wheat, soy, corn, and peanuts. I like the fact that this product wheat free, soy free, corn free, gluten free peanut free and to top everything off it's certified kosher. In my opinion the ginger snapz tasted good ... very 'snappy' - for lack of a better word. When you are allergic to the things I am allergic to you read the labels/ingredients of foods/snacks and you notice that pretty much everything contains SOMETHING that you are allergic to. So I am grateful for this product being made. I've read several reviews and I've noticed that most of the people who gave the ginger snapz a low rating kept saying they had a sandy taste. FYI: Look at the ingredients, it contains rice flour. Rice flour has a sandy/grainy type of feeling when eaten/felt. With that being said, I let my mom and my brother taste the ginger snapz. (Both of them aren't allergic to anything whatsoever). They said that it tasted good but it left a grainy/sandy after taste in their mouths. Once again, this product does contain rice flour. With that being said, remember people - this product has no wheat, soy, corn, or peanuts. I give credit where credit is due, they stripped some of the most common ingredients that people are allergic to and still ended up with an excellent tasting snack. 4 out of 5 because after I ate about 6 snapz and got over the actual feeling of me actually eating something that I wasn't allergic to *smiles* .. I did taste the sandy/grainy-ness that people were talking about. No complains though. I can make ice cream sandwiches now, no complains at all.

review/summary: If You're Watching Your Weight, Beware !
review/text: Don't panic..........they won't make you fat unless you eat too many which is easy because they are so yummy !<br /><br />Somehow, these cookies are a tiny bit chewy but not soft AND they have a slight crunch when you bite into one.  They are just right as far as I'm concerned and hard to put down.  In addition, there are a ton of chocolate chips in these cookies.  They would remind you a bit of Famous Amos' tiny chocolate chip cookies, although not as crunchy.  It's hard to believe that these cookies are gluten-free.  I looked at the ingredients a couple of times to make sure.<br /><br />I keep the bags of cookies in the freezer(summer heat) and they are just as good after thawing as they were right out of the shipping box, so don't worry about a chocolatey mess in the heat.<br /><br />These are hard to find in the stores AND the price here on Amazon is really low when compared with the local health food store. Hard to beat this deal.  Highly recommended.

I attended an Autism Fair on July 24, 2010 and these cookies were being passed out as free samples.  People descended on those cookies like a flock of falcons and I felt lucky to be able to snag one.  Even so, they were a BIG hit and I ended up getting a bag for guests.  Within minutes those cookies were gone.<br /><br />Hats off to Pamela!  (You will also want to check her website for more good recipes and products).

review/text: OMG! So the kids say these days. We just ordered these a week ago because my wife LOVES to bake, but can't eat wheat products anymore. I ordered these for her to try and BINGO she ate almost the whole bag at one sitting! She never eats that many cookies at a time...I tried them and of course I finished off the bag. These products on Amazon.com are wonderful and very helpful for people who are allergic to wheat. My wife can enjoy eating similar meals with me now without fear of a reaction. She's tried the Ener-G bread, the Bob's Gluten Free flour and the cereal w/berries.  She's in heaven, (NOT physically) and is enjoying eating again. This week we're going to try the gluten free, wheat free pasta with homemade tomatoe sauce and hamburger meatballs. I'm excited to sit down to dinner with her and I'm trying these products also.  Anyway, these cookies are wonderful and taste just like regular flour made products. Would recommend any of these gluten free, wheat free products on Amazon.com. We rate this product a 10 and will continue to purchase them.

If you dont heat it, then you can't taste the chocolate chips at all and as a result is really unsatisfying. Although, in my opinion w a really good snack you shouldnt have to do anything to it. But, w.e.<br />In conclusion- these r realli good and youll get your $ worth, subscribe its only like $2.30 for each 7 oz packet. But, dont eat these unless you have a microwave at hand, or it really isnt good otherwise.

review/text: These cookies are so good that its a bit difficult to stop eating them ... and though "gluten free," they are not dietetic, so beware.  One other caution ... I had purchased some at Whole Foods, and then decided to buy more through Amazon. I think the ones that arrived via Amazon were not as good ... like maybe they were from a different cooking date/lot that had been baked a little too long. They were still good enough to eat, but I noticed a slight difference. However, the convenience of being able to shop online and the fact that even those cookies from the "bad lot" were very enjoyable, somehow makes it worth giving a second chance( with the hope that it was just one time they were overdone).

review/text: These cookies are so good that, when they arrive, I have to write on each package what month I will eat them in.  If I don't I have all six packages eaten within a week!  These cookies make gluten free living much more enjoyable.

review/summary: Excellent cookies
review/text: These are the best chocolate cookies I have ever eaten - gluten free or otherwise.The small size helps with portion control but even only one is a treat. They make the best ice cream sandwiches with mint chocolate chip.  My sister is diabetic and could work these into her eating plan without guilt. Give them a try! Thanks Pamela.

review/summary: AWESOME COOKIES
review/text: I am new to trying to eat gluten free, some products out there are outright nasty.... But these cookies taste<br />like your giving nothing up but getting more than you expect for the money.  For the price alone its a great<br />product what you recieve, but the taste is even sweeter than the price!  You won't be disappointed!!

review/text: I am a fan of these cookies and order frequently.  This was the first time that I had broken cookies,  They were still delicious but several were all crumbs. I compained in packaging feedback as well but it was the inside box that smashed the cookies. Only gave three stars due to breakage.  These are five star cookies!

review/summary: Fabulous Chocolate Chip for GF
review/text: I've lived GF since the age of 12 (in other words, along time)lol.<br />These are terrific cookies.  I am usually fairly restrained when eating sweets, but I admit, I would have eaten the entire bag in one sitting had I not thought about the calories and the fact I was getting really full.<br />If you are looking to feel like you aren't deprived, then you must try these.<br />Other than the fact, that they tend to be a bit more crumbly than most cookies, they are a winner.<br />ENJOY!

review/text: These cookies are always my favorite. They taste just like Famous Amos cookies! However, when I ordered them from amazon every other bag was stale even within the expiration date the taste was not the same. I was super dissapointed and it even prevented me from ever buying these again.

review/summary: Very, very tasty. Wouldn't know they're gluten free.
review/text: These cookies have a very similar taste and texture to Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies, if you remember those from your gluten-eating days. There is a slight caramel-like aftertaste and a bit of a gritty finish from the rice flour, but I doubt that anyone would be able to tell they're not "normal" cookies. If you prefer your cookies crunchy, get these. If you prefer softer cookies, the WOW Baking brand is excellent.

review/text: There are an awful lot of gluten-free products I don't really care for, including Pamela's full-size chocolate chip cookies. They are nasty. I make my own.<br /><br />These Mini cookies taste nothing like the full-size cookies. They are highly addictive. If I eat one, I know I'll eat the entire bag. I just have to stay away from them entirely or my daughter (who has Celiac Disease) will never get any!

review/summary: Gingerly Delicious!!!
review/text: These have been my favorite ginger cookies for about a year now. They're getting harder to find as they gain popularity - my local store is frequently sold out.<br /><br />They're crazy delicious - I need to start buying them by the case. If you haven't tried them, you're in for a treat! Or, I should say "don't try them" - put them back on the shelf in case I'm cruising down the cookie aisle - you're making it too hard for me to find them!!!<br /><br />Seriously, run, don't walk, and try these asap! You won't regret it.<br /><br />FYI: the case price on Amazon is very good and beats the local stores in my area by quite a margin - something to consider.

review/text: I wanted these for a crust for pumpkin cheesecake, but they didn't quite make it in time. No matter, we enjoyed them right out of the box. They are packed full of flavor. The big question, as with all GF baked goods, is texture. These cookies are excellent, very crunchy without being at all crumbly or sandy. If you've ever enjoyed Ppefferneuse, these will take you there. They are exactly like that, right down to the possibility of a cracked tooth. And that's not a negative, it's part of the charm. Really, they're good cookies, with outstanding ginger flavor. Mom says these are every bit as good as the Ppefferneuse she made for Christmas every year, and that's high praise.

review/text: Being a fan of Pamela's products, I had no hesitation in trying the chocolate chip mini cookies. These remind me of any store-bought, traditional gluten-filled chocolate chip cookie in that they taste normal and are not chalky and dry like so many other gluten free cookies out there. I like the size of these cookies because you feel like you are getting more out of your snack than one signle larger cookie. They are the perfect size for my children (who also love them) and the chocolate doesn't melt too fast and make a big mess. Yum!

review/summary: Hard to find a crispy gluten free cookie
review/text: But this one hits the mark. One of the hardest things to replicate in gluten free items is texture. I do not like soft cookies so I am delighted with this product. When non-celiac friends are over, I make sure I have a couple bags because if they get into them, they disappear pronto. Nice ginger "bite" to the flavor profile too. I have yet to not be thrilled by any of the Pamela's products that I have purchased! Buy these cookies by the case from Amazon; this will save you money, insure freshness, and they are delivered right to your door if your total order is over $25.

review/summary: Warning! Watch expiration date.
review/text: Both of my children are on a gluten free diet. We eat a lot of these cookies and highly recommend them. I am not a fan of all gluten free options.<br /><br />The only thing to watch is the expiration date. We bought a clearance listing of the chocolate chip cookies from amazon (from amazon but not the full price item). The cookies were close to the expiration date and tasted old and stale - but we know the cookies taste amazing - so I'm sure it was because they were near the expiration. My kids didn't care so they still ate them.<br /><br />We buy these monthly through amazon and we have only had that happen the one time we bought the discounted cookies. My tip is if you do get a stale pack, contact amazon immediately. Amazon will back their products but get a replacement because these cookies are worth trying!<br /><br />This review is specifically about the chocolate chip cookies but we also love the chocolate cookies <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T348UW">Pamela's Products Simple Bites Wheat-Free Gluten-Free Mini Cookies Extreme Chocolate -- 7 oz</a> and ginger snaps <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILILM0">Pamela's Products Simplebites Ginger Mini Snapz, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>(I HATE ginger snap cookies but love these).

review/text: The first shipment we got was delicious.  The second and third was too.  Then with the fourth shipment I noticed they were crumblier and drier. The next shipment was dull in flavor.  I began realize they were taking out some of the molasses and most of the ginger, which are the main ingredients that make a ginger snap cookie.  Now it's like putting a half cup of  brown sugar in your mouth and good luck trying to swallow it.  Pathetic.  Never  buying again.  I'll find a way to make my own.

review/text: These cookies are amazing! I am on a gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, and soy-free diet, which makes it almost impossible to find desserts, candy, or baked goods I can eat. These cookies are free from all these allergens, but more importantly: they are delicious. The Extreme Chocolate ones are crunchy at first, but then they get chewy and melty in your mouth. They feel rich and even buttery, and have a satisfying chocolate taste. Reminded me of brownies. I was very impressed and I would have enjoyed this product equally even if I weren't on a restricted diet. Superthumbs up and THANK YOU for this product!

review/text: My husband and two boys, 3 and 1, all like these little cookies so much that all of them took more than the serving size. I let them eat them freely because I'm OK with the ingredients. I didn't eat so many of them because they taste too sweet for me. They also have a strong spicy taste probably because of the ginger.
