review/summary: Wonderful Smell, Wonderful Taste!
review/text: I normally don't like any nut flavors in my coffee, but received this as a Christmas present, so I gave it a try.  I have been drinking Folger French Vanilla coffee for several years now because I love the smell of it brewing almost as much as the taste first thing in the morning.  However, the Copper Moon Hawaiin Hazelnut has now replaced the French Vanilla as my favorite coffee for smell and especially taste! This coffee doesn't have any bitter taste and the first cup in the morning is manna.

review/text: Let me start off by, this stuff tastes like DOODOO. YUCK!<br />The taste can easily be covered by some bananas and peanut butter, but those are both things I can't stand.<br /><br />This stuff does not mix very well, either. Not even when I used a blender.<br /><br />I'm sure there are others who can stand the taste, but I personally could not drink it without gagging.

review/text: I am not using the product as intended because I can't seem to get it down in the morning. The flavor is supposed to be chocolate, the color is there but that is just about it. If i put in flavored creamer for 1/4 of the liquid, I can drink it, otherwise it is tough. I feel bad because I know it is good for me. I guess I will just have to persevere and get by the taste.

review/text: My son will NOT eat this stuff. I have tried and tried. It is a great product packed with all these healthy goodies in it, but I can't get my son to injest it! I have tried with chocolate milk, PBJs, and yogurt with no avail. It received great reviews about taste and I have tried it and it isn't horrible. Kids are just pickey sometimes and I gues my son is VERY pickey. It does taste better then the berry flavor thou.

review/text: I have been using this in my morning smoothie every day for a month now. And all I can say is...well, I have more natural, clean energy that lasts all day, and my digestion,hormone balance and sleep is MUCH better! I'm buying the bigger jar when I run out of this. Oh, and I keep my jar in the freezer and believe that makes a difference in freshness and quality!<br /><br />My suggested recipe:<br /><br />1 scoop Chocolate Amazing Grass<br />4-6 oz milk of your choice (I was using Soymilk, but now use Silk's Original Coconut Milk).<br />Ice<br />Splash of Orange Juice<br />Half a banana, and/or a few berries of your choice<br />1 Tbs.

It helps me get thru my busy day and I love knowing I got tons of great greens in.<br />The ONE thing you must know about this drink is you need to mix the powder with ONE oz. of water when you make your cup before you add the milk. If you don't it will be chunky and gross.<br />I also add chocolate whey protein to it and that makes it even yummier!

review/summary: Very Pleasant Taste
review/text: I tried all the green superfoods from no flavor to berry and believe me, the chocolate is the best one.  It almost reminds me of those instant breakfast chocolate drinks I use to drink as a kid.  I am a really picky when it comes to tastes with eating and drinking natural things that are good for you.  What most people think is an acceptable taste from vitamins to energy drinks and bars, I usually never agree.  I have to admit, for a healthy drink the taste pretty darn good and I have to mix mine with rice milk since I am allergic to regular milk.  I am sure if it's mixed with regular milk, it would taste even better.  This is a great way to get those healthy foods we never find time to eat throughout the day.  The instructions say to  have two to three times a day and that is a bit much for me.  One every morning is plenty for me, IMO.

review/summary: tasty greenfood choice!
review/text: Being a health nut, I have put some greenfood powders in my mouth that were less than tasty, let me tell you.  This one suggests being mixed with milk, but I went ahead and tried it just with water out of curiosity BEFORE the indulgence of milk.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the lovely cocoa flavor.  I bought this more for my hubby who cannot stomach green drinks and forgets to take his capsule version...his words "not the best chocolate milk I have ever tasted, but as a green drink not bad at all"...from him, Standard American Diet Man, this is high praise.  i am trying to get thru a less tasty one at home now so I can indulge in HIS.

review/summary: Great with blueberries
review/text: I tried this w/o any fruit or protein powder and the taste was a little too "healthy". However, I add protein powder and berries, usually blueberries, and it's delicious w/just a hint of chocolate flavor. It's a great way to sneak in those servings of veggies that are not so easy to get in when you're in a rush and on the go. My daughter says it smells like chocolate, so even though the flavor is pretty well hidden to me, the natural cocoa comes through in the aroma.

review/summary: not miraculous, but still pretty amazing
review/text: I had never tried other "green drinks," so reading reviews on this product, I was most interested in what results I could expect from drinking it, and internet searches promised me visibly clearer skin, increased and sustained energy, and regular elimination.  I enthusiastically ordered both this flavor and the ORAC one, and began drinking this (mixed with mostly water, a touch of unsweetened almond milk, and some matcha tea powder) with breakfast, and the ORAC (mixed with mostly water and a top off of raspberry crystal light) with lunch.  After a month, I can say that I honestly don't feel any miraculous boost in energy or well-being, and my skin hasn't taken on an angelic glow.  I feel healthy, but then I always did.  And I feel good knowing that I'm getting more antioxidants and vitamins from whole sources, not supplements.<br /><br />As for the taste, I completely disagree with the reviewers who say that this tastes just like chocolate milk.  These people clearly weren't raised on Nesquik and Hershey's!  Mixed with mostly water, it tastes like what it is:  greens and cocoa.  You can definitely taste the greens, which took some getting used to for me.  And you have to keep the spoon in your glass to keep stirring it up before every swallow.  However, now that I am used to it, I really love it, and I look forward to drinking it.  Also, some reviewers have said that they have been able to replace coffee with this, and that hasn't been the case with me.  I tried.  I really did.  I even began mixing in the matcha tea powder after a week of groggy mornings sans coffee.  Finally, I just accepted that I'm an addict, and I finish my Amazing Grass and then make my coffee.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that adding a green drink (or two)to your diet will probably not dramatically change your life, but it certainly can't hurt.  I've come to the conclusion that the real results will likely come in the form of things that I can't see, like disease prevention down the road.  And for that reason, I have this stuff on my subscribe and save list, because an ounce of chocolaty prevention is worth a pound of cure.

review/summary: Tastes fantastic!
review/text: This product IS truly amazing.  It tastes wonderful, has organic ingredients, and helped to increase my energy levels and cut down my cravings for desserts and sweets.  All you need is one scoop a day (although you can have 1-3 servings).  I chose to add mine to soy or almond milk (because there is a lot of sugar in milk) and then I throw it in the blender with what ever fruit I feel like enjoying that day.  It tastes like a chocolate smoothie!  I am not a mother yet, but in the future I would definitely supplement my child's diet with this (they do make it for children as well). It helps the body get the nutrients it requires and tastes fantastic!  By far the best I have ever tried.  I read some reviewers had difficulty mixing it, but if you put it in the blender for 30 seconds you don't have to worry about any sediment on the bottom of your glass.  I just make sure to rinse the blender before it dries on it because then you have to scrub it a little.  If you don't have a blender I am sure you could put it in a cup with a lid and shake it vigorously.  Try this, you won't be disappointed.  It's more like a treat than a supplement.

It satisfies that chocolate craving while providing you with a ton of nutrients.  Not sure why some people said this tasted bad, but trust me this is worth ordering!  I am a personal trainer and would recommend this product to my clients, so do try!!!

review/summary: This stuff really is AMAZING!
review/text: I have been taking this Amazing Grass greens powder for over a month now and I have so much energy! I used to drink coffee but this is WAY better than coffee. It makes you feel so balanced. I add it to some high quality whey chocolate protein powder (organic only) and I have energy all day and can think so clearly! You don't come crashing down afterward the way coffee and/or sugar makes you feel. My digestion has improved dramatically. I had been having digestion issues but they went away almost completely. I also drink aloe vera juice to help with digestion, with meals. It would be better if this had aloe vera powder in it actually but it is great on it's own. Trust me this stuff really is amazing!<br /><br />I first start out my day with a cup of warm water with the juice of half a lemon. Then I take these greens with the protein powder and make a shake. Then I have a little oatmeal separately with lots of cinnamon (either before or after the shake). I am not hungry for hours. I don't crave sugary things like I used to, and I never get too hungry to ever eat more than I should. I told all my family and friends about it. It's that good! And the price can't be beat. One of the cheapest greens products on the market. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great Stuff! Tons of energy!
review/text: I am pretty new to superfoods and raw foods.  I mainly bought this because I just had a baby and was trying get back into shape by doing more for my body such as exercise and eat better.  The baby keeps me so busy throughout the day and I was exhausted all the time, I also knew that not eating as well as I should had a lot to do with it.<br /><br />My first impression upon opening the container is that it smelled a little grassy, but that could be normal for superfoods.  I tried mixing it with some milk the first time and did not like the taste at all. Looking back, it may have been because it didn't dissolve well. Thankfully, I didn't give up and throw it out on the first try. I re-read the instructions to see that they recommended dissolving it first in an ounce of water before adding to to your drink of choice and when I tried it this way---SO MUCH BETTER!  After trying it a couple of different ways, I now replace breakfast or lunch with a scoop of this mixed in a a vanilla protein shake.  Sometimes I add a little peanut butter or peanut butter & banana. The shake optionin my opinion is definitely the most delicious way to drink this.  When I don't have time for that I just mix it with some vanilla almond milk (doesn't taste as good-but still pretty good).<br /><br />The most important discovery about this stuff is that it has given me tons of energy throughout the day.  It is amazing how good I feel. I was a big coffee person but this stuff works better in the morning than coffee in my opinion. With that said, I HIGHLY recommend those with sleep issues NOT to take this at night.  I originally was taking this at night until I figured out this was the reason I couldn't get to sleep. Bottom line...tastes great, gives me great energy throughout the day, and as a result, I am sleeping a lot better at night. I highly recommend this product but do experiment with it a little if you need to find a taste that suits you best.

review/summary: Good Chocolate Raw Food & Probiotic Drink
review/text: About a year ago, the wife brought back a barley/wheat grass drink back from Japan.  We started drinking it on a daily basis to help start a turn around on eating right.  I started looking around for a different drink because our green drink before was about $50 for a month supply shipped to the States.  I started with the Amazing Grass green drink.  It was ok, then I switched to chocolate.  I drink it with about 6oz of unsweetened soy milk.  I have it everyday for breakfast.  Some times I vary and will put it in with some peanut butter into oatmeal.  The wife thinks it is a bit gritty and she like the Amazing Grass Superfood.  It taste like chocolate soy milk to me.

review/summary: Best of Amazing Grass
review/text: I originally decided to try Amazing Grass after some great reviews of the stuff. I ordered both the Normal and Kids Samples of the Green Superfood variety. The chocolate was the first one I tasted, and by far, the best. So, it's the one I bought. I have used this stuff for 2 weeks now.<br /><br />Taste: The taste is pretty fair. Not the best. Not the worst. Compared to the other flavors, this stuff is fantastic. It has a very apparent chocolate flavor with hints of a "green" flavor. It is not very sweet, but not bitter, either. I use plain, unsweetened almond milk to mix mine with, and it tastes decent. However, it tastes best when blended with half a frozen banana, or just half of a banana with some blended crushed ice. When prepared this way, it's really quite good. Drinking it with a milk of some variety is rather important, as when mixed strictly with water (didn't have milk at one point) it tastes absolutely horrific. Taste wise, this stuff is maybe a solid B. I certainly appreciated it most after trying the Berry, Lemon Lime, Original, Kids Chocolate and Kids Berry flavors. They were all absolutely repulsive. I let a couple of people I work with try the Berry with me, one girl ran to the bathroom gagging, one spit it out, and the guy who tried it choked it down unwillingly and stuffed about 3 peppermints into his mouth afterward, cursing me for having him try it. So, compared to those, chocolate is exceptionally good.<br /><br />Texture: The texture depends on how it's blended. If you just use milk, it does get chunky and doesn't blend well. If you blend it with a small amount of water first, then add your choice of milk afterward, it blends much better and you should get a chocolate milk appearance. I have had several occasions where it just didn't blend, even with water, for some reason. When I blend it with a frozen banana, I do not add milk. The blender seems to be the best way to get it all good and mixed up perfectly.<br /><br />Health Effects: This is why I gave this product a full five stars. It's absolutely amazing. I read so many reviews thinking "placebo effect" or "it certainly won't affect ME that much." However, I've noticed very distinct differences in my health. My chronic fatigue has  disappeared. I simply don't get sleepy throughout the day anymore. Also, I have food sensitivities to dairy, grains, and excessive sugars, so I typically eat a paleo-ish diet. Normally, when I eat something even remotely bad, such as a cupcake, I'll become extremely exhausted within an hour and will always break out within a day or two. However, I've eaten very poorly the past week with candies, donuts and even a pizza with cheese. I drink this stuff immediately after and the inevitable crash NEVER comes and my face doesn't break out. I actually left this stuff at home over the weekend when I was out of town, and when I had a donut without drinking this stuff after, I had my usual crash followed by a mild breakout. Had some candy this morning, followed by this stuff, and again, no crash. For the health benefits alone, this stuff lives up to the hype and it's name. It truly is amazing.

review/summary: Much better tasting than the unflavored one.
review/text: I've tried both the original unflavored powder and this chocolate one. And also other products.<br /><br />One other reviewer said that this is just the unflavored powder plus a hint of chocolate and doesn't taste that much better. I disagree. These things are never meant to satisfy tastebuds, but the chocolate one is still much easier to drink down than the original. It has just enough chocolateness to distract you from the otherwise very healthy and grass-y flavor (though freshly juiced wheatgrass is still much stronger).  I can just mix this with water and it goes down easy enough, unlike the original flavor, where I really have to force myself swallow or mix it with juice/protein shake to ease up the taste.<br /><br />As for the effectiveness, I really don't feel any energy-boost from it. However after two month and 3 cans of this stuff (2 chocolate ones and 1 unflavored), I can tell that my skin has a healthier look, and I in general feel cleansed internally and mentally. One of the most noticeable effect is that I poop a lot better with this. I'm not like constipated or anything, but this stuff takes it to another level. When my first can ran out I didn't restock for a month because I was sprouting alfalfas and thought that that plus some occasional wheatgrass shots would be good enough. However, during that month I could tell what my body missed without this stuff, so I immediate subscribed on amazon again.<br /><br />In general if you don't eat a lot of vegetables and fruits, you will find having this powder in your diet does help a lot. Even if you already do, this is still a nice add-on. The hint of chocolate is very helpful in making this healthy drink more drinkable. I recommend this.

review/text: I've tried many nutritional drink powders in an effort to improve my health.  While I'm sure that many have impressive nutritional benefits, the taste has consistently been a problem and until now I have only found products that tasted tolerable at best.  This drink is GOOD.  I mix it with almond milk and personally cannot tell the difference between this drink and regular chocolate almond milk.  My sister tried it and said that it wasn't bad but that she could "taste the green." I've tried adding a small amount of regular chocolate powder in addition to this powder and so far everyone's enjoyed it that way.  It's great to have finally found a product that's delicious as well as nutritious!

review/text: I love both the original and chocolate Amazing Grass Superfood Powder. I prefer this one for the days I want something little heavier, like chocolate "milk", or for when the grassy taste of the original flavour is a little too much. It gives a super shot of sustained energy - I chug a glass of this every day right before work and I'm set to go. The energy doesn't drop me like coffee and I know I'm beefing up on my day's veggie & fruit requirements. I do, if you've never taken it before, recommend drinking one scoop a day until you feel comfortable enough to increase it if you feel you need it. The energy was a little much to handle for my boyfriend and a couple friends all of whom never had it before.

review/summary: Palatable blend of impressive array of nutrients and antioxidants
review/text: I ordered this with trepidation. I've never been able to swallow green food mixes, other than Green Magma (which is not "mixed", but just barley grass). Wheat grass makes me gag. Literally--cannot swallow it. My body rejects it and I gag and spit it out. So, over the years, trying green foods trying to find something I can swallow has been trying.<br /><br />Well, there ya go. This one works.<br /><br />I ordered it on the basis of numerous positive flavor reviews and I liked the list of nutrients/enzymes.<br /><br />30 calories per serving of 8 grams= 1 g fat, 2 g protein, 4 g carbs (2 g fiber), 65% Vit A, 30% of C and K, 15% of B12 and Riboflavin, 6% of iron and manganese; organic grasses (wheat, barley, alfalfa, spirulina, spinach, broccoli, chlorela); with antioxidant from maca, acai, carrot, rose hips, beet, pineapple, green tea, acerola cherry. Fiber from apple pectin, organic oat powder, organic flax seed powder. Also L acidophilus, peppermint, Siberian eleuthero root, and sea salt.<br /><br />The flavor is pleasant. It's like the taste of bitterish dark chocolate bars with a grassy undertone that isn't offputting. It's not like it's a chocolate malted or anything, but it works fine for me. I can drink this. I do not gag. Yay.<br /><br />I will reorder this. I like the healthful profile and the flavor.<br /><br />UPDATE: Okay, I didn't really expect a noticeable effect from this (I mean, I've had superfoods before and didn't suddenly go change the world or anything), but I have actually noticed an uptick in my energy after adding this to my pre-workout smoothie and my pre-chore protein drink. I've been adding it to BSN sytha-6 chocolate protein mix with an extra teaspoon (heaping) of Raw cacao (organic), and it's a nice flavor combo. I think it would be great with a banana, too, for extra potassium (a chocobanana vibe).<br /><br />Maybe it's placebo. Who knows? But as I wasn't thinking I'd notice a change, maybe not. But wow, I do feel an energy surge in the afternoon when I usually have a slump and I get through my 55 minute personal training session with more oomph.

review/summary: AWESOME PRODUCT!
review/text: I am a college student of health sciences and the mother to a 3 yr old toddler. I personally show very little response to "placebo effect" situations and I am a true skeptic at heart. I originally found the "kid" version of this product for my daughter while searching for something to boost her immune system. I spent hours on the computer researching the ingredients of these products. I decided to try the adult version for myself and I can honestly say that the Amazing Grass Superfood Powders have made a huge improvement in both of our lives.<br /><br /> My daughter attends daycare and with that setting comes frequent colds/flus, some serious. She spent the better part of each month with varying degrees of sickness. Since we have using the Superfood Powders (months), neither she nor I have gotten sick. We spent time with my parents who were both very ill while she and I remained in good health.<br /><br /> I have a greater amount of energy since using this product as well. I have chronic fatigue but the effects are greatly reduced since drinking this powder. It is also nice to know that my body is getting the nutrients it needs to perform well. It is difficult to include all the necessary foods in your diet that your body needs to thrive but the Amazing Grass products take care of that.<br /><br />Who cares whether or not it tastes "just like chocolate milk"? It isnt meant to be sold as a dessert drink. It is meant to keep you healthy. I mix one scoop of powder with 8 oz of almond milk and add 1 tsp of Ovaltine. It tastes great. No, it doesnt taste just like chocolate milk but it is definitely palatable and does not need to be consumed "fast". Anyone who has tasted pure Spirulina powder can agree that this is MAJORLY masking the flavor of its healthy ingredients!!<br /><br />Overall, EXCELLENT product! I am getting ready to purchase my 4th jar!

review/summary: YUMMY!!! WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED!!!!!
review/text: This stuff taste great! And that was my biggest concern. I wanted to try to increase my health without having to make myself gag lol. But I drink Muscle Milk and that stuff is really strong until u get used to it...but this product was great first round! I mixed roughly with an ounce of water with a few more ounces of almond milk (I free-hand measured both the milk and water) delicious!!! Honestly I heard it smelled strong and it tasted like "earth" not at all. I used one scoop as directed and I could smell the "green" and taste it but it was so slight I don't even know why someone would mention it. And I am just a 27 year old African American woman who wants to improve her health. I'm like 5 ft 151 lbs and I don't wanna end up sick from being over weight from not getting the proper nutrition. I know that diet and exercise are also important. I feel that if you think you can just drink this but not eat a balanced diet and exercise you are mistaken but I think this is a great add to a healthy lifestyle!

review/summary: GREAT FOR OVERALL HEALTH
review/text: This is great for getting in all your nutrients.  Here is my Chocoberry Smoothie recipe I have created for my morning breakfast routine:  1 scoop <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112EUPM">Amazing Grass Chocolate Drink Powder, Green Superfood, 8.5-Ounce Container</a>, 1 cup Blue Diamond unsweetened Almond Vanilla Milk, 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, 1 tablespoon unsweetened 100% cocoa, 1/2 scoop protein powder (after trying many, I use Whole Nectar Soy Protein Powder @ wholenectar.com or I have found at Costco), 2 tablespoons <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GJ9JWS">PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz</a>.  I add a heaping scoop of ice, mix in my vitamix blender, and it's pretty good.  This comes to 225 Calories, 10 grams fiber and 17 grams protein.  You CAN taste the "greens" a little, but the peanut butter and blueberries definitely help.  The blueberries are great for antioxidants and the cocoa is great for health, too.  I feel full for a good 4 hours.  You can add more protein, if you'd like.  The Amazing Grass needs to be refrigerated after opened...I keep that and the peanut butter in my freezer.

review/summary: Energy booster
review/text: I always buy something here in Amazon. After having a baby a year ago, I feel always tired and cannot focus on what I'm doing. I wanted to take some pills but am afraid of the side effects. I then went browsing for energy drinks and found this one. At first I was skeptical about it so I ordered the small one in case it doesn't work. I ordered it together with the blender bottle with blender ball. I was really impressed how it gave me so much energy after few minutes drinking it. The grass taste is still there even though I order the choco favor but I really don't care 'cause there are no other energy products that can give me this much energy and I feel that everything's so clear. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.

review/text: This just arrived in the mail today and I cracked it open and taste tested it.  The taste is not horrible, in fact it's very drinkable.  That being said, it doesn't taste great either.  I mixed it in a Blender Bottle and it was a pretty good consistency. I used almond milk as well.<br /><br />I later tried mixing it into my protein shake and it worked great!  I can taste the undertones of the chocolate amazing grass but it's about 10 times more palatable.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars because of the nutritional value and I can actually stomach it in my protein shake.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't think I can drink it as a stand alone.

review/summary: Surprisingly good.
review/text: As of this review I'm on day 4 of using this product. Have to admit that I was very surprised by how good this product is. Very good chocolate flavor, no grittiness or "grassy" flavor of the Amazing Grass Green powder, although I love that product as well.<br /><br />One of the things I missed the most in my transition away to a low-refined carbohydrates/sugar diet were chocolate milkshakes, and all the previous substitutes that marketed themselves as that were never satisfying, similar to the feeling of drinking a diet coke instead of a real coke with real sugar. I think I may have found a recipe that is very close alternative that's not only far healthier, but REALLY good as my morning meal replacement when I don't have time to cook breakfast, and it keeps me easily satiated until well after lunchtime. The benefit of that of course, is because I'm not starving for lunch or completely lacking in nutrition, it makes it much easier to make healthy choices during the lunchtime, instead of opting for the junk food my body would normally crave by that point.<br /><br />Here's what I make every morning in my blender if I don't have time for a proper breakfast<br /><br />8 oz Unsweetened Chocolate Almond Milk<br />1 Scoop Amazing Grass Chocolate Drink Powder<br />1 Scoop Nature's Life Low sugar, Green Whey Pro-96 (or your own low sugar whey protein mix, this one tastes great, the packaging is pretty over the top however)<br />1 Scoop Flaxseed powder.<br />1 packet of Stevia powder.<br /><br />Tastes really a lot like a chocolate milkshake, certainly enough to I can't claim that I feel a boost of energy that others are commenting on here, I'd say it's more of an evening out of my energy levels that keeps me going. I definitely don't need several cups of coffee I previously did to get going anymore, which is great. Will update as I finish the jar.

I usually just drink it with water, but if you blend it with milk, peanut butter and some extra cocoa, it's pretty yummy, but with that 'green' aftertaste.  I have only been taking it a few days, so I haven't noticed much difference. I do think it gives me a mild energy boost taking it once a day.

review/summary: A Great Way to Get Extra Nutrition
review/text: I have purchased the Amazing Grass Green Superfoods in both Berry flavor and Chocolate.  I much prefer the chocolate.  I mix it into a smoothie and the subtle chocolate flavor is pretty good.  The chocolate flavor is very mild and subtle, but not grassy tasting at all.  I made a smoothie yesterday with frozen cherries, lite vanilla soymilk, spinach, vanilla protein powder and the chocolate amazing grass.  It was very good and easy to drink.<br /><br />The Berry flavor mixes well in fruity smoothies.  I taste a bit of grassy flavor, but it is still drinkable.  It mixes very smooth.  I am able to get my 16 year old DS to drink it too.<br /><br />Amazon has a great price and I have recommended this product to a few friends as well.

review/summary: Best tasting superfood, but still not great tasting.
review/text: It seems like none of these superfood/supplement powders ever taste GOOD. Some of them have made me downright sick. This one is about the only one I've found that is drinkable by itself. There is an earthy, grassy undertone to it that is a bit rough, but I mix one scoop of this (about a heaping teaspoon's worth) and one tablespoon of Ovaltine to 8 ounces milk (sometimes soy milk) and it's delicious. Sometimes I'll mix it with the Bolthouse Farms Chocolate Soy Protein drink. If I know I'm going to have a busy day I'll mix it with milk and a half-scoop of whey protein powder.<br /><br />No matter what powder drink supplement/meal replacement mix you choose, you'll want to invest in one of these: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036QVWB6">LaCuisineTM 18oz Tornado Portable Mixer</a>. Add a little liquid, start blending, add your mix and then fill with more liquid. Your drink is now smooth and if you're a slow drinking like me you can zap it before a sip to keep your drink smooth all the way.<br /><br />Beyond taste, after a week of using the Amazing Grass Chocolate Superfood and changing nothing else in my diet or activities, I find myself having less trouble falling asleep, and I'm waking up earlier and with more energy.<br /><br />If you're wondering exactly what the difference is between this and the Amazing Grass Meal, the answer is about 100 calories and I'm not sure what else. The scoop in the meal can is about three heaping tablespoons (the superfood scoop is about a heaping teaspoon). The taste is almost identical.

review/text: I have tried other green drinks in the past and they were very hard for me to get down in the mornings no matter what I mixed them with. I have only used this product for the last two days. I made it with unsweetened almond milk and one packet of stevia both yesterday morning and today... I love it! At first I wasn't sure about the slightly unusual taste but I have to admit that I really enjoy it. It worked well in my shaker bottle. I made it up the night before and grabbed it to take to work in the morning. It needed to be re-shaken in the morning but I truly enjoy drinking this product. I actually am a little sad when I finish it. I plan to try to mix it with a scoop of protein powder also just to get more bang out of my breakfast shake. I would suggest this to anyone to try!

review/summary: Less is more......
review/text: This is the first product in the Amazing Grass line that I have tried and it tastes pretty good, I was happy about that... It actually tastes good shaken up in a blender bottle all by itself with a bit of organic almond milk. In the blender it works great with bananas, strawberries, coconut and rice milk. I chose this product because it did not contain soy or soy lecithin. Soy is not recommended because it disrupts estrogens in the body and it also causes havoc with people who have thyroid disorders. I'm real happy about the probiotics included too.<br /><br />I couldn't find the scoop in the tub when I opened it so I called the company to find out how many teaspoons equaled the 8 gm dosage and they had me on hold a long time trying to figure this out. It seems they should know this information by heart, but no such luck. They told me the answer is about 2 teaspoons. If you happen to get a tub without a scoop, I guess that's a good approximate.

BTw, Trader Joe's sells a much less expensive powdered greens that I'll try mixing with cocoa. Don't know if the TJ's version is organic or has the same quality.

Amazing Grass Chocolate drink is gritty (even though I added in a little milk on my second turn) and that's okay, because it's filled with nutrients which would take 100's of food calories to collect -- and for only 30 cals per serving, I can deal with it.<br /><br />I'm just writing this to let others know that unless you hide it in smoothies, it's NOT going to taste like chocolate BUT the taste is bearable (you just have to shake the hell out of it if you only add it with water to save on calories). The serving size is only 8oz, so it's bearable on the taste buds but, yeah, there's no chocolate bar in my mind as it's being drunk.

I have found that it is best to first mix with a little water as it helps the wheatgrass mix better.

review/summary: Finally something that tastes great, mixes easily and is good for you.
review/text: First of all I need to state that I have been drinking all kinds of nasty-tasting green drinks for over 10 years for the health benefits. I don't eat any sugar of any kind, and I focus a lot on how anything I consume is going to make me feel. Having said this, I think this product is the best-tasting supplement I have ever had. It reminds me a little of chocolate milk, but with a lot less sugar and garbage in it.<br /><br />I poured it into my water bottle after working out. I did not even shake it much and it mixed right in without being gritty or lumpy. I drank it about 45 minutes ago, and I feel good. I didn't get a "rush" of energy, but I feel more of a calm energy that comes from feeling healthy and well-nourished. I am looking for a product to replace the caffeine in the organic coffee I drink. I hope this is it. Time will tell. I also chose this product because of the health benefits of maca. Time will tell on that, too.<br /><br />Another thing I like I about this product is it comes in little individual serving packets. This would be great for camping. It seems to be easily digested and absorbed, which is another major advantage.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this product so far. I bought this company's chai vanilla meal replacement, also. It doesn't have any sugar. Unfortunately the chocolate flavor does have sugar, so I didn't buy that one. I will review that one after I try it. I'm just really thankful for products like this.<br /><br />I bought this product at my local health food store. It was on sale for $22.99. Amazon is again, by far the best place to buy things. Subscribe and Save is the way to go.

review/summary: Very good product!
review/text: I have found a job as a computer programmer, and going from my previous job that was fairly physically demanding to sitting down all day, my weight has started to climb, so buying this product is my first attempt at a healthier living style.  At first I was a little concerned because a lot of people are having trouble getting over this product, and usually I am fairly susceptible to the flavor as well.  I was even a little apprehensive, because the smell is not the greatest.  However, the flavor isn't bad!  To me, it tasted like a very week chocolate milk (I mixed it with Skim Milk) with a very small hint of what I can only describe as an earthy flavor.  It wasn't a put off at all.  I was able to down the rest after my initial sip very quickly, use a little more milk to swish around all the left overs on the side and bottom of the glass and finish it off no problem.<br /><br />  As far as performance goes, this may just be the placebo effect, but within the hour, I had none of the usual sluggish feeling, and am generally feeling more alert and energetic.  I will update this review in a few weeks once I have had time to use this product more thoroughly.  But with the way I understand antioxidants to work, they need a while to clear all the toxins so it should only get better.  So far, I highly recommend this product!

review/text: This greenfood powder tastes amazing!  Over the years, I've tried protein powders and energy drinks, but this stuff tastes REALLY really good.  I usually put some in a small jar and mix it with almond or soy milk in the morning.  By the time I get to work, it's shaken up and ready to go!  This tastes even better with chocolate milk!<br /><br />I haven't used it in any other way YET, but I know plenty of people use this in smoothies and juices.  Also, you can use this in baked goods like pancakes and waffles! (For recipe-> (...))<br /><br />Even if you don't usually buy this type of thing, you should give this a try.

review/text: I started looking into "greens" products when we wanted to improve our health. I read all the reviews and finally found Amazing Grass. We tried the berry and didnt like it but the chocolate is good! It took my husband awhile to get used to it but he now puts it in his protein shake every, single day! I like it with almond milk, hemp protein powder and some raw honey. My kids like it too. I add it to smoothies with berries and they eat it up. Love it!

review/text: I bought the chocolate and loved it and it makes me feel like I am doing something healthy for my body. I mix it with plain almond milk, crushed ice and spiruteen protien powder, I also put some organic fruit juice in it. Cherry juice for the chocolate and yum. My husband loves it also. I was so impressed I just received the berry flavor and will try it in the morning. I also bought the peanut butter chocolate protien bars, I just ate one and it was delicious. The only adjustment I had to make was the green grass color in the middle. The taste made it worth it. I can't wait to try more. and am shopping at Amazon for others items, I feel like I can have these things without any guilt of having sweets because to me they are just as good. I will give a review of the berry flavor after I have tried it.

review/summary: Amazing Grass Chocolate is Amazing!!
review/text: I was truly amazed at how good this tastes given that it is healthy for you.  If you mix with milk, it is best if you mix with 1 oz water first to avoid all the lumps and clumps.  It tastes okay with water, but tastes better (to me) if mixed with milk.  I have used skim milk, almond milk, and low fat vanilla milk plus I add a scoop of ground golden flax seed.  This is my morning breakfast drink - it fills me up and gives me energy.  One 8.5 oz container yields 30 servings.

review/summary: Great Green drink
review/text: I think this green drink is chocolatey and delicous.  I don't have a problem w/taste and texture as alot of people do, however, the taste of this is really quite good compared to other green drinks.  In fact, it tastes so good I hope I am really getting the green benefit that it promises.  Amazing Grass promises to be one of the best if not THE best green drink on the market.  The chocolate does cover up the green taste, but if you like chocolate that can be a good thing!! The texture however is a little gritty, but as the canister states is does dissolve better in a little water first then add your other liquid.  I will continue drinking this to get my greens and because it tastes good.  Amazon has a great price!!

review/summary: so yummy i wanted seconds
review/text: I've been a vegetarian for about six years and sometimes vegan. However after starting work at a high pressure job out of college, I fell into the pizza, quick convenience food trap and have gained thirty pounds. I am trying to get back into the healthy lifestyle I had during my first few years as a veggie but I got tired of my morning green smoothies and felt I needed a bigger kick. I got this product in the mail about 4 days after I ordered it and could not wait to try it.<br />I mixed it in about 1/2 a cup of bottled water first. Then I blended it with about  1 cup and a half of coconut milk and a few frozen peach slices.<br />I didn't like it at first so then I added three teaspoons of organic cane sugar.<br />It was delicious, a little chalky because I don't think I mixed it thoroughly with the water, but tasted something like Quick or those Slimfast powdered drinks.<br />Tomorrow I will add half a frozen banana and more peaches and will cut out the sugar.<br />I didn't have any coffee this morning either and didn't feel groggy at all. Will keep drinking and buy it again in the larger size.

Sometimes I'll add a scoop of chocolate protein powder.  I'm not sure about the energy because I drink coffee in the a.m. too, but what I've noticed is I haven't been sick this winter at all.  Every year I get sick a couple of times, so I attribute it to the Amazing Grass.  My kids won't drink green drinks but they do like this (minus the additional wheatgrass).

review/text: Most green powders are "tolerated" for their health benefits and I have found a couple that are "least likely to make me gag" LOL. However, once I heard how good this was from other Amazon reviewers I had to give it a go. I do like it in 8oz of water, but even better...I put a heaping scoop in my protein smoothie with half a banana, some unsweet almond milk and couple tbs of coconut milk. There is the typical texture of green powder if you have it in h2o, but those who are accustomed to green powders won't be phased by it.

review/summary: Was a miss for us
review/text: I had high hopes for this product after reading so many great reviews.  I purchased this for my 9yr who really needed the extra fiber.  Who doesn't like chocolate, right?  I knew as soon as I opened it I would probably have a challenge on my hands.  Although it did smell of chocolate, it was rather overwhelmed by a 'vitamin-supplement' kind of smell.  Made a smoothie with one of the recommended recipes and after one sip, she refused to drink it.  (she's not even a picky eater)<br />I thought it was only ok, but one of those kind of things you might shiver down when you are on a diet.  In desperation, I tried 'doctoring' it with Hershey's syrup - no dice.  Then I even dumped in chocolate icecream - now, no nutritional value and no amount of cajoling or threats could make her drink it.  Like I said, I had high hopes... but this just did not work for us.

review/summary: No inclusions of sand or shell fragments
review/text: Nothing is seriously wrong with these farmed oysters from the People's Republic of China.  There are no inclusions of sand or shell fragments.  Just as clams are an extremely, extremely rich source of iron, oysters are an extremely, extremely rich source of zinc.  The only problem might be that these oysters don't taste quite as good as the best-tasting brands of canned whole oysters.  Like most farmed oysters from China, these oysters are dark gray in color, which might be considered a disadvantage by someone who has become comfortable eating light-colored, good-tasting, canned farmed oysters from South Korea.  Unlike smoked oysters, which are high in cancer-causing nitrosamines and cancer-causing heterocyclic amines, these oysters are quite good for your health.  Oysters are extremely low in mercury and other marine pollutants and moderately high in the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA.

For people who only drink mainstream black teas, it takes a little getting used to different types of teas with their subtle smells and tastes.  I love this tea, as well as the honeybush tea.  They have great health benefits and a very subtle taste and smell that is not overpowering.  I will definitely buy again!

review/text: I wasn't familiar with this coffee company, but was surprised to find that it makes an excellent product. The Creme Brulee flavor was just the taste I was hoping for, and it made many great pots of coffee. I will definitely be buying this again!

review/summary: perfect
review/text: This salt is perfect for finishing a dish, you want to use it on your food just before you eat it. The salt crystals are all different sizes, some big chunks and some small so when you put a little sprinkle on your salads, fish, meats, capriccios , anything, it gives your food a nice crunch that makes the taste difference from homemade food to a fancy gourmet meal. I like to always have it in my kitchen. This is not a salt you would add to something while it is cooking because the salt will disintegrate  and that is not the point of using this salt. You want to bite down on the different sized grains as you are eating.

review/summary: Couldn't be more pleased!
review/text: Purchased two 7' topiaries to place on pillars and flank the interior of my front door. Got the idea from a well known high-end retail store but didn't want the hassle of keeping their "live" product surviving in my home. Found this product online and am extremely satisfied. Product looks natural but still uniform in shape and designed with an adequate amount of greenery, and the price was fantastic.  Very happy I took a chance and ordered this product....love the result!

review/summary: Great coffee, but Pricy!
review/text: I was looking for a replacement for the Millstone subscripiton I had since Amazon canceled it.<br />This is a very good tasting coffee for a pod machine, however; I bought my first boxes from the warehouse to see if I even liked it before purchasing full time. Then I went into the regular menu and saw the regular price, oh boy, can't afford that! I drink alot of coffee:)

review/text: Not the spiciest sauce from louisiana but the flavor and hotness level to me is perfect. Similar to tabasco but more mild and more vinegar.It comes in a much larger bottle because you will use a lot of it. To me goes great with anything.

review/summary: Hard as rocks
review/text: I just ordered a 3-pack of these maple sugar candies, and I am sorry to say, I am extremely disappointed.  They are as hard as rocks, nearly impossible to chew, and have strange coloring all over them.  Areas of pale white, dark, and light.  I would guess these are leftover from Chrismas '09, and have been sitting in a warehouse untli now.  While the taste is okay, I would not recommend a buy at all.  Steer clear of these.

review/text: If you are a maple sugar candy lover, the question is frshness. Old, these can be like rocks. Fresh, they are an unbelievable treat with elegant mouth feel unlike any other candy.<br /><br />These arrived very fresh and were delicious. It was a good quantity for the price. I live in a part of the country where it is hard to find this product so I am delighted to get it through Amazon.

review/summary: Finally.....REAL maple candy!!
review/text: This product is not old or stale.  It is not "creamy" like some maple candies because it has been cooked to perfection.  The longer the candy cooks, the more condensed it becomes....hence, the hardened sugar crystals.  This is the best maple candy I've had in the last 30 years.  Makes me feel like a kid growing up on the East Coast again.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029SU2MM">Butternut Mountain Farm Pure Maple Sugar Candy, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248EA8Y">Butternut Mountain Farm Pure Maple Sugar Candy, 9-Ounce Box</a>

review/summary: The dogs love them.
review/text: I've been using these for years and my dogs love them.<br /><br />One of my dogs requires daily medication.  For a couple of months I would just toss the pill into her bowl with her food and she would gobble it up with everything else.  However, she eventually learned how to eat all the food and leave the pill.  At the recommendation of my vet I tried these and they work great.<br /><br />To mitigate the cost I don't use a whole pocket at a time.  Instead, as these are very soft, I'll rip off a very small chuck of a pocket and use that - all my dog needs is enough to cover the little pill.  This will extend the bag's use exponentially but wouldn't work with larger pills.<br /><br />My only complaint is that these smell rather strong.  The smell isn't bad, in fact it smells almost delicious.  The problem is that my fingers smell very strongly after I use them, hence I have to wash them immediately - not a big deal but I dropped the review by a star for it as it's annoying.

review/summary: Greenies Pill Pockets
review/text: These Pill Pockets are a must for anyone who has a dog that resists pill administration. I have a 16-yr-old miniature Poodle w/heart & joint issues. He fights taking pills, which isn't good for his bad heart. I put 1/2 Rimadyl tab, 1/2 enalapril tab, & 1/4 tramadol tab in one (1) Pill Pocket! Yes, all of those in 1 pocket. I pinch the pocket around the meds, then roll the pocket in my palms to seal it, & he takes it w/o any resistance! These are absolutely wonderful! I use the chicken flavored, & have tried the duck (when the chicken was out). The duck smelled really bad to me, but the dog didn't seem to mind at all. I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Great coloring, but WATCH YOUR SETS!
review/text: I only learned about gel food coloring this summer.<br />I have to say that I am COMPLETELY sold on it! We did a project that needed black frosting,<br />and I didn't want to buy multiple tubes of decorating black... so I ordered the black gel to try it.<br />I was very, very happy with the results and wanted to expand my collection of colors.<br /><br />I THOUGHT that I was getting a really basic set. I did not even think about there being different<br />COLOR sets - I thought it was only different quantities of bottles in the sets!<br /><br />So, I highly recommend the AmeriColor gel food coloring. They do fabulous color without needing a whole<br />lot of product. The colors are very true. My first try was black, and it was a true black - no purple<br />or blue "shades" in the frosting.<br /><br />Just be aware of what you are getting in the color sets, and check to see if they are colors you want<br />and/or need. While I would love to have every color they make, I can't afford it, so was a little disappointed<br />when I opened the set, only to find some of the more unusual colors. Oh well - my fault for not reading<br />it closer!  That's why I am leaving this review - so you can make sure you read the COLORS that are included<br />in the set you are buying. I noticed not every listing has "set #1 or set #2, etc" in them, so as the buyer,<br />you need to be the one to read the color listing.
